CNN,tech, CNN  The technology sounds simultaneously fake and dangerous Strap on a headset and send targeted electrical currents into your brain for about 15 minutes to get more energy improve your focus or calm down Brain stimulation is a very real but still unproven area of technology for tinkering with the human brain For decades scientists have experimented with sending electrical currents through subjects skulls to their brains to do everything from treating serious mental disorders like depression to improving memory and learning Now Silicon Valley is hoping it can turn brain stimulation tech into sleek wearable devices for consumers Is it really possible to make the jump from the lab to Best Buy shelves The latest company to attempt to create a consumer brain stimulation product is Thync a startup with a serious pedigree Founded by entrepreneur Isy Goldwasser and neuroscientist Jamie Tyler who has a PhD in psychology and behavioral neuroscience Thync has been working on its device secretly for the past three years Its a portable headset that will offer three settings to start energy relaxation and focus For some people it would be their third cup of coffee for some people it would be their afternoon nap said Goldwasser One of the primary technologies Thync is based on is transcranial direct current stimulation or tDCS which uses a weak electrical current to change the sensitivity of neurons in the brain Neurons are cells in the brain that send electrical signals to each other resulting in the release of chemicals that impact what a person is thinking or feeling When targeted to the right area the tDCS currents can create changes in how a persons brain is functioning With the potential to replace everything including a soda habit yoga class or pharmaceuticals for mental disorders the market for brain stimulation devices that are proven to work is potentially huge The US military has even experimented with it as a way to improve pilot training Thync is focusing on small improvements for already healthy minds The users are going to be people who really have busy lives and really need tools besides chemicals drugs or alcohol said Goldwasser Theyd like another approach to change their mental state Its not the first commercial product to use tDCS Focus is a 250 headset that uses tDCS to help gamers increase focus and performance while playing video games There is an expansive community of people who experiment with doityourself tDCS headsets they make using tutorials found online and equipment found at a local Radio Shack Even with a number of respected studies on brain stimulation its still not clear if these techniques have an impact I think most people would agree that the jury is still out about whether tDCS  has any proven therapeutic or cognitive enhancement effects said Charan Ranganath a professor at the Center for Neuroscience at the University of California Davis Research into the effectiveness of tDCS and other brain stimulation methods is still considered to be in the early stages and there are doubts in the neuroscience community about early results Some of the published studies have small sample sizes dont adequately address placebo effects and they often use weird measures of memory or cognition that can be hard to interpret said Ranganath There is also a tendency to only publish studies that have positive results while ignoring the ones with negative results If tDSC does work creating the same desired effect in different people is difficult even in tightly controlled laboratory studies where the equipment is set up and handled by experts To make tDCS work the currents must hit specific target areas in the brain which vary greatly for each person Everyones head is shaped differently and if its off by a small amount a tDCS device could have a drastically different impact Even if it does hit the right spot theres no guarantee a signal will impact people the same way For example some people function really well after a morning cup of coffee while others have the opposite reaction to caffeine The idea that the same method will achieve enhancing effects on everyone is probably over simplistic said Ranganath To counter those concerns Thync is taking its science safety and testing seriously In addition to tDCS it is using an emerging new technique called transcranial pulsed ultrasound along with custom algorithms and proprietary neurosignaling waveforms It took us years to find these effects said Thyncs Tyler You cant just slap it on your head and jolt your brain  there is real science Thync has already tested its product on more than 2000 people in as many trials After using Thync the subjects answer questions about how they feel and the researchers measure their vitals If it wants FDA approval down the line Thync will need to go through extensive clinical trials Thync plans on having its first product ready by 2015 The Californiabased company recently secured 13 million in venture capital funding Its still too early to know how effective Thync or other future brain stimulation devices will be when they are released But supporters of the technology think were just at the beginning of a consumer neurotechnology revolution Tyler thinks soon these products will be commonplace It is inevitable ,0.4
CNN,tech, CNN  For the past 25 years the Web has opened up unprecedented possibilities for human communication But it has a dark side too  sometimes a very dark one Four out of 10 of Web users have been harassed online according to a survey released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center And about 73 of the Web users surveyed said theyve witnessed someone being harassed online The harshest forms of abuse  physical threats stalking and sexual harassment  are often reserved for women With responses from 2849 Web users the Pew study appears to be the most detailed of its kind looking at abusive behavior on the Web And it comes at a time when high profile cases of online abuse many of them targeting women have bubbled up from the Webs darker corners into the full light of public scrutiny Theres a pretty broad spectrum of these actions said Lee Rainie director of Internet Science and Technology research at the center And some of it is quite severe Online harassment breaks down into two categories according to Pew One is minor and one more severe The first includes things like namecalling and humiliation The second category targets a smaller segment of Web users and includes actions like stalking harassment over a long period of time and violent threats Its that sort of abuse that has made headlines in recent months Most prevalent has been GamerGate a movement that purports to be about defending videogaming culture and demanding responsible journalism from gaming websites But it quickly turned into a wave of vicious online attacks on journalists game developers and others  almost all of them women Several women have been subjected to violent rape threats detailed death threats hacking and doxxing in which documents with personal information are stolen and posted online At least two women have been forced to leave their homes after receiving specific threats of violence as a result of GamerGate In other highprofile incidents actor Zelda Williams left social media for several weeks in August after she received graphic abusive messages on Instagram and Twitter about the death of her father comedy legend Robin Williams And earlier this month actor Milla Jovovich announced on Twitter that shed stopped interacting with fans because she and her family had been threatened by a stalker from the site After contacting authorities I was told to absolutely stop talking to people I dont know on social forums she wrote Now that sucks for all the cool people I got to know on here but my family comes first and I cannot take any chances when it comes to them Its that sort of intense abuse that concerns Sara Baker coordinator of Take Back the Tech a campaign aimed at ending online violence against women In our work we see how the effects of online violence play out in the physical world all the time she said Whether or not such abuse results in physical violence  and it sometimes does  it always results in real harm According to the Pew study women experience the more severe types of abuse at disproportionately high levels when compared to men Among women age 1824 26 said theyd been stalked online and 25 said theyd been sexually harassed online Sponsored by members of womens groups from around the world Bakers organization recently gave a failing grade to Facebook Twitter and YouTube in a report saying the Webs largest socialmedia sites dont do enough to prevent abuse of women on their networks The Pew report suggests that social media is in fact where a lot of online harassment takes place Two out of three respondents who said theyd been harassed online said the most recent incident happened on a socialmedia website or app Other sites where people said they encountered harassment included the comments section of websites 22 online gaming 16 in email 16 on a discussion site such as Reddit 10 and on online dating sites or apps 6 Part of what makes online abuse so rampant is the anonymous nature of some Web forums Half the people who said theyve been harassed online said they didnt know their attacker But theres good news Just as the Web can be used to harass people it can be used to rally people against hurtful speech as well The Internet has expanded our ability to respond to such violence by finding community exchanging knowledge and building solidarity Baker said ,0.4
CNN,tech, CNNs coverage of Web Summit in Dublin looks at how technology is changing the world CNN  Remember in the late 90s when you would kill time in AOL and IRC chatrooms or post on Usenet Youd strike up conversations with strangers about subjects you were all interested in say The XFiles container gardening or The Fugees Facebook wants to bring some of that community back with a fun new iOS app called Rooms The free app released on Thursday lets you create or join chatrooms based on shared interests Start a room for Law  Order fan fiction writers toss up a background photo of Olivia Benson and customize your name or like button with gun or knife emojis People who join the room can post photos text and videos You can share the invite widely or keep the guest list short though the posts are public The social media giant is 10 years old Thats solidly middleage in Internet years as evidenced by the number of parents and grandparents who have successfully colonized Facebook To avoid obsolescence the company has been quick to jump on any new messaging trends that are hip with the kids It bought Instagram and WhatsApp It made a Snapchat clone called Poke in 2012 and another called Slingshot earlier this year Recently anonymity has been a hot topic embraced by standalone apps such as Whisper and Secret and cherished by people whose online personas are entirely pseudonymous Facebook saw firsthand how much people value being able to communicate under their chosen identities The company started cracking down on members who werent adhering to its realname policy and incurred the wrath of activists and drag queens Rooms takes the opposite stance It doesnt require people to use their real names and encourages chatters to use as many nicknames as they like for different rooms In the blog post announcing the app Facebooks Josh Miller trumpets the key feature In Rooms you can be Wonder Woman  or whatever name makes you feel most comfortable and proud You can even create different identities for different contexts ,0.4
CNN,tech, Editors note Tomorrow Transformed explores innovative approaches and opportunities available in business and society through technology CNN  Ever since two men first laid a bet on two flies climbing up a cave wall gambling has struck at the core of the human condition the future is uncertain And while games of chance like dice and cards have been with us for centuries bar room wagers on matters of abstract speculation have often been lost to history disappearing as fast as the hot air that produced them Until now that is Novelty bets Thanks to websites like Longbetsorg and professional gaming sites like Paddy Power oddball bets on everything from the next pope to the life expectancy of the universe have a running book In the case of Longbetsorg they are the source of heated debate about the shape of the future These bets become an interesting tool to understand how we think about the future and even if we are really arguing about the right things said Alexander Rose director of the Long Now Foundation which backs the Long Bets project Betting exchanges that take novelty bets are nothing new  Paddy Power has a longrunning book on whether it will snow on Christmas Day and the next pope  but what makes Long Bets different is that it will only accept bets that advance our understanding of science and the future The winner also must donate their winnings to a charity of his choice Predicting the future So far Long Bets has taken longterm bets on whether drones will do battle as part of protests whether commercial flights will become pilotless and on the future of level of the worlds population People need to have an opposing argument and come to an agreement about the terms which actually turns out to be quite tricky Rose told CNN Someone will make a bet for instance that we will find extraterrestrial intelligence in the next 50 years then theres often a long philosophical discussion about what constitutes extraterrestrial intelligence or even life If we are talking about something as strange as that we dont know even if wed recognize it Often he said the parties have already bashed out the terms before they come to Long Bets Buffetts million dollar gamble In the case of its current highest profile bet  a million dollar bet between billionaire investor Warren Buffett and alternative investment group Protg Partners LLC  the two parties had already agreed the terms and had come to Long Bets to find a platform for the wager For a simple 50 fee anyone can make a prediction which then becomes a bet when someone takes up the challenge Nothing is too outlandish said Rose as long as it is well argued Often the results can be surprising We had one bet on the cost of energy five years into the future and the parties had used a very good source which was the report of the US Department of Energy he said However when it came time to adjudicate that bet it was found the government had pulled its report in the wake of the 74 billion Enron scandal in 2001 Enron had sufficiently skewed the energy market that the government had to unwind all the Enron trades out of its report to know the true cost of energy Rose said It was enough to flip the results of the bet Changing parameters Often the future is so unpredictable that the parameters of the debate change entirely Once such argument over whether the top 10 news stories would come from a blog or the Wall Street Journal was at the time surprisingly eclipsed by Wikipedia which was little known in 2002 We often find that its not so much whether someone was right or wrong but that what was being argued about was not even relevant Rose said Our main goal is that they create an interesting discussion about the future And we try to keep them away from celebrities and sports and more on arguments about the world Weve taken a few bets on sports but only when theyve been arguments about globalization Some have time scales so long that no one will ever collect on them Turing test A bet on whether the universe will keep expanding is unlikely ever to see a winner but a 20000 bet between Googles director of engineering Ray Kurzweil and Lotus Development founder Mitchell Kapor on artificial intelligence passing the Turing test comes up in 2029 To pass the test a machine or computer program must convince a human judge that it has a level of intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human being For mainstream punters meanwhile betting exchanges like Paddy Power have been taking novelty bets on everything from the next pope  more than 300000 450000 was placed after Pope Benedicts resignation  to parents betting on their sons becoming soccer World Cup football captains For us its really a fraction of our business less than 1 but its very good for our profile and we like doing it Paddy Power told CNN And anyway who knows One day well all be caught with our pants down when Elvis comes back into town Read more from Tomorrow

CNN,tech, Editors note Smart Business explores the ways companies are thinking smart to thrive in our digitized world  CNN  In the narrow winding lanes of Old Delhi the knotted masses of electrical wiring hanging across the streets are sometimes so thickly entwined they blot out the sun In the streets of Bangkok electricity wires loop and run in chaotic bundles from concrete power poles In the slums of Mumbai to the townships of South Africa electricity infrastructure is a triumph of make and mend For power utilities in emerging markets collecting the bills from this tangled skein of wiring is a nightmare and slow payment  even outright energy theft  remains a powerful disincentive for new investment in the sector Smart solutions One company however says smart meters may hold the answers to the power problems of the worlds emerging markets While smart meters have been in use in the United States and Europe for more than a decade in markets such as Africa they are set to encourage muchneeded investment in the sector The devices not only record electricity consumption but relay information back to the utility for monitoring and billing purposes Critically they also require prepayment which means that utilities that produce the power can be sure they will be paid for it Alain Bollack director at the Global Power  Utilities Centre of Ernst and Young said the company worked with the city of Tshwane outside Johannesburg in South Africa to install prepaid smart meters to solve endemic problems of late payment longterm debtors and electricity theft The city had two major problems Bollack told CNN The first was they couldnt collect the cash from customers  either businesses or individuals They had 800000 customers that were an average 500 days in arrears The second was that a lot of clients were stealing electricity and thats very common in emerging markets Chaotic infrastructure He said the chaotic nature of the electricity infrastructure in places like Africa or India means that stealing energy is easy Often its as easy as hooking onto a line bypassing the meter and getting free energy The first major problem of energy in emerging markets is getting access to it i the first place the second problem is that when there is access it gets stolen He said cities such as Mumbai had worked hard over the past 10 years to reduce the opportunity for consumers to steal electricity Over ten years ago some 65 of the energy produced in Mumbai was not paid for Bollack said Smart meters he said require customers to pay before they consume and also relay information back to the utilities if the meters are tampered with in any way Legislation is key So far some 3000 smart meters have been rolled out in Tshwane particularly among high consumers of energy At the core of the solution however is legislation and Bollack said that the city government passed laws to enforce the new rule That might not be very pleasant for many consumers but at the end of the day if you provide a service its quite normal to pay for it Bollack said If you have asked nicely for many many years and people still wont pay then you have a right to enforce that by law He said the value proposition extended to consumers in that they also gained a better picture through smart metering of what and how they consumed electricity Ultimately however energy theft is not a sustainable business model leading to underinvestment more costly production and higher prices Bollack said that Tshwanes foray into smart meters was now being viewed with interest from countries throughout the region including Ghana Zimbabwe Mozambique and parts of Nigeria They are looking at it as a possible way of resolving the financing problem of energy infrastructure in Africa Bollack said If you are lucky if youve got investors from China or the US or Europe who are happy to put billions on the table but dont have any guarantee of return on investment Holy grail He said that smart meters in Africa are fast becoming the holy grail for energy sector investors and ultimately could accelerate investment that would provide power for millions more people in the region While critics might argue that consumers have gone from free albeit stolen electricity to electricity they now cant afford Bollack said smart meters for the first time could reverse the vicious circle created by energy theft The business case for the city of Tshwane is interesting he said Energy is one of the citys main sources of revenue and what they are saying is that smart meters are not being introduced to balance the books but to collect the cash to reinvest it into the community Even though theres a lag between when you collect the cash and reinvest what you ultimately create is a virtuous circle Read this Is this the end of the 95 working day Read this Driverless vehicles The end of the road for the trucker ,0.4

CNN,tech, Editors note In celebration of International Day of the Girl October 11 and Ada Lovelace Day October 14 Leading Women is devoting the month of October to women and girls in STEM science technology engineering and math CNN  Robots can be many things  knowledgeable dexterous strong But can they ever be genuinely laughoutloud hilarious If you prick us in our battery pack do we not bleed alkaline fluid asks Ginger the Robot haltingly throwing up its arms in its best impression of a reallife comedian Truth be told if Ginger were a human itd be dying on stage The cute little machines monotone voice has all the drama of a conveyer belt while its expression is as vacant as a doll Comedic timing is hard to master  particularly when you have no emotions Luckily for Ginger sitting beside it is comedy sidekick  and programmer  Heather Knight  The living breathing 31yearold engineer heads a theater and robotics collective called Marilyn Monrobot The group runs everything from a Robot Film Festival to Cyborg Cabaret and standup alongside poor old Ginger I fell in love with the idea that we could collaborate between the arts and robotics explains Knight originally from Boston and now a doctorate student at Carnegie Mellons Robotics Institute in Pittsburgh I was looking for a way to do a performance with a robot and I was like hey what about a comedy routine on stage That way you could make jokes and get realtime feedback along the way she says with infectious fasttalking enthusiasm Funny business The unlikely partnership between researcher and robot is not without friction  at one stage Ginger informs us Knight has been cheating on it I caught her collecting videos of other robots says the kneehigh Nao robot created by French robotics company Aldebaran and popularly used as a learning aid in universities I dont feel pain says blankfaced Ginger But still that does not compute I confronted her and she claims she needs to do research with other machines to improve my response capabilities Theres only one way to win Knight back it seems And thats through some aptly robotic dance moves Indeed Gingers charm lies in its very robotness  which has more in common with human comedy than you might think When it talks about its perception capabilities still being in development  that gets a laugh almost every single time explained Knight who programs all of Gingers dialogue and movements herself People love when it goes all supertechy and acts like a real robot One of the things Ive learned from interviewing comedians over the years is that part of what makes a performance compelling is authenticity If youre going to be a comedian you need to bring material from yourself Intelligent interaction  And like all good comedians Ginger must read the crowd In this case that involves programming the machine to pick up on social cues like clapping and even smiling Things like laughter applause these are symbolic things that we all do says Knight So when youre in a theater you can have hundreds of people that are also data points In the past Ive given the audience feedback cards that were red on one side and green on the other so they could explicitly tell the robot through its vision whether something was working or not Regardless of Gingers comedic powers the adorable bot could one day influence the personalities of other machines For example if you had a robot thats delivering juice boxes in a preschool then youd want it to be pretty warm explained Knight But if you have a robot thats a security guard in a garage at night with some suspicious people hanging around then being a little intimidating can totally be appropriate Sweet science While other engineers compete to create the most humanlike robot ever Knight says they might be better off making machines that we just really like having around Theres all these different relationships we have with technology now  frustration with our software updates or bonding with our cars to the point of naming them she said So it can be refreshing to have a piece of technology actually making fun of its self rather than just inconveniencing us when its supposed to be improving our lives Gingers unique comedy act isnt just a research project  its an important teaching tool with Knights Ted talk attracting over 600000 views online When the robot makes fun of me it means I can tell you about my research and its like my own selfdeprecation explained the bubbly engineer and you get the feeling her popularity is not just down to Ginger but her own charismatic stage presence Its the spoonful of sugar that makes the education go down One things for sure science class would have been a whole lot more interesting with these two at the front They call me Ginger the Robot gosh I love saying that It makes me feel like some sort of super hero says the miniature machine with a jerky swivel of the head But actually I am just a mediocre robotic comedian Boom Boom Quiz

CNN,tech, CNN  Its the most controversial issue since people started filming videos in portrait mode Should tablets be used as cameras Whipping out a tablet to take a photo is a practice that like it or not is going mainstream Once primarily the domain of dads who dont mind embarrassing their children tablet photography has become so common that Apple added serious camera features to its new fullsized iPad Why when its very likely they have a smartphone with a better camera do people use tablets to take photos and videos I think people look a little silly doing it but I can understand why said Amit Gupta founder of Photojojocom Its like the worlds biggest viewfinder Traditional cameras have small viewfinders that when you put your eye to them fill your entire view with a scene Smartphone screens are dinky in comparison Someone who struggles to see a phone screen especially when holding the device in outstretched arms may enjoy the extra real estate of a tablet Editing is also much easier on a tablet On a smartphone postproduction is usually limited to a few tweaks and an Instagram filter but a tablet is large enough to be a decent canvas for editing Guptas site is a popular shop for mobile photography accessories Since the iPad debuted he has seen a jump in the number of people buying tabletspecific photography tools like the iOgrapher iPad Video Rig For critics a better view isnt enough to justify pulling out a tablet instead of a phone or real camera Aside from the camera quality there are a number of reasons for the stigma against tablet photography  including what professional photographer and instructor Steve Simon calls the dorky factor  Wielding a large flat rectangle to take a photo is awkward The thin smooth frame is made for gripping with two hands or resting on a surface not holding it above your head while you tap to focus a shot Light bouncing off the large glossy screen can create unfortunate glare especially outdoors The shape and size can also have an impact on a final photo Cameras have an effect on their subjects A person will act differently in front of a large professional DLSR setup versus a smartphone or tablet As a street photographer where keeping a low profile is hugely helpful to capture real moments using a large tablet is the opposite of stealthy said Simon who teaches a course on street photography I find the tablet photographer looks a bit invasive and aggressive holding that big device in front of whatever or whoever they aim it at Its not just the person theyre photographing that might be put off Events like concerts are already turning into obnoxious seas of smartphones being held in the air The only thing worse is the person who holds up a tablet blocking other peoples views Early tablet photographers clearly arent too concerned about what other people think or the hardwares limitations Apples upgrades mean the practice could catch on with more people and shed some negative associations Remember there was resistance to smartphone photography at first too but it took off because people always had the devices in their pockets and sharing was instant The photos werent great quality but using a phone was convenient and the best camera is the one thats with you became a rallying cry The iPad Air 2s main camera is now competitive with the iPhone 6 It has an eight megapixel sensor and a number of camera features previously only found on iPhones including timelapse video slowmotion and burst mode Apple says its new iPad Air screen has been redesigned and given an antireflective coating to reduce glare by more than half Inside theres a more powerful graphics processor which makes the tablet a great tool for editing The number of fullfeatured photo and video editing apps for the iPad is growing Apple demonstrated the new Pixelmator iPad app at its press event using it to remove an unwanted oryx from a desert scene There are still many valid reasons for not using a tablet as a camera but the upgraded iPad camera chips away at some of them The increased range in sizes for mobile devices is also helping blur the lines between phones and tablets Theres going to be less stigma because everyones toting around these bigger phones said Gupta Its going to become a little easier to justify pulling out the iPad ,0.4

CNN,tech, CNN  The technology sounds simultaneously fake and dangerous Strap on a headset and send targeted electrical currents into your brain for about 15 minutes to get more energy improve your focus or calm down Brain stimulation is a very real but still unproven area of technology for tinkering with the human brain For decades scientists have experimented with sending electrical currents through subjects skulls to their brains to do everything from treating serious mental disorders like depression to improving memory and learning Now Silicon Valley is hoping it can turn brain stimulation tech into sleek wearable devices for consumers Is it really possible to make the jump from the lab to Best Buy shelves The latest company to attempt to create a consumer brain stimulation product is Thync a startup with a serious pedigree Founded by entrepreneur Isy Goldwasser and neuroscientist Jamie Tyler who has a PhD in psychology and behavioral neuroscience Thync has been working on its device secretly for the past three years Its a portable headset that will offer three settings to start energy relaxation and focus For some people it would be their third cup of coffee for some people it would be their afternoon nap said Goldwasser One of the primary technologies Thync is based on is transcranial direct current stimulation or tDCS which uses a weak electrical current to change the sensitivity of neurons in the brain Neurons are cells in the brain that send electrical signals to each other resulting in the release of chemicals that impact what a person is thinking or feeling When targeted to the right area the tDCS currents can create changes in how a persons brain is functioning With the potential to replace everything including a soda habit yoga class or pharmaceuticals for mental disorders the market for brain stimulation devices that are proven to work is potentially huge The US military has even experimented with it as a way to improve pilot training Thync is focusing on small improvements for already healthy minds The users are going to be people who really have busy lives and really need tools besides chemicals drugs or alcohol said Goldwasser Theyd like another approach to change their mental state Its not the first commercial product to use tDCS Focus is a 250 headset that uses tDCS to help gamers increase focus and performance while playing video games There is an expansive community of people who experiment with doityourself tDCS headsets they make using tutorials found online and equipment found at a local Radio Shack Even with a number of respected studies on brain stimulation its still not clear if these techniques have an impact I think most people would agree that the jury is still out about whether tDCS  has any proven therapeutic or cognitive enhancement effects said Charan Ranganath a professor at the Center for Neuroscience at the University of California Davis Research into the effectiveness of tDCS and other brain stimulation methods is still considered to be in the early stages and there are doubts in the neuroscience community about early results Some of the published studies have small sample sizes dont adequately address placebo effects and they often use weird measures of memory or cognition that can be hard to interpret said Ranganath There is also a tendency to only publish studies that have positive results while ignoring the ones with negative results If tDSC does work creating the same desired effect in different people is difficult even in tightly controlled laboratory studies where the equipment is set up and handled by experts To make tDCS work the currents must hit specific target areas in the brain which vary greatly for each person Everyones head is shaped differently and if its off by a small amount a tDCS device could have a drastically different impact Even if it does hit the right spot theres no guarantee a signal will impact people the same way For example some people function really well after a morning cup of coffee while others have the opposite reaction to caffeine The idea that the same method will achieve enhancing effects on everyone is probably over simplistic said Ranganath To counter those concerns Thync is taking its science safety and testing seriously In addition to tDCS it is using an emerging new technique called transcranial

CNN,tech, CNN  Car safety testing has come a long way since the days of dropping cadavers down unused elevator shafts in the 1930s That we enjoy greater peace of mind on the road  with fatal accidents in the US at historic lows  is largely due to the evolution of crash test dummies Vehicle manufacturers must prove their safety with dummies before they can be legally sold in the US and Europe and these unsung heroes have developed into extraordinarily sophisticated tools for collecting data and assessing risk The newest dummies can have over 130 channels of information says Chris O Connor CEO of Humanetics the worlds leading producer of dummies So the amount of data is up four or five times what it could years ago Humanetics work with insurance and academic institutions to analyze the everincreasing data This allows them to establish and prioritize the most common injuries but also the most common victims Obese people are 78 more likely to die in a crash says O Connor The reason is the way we get fat We get fat in our middle range And we get out of position in a typical seat To accommodate the increasing numbers of overweight drivers Humanetics are developing an obese dummy One prototype has already been produced that weighs 273 pounds with a body mass index of 35 The analytics also reveal that risk of a serious injury increases by 20 in 50yearold drivers by 40 at 80 and steadily higher thereafter Replicating age in a dummy is an ongoing challenge but the company hope to have a prototype by 2015 Humanetics are also rolling out their next generation THOR Test device for Human Occupant Restraint for median range occupants with the most advanced sensitivity yet The idea of these new dummies that they start to measure new types of load such as shoulder loads they interact with restraints better says Dr Joel Stitzel director of the Center for Injury Biomechanics They have more measurement capabilities so they can do a better job of predicting injury But Stitzel believes the timehonored crash test dummy could be challenged by a new concept The way the industry is going is more towards computational modelling THOR is the future of dummy development but auto manufacturers are looking to develop virtual scenarios they can run on computerswhich allow them to look at more specific anatomy It allows manufacturers to see things that dummies cant tell them and they can more easily modify virtual models such as adding subcutaneous fat to simulate larger people Such systems are already being tested in Europe While the new model would require a significant initial outlay the value increases with each use relative to dummies that can cost 500000 each in addition to writing off expensive vehicles Read more from Make Create Innovate Beyond Pistorius rise of the Cyberathletes Turn your kitchen into an orchestra with this magic device An end to all airport security lines ,0.4
CNN,tech, CNN  For the past 25 years the Web has opened up unprecedented possibilities for human communication But it has a dark side too  sometimes a very dark one Four out of 10 of Web users have been harassed online according to a survey released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center And about 73 of the Web users surveyed said theyve witnessed someone being harassed online The harshest forms of abuse  physical threats stalking and sexual harassment  are often reserved for women With responses from 2849 Web users the Pew study appears to be the most detailed of its kind looking at abusive behavior on the Web And it comes at a time when high profile cases of online abuse many of them targeting women have bubbled up from the Webs darker corners into the full light of public scrutiny Theres a pretty broad spectrum of these actions said Lee Rainie director of Internet Science and Technology research at the center And some of it is quite severe Online harassment breaks down into two categories according to Pew One is minor and one more severe The first includes things like namecalling and humiliation The second category targets a smaller segment of Web users and includes actions like stalking harassment over a long period of time and violent threats Its that sort of abuse that has made headlines in recent months Most prevalent has been GamerGate a movement that purports to be about defending videogaming culture and demanding responsible journalism from gaming websites But it quickly turned into a wave of vicious online attacks on journalists game developers and others  almost all of them women Several women have been subjected to violent rape threats detailed death threats hacking and doxxing in which documents with personal information are stolen and posted online At least two women have been forced to leave their homes after receiving specific threats of violence as a result of GamerGate In other highprofile incidents actor Zelda Williams left social media for several weeks in August after she received graphic abusive messages on Instagram and Twitter about the death of her father comedy legend Robin Williams And earlier this month actor Milla Jovovich announced on Twitter that shed stopped interacting with fans because she and her family had been threatened by a stalker from the site After contacting authorities I was told to absolutely stop talking to people I dont know on social forums she wrote Now that sucks for all the cool people I got to know on here but my family comes first and I cannot take any chances when it comes to them Its that sort of intense abuse that concerns Sara Baker coordinator of Take Back the Tech a campaign aimed at ending online violence against women In our work we see how the effects of online violence play out in the physical world all the time she said Whether or not such abuse results in physical violence  and it sometimes does  it always results in real harm According to the Pew study women experience the more severe types of abuse at disproportionately high levels when compared to men Among women age 1824 26 said theyd been stalked online and 25 said theyd been sexually harassed online Sponsored by members of womens groups from around the world Bakers organization recently gave a failing grade to Facebook Twitter and YouTube in a report saying the Webs largest socialmedia sites dont do enough to prevent abuse of women on their networks The Pew report suggests that social media is in fact where a lot of online harassment takes place Two out of three respondents who said theyd been harassed online said the most recent incident happened on a socialmedia website or app Other sites where people said they encountered harassment included the comments section of websites 22 online gaming 16 in email 16 on a discussion site such as Reddit 10 and on online dating sites or apps 6 Part of what makes online abuse so rampant is the anonymous nature of some Web forums Half the people who said theyve been harassed online said they didnt know their attacker But theres good news Just as the Web can be used to harass people it can be used to rally people against hurtful speech as well The Internet has expanded our ability to respond to such violence by finding community exchanging knowledge and building solidarity Baker said ,0.4

netiquettecnncom CNN  We begin this weeks column with a stunningly beautiful quote from Anais Nin brought to our attention by the inimitable site Brainpickings Read it slowly because its that good Yes were enculturating you in Netiquette We can hear the shouty complainy emails already The secret of a full life is to live and relate to others as if they might not be there tomorrow as if you might not be there tomorrow  This thought has made me more and more attentive to all encounters meetings introductions which might contain the seed of depth that might be carelessly overlooked This feeling has become a rarity and rarer every day now that we have reached a hastier and more superficial rhythm now that we believe we are in touch with a greater amount of people more people more countries This is the illusion which might cheat us of being in touch deeply with the one breathing next to us The dangerous time when mechanical voices radios telephones take the place of human intimacies and the concept of being in touch with millions brings a greater and greater poverty in intimacy and human vision Nin wrote those words in 1946 but she might as well have been writing them today She starts with a YOLO and ends with a contemporarysounding rumination of just how horrible weve all become now that we hold the power to be in touch with millions of people in the palms of our hands Thats right were talking about how annoying and rude and antisocial weve all become with our smartphones and tablets As CNN investigates all the ways mobile devices are changing our lives wed like to

Artist we need unstructured time for creativity to foster down time in which we mess around and let our disconnected thoughts gel into cool ideas If you turn every spare moment a red light a line at

case you should share it with the world So that we can laugh at you 4 Being really really scared to actually use the phone Phones and tablets have made it oh so easy to communicate without using our voiceboxes This is bad for relationships for oh so many reasons Anais Nin would just hate it Hit dial and enjoy the timehonored pas de deux of two humans you know talking 5 Missing your favorite bands concert because youre so busy taking crappy photos letting your phone ring and fiddling with your phone during the set Your hardofhearing reformed punkrock uncle was right Concerts really WERE better back in the day not necessarily because music really meant something man but because the audience actually paid attention and sang along and danced instead of holding their phones in the air and

come to the basement to settle the argument over whether a loofah is an animal or a plant or whether one could in theory set ones farts on fire The humor of the scene in Clueless where Cher and Dionne

another new report But to quote every mother of a teenager ever If everyone else jumped off a bridge would you do it too Seriously those 28 of people are dumb Theyre risking public humiliation should

moments when youve got your head ducked away from your surroundings fingers flailing tongue protruding from the lower right side of your mouth ever so slightly sending someone an obviously inane missive when you could be just interacting with the people or nature or cityscape or whatever around you It may feel natural but when youre around anyone over 25 in particular it comes off as very very rude Nobody enjoys being put on hold while the person 3 feet away from him or her taps all over a screen And when the tapping goes on for hours on a 45second loop in response to every ding of a response We promise if you text your friend back just once to say you cant talk right now no one will spontaneously implode If anything your buds callused finger pads will appreciate the muchneeded break Get over your fear of the phone Our parents couldnt believe how much time we spent on the phone in the early 2000s lounging on pink carpet and twirling the phones cord while parsing exactly what Darren meant by writing his and Janices initials as the points on the vector on the chalkboard in geometry class It probably seemed like a colossal waste of time moments we should have spent doing homework while wearing our dental headgear or something But voicetovoice communication is becoming a lost art and thats kind of a huge bummer Nowadays just 14 of teens say they talk daily with friends

CNN,tech, Editors note Tomorrow Transformed explores innovative approaches and opportunities available in business and society through technology CNN  Ever since two men first laid a bet on two flies climbing up a cave wall gambling has struck at the core of the human condition the future is uncertain And while games of chance like dice and cards have been with us for centuries bar room wagers on matters of abstract speculation have often been lost to history disappearing as fast as the hot air that produced them Until now that is Novelty bets Thanks to websites like Longbetsorg and professional gaming sites like Paddy Power oddball bets on everything from the next pope to the life expectancy of the universe have a running book In the case of Longbetsorg they are the source of heated debate about the shape of the future These bets become an interesting tool to understand how we think about the future and even if we are really arguing about the right things said Alexander Rose director of the Long Now Foundation which backs the Long Bets project Betting exchanges that take novelty bets are nothing new  Paddy Power has a longrunning book on whether it will snow on Christmas Day and the next pope  but what makes Long Bets different is that it will only accept bets that advance our understanding of science and the future The winner also must donate their winnings to a charity of his choice Predicting the future So far Long Bets has taken longterm bets on whether drones will do battle as part of protests whether commercial flights will become pilotless and on the future of level of the worlds population People need to have an opposing argument and come to an agreement about the terms which actually turns out to be quite tricky Rose told CNN Someone will make a bet for instance that we will find extraterrestrial intelligence in the next 50 years then theres often a long philosophical discussion about what constitutes extraterrestrial intelligence or even life If we are talking about something as strange as that we dont know even if wed recognize it Often he said the parties have already bashed out the terms before they come to Long Bets Buffetts million dollar gamble In the case of its current highest profile bet  a million dollar bet between billionaire investor Warren Buffett and alternative investment group Protg Partners LLC  the two parties had already agreed the terms and had come to Long Bets to find a platform for the wager For a simple 50 fee anyone can make a prediction which then becomes a bet when someone takes up the challenge Nothing is too outlandish said Rose as long as it is well argued Often the results can be surprising We had one bet on the cost of energy five years into the future and the parties had used a very good source which was the report of the US Department of Energy he said However when it came time to adjudicate that bet it was found the government had pulled its report in the wake of the 74 billion Enron scandal in 2001 Enron had sufficiently skewed the energy market that the government had to unwind all the Enron trades out of its report to know the true cost of energy Rose said It was enough to flip the results of the bet Changing parameters Often the future is so unpredictable that the parameters of the debate change entirely Once such argument over whether the top 10 news stories would come from a blog or the Wall Street Journal was at the time surprisingly eclipsed by Wikipedia which was little known in 2002 We often find that its not so much whether someone was right or wrong but that what was being argued about was not even relevant Rose said Our main goal is that they create an interesting discussion about the future And we try to keep them away from celebrities and sports and more on arguments about the world Weve taken a few bets on sports but only when theyve been arguments about globalization Some have time scales so long that no one will ever collect on them Turing test A bet on whether the universe will keep expanding is unlikely ever to see a winner but a 20000 bet between Googles director of engineering Ray Kurzweil and Lotus Development founder Mitchell Kapor on artificial intelligence passing the Turing test comes up in 2029 To pass the test a machine or computer program must convince a human judge that it has a level of intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human being For mainstream punters meanwhile betting exchanges like Paddy Power have been taking novelty bets on everything from the next pope  more than 300000 450000 was placed after Pope Benedicts resignation  to parents betting on their sons becoming soccer World Cup football captains For us its really a fraction of our business less than 1 but its

CNN,tech, CNNs coverage of Web Summit in Dublin looks at how technology is changing the world CNN  Cybercrime costs the global economy an estimated 400 billion a year and as it grows in scale and sophistication law enforcement is having to do the same The US secret service helped prevent over 1 billion in fraud losses from cybercrime last year but it is up against skilled and organized international crime networks Ed Lowery a special agent at the US Secret Service Investigative Division has witnessed the criminals becoming increasingly sophisticated What weve seen develop over the last 10 to 15 years has been cartel behavior from individuals who  have developed a very very intricate criminal conspiracy or criminal consortium to commit crimes against assets of the United States exfiltrate data and then monetize that data around the world he says With hackers driven by a desire to make a fast buck or by political motives cybercrime and geopolitical tension often go hand in hand Whether it is China or Russia this is a major challenge for law enforcement Weve developed our expertise dealing with the East European Russianlanguage speaking cyber criminals says Lowery Over the course of the last decade its become very apparent that those individuals are the highest caliber the most prolific and probably the most damaging cyber criminals that are out there They are operating from many places where the US and international law enforcement does not have the same level of cooperation Watch The world of Hackonomics Rob Wainwright the director of European law enforcement agency Europol agrees Its fine for the US and Europe to work together but where a lot of cybercriminals work according to the community themselves is in other parts of the world where relations are much more tense with the West he says From its base in the Netherlands Europol is spearheading Europes cyber policing Its Cybercrime Center which opened in January 2013 aims to be a focal point for gathering data and developing tools to detect and prosecute cybercrime But much more needs to be done to tackle what has become a truly global problem according to Wainwright We need to up our game in terms of developing our digital forensics skills and certainly in terms of our international coordination he says Here at Europol weve succeeded in bringing together some of the major agencies across the globe including those in the United States to help us fight the biggest syndicates here but we need much greater international cooperation He adds Its not the first time of course that certain geopolitical circumstances can impede the way in which we can operate against criminal terrorist groups Thats a fact of life and its something we rely on our political leaders to deal with and its important we establish effective policetopolice channels of cooperation One way that policing can stay ahead is through consistency  one set of laws for everyone who uses the Internet Theres one other thing thats very important here and thats making sure that we have an uptodate and modern legislative framework that can allow us to fight criminals online in the same way that police fight criminals in the real world says Wainwright At the moment the legislation which allows us for example to detect the criminals online and allows us to decrypt the way in which theyre working is pretty deficient actually and certainly not aligned across different jurisdictions The challenge for policing isnt just at the macro level of international cooperation and legal frameworks a shortage of law enforcement officers with the right expertise in specialized cyber skills is still a problem This is obviously a unique skillset and it takes years to develop that skillset says Lowery But even in this world of hightech criminality matched by hightech policing oldfashioned investigative skills still have their part to play You need a very highly skilled cadre you still need to be able to develop evidence that will stand up in a court of law says Lowery We have to be sure that the individual that we are going to charge with that crime is absolutely the individual that committed the crime To do that takes a lot of oldschool detective work ,0.4

CNN,us, Editors note Loren Stanford shared her personal story in response to Brittany Maynard a 29yearold with an aggressive form of terminal brain cancer who took medication on Saturday to end her life A version of this piece first appeared on CNN iReport before Maynards death CNN  As a woman whose parents had cancer I have quite a few things to say about dying with dignity In 1984 my mother was diagnosed with stage four cancer of the ovaries uterus ureters small intestine bladder and kidney I was 8 She was given six months to live She refused to accept that and sought treatment in Tampa Florida Her condition improved until two years later when she was diagnosed with a brain tumor Her body was mangled from all the surgeries She had to wear an ostomy bag which I learned how to change because she was so weak She had to give up her nursing career She had to give up the fun things in life she enjoyed doing because her body couldnt take it She no longer had the quality of life that she deserved My father no longer physically attracted to her satisfied his physical needs with other women She was too sick to give him what he physically wanted In 1988 when she was well enough to be at home full time my parents separated and filed for divorce Cancer broke their foundation of love and trust The pain didnt stop there In 1992 she was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer and lost her breasts The only part she felt that still identified her as a woman was taken away The same year my father was diagnosed with brain cancer He died quickly three weeks after his diagnosis He simply collapsed and died My right to death with dignity at 29 For years she suffered Its hard watching your mother cry over the pain Its hard watching your mother break down piece by piece For years she fought a pain pill addiction She wanted to live so she could raise her children but in reality she spent her time in the hospitals operating rooms and doctors offices Her hopes took a horrible turn She suffered greatly for 17 years until 2001 when doctors found cancer on her spine She killed herself three days later The person who died was not my mother She was not the funny intelligent strong and fierce woman I knew The person who died was sad and had lost all hope My last memory of my mother is of this person Lying on the bed with a bottle of pills next to her and her eyes half open There is no justice in her lasting legacy She deserved better She deserved to go in a more dignified way Dying with dignity is more than just for the person who is dying Its for their loved ones If it meant my mother leaving this world the way she was in 1984 and not in 2001 then I would have supported her decision to do so My last memories of her should have been when she was still full of life on the outside even though she was dying on the inside She chose to take her life anyway except it was without her loved ones surrounding her saying their final words and making peace She died alone My sister found her Her death was treated like a crime scene because she killed herself at home There were no final words No goodbyes Nothing but the unimaginable guilt I carry with me every day because maybe I could have done something better for her The danger of assisted suicide laws Its not fair to throw stones at someone because they are through fighting No one person or disease is the same so its unfair to judge and compare Just because a person decides they are done does not make them weak or selfish Dying with dignity is a brave decision to make Its a decision that involves everyone and its one of the greatest gifts of love that person can give to those left behind When assisted suicide is not the answer Some say she beat cancer She was given six months to live but lived for 17 years But what kind of life was it Was it a life worth living She had so much to live for but at what cost What kind of life was it for her children I can tell you it was hard I was robbed of a childhood It was years of struggles and tears I would never wish what I had lived through on anyone No child should have to see their parents suffer so much Today Im happily married and have a 4yearold son I would never want him to watch either one of his parents suffer If a diagnosis is final and the options are there I just may choose to die with dignity and end my life on my terms If you have to explain death how hard is it to include dying before the suffering becomes too great Sure the experiences built me up to be strong and be able to handle some serious stress and in part made me the person I am today but I would gladly trade it back if my mother could have done things her way when she really should have Whats your reaction Stanford answered some of your questions in the comments below The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Loren Stanford ,0.4

CNN,us, CNN  Teams of investigators were out at daybreak Wednesday examining damage to NASAs Wallops Flight Facility after an unmanned rocket exploded shortly after launch on the Virginia coast NASA spokeswoman Rachel Kraft told CNN via email NASA is warning people in the area not to touch debris if they find any The Antares rocket built by NASA contractor Orbital Sciences Corp and its Cygnus cargo spacecraft suffered a catastrophic failure shortly after liftoff Tuesday evening the company said The crash caused a huge fire and scattered debris over a large area Orbital Sciences told CNN it would issue a statement on the status of the investigation later Wednesday The cargo module was carrying 5000 pounds of supplies and experiments meant for the International Space Station Officials say no one was injured or killed in the explosion but NASA says debris may be scattered around the launch area and some may have fallen into the ocean Rocket explodes in fireball What happened The public is being warned to forget about grabbing up rocket debris as souvenirs It had a lot of hazardous materials on board that people should not be looking for or wanting to collect souvenirs over said Frank Culbertson a former NASA astronaut and now a manager at Orbital Sciences Corp If you find anything that washes ashore in the local area or came down on your farm or in your yard  definitely do not touch it and keep people away from it There may be a possibility of debris washing up onto some of the beaches into some of the areas surrounding the island Bill Wrobel director of NASAs Wallops Flight Facility said a news conference Tuesday If people do find any debris theyre being urged to call NASA at 7578241295 NASA says teams started assessing damage to Wallops at daylight Wednesday Damage was contained to kind of the south end of Wallops Island Wrobel said Thats predominately where many of the pieces came down Opinion Rockets blow up we move on You see a big fireball The rocket lifted off at 622 pm ET but about six seconds after launch there was an explosion and the rocket fell to the ground engulfed in a huge fireball It seemed to be going perfectly when Ed Encina saw the launch brighten up the sky from his vantage point about 3 miles away And then all of a sudden you see a big fireball said Encina a Baltimore Sun reporter He recalled a loud boom that caused your feet to shake a little bit as well as flames enveloping a roughly 100yard area around the launchpad in a marshy area with brush CNN iReporter Dymetria Sellers who watched from a drawbridge because the NASA visitors station was full recalled a breathtakingly beautiful sight when the rocket ascended followed by mass confusion as flames lit up the early nighttime sky moments later About 30 seconds later we could hear and feel two booms reach us and it was apparent the rocket had exploded she said Did you witness the rocket explosion Please share your images Mark Kelly a former NASA astronaut said such a colossal fire was to be expected after the launch failure It takes a lot of propellant to take a spacecraft of that size moving 25 times the speed of sound Kelly told CNN explaining how fast the rocket should have gone on its way to the space station So when it fails its usually pretty catastrophic Orbital Sciences will lead the investigation into the explosion NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration will assist What we know so far is pretty much what everybody saw on the video Culbertson said The ascent stopped there was some lets say disassembly of the first stage and then it fell to Earth  We dont really have any early indications of exactly what might have failed and we need some time to look at that Theyll examine debris and review video of the launch and telemetry from the spacecraft We have reams and reams of data that comes down from the rocket during launch Culbertson said Payload included student experiments The cargo included crew supplies hardware for the space station spacewalk equipment and several experiments designed by students No classified payloads were on board the spacecraft said Kraft the NASA spokeswoman One experiment from Duchesne Academy of the Sacred Heart in Houston would have tested how pea shoots grow in space The school said on its website that students parents and teachers were shocked and disappointed by the explosion but that it wasnt a total loss The amount of learning that occurred as a result of being part of this program through the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space CASIS is incredible and the students and their teachers  should always be proud of this accomplishment the school said Also lost in the blast was a study called Drain Brain which was designed to help learn more about blood flow in space and an experiment called Meteor which may have helped find previously undetected meteor showers The cargo also included more than 1300 pounds of food for the space station NASA four to six months worth of food is stashed on board so there is no worry the crew will go hungry Also a Russian Progress resupply vehicle arrived at the space station Wednesday And SpaceX is scheduled to take up supplies in December The station is in great shape the crew is in good shape said Mike Suffredini the space stations program manager Opinion Dont overreact to rocket explosion CNNs Greg Botelho Chandler Friedman

CNN,us, Editors note In celebration of International Day of the Girl October 11 and Ada Lovelace Day October 14 Leading Women is devoting the month of October to women and girls in STEM science technology engineering and math CNN  Just one in seven engineers are female only 27 of all computer science jobs are held by women and women have seen no employment growth in STEM jobs since 2000 reports Forbes Women who work in the fields of science technology engineering and math and those who campaign for higher numbers of women in these fields think they have some solutions to this growing problem 1 The toys and games that young girls play with mold their educational and career interests they create dreams of future careers says Andrea Guendelman cofounder of Developher Extensive research shows that certain toys and games can help young children develop the spatial logic and other analytical skills critical to science technology engineering and math A huge part of the reason women are not entering these fields and huge part of the solution starts at the very beginning 2 Introduce girls early to role models of other women In STEM suggests Regina Agyare founder of Soronko Solutions These women will mentor them and introduce them to STEM through games and practical learning experiences 3 Its important to engage girls in STEM at an early age and keep them interested adds Patty L Fagin PhD Head of School at Stuart Country Day School of the Sacred Heart Girls start out as strong in math and science as boys but lose interest along the way we call this the leaky pipeline Grow the pipeline keep girls engaged and well increase the number of women in STEM Create opportunities for success and safe environments in which to fail Theyll learn to persevere and develop a growth mindset so critical to success in STEM fields  instead of this is hard I cant do it they will believe I can try another way Girls want to make a difference so give them handson realworld problemsolving activities to show STEM is relevant and fun Expose girls to the different areas of STEM and provide women mentors for girls and young women so they in turn will mentor other girls 4 Theres no magic recipe for getting girls into STEM but we know early and positive exposure makes an impact Karen Horting CEO and Executive Director at the Society of Women Engineers told CNN Our Invent it Built it program Oct 25 in Los Angeles will expose girls in the sixth to eighth grade to the creative collaborate nature of a rewarding career in engineering Registration continues through Oct 11 and additionally provides educators and parents with the tools they need to nurture the future engineers in their lives 5 Start them young is Michelle Sun Founder and CEO of First Code Academys advice STEM fields are often thought of as a career path for the boys globally and no less common in Asia We observe brothers in a family are more likely to be enrolled to our kids coding classes However the amazing thing we found with students from 8  11 years old is that our female students come to our programs with minimal preconception of what programming is about They approached it with much enthusiasm and confidence just as any other hobbies or subjects By starting them young we provide them a chance to experience the STEM field first hand 6 I believe one on one mentoring programs with accomplished female STEM professionals will help bring girls in to the STEM field says Adeola Shasanya who recently cofounded AfroTech Girls and works at the Lagos State Electricity Board as an Electrical Engineering and Renewables Consultant Fun technical workshops could also help spark a STEM interest for girls I believe work shadowing a female stemist in a typical work environment could enlighten the girls on what work would be like as a STEMist 7 Haiyan Zhang Innovation Director at Lift London Microsoft Studios believes confidence is key Insatiable curiosity and the self confidence to make change in the world  two qualities that are key to instil in the female innovators of the future Science technology engineering and mathematics become the tools with which to explore curiosity and to create change 8 Women are the future of technology and todays technology is fun and cool says Weili Dai President and Cofounder of Marvell Technology Group Its not just about developing nerdy stuff its about turning technology into fashionable and userfriendly smart solutions A womans natural talent is design and the look and feel and making these things fit into our lifestyles I believe by embracing STEM and leveraging inherent strength of women  the sense of responsibility passion compassion and pride we dedicate to family and community  and applying it to business can make women the X factor in the new era of global growth and prosperity for the Smart Life and Smart Lifestyle 9 Time and again I hear from women who chose their STEM career because they were inspired by a successful woman who proved it could be done adds Suw CharmanAnderson Founder of Ada Lovelace Day Role models are incredibly important both to girls and to women and we need to show girls just how exciting fulfilling and enjoyable a career in STEM can be We must prove that there is a path for them to tread by telling the stories past and present of the women whove built invented discovered and explained the world around us but who so often go unmentioned 10To get more girls in STEM lets go for collective action says Julie Kantor Chief Partnership Officer at Million Women Mentors Of 368000 high school girls who want to pursue STEM only 4 said they had a mentor encouraging them Commit to mentoring a girl or young woman in STEM skills Or offer an internship with a designated mentor at your company Ladies and gentlemen lets get a million STEM mentors by 2018 Read 12 inspirational quotes from women scientists Relive Twitter chat as it happened How can we get girls into STEM Quiz10

CNN,us, CNN  Car safety testing has come a long way since the days of dropping cadavers down unused elevator shafts in the 1930s That we enjoy greater peace of mind on the road  with fatal accidents in the US at historic lows  is largely due to the evolution of crash test dummies Vehicle manufacturers must prove their safety with dummies before they can be legally sold in the US and Europe and these unsung heroes have developed into extraordinarily sophisticated tools for collecting data and assessing risk The newest dummies can have over 130 channels of information says Chris O Connor CEO of Humanetics the worlds leading producer of dummies So the amount of data is up four or five times what it could years ago Humanetics work with insurance and academic institutions to analyze the everincreasing data This allows them to establish and prioritize the most common injuries but also the most common victims Obese people are 78 more likely to die in a crash says O Connor The reason is the way we get fat We get fat in our middle range And we get out of position in a typical seat To accommodate the increasing numbers of overweight drivers Humanetics are developing an obese dummy One prototype has already been produced that weighs 273 pounds with a body mass index of 35 The analytics also reveal that risk of a serious injury increases by 20 in 50yearold drivers by 40 at 80 and steadily higher thereafter Replicating age in a dummy is an ongoing challenge but the company hope to have a prototype by 2015 Humanetics are also rolling out their next generation THOR Test device for Human Occupant Restraint for median range occupants with the most advanced sensitivity yet The idea of these new dummies that they start to measure new types of load such as shoulder loads they interact with restraints better says Dr Joel Stitzel director of the Center for Injury Biomechanics They have more measurement capabilities so they can do a better job of predicting injury But Stitzel believes the timehonored crash test dummy could be challenged by a new concept The way the industry is going is more towards computational modelling THOR is the future of dummy development but auto manufacturers are looking to develop virtual scenarios they can run on computerswhich allow them to look at more specific anatomy It allows manufacturers to see things that dummies cant tell them and they can more easily modify virtual models such as adding subcutaneous fat to simulate larger people Such systems are already being tested in Europe While the new model would require a significant initial outlay the value increases with each use relative to dummies that can cost 500000 each in addition to writing off expensive vehicles Read more from Make Create Innovate Beyond Pistorius rise of the Cyberathletes Turn your kitchen into an orchestra with this magic device An end to all airport security lines ,0.4

CNN,us, Orange California CNN  Ian Chung is nestled in darkness Born just 24 weeks into gestation he weighs scarcely more than a pound He can hear the faint sounds of the outside world mingling with the soothing sound of his mothers voice His spindly arms and legs shake as he lets out a warble Oh my love coos his mother Julie Chung 31 Youre going to be OK Julies hands descend  one landing lightly on Ians chest while the other pushes against his jerking legs She is using touch and light pressure to simulate for her premature son her own womb A few moments later Ian stops crying When he was born he was so tiny said Chung It was like Oh wow can a baby even survive outside the womb this early Medical advances are improving outcomes for even the tiniest babies Experts say fewer than 1 are born in the micro preemie category at the hospital where Ian is being treated Childrens Hospital of Orange County in California that means born before 28 weeks or born weighing less than 22 pounds Survival rates among micro preemies have been improving said Mindy Morris a neonatal nurse practitioner at Childrens Hospital So they may survive to discharge But then growing up as children they have a lot of complications Doctors and nurses at a specialized unit at Childrens Hospital have implemented a system they say is dramatically reducing disability and infection rates among this rare preemie population Aptly named the Small Baby Unit the staff work under the cover of darkness and quiet in a separate wing of the hospital Here stimulation is kept to a minimum speaking is only done in hushed voices The overall effect is one of relative calm an attempt to mimic what babies would experience if they were still safely tucked in utero We try to keep it low sound low lights so that it is as close to the womb as we can get said Morris coordinator of the Extremely Low Birth Weight Program at Childrens Hospital We try to minimize the intrusion to them In 2009 before the Small Baby Unit was up and running 45 of babies were discharged with chronic lung disease In 2012 after the unit had been operating for three years the rate was down to 27 Infection rates from 2009 to 2012 dipped from 41 to 15 and feeding weight and head circumference have also improved Dr Kristi Watterberg chairwoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on the fetus and newborn said that developing processes to treat extremely low birthweight babies is  broadly speaking  a good thing But since Childrens Hospitals data are selfreflexive she questions what exactly is contributing to the units success When someone starts focusing on something it tends to trend better said Watterberg What made it happen We dont know Watterberg said that some elements of what is being done at Childrens Hospital including various forms of touch therapy can be beneficial to premature infants A large study published in 2004 found 21 to 48 greater weight gain among infants undergoing moderate massage therapy they also were discharged sooner from the hospital Other studies suggest that specific types of massage therapy stimulate production of growth hormones and promote bone development At the Small Baby Unit parents act as therapists and partners with the staff so they are engaged fully with their childs progress Studies show that mothers who massage their infants experience decreased depression and anxiety It can hurt to be touched Chung is learning about the thin line between stimulating and overstimulating her son For preemies it can hurt to be touched because their skin isnt ready for it explained Karin Mitchell a developmental therapist working with Chung Mitchell grabs Chungs hand Let me show you on your hand she said pressing on Chungs palm to show her how firmly to touch Ian Its not heavy but its also not superlight Remember when he was inside the womb there was amniotic fluid and there was a feeling of that moving across every skin cell of his body Mitchell said Thats what helps babies know Where do I start and where do I stop When babies are born early like Ian they dont have that option so now they have to learn their body in the midst of air Its a lot different Soon Ian will lie  tubes and all  skintoskin on his mothers chest for an hour or more something referred to as kangaroo care Painful medical interventions like intubation extubation and blood draws are performed while a baby is skintoskin with a parent whenever possible In those situations touch is thought to mitigate pain Kangarooing as mothers here refer to it also helps with bonding and regulating things like respiration and sleep among babies For mothers it may stimulate breast milk production It calms me when hes kangarooing with me and I notice hes more calm said Chung She pauses as tears roll down her face Its nice to know that those things help him You cling to those little things that can ease things for him Ians care here is in stark contrast to what he got during his first few days of life in a traditional NICU at another local hospital There according to his parents the lights and noise were blaring This unit is a laser focus on this very specific patient population I think that is what makes this so unique said Dr Kushal Bhakta medical director of the Extremely Low Birth Weight Program at Childrens Hospital Other places Ive worked you will have a tiny premature baby next to an older child who has a heart condition next to another child who may be crying he continued So theres  a lot of other stimuli to this little tiny preemie and its not done purposely Its just the layout of whatever unit theyre in Watterberg of the American Academy of Pediatrics said it is important to strike a balance adding that theories and approaches regarding noise in the ICU are constantly evolving We used to think it should be quiet so when these babies came into the world too soon wed turn off the lights and make it quiet said Watterberg a professor of pediatrics and neonatology at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine Turns out babies were hearing a fair amount of noise in utero and that maybe if its too quiet they are not hearing the kind of language they need She cites recent research that suggests too little sound could interfere with a babys acquisition of speech and language and that exposure to speech can enhance brain development in babies Similarly she said too much darkness could be counterproductive to a babys development since in utero a baby would be exposed to a stream of information from its mother reflecting her own changing circadian rhythms We know that what happens in the ICU affects babies long term said Watterberg So Im pleased that this group is working on it but the information we have is always in process Numbers  In the Small Baby Unit numbers mean a lot When Ian was born they went something like this 47 chance hed survive and if he did survive only a 31 chance he would escape serious neurodevelopmental problems Chung and her husband Ryan Chung temper the harsh reality of those statistics by focusing on other numbers  milestones Ian is reaching from day to day week to week Ian has already defied the steep odds that he would not survive Today he is 7 weeks old We celebrated 10 grams last night said Julie of Ians weight gain since he was admitted to the Small Baby Unit Its like He is 2 pounds Wow  The Chungs believe that Ians future prospects are improving because of his treatment  in particular the emphasis on touch  in the Small Baby Unit Three weeks and 10 ounces later he is less reliant on supplemental oxygen and is less averse to touch Julie you want to massage him asks Mitchell Yes says Chung who glances up at the numbers changing favorably on a monitor above her He likes it Weeks earlier the monitor beeped incessantly Today Ian seems relatively calm  more OK with his surroundings Although some of the science behind what happens in the Small Baby Unit eludes her Chung knows that one alternative  little or no contact between her and Ian  would leave her empty emotionally She recalls an article she read recently describing how most NICUs

CNN,us, CNN  What started as an expose of the harassment women face in public has turned into fodder for death and rape threats against the woman in the viral video There are people whove said a lot of things but Im not reading what they are saying Shoshana Roberts told CNNs Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night We hit a nerve Roberts didnt say a word as she walked through the streets of Manhattan for 10 hours for the video She didnt have to How should men approach women Over 100 passersby spoke up with catcalls and phrases such as God bless you mami Damn and Hey look it there My nonverbal cues were saying Dont talk to me No eye contact No friendly demeanor she said But they were ignoring my nonverbal cues Accurate depiction Roberts said the video is an accurate depiction of what she faces daily For instance there was a time when her grandfather died and someone told me that they liked the way I looked It is all day long It is every day she said Thats a typical day It doesnt matter what you wear Where are the white men in the catcalling video The 10 hours of footage was edited down to a 156 public service announcement for the antistreet harassment group Hollaback It was shot by filmmaker Rob Bliss who was wearing a hidden camera in his backpack I have multiple experiences of sexual assault which is why I wanted to be involved in this project Roberts said in a separate interview with HLN Scary feeling Perhaps the most nerveracking part of the video was when a man started walking alongside Roberts and continued following her for five minutes I have been doing martial arts since I was nine and I have a black belt in tae kwon do  and I am scared Roberts told Cooper The video has been viewed more than 12 million times on YouTube Despite numerous threats of violence against Roberts many have been supportive ShoshanaBinya thank you for participating in that hollaback video too many women go through the same thing Andrea_Misho said on Twitter ShoshanaBinya thank you for participating in that hollaback video too many women go through the same thing It needs to stop Street harassment disproportionately impacts women people of color LGBTQ individuals and young people Hollaback says on its website Although the degree to which Shoshana gets harassed is shocking the reality is that the harassment that people of color and LGBTQ individuals face is oftentimes more severe and more likely to escalate into violence the group said Roberts said shes perplexed by why so many people harass when there is seldom a good outcome We dont put up with harassment in schools at work or at home so why should we on the street httpstcohfHLNKUDCP I dont know what they expect people to do she said I mean this is happening to so many women and my story is not unique It needs to stop she added We can change hearts and minds CNNs Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report ,0.4

CNN,us, CNN  The first indication that something was wrong was a phone call from his daughters Denver area school to let Assad Ibrahim know that she had not come to class He dialed her cell And she answered But officials say she didnt tell him that she was on her way to Syria to join ISIS She was just late for class thats all Ibrahims daughter told him on Friday according to the Arapahoe County Sheriffs Office which filed a runaway report The American girl of Sudanese descent also kept quiet about her two girlfriends Americans of Somali descent who were flying with her to Turkey by way of Germany Two more girls sisters Those two had told their father Ali Farah that they were going to the library But when Farah got home from work a visitor came calling according to the documents Apparently it was Ibrahim Farah should check to see if his daughters passports were missing the visitor told him  just like his daughters passport was Sure enough they were gone along with 2000 in cash The two families called the FBI They said they thought the girls were on their way to Turkey The agency put out a notice on their passports German authorities intercepted the trio ages 15 15 and 17 at Frankfurt airport and put them on a plane back to the United States where they were greeted by FBI agents The three girls were questioned and released Two US officials say they had planned to join militants with ISIS the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria A former jihadist speaks out Out of the blue The girls parents say they had no idea their children planned to travel None of them had ever run away before Their disappearance hit them out of the blue the way other ISIS related incidents are popping up in the Western world Two more turned up in tandem with the girls runaway attempt On Monday a radical convert to Islam in Canada ran down two soldiers in his car killing one of them Martin Rouleau Couture 25 then led police on a chase before his car rolled into a ditch in the town of SaintJeansurRichelieu southeast of Montreal He exited the car and police shot him dead Back in July Couture too had tried to join foreign jihad and Canadian police arrested him on his way to Turkey But they could not charge him and had to let him go And this week a video turned up of a 17yearold Australian boy standing with ISIS fighters and threatening to behead Western leaders including President Obama then fly the ISIS flag over the White House Colorado teen pleads guilty in plan to join ISIS ISIS draw ISIS has for an antiWestern organization been surprisingly attractive to young recruits from the West as well as to some young women More than 100 of the foreign fighters have come from the United States according to intelligence estimates hundreds more from Europe which is geographically closer to the fight Every week five more people from the UK alone join ISIS a British police commissioner said Tuesday And thats a conservative estimate We know that over 500 British nationals traveled to join the conflict said Sir Bernard HoganHowe from the Metropolitan Police Five a week doesnt sound much but when you realize there are 50 weeks in a year 250 more would be 50 more than we think have gone already he said To put things into perspective though thousands more come from the Middle East and Africa More than 3000 have joined from Tunisia Sense of belonging Its more than just a radical interpretation of Islam that is drawing teens to the extremely bloodthirsty militant group a former CIA officer says Theyre often times searching for an identity because what the jihadis are actually pushing is a specific narrative which is Your people Muslims are being oppressed in this place called Syria your government is doing nothing were the only ones who are actually going to help you out said Aki Peritz Why dont you join the fight Richard Barrett of The Soufan Group says many of the teens lack a sense of belonging where they live and they believe ISIS can give it to them The general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in Syria suggests camaraderie good morale and purposeful activity all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own selfesteem he says And ISIS constantly cranks the PR machine making expert use of slick videos and social media Echoing back West ISIS global digital reach has terror experts in the United States worried about security at home as well There are terrorist groups in Yemen and in Syria with stated ambitions of striking on American soil but another threat is more probable says counterterrorism expert Matt Olsen I would say the most likely types of attack is one of these homegrown violent extremists or lone offenders in the United States and with the rise of ISIS and the number of people going to Syriathe likelihood does go up Selfstyled attackers like the Boston Marathon bombers could be the result The use of the Internet makes terrorists more vulnerable to tracking but that has become more difficult since Edward Snowden revealed secret US surveillance programs Opinion What lures Americans to Syria fight Girls online activities In Denver the 17yearold girl was apparently the instigator of the trip having planned it for months two US officials said But all three researched the plan online visiting websites where extremists discuss how to get to Syria The online activity didnt set off any tripwires the FBI typically uses to flag possible jihadist sympathizers the officials said The FBI is combing all of their communications to see if anyone was helping them Their parents think ISIS was behind the trip Investigators are also not sure the girls had even worked out the final goal for their travel As was the case with the Canadian Couture the investigation into the travel will probably not lead to charges especially because the girls are minors the two US officials said On Monday Sheriffs Deputy Evan Driscoll visited the two girls of Somali descent in their home and had a conversation with them The girls explained that they stole the 2000 and their passports from their mother he wrote in the
