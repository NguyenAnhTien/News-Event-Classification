MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/rand-pauls-long-game, Rand Paul this week announced a class action lawsuit against President Obama to curb the NSA s ability to gather domestic phone records  insisting such surveillance efforts should be  specific to the person  to the place and to the items  But lurking behind the policy argument is a clear political motive as well  the Kentucky senator  who s considering a bid for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016  has argued for years that his libertarianism is just what the party needs to attract a younger  more diverse base  Paul s lawsuit  which is backed by former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli and tea party group Freedomworks  is the latest phase in Paul s long running campaign against government spying  But lately his political motives have been more visibily attached to the war on surveillance  Paul s asking Americans to show their support for his lawsuit by giving him their e mail addresses and zip codes   information that some commentators noted is more valuable to a candidate building a voter database than to a judge considering a lawsuit  Paul s critique of the NSA isn t unique to the right  many progressive activists are similarly appalled by evidence of widespread government spying  And opposition to such surveillance programs isn t the only area where Paul has some overlap with the left  Some of his more libertarian positions  like scaling back the war on drugs and restricting drone strikes  also cross party lines  One of Paul s top allies in the Senate when it comes to spying concerns is Ron Wyden  an Oregon Democrat who is also intensely critical of the NSA  Paul has argued such crossover issues will attract voters not traditionally associated with the GOP  He s made an effort to reach out to African Americans by criticizing mandatory sentencing laws  And he insists protesting government intrusion will win back the so called Millennial voters   young people born after 1980 who backed Obama by large margins in 2012  Young voters  don t really care as much about taxes  regulation  balanced budgets might not be their big deal either  but they care about their liberty  they care about their privacy  Paul said at a forum hosted by Young Americans For Liberty in July   I think if we do  the youth will come  Paul s efforts may even resonate with more traditional GOP base voters  Republican strategist Ford O Connell told msnbc that Paul s NSA attack would appeal to that group because it dovetails with conservatives  general anxieties about government overreach under Obama   This is about not just getting to the general election and winning young voters  it s also high on the mind of tea party folks and constitutional conservatives  O Connell said  For now  neither party has a monopoly on the battle over civil liberties  Many Republican leaders  who gleefully attacked Democrats for opposing warrantless wiretapping under President Bush  are still uncomfortable with Paul s positions  And Democrats have yet to reach a consensus either  with some more hawkish officials like Senator Dianne Feinstein aggressively defending the NSA s surveillance practices  Some progressives are making a parallel case to Paul s as well  arguing Democrats shouldn t cede political ground to the GOP on the issue of privacy  Shenna Bellows  a Democrat challenging Republican Sen  Susan Collins in Maine  has made the incumbent s support for the NSA and the PATRIOT Act her top campaign issue   Privacy is a winning issue in 2014 because there s a really interesting coalition of progressives and libertarians across Maine and across the country interested in restoring our constitutional freedoms  Bellows told msnbc in a phone interview   I think privacy is incredibly important to young people who understand technology and understand that our laws have not kept pace with technology  Paul s earned plenty of praise from progressives for his positions on surveillance  drone strikes  and drug laws  But his political ambitions can be a source of tension in those circles  Paul is intensely conservative on budget issues  favoring the rapid elimination of huge swaths of the federal government  and he opposes abortion rights  His libertarianism has also led him to some politically explosive places  like criticizing the 1964 Civil Rights Act that ended segregation  and some fringe associations  like a neo Confederate aide who resigned last year  And that s not even counting his father s far more inflammatory history  The closer the younger Paul gets to a plausible presidential campaign  the harder it gets for some progressives to separate his issues from his ambitions  Van Jones  the progressive activist and former Obama adviser who now hosts CNN s Crossfire  carefully qualified his support for Paul s filibuster against drone strikes last year by labeling him  a civil liberties hero and a civil rights villain  in a column  Liberal columnist Adele Stan took fellow left wing activists to task over their support for Paul the same month  warning that they were legitimizing his more extreme positions by extension  Concerns on the left about boosting Paul s presidential stock might make it marginally harder to find activist allies for his policy causes  but they aren t particularly relevant to his electoral ambitions  In fact  one of the biggest obstacles he could face in 2016 is that his rivals actually buy into his argument  Many of Paul s signature issues are gaining ground within the GOP  The Republican National Committee recently adopted a resolution sponsored by a Paul supporter decrying NSA spying  Texas Gov  Rick Perry  who might run again in 2016  recently suggested Texas move towards decriminalizing marijuana and has defended the right of states to legalize the drug  Chris Christie  who has clashed with Paul on national security issues  slammed the war on drugs as  a failure  in a speech last month  Two other likely presidential candidates  Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio  joined Paul for his anti drone filibuster last year  Paul is surely heartened to see libertarian policies gain ground among Republican leaders  But the more they do  the less unique his appeal might be to Republican voters  There s a long history of political insurgents fading away as the major parties co opt their views  Paul s biggest enemy could be success  Close video       The Daily Rundown  2 14 14  10 57 AM ET       The road to  16 00        Would be 2016 candidates learn some hard lessons about the

nephew was killed by transit police in Oakland  flew all the way from California  And Noche Diaz  an anti police brutality activist from New York City  boarded a bus in Chinatown and spent the next 16 hours en route to Georgia before joining a group of friends for the 10 hour drive to Sanford   I was anxious  I was afraid  but I knew I had to be here for the start of this trial  said Sherman  standing on the grass outside of the Seminole County Criminal Justice Center  where the trial of George Zimmerman for second degree murder began on Monday morning with jury selection  Sherman stood with a dozen or so other people who d gathered in front of the courthouse  holding a large sign with a picture of her 9 year old grandson Semaj that read   Could He Be The Next Trayvon Martin  Trayvon Martin  17  died just about six miles from the court house where scores of potential jurors were convened and questioned today  Zimmerman  who has pleaded not guilty  says he shot Martin in self defense after the teenager attacked him  When police initially declined to arrest Zimmerman  thousands of protestors  descended upon Sanford  There were massive rallies with celebrity activists who compared Sanford to Selma and Montgomery  The case has remained controversial  And yet the crowd outside the courthouse on Monday was small  City officials have been preparing for the trial for about a year  creating so called free speech zones for protestors  making accommodations for the national and international press figured to be in town for the trial  and assigning officers with the county sheriffs and police departments to guard the courthouse and other key locations in town  The planning so far has cost more than  500 000  according to City Manager Norton Bonaparte  But little of that exhaustive preparation seemed necessary Monday  as some of the protesters  many wearing hooded sweatshirts like the one Martin was wearing the night of his death  began trading their protest signs for places in the shade as the late morning sun crept higher and hotter  There was no chanting  no apparent rancor  There seemed to be just as many members of the media present as there were protestors  But the surprisingly sparse crowd did little to dim the spirit of those who d trekked from across the country or from across town to be here   I said I would be here for the start of the trial and I made it  said Sherman  who used four days of vacation from her job with AT T   I m here to support Trayvon Martin and his family  It s not just his family that was hurt by this  We ve all spent a year and a half being mad  being sad and being angry  I m here for justice  Cephus Johnson  the uncle of Oscar Grant  22  who was shot and killed by a Bay Area transit officer on New Year s Day in 2009  said he made the trek from Oakland to carry the spirit of all the young  unarmed black and brown men killed by law enforcement  security guards and others each year   When we heard about Trayvon it hit us hard  It was painful  gut wrenching  and we knew exactly what his family was going through  said Johnson   We couldn t have made it without the support of the community  coming to court with us  helping us to get through the process  So that s why we re here  Grant s killing was captured on video which later went viral  It renewed debate over the treatment of black men by law enforcement   It s a group that none of us want to be a part of  said Johnson  of the families of gun violence   but we have to stand together  An award winning film   Fruitvale Station  depicting the life and death of Oscar Grant  is scheduled to be released in theaters in July  The officer who killed Grant was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to two years in prison  but served less than a year because of time served in jail while he awaited trial  Over the course of the next week or more  some 500 prospective jurors will file into the county court here in Sanford  That number will be whittled down to six jurors and several  alternates  The jurors will remain anonymous and will be asked a litany of questions by the judge  defense attorneys and the prosecution most likely about what they know about the case  how they feel about race  guns and marijuana  among other things  The trial could last six weeks  Ultimately  the jury will have to determine Zimmerman s guilt or innocence  was his shooting of the unarmed teenager legal self defense or second degree murder  Noche Diaz has already made up his own mind   Trayvon Martin is not on trial here  said Diaz   If we don t get justice  if Zimmerman is not found guilty  vigilantes out there will think vigilantism is free and the courts will have your back  There was no visible presence of Zimmerman supporters outside of court today  but Robert Zimmerman  George Zimmerman s brother  who has been one of his most vocal defenders  held an impromptu press conference during a court recess  He said that his family has received death threats and have few interactions with people outside of the family  Robert Zimmerman reiterated his brother s account of what happened just before Martin was killed  saying that Martin struck Zimmerman first  breaking his nose  He expressed faith in the justice system  and said that he believes his brother will ultimately be vindicated   We are very confident in the outcome of the case  he said   and we are confident that the state will not be able to meet its burden  Note  George Zimmerman has sued NBCUniversal for defamation  The company has strongly denied his allegations

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/congress-comes-out-medical-marijuana, For the first time ever  Congress is taking action to protect   not condemn   medical marijuana use  Shortly after midnight Friday  the GOP led House passed a measure that would prohibit the Drug Enforcement Agency from raiding medical marijuana activities in states where it is legal  It gained broad bipartisan support with 170 Democrats and 49 Republicans voting in favor of the bill  with a final 219 189 tally  Republican Rep  Dana Rohrabacher of California attached the measure to a routine spending bill  It would block the Justice Department from using federal dollars to interfere with medical marijuana operations that are legal in almost half of states in the country   Some people are suffering  and if a doctor feels that he needs to prescribe something to alleviate that suffering  it is immoral for this government to get in the way  Rohrabacher said  raising his voice on the House floor Thursday night   And that s what s happening  The measure still faces several procedural hurdles  The Senate is expected to pass its own funding bill  meaning the amendment would have to survive the reconciliation process in a joint conference  And that s even before it makes it to the president s desk for his signature  The groundbreaking vote mirrors a growing swell of support for marijuana across state legislatures and among the public  For the first time ever  a majority of Americans support legalizing marijuana  Minnesota just became the latest state to green light medical use of pot  adding to the 21 other states and the District of Columbia that have similar laws on the books  Meanwhile Washington and Colorado are becoming a testing ground in shaping a market and regulation for recreational pot use while the drug remains illegal under federal law   Despite this overwhelming shift in public opinion  the federal government continues its hard line of oppression against medical marijuana  Rohrabacher said on the House floor  The feds have already taken small steps toward reconciling the competing state and federal laws  Easing back on the decades long  war on drugs  Attorney General Eric Holder said the DOJ would stand by the voter backed initiatives in Washington and Colorado  Holder has also said the administration would be  glad to work with Congress  on whether to declassify marijuana from being considered on the same level as heroin and LSD  a movement that is slowly gaining steam   It s becoming clearer and clearer that marijuana prohibition s days are numbered  Marijuana Policy Project director Dan Riffle said in a statement   It s nice to see more members of Congress standing up for their constituents instead of standing in the way of reform  Do you think recreational marijuana will be legal nationwide within the next decade   ,05/30/14 12:28 PM,drugs

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/can-anonymous-tips-justify-police-stop, In a world where police have the green light to swab arrestees  cheeks for DNA and   at least in some cases   test DUI suspects  blood without consent  it might be surprising to learn that courts have any qualms at all about police pulling drivers over based on anonymous tips  But so they do  The Supreme Court has long been suspicious of police searches or seizures based on tips from callers who don t give their names  On Tuesday  the court will revisit that issue for the first time in a decade when it hears a case presenting this question  Can police stop a driver based on nothing more than an anonymous tip that he or she was driving recklessly  The case  Navarette v  California  raises important doctrinal questions about the 4th Amendment  But it also has practical implications in the road rage era  After all  someone willing to shout obscenities at another driver could just as easily call 911 and say that driver is weaving all over the road  That scenario cuts to the heart of Tuesday s case  Can such callers be trusted  More to the point  can they be trusted enough to justify a police stop  Navarette began with a 911 call in California  The caller reported that a silver Ford pickup truck had just run her off the road  The dispatcher relayed that information to police  and officers soon spotted a silver Ford pickup with a license plate matching the one the caller had reported  Officers followed the pickup for a few minutes and didn t see any signs of reckless driving  Nonetheless  they pulled the pickup over  Inside they found two men  Lorenzo and Jose Navarette   along with four large bags of marijuana  The men pled guilty to drug charges  But they also challenged the legality of the police stop  The officers  they argued  did not have reasonable suspicion to pull them over based on nothing more than an anonymous tip of reckless driving  The case is now before the Supreme Court  and   as in so many cases   the outcome boils down to how the court chooses to read one of its earlier decisions  In 2000  in Florida v  J L  the court ruled that police could not stop and search a teenager at a bus stop based only on an anonymous tip that he had a gun  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg  writing for the court  explained that police have to have reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot before they can search a suspect  and an anonymous tip   without more   doesn t amount to reasonable suspicion  Instead  she wrote  police have to corroborate the tip  they have to have reason to think the tip is  reliable in its assertion of illegality  In reaching that result  Justice Ginsburg worried that letting police act based on uncorroborated anonymous tips would make it too easy for grudge holders to use police as their instrument of revenge  The government argued in J L  that firearms are so dangerous that tips about gun possession should automatically justify a search  Ginsburg rejected that argument  explaining   Such an exception would enable any person seeking to harass another to set in motion an intrusive  embarrassing police search of the targeted person simply by placing an anonymous call falsely reporting the target s unlawful carriage of a gun  At the same time  Justice Ginsburg left the door open to exceptions in other cases  She wrote  for example  that  a report of a person carrying a bomb  might be a case where the danger is so great that police can stop and search a suspect based on a pure anonymous tip  In Navarette  the state of California   supported by the Obama administration   is trying to shoehorn reckless driving within Justice Ginsburg s bomb exception  Police should be able to pull drivers over based on anonymous reckless driving tips  the state argues  because reckless driving often means drunk driving  and that presents an immediate danger to the public  The Navarettes  for their part  say this case is just like J L  They say police should be required to corroborate the tip by following the driver and observing reckless driving  And  they point out  Justice Ginsburg s concern about harassment is just as big a problem in this context  What s to stop an angry driver from taking out his rage by calling in a bogus tip   At least one person in virtually every car now on this nation s roadways has a cellular phone  some prepaid and therefore untraceable  they argue   making instant anonymous tips available to almost everyone caught up in road rage  The court will decide the case by June  Whether anonymous tips trump the Fourth Amendment will turn on whether five Justices think reckless driving is uniquely dangerous   and whether they think it would be too much of a burden to make 911 callers give their names  Poll  Can anonymous tips justify a police stop   ,01/20/14 05:00 PM,drugs

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/washingtons-silence-the-racial-wealth-gap, In 1967  with the Civil Rights movement still in full swing and Jim Crow still looming in the rearview mirror  median household income was 43  higher for white  non Hispanic households than for black households  But things changed dramatically over the next half century  as legal segregation faded into history  By 2011  median white household income was 72  higher than median black household income  according to a Census report from that year  PDF  To say that economic inequality is still a heavily racialized phenomenon  even a generation after the end of the Civil Rights era  would be an understatement  Yet both major parties continue to discuss inequality in largely color blind terms  only hinting at the role played by race  The trend is even more startling when one looks at median household wealth instead of yearly income  In 1984  the white to black wealth ratio was 12 to 1  according to Pew Research Center  By 1995  the chasm had narrowed until median white income had only a 5 to 1 advantage over black income  But over the next 14 years the wealth gap began to grow once again  until it had skyrocketed up to 19 to 1 in 2009  Yet even a recent 204 page analysis of the federal War on Poverty  spearheaded by Rep  Paul Ryan  R Wis  gives only passing mentions to racial disparity  In the first section of the report  which purports to explain the causes of modern poverty  Ryan and his co authors bring up race only twice  Once to identify  the breakdown of the familiy as a key cause of poverty within the black community  citing Daniel Patrick Moynihan  and again to applaud the narrowing of the  achievement gap  between white and black schoolchildren  Weeks later  during a radio appearance  Ryan said poverty is in part to blame on the fact that  inner cities  have a culture of  men not working  President Obama went a step forward in December s major address on inequality  when he noted that  the painful legacy of discrimination means that African Americans  Latinos  Native Americans are far more likely to suffer from a lack of opportunity higher unemployment  higher poverty rates  Yet that amounted to a footnote in a speech that also included the line   The opportunity gap in America is now as much about class as it is about race   I think it doesn t make for good politics  said Color of Change executive director Rashad Robinson of the racial wealth gap   It s messy and requires us to be deep and think about much bigger and more long term solutions than Washington s oftentimes willing to deal with  Yet in a serious discussion about American inequality  the subject of race is essentially unavoidable  That s because most of the pipelines to a higher economic class such as employment and homeownership are  oftentimes not equally accessible to black folks  said Robinson  Disparities in homeownership are a major driver of the racial wealth gap  according to a recent study from Brandeis University  According to the authors of the report   redlining  a form of discrimination in banking or insurance practices  discriminatory mortgage lending practices  lack of access to credit  and lower incomes have blocked the homeownership path for African Americans while creating and reinforcing communities segregated by race  Many of the black families that have successfully battled their way to homeownership over the past few decades saw their nest eggs get pulverized by the 2008 financial collapse  The Brandeis researchers found that  half the collective wealth of African American families was stripped away during the Great Recession  in large part due to the collapse of the housing market and the subsequent explosion in the nationwide foreclosure rate  Similarly  employment discrimination has done its part to ensure that black unemployment remains twice as high as white unemployment a ratio that has stayed largely consistent since the mid 1950s  National Bureau of Economy Research fellows have found that resumes are significantly less likely to get a positive response from potential employers if the applicants have names that are more common in the black community  And an arrest for even a non violent drug offense can haunt a job applicant for the rest of his life  combined with the fact that black people are nearly four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than whites  despite using the drug at roughly the same rate  criminal background checks have helped to fuel racial inequity in job hiring  Yet both parties have stressed personal responsibility to an outsized degree  said William Darity Jr  the director of Duke University s Consortium on Social Equity   The underlying narrative that many people share is that whatever inequities still exist  they re due to the misbehavior or disfunctional behavior of black folks themselves  said Darity   So there s no reason to pay attention to racial disparities because one doesn t believe they re still significant  or there s no need for public policy action by the government because it s just a question of black folks changing their own behaviors  Darity portrayed this as a bipartisan problem and criticized President Obama for  playing  into that behavior  by emphasizing personal responsibility in the  My Brother s Keeper  initiative to help young men of color  The conservative notion of a  culture of poverty is another example of the fallacy  he said   I think a lot of people are really attracted to stories about personal uplift or social mobility  but these are very exceptional cases  he said   That s not the norm  Most people who are born into deprived circumstances do not really have the capacity or support to come out of those deprived circumstances  Instead  he argued that the only way to break self perpetuating inequality was through wealth transfers   People s behaviors are largely shaped by the resources they possess  and if their resources alterned  than they might change their behaviors  he said  Poll  What do you think is the primary factor perpetuating the racial wealth gap

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/after-the-shots-ring-out-regrets-and-redempt,  Bam  Bam  Bam  Demetrius Harris remembers hearing just before his legs failed him and he was thrown to the ground   Bam  Bam  More shots rang out   Bam  Bam  Bam  Harris winced and squeezed an imaginary trigger as he reenacted each blast   I tried to run but one of the bullets crashed through the car window and hit my spine  said Harris  a former drug dealer on Chicago s South Side   Something said get up  When I tried to get up my lower half just slumped  Joel Irizarry  a one time gang member on the northwest side  remembers the moment he was shot with just as much clarity  He said he watched his shooter pull out a pistol  raise it and fire a single shot   The bullet went through the backseat and hit me dead in the spine  said Irizarry  who was 17 when he was shot   As soon as it hit me I was instantly paralyzed  Both men were caught in Chicago s violent gun culture when they were wounded  In Cook County Hospital alone  doctors treated more than 1 000 people for gunshot wounds in the last year  Like so many other Chicagoans wounded by gunfire each year  Irizarry and Harris survived  but suffered catastrophic physical injury  Officials in some of the city s hospitals and trauma centers say that while accurate statistics are difficult to come by  they are seeing more patients suffering from spinal cord injuries associated with gun violence  a haunting uptick that seems to be trending with the city s rising homicide rate  They say the rise in such injuries comes after steady declines from the bad old days of the early 1990s when the boon in crack cocaine fueled a record level of shootings and killings  The gnarled spines and shattered limbs are the most direct correlative  aside from the mounting dead  of a city seemingly consumed by relentlessly whizzing bullets and bloodshed  Across Chicago  in hospitals and rehab centers and among a growing  loosely affiliated network of survivors many of whom have been paralyzed by gunfire the physical and emotional remnants of violence are all too present  Disfigurement  disability and  oftentimes  shame   I knew at some point it was going to happen  said Harris  33  who was shot in 2003 and  left paralyzed from the waist down   I knew at some point I was going to go to jail I knew at some point I was probably going to get shot  I just didn t know that when the bullet hit me it would tear my spinal cord up and I would be confined to a chair for the rest of my life  Among this unfortunate club of hobbled survivors  there is a growing camaraderie  Harris and Irizarry are part of an anti violence program called In My Shoes  a peer led curriculum funded by Schwab Rehabilitation Hospital that speaks mostly with youth about the consequences of gang and drug involvement  Peer leaders of In My Shoes say the program is part practicum on how to be independent after suffering a spinal cord injury  and part therapy and rehab group  Mostly  they re a group of cautionary storytellers  The program s staff is made up almost entirely of people who have been paralyzed as a result of gun violence   Seeing a young person get shot and end up with a disability  that to me is one of the most heart wrenching things  because a lot of times they are so young  12  13  14 years old  said Irizarry   These are babies  They haven t begun to live yet  And now they have to live the rest of their life with a disability is very  very disheartening  But we let them know that life isn t over  Victims of our own circumstance On a recent afternoon Harris and Irizarry rolled their wheelchairs down the corridors of Schwab  on Chicago s West Side  chatting with passersby and trading smiles and handshakes with random staff who whisked through the center s main lobby  Far from their former street life  they spend countless hours in hospitals regaling those who will listen with their war stories  They talk in painful detail of the burn of a bullet cutting through their flesh  and the moment they realized that they would never walk again  But they also talk about the role they played in their own  tragic misfortune   At the end of the day we re all victims victims of our own circumstances  Irizarry said   A lot of times young people only hear about death or jail  They don t hear about the disability  They don t know that this  he said motioning to the wheelchair he was sitting in   is an option  When someone is newly injured there is also grief  denial  regret and figuring out how to navigate the physical space around them while in a hulking wheelchair under unsteady hands  The group pairs those who were shot with mentors with similar disabilities  They set personal goals  Help people get back into school  They teach them how to plan out their every trip outside of home  Schools and buildings without wheelchair ramps and un shoveled sidewalks are the bane of a wheelchair bound person s life  especially during the brutal Chicago winters  Irizarry and Harris say  With equal parts clarity and candor  Irizarry and Harris drum up the ghosts of their pasts and the violent episodes that led to their injuries   Being a gangster isn t something that you do  It s a result of what happens to you  Harris said   Nobody wakes up at eight and says I m  going to be a gangster   You react to the lifestyle that you re put in and the situations that mold you and it makes you hard  and it makes you cold  it makes you callous and have no compassion  The night that Harris was shot  he says his killer squeezed off as many as eight shots before his gun jammed  As he lay there  he said he turned to look his killer in the face  but instead saw his legs kicking uncontrollably even though he couldn t feel a thing from his waist to his toes   I know I m not crippled  he pleaded to himself   I know I m not paralyzed  Long before those first shots rang out  Harris said he had a bad feeling about how the night might end  It was about 8 p m  on a spring evening in 2003  and Harris  who said he d traded education and legal jobs for a hustler s life  set out on his neighborhood s main strip to make a couple dollars selling drugs  Harris said he had a bad feeling about going out that night  but the prospect of getting paid clouded his instincts  Earlier in the day there was an informal meeting with his crew  And one of its leaders warned everyone to stay off the block that night  that there d been too much shooting and too much attention from the police  Harris said he saw the warning as an opportunity  if the entire clique was staying low key  that meant more customers and more money for him   He kept saying  I got a real bad feeling  Harris recalled   While he s telling us all this as a group  I m sitting there thinking that if he wants everybody to stay in the house  I d be able to make a killing  a bigger profit  Later that night  Harris hit the strip and almost immediately ran into a local flower peddler known in the neighborhood as  Flower Man  standing in the doorway of a bar  He was looking to buy some marijuana and crack cocaine  The weed Harris had on him  The crack was in his car  which was parked down the block  After handing Flower Man the weed  he made his way down the street to his car to retrieve the cocaine  He reached for the car door handle then heard gunfire  The impact of the bullets tossed him to the ground  Harris said he turned to look at his legs and they were still kicking   I couldn t stop them  Harris said  He tried to get up  but couldn t  Harris suffered a gunshot wound to his T7 vertebra  A nurse would later break the news to his family that he d never walk again   They were in denial for a long time  he said  Some of them still are  But Harris isn t   When you 13 and 14 you might convince yourself that you Superman  but when you 23 and you ve been to over 20 funerals you don t believe in Superman or bulletproof  Harris said  Harris said he has buried at least 10 close friends killed by gun violence in the 10 years since he was paralyzed  He rattled off a list of names  Gary Pinex  Keith Daniels  Rally Prichard  Paris Mercer  All dead   I m just lucky to be alive  I ve seen people way tougher than me  way stronger than me  lying dead in the streets  Harris said   I ve seen death  I ve lost count of how many times I ve seen death  Gang Banging at 15 By the time Irizarry was in his mid teens he was living a double life  At home he was a protective big brother and a loving son to his single mother  But in the streets of his West Humboldt Park neighborhood  he was something else entirely   I started gang banging at an early age  about 15  Irizarry said   I couldn t get to school  I couldn t get to work or go the local grocery store without being chased  harassed  beat up  There s only so much you can take of being a victim  I felt my only option is to join this gang and get this little protection that they claim to give you  For Irizarry  then a tall  skinny kid all of  135 pounds soaking wet  the odds of surviving on his own weren t worth taking  One gang controlled his high school  Another controlled his neighborhood  Shooting and fighting were everyday occurrences  But even as he became a more active  combative member of his gang and started selling drugs to  keep some money in my pocket  the two realities he was living were becoming starker  His mother and father had separated  so he was the man of the house  He did his best to keep his little brother and sister in line while his mother worked long hours at a local retailer  Irizarry said he even managed to keep up decent grades in high school  and as the end of his senior year approached he was excited about becoming the first in his family to earn a high school diploma  Then  on a sunny afternoon in the Spring of 1998  it all came to an end   He pulled out a pistol and shot just once  Irizarry said  Irizarry said he was targeted by a rival gang member who d seen him pull up to a neighborhood park  along with a friend whom he d had beef with from an earlier fight  First he threw bottles and bricks  Then  as Irizarry peeled away from the park  the young man whipped out a gun and fired  The bullet crashed through the back of the car and directly into Irizarry s spine  He knew immediately that he d been hit  Unable to move his legs  he said his foot smashed down on the accelerator  sending his car careening down the street  He finally managed to throw the car into neutral to slow it down  at which point his  so called friend  and fellow gang member hopped out of the car and left Irizarry  his younger brother and a cousin in the car to fend for themselves   He left me for dead  Irizarry said   I kept praying  asking God not to let me die like this  Days later at the hospital he asked a doctor   When am I going to walk out of this hospital   You re never going to walk again  the doctor told him   Instantly my world was shattered  Irizarry said   There were a lot of nights waking up and hoping that this was a nightmare  only to wake up and see a wheelchair parked next to my bed  When Irizarry finally made it back home from the hospital he experienced a mix of emotions  There was excitement to be finally leaving the hospital  frustration with his disability and fear of more violence  His shooter was a member of a rival gang in the neighborhood  Anything could happen  he thought  This time he d be a sitting duck   What we re confronting with the violently acquired injury  they re going home to where they were shot  said Dr  Michelle Gittler  a physiatrist and expert on violently acquired spinal cord injuries at Schwab   They are going right back to that community where their injuries occurred and that s one of the hardest issues  After the initial shock wore off  Irizarry made immediate plans to change his life  He distanced himself from his old gang  And his family uprooted to a nearby suburb  But the impact of his injury rippled through his family  He could no longer help out financially because he could no longer work  The  400 or so he received each month in Social Security Income did little to help buoy his families expenses  And he could no longer keep his younger siblings in check   My mom  having to see me in this situation and trying not to cry every day  it hurt  Irizarry said   Even though I was the oldest I was her baby  She was there when I first started to walk  and now I d never walk again  But his injury did something no nudging before it could ve done  he was off the streets  He went back to school and began to realize  in part through his rehab work at Schwab  that life was not over  After doing his rehab at the hospital he eventually was hired as a peer mentor with In My Shoes  One of the truest signs that he d moved on  he said  was when he came face to face with someone from the same gang that had shot him  The rival wasn t menacing this go round  He wasn t chasing him or pointing a pistol in his direction  This time  they were on the same team  He was from the neighborhood and was found shot one evening behind Irizarry s father s barbershop  The rumor was that his own gang had turned on him  The man was paralyzed from the waist down and seemed as affected mentally as he was physically  He was anxious and paranoid  He d been holed up in his home and refused to go out in public or take public transportation   He was always worried about who was around  that someone was always going to try to kill him  Irizarry said  But almost every day Irizarry called the guy or they d meet up to talk  Soon  Irizarry coaxed him into riding public transportation and then  back onto the social scene  The two developed a friendship and a bond  Eventually Irizarry landed him a job fixing wheelchairs at Schwab rehab   That other stuff to me was in the past  Irizarry said  noting though that he rarely shares his former gang affiliation   It could still be dangerous in certain neighborhoods  To this day  wounded gang members are rolled into Schwab  their tough exteriors softened by their disabilities  And Irizarry  Harris and the rest of the team initiate them into this new club  Some change their ways  Some don t  Harris and Irizarry say   Some people have been doing it so long it s hard for them to break out of it  Harris said   Some say they want a way out  others say they can t find a way out  But for us  after everything we lost  whatever we were going to get out of it wasn t going to be worth what we ve already lost  Some people have been doing this so long and are afraid of change  They just fall back to what they know  Previously in msnbc s ongoing look at Chicago gun violence

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/political-fight-over-marijuana-opens-new-bipa, Amid last week s brouhaha over Mitt Romney s tax returns  staunch conservative Tom Tancredo endorsed the legalization of marijuana in Colorado  Tancredo s support for Amendment 64  a proposed state constitutional amendment to regulate the drug much like alcohol  came as a surprise to many given his boisterous reputation as a longtime Republican lawmaker  Yet  his departure from GOP orthodoxy is hardly unique  He joins a growing list of prominent Republicans who support ending the drug war  including libertarians Ron Paul and former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson  and even conservative evangelical Pat Robertson  In writing of his support for Amendment 64  Tancredo said   I am endorsing Amendment 64 not despite my conservative beliefs  but because of them   Meanwhile  support for Amendment 64 is up by 11 points  according to a recent poll by Survey USA and The Denver Post  As schisms form within the Republican Party on various social issues  including marijuana and gay marriage  Democrats must be willing to reach out to the disaffected and moderates to build coalitions around ballot initiatives and non conventional candidates  These coalitions can lay the groundwork for electing preferential  if not ideologically pure  Democratic candidates in conventionally Republican parts of the country  This isn t to say that former congressman Tancredo or Johnson are going to be running for office as Democrats any time soon  They won t  But the people who support these men aren t necessarily going to be the conventional GOP rank and file voters that the national party would like them to be  The widely circulated  GOP purity test  from 2009 that would have barred moderate  and even conservative  Republican candidates from receiving funding and would have disqualified Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W  Bush was one of the many signs of the collapsing of  Big Tent  thinking from the right  The issue of marijuana legalization  however  might be the match that sets the entire tent ablaze  There are few issues that pitch hard right social conservatives against their socially moderate to liberal libertarian counterparts in such clear terms  It is hard to find a self identified libertarian who today supports the continued prohibition of marijuana  For libertarians  the issue is a principled one  do we trust informed citizens to govern their own lives and claim responsibility for their decisions  or do we cede that decision making power to government  The drug war may not be the most prescient issue for libertarian voters  but I can think of few others that highlight the philosophical conflict between these two wings of the Republican Party in such concise terms  As the GOP grapples with these questions  it is critical that Democratic politicians and activists reach out to those who will be disillusioned by the response they receive from their one time Republican compatriots  They will have different values  different ideas  and different policy positions  They will also represent one of the best opportunities our generation will see in advancing some of the most important causes of our time  Working across somewhat unconventional aisles in Colorado  Washington  and Oregon should be only the beginning  We have to be ready to work with those who want out even and especially if we don t see eye to eye on every single issue  While we cannot and should not gloss over the real ideological differences that do exist  those of us on the left would do well to understand the opportunity in front of us  Zach Wahls is a sixth generation Iowan  author of My Two Moms  Lessons of Love  Strength and What Makes a Family  Green Bay Packers fan and a commentator on LGBT and youth issues  He lives in Iowa City  Iowa  ,09/27/12 06:57 PM,drugs
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/geoffrey-cowley-answered-your-obamacare-questions, Geoffrey Cowley  national health reporter for msnbc  answered your Obamacare questions  We took questions from both msnbc com and Facebook Check out Geoff s responses below  Reader questions were edited for typos and remain in their original format  Gloria Gevirtz What will happen with the ACA if the next president is a Republican  Geoffrey Cowley  If the GOP wins the White House and both houses of Congress  unlikely  we ll no doubt see new efforts to scale back the health care law  But it s hard to imagine lawmakers repealing the Affordable Care Act in 2017  By then  according to the Congressional Budget Office  25 million previously uninsured people will have gained coverage  The CBO projects that 24 million Americans will buy their insurance through the exchanges in 2017  and 12 million will benefit from the Medicaid expansion  Politically  taking health care away from 36 million people would be a hard sell   DWAT8002 I currently do not have healthcare coverage  I just started a new job that offers healthcare benefits  but I will not be able to sign up until April 1  Since the deadline to sign up for health insurance and avoid the tax penalty is March 31  will I have to pay the penalty fee even though I will have coverage on April 1  Geoffrey Cowley  No one who enrolls in a health plan by March 31 will face any penalties this year  even if the coverage takes a while to kick in  By waiting until April 1 to enroll  you would cross the three month threshold and incur a penalty for the part of the year you spent uninsured  details here  The penalty for going uninsured all year is  95  or 1  of your income if you make more than  95 000  The baseline fine for three uninsured months would be a fourth of that amount  or  23 75  If you want to save the money  maybe your employer will move up your start date by a day  Ademocrat My husband and I rarely have need for doctors but because he is self employed and makes an average of  150k  we will have to pay over  500 per month for  affordable  health coverage with a large deductible to boot  Yes  we can afford the cost  but why should we pay for something we have no need of  We paid so much less for the few times we did need a doctor as self pay patients  Please explain to me what is  affordable  for those of us that would rather keep our money instead of lining the pockets of these insurance monsters  Geoffrey Cowley  There s a difference between not needing something and not needing it at this moment  We require drivers to insure themselves because some will have accidents and the costs they can t cover will fall upon others  The argument for mandatory health coverage follows the same logic  Self pay may work well while you re healthy  but few of us could pay cash for the care we would receive when mortally injured or seriously ill  Since we re all likely to require serious care at some point  we owe it to each other to pay our share of the cost  Conservatives used to champion that idea  but something has eroded their sense of shared responsibility  As for affordability  health care is expensive and often wasteful  The health care law includes many provisions to make it more efficient and to help people who truly can t afford it  Fortunately for those who can afford coverage  health care costs are now rising more slowly than they have in decades  Tom Kruse via Facebook Dental health is health  Why wasn t dental insurance included in ACA  Geoffrey Cowley The health care law treats dental care as an essential health benefit for children and youth less than 19 years old  Any health plan offered to that age group will include dental coverage  but Obamacare makes dental coverage optional in adult health plans  Some offer it  some don t  and consumers can choose the level of coverage they want  There s no tax penalty for skipping dental coverage  but you re right that it s worth having  Untreated cavities and gum disease can foster everything from pregnancy complications to heart disease  KaitlynK For unknown reasons  many doctors are not accepting ACA exchange insurances  If this trend continues  can t the government compel physicians to accept these insurances so that Americans can continue to have access to affordable care  Geoffrey Cowley Doctors can refuse any form of payment they don t like  Many refuse Medicaid because of its traditionally low reimbursement rates  and some refuse all insurance to avoid being second guessed by claims adjusters  It s hard to imagine any doctor caring whether a patient s health plan was purchased through an insurance exchange  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act  those policies provide the same coverage as the policies people get through their jobs   LLeno22 My 88 year old mother has Medicare through her former employer  the state of Michigan  where she retired as a teacher 30 years ago  The prescription coverage thru Catamaran is horrible  only allowing for old generic meds which have not helped her issues with diabetes and neuropathy and they offer no therapeutic meds for dementia  Can the ACA help my mother or supplement her prescription coverage  Geoffrey Cowley It sounds like your mom is using Medicare Part D  the prescription drug plan that President George W  Bush signed into law in 2005  The program is administered by private insurers  through Medigap or Medicare Advantage plans  Different insurers charge different premiums and cover different collections of drugs  so you should shop around for the right plan  Medicare has an online plan finder you may find helpful  Under federal law  all Medicare Part D plans must provide a minimum level of coverage  The law also limits the deductibles and copays insurers can impose  This year s maximum deductible will be  310  down from  325 in 2013  and copays will be capped at  2 850  down from  2 970  in 2013  The Affordable Care Act doesn t restructure Medicare Part D  but it does close a big gap in coverage  Because of a quirk in the 2005 law  Part D benefits fall off sharply after a subscriber s total drug bills reach a certain threshold  2 970 last year  and resume only after the subscriber crosses a  catastrophic  threshold  4 750 last year  For more details on this  doughnut hole  see this fact sheet from the AARP  The Affordable Care Act is slowly closing the hole  both by shifting its boundaries  to  2 850 and  4 550 this year  and by helping people pay for their medications while they pass through it  Last year  between federal subsidies and drug company discounts  people in the doughnut hole paid 48  of the retail price for brand name drugs and 79  of retail for cheaper generics  Obamacare ensures that by 2020  no one in the gap will pay more than 25  of a drug s retail price  AltaAndy sent via email In your recent article on Arkansas  approach to Medicaid expansion  A red state breakthrough on health care reform  you mention a graduate student who  earns too little to qualify for a discount on private health insurance  I don t get that  Are you saying he has to earn MORE to qualify for help  Geoffrey Cowley Yes  it s strange but true  Here s the back story  As signed into law four years ago  the Affordable Care Act extended Medicaid coverage to everyone living below 138  of the federal poverty level  roughly  16 100 a year for a single adult and it used tax credits to help people with moderate incomes buy private insurance through the new health insurance exchanges Those subsidies are available to anyone earning 100  to 400  of the federal poverty wage  11 670 to  46 680 for a single adult  Just about everyone would have been covered if that formula had stuck  But two years ago  the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out of the Medicaid expansion  and 23 of them have done just that  If Arkansas had turned down its Medicaid expansion funds  that grad student would be out of luck  His  9 000 a year internship would make him too rich for traditional Medicaid  he would have to earn less than  2 000 a year to qualify for that  But his  9 000 salary would make him too poor for a marketplace subsidy  Some 5 million low income people have fallen into that coverage gap in the Medicaid refusal states  Congress could fill the gap by lowering the floor for marketplace subsidies  but no one expects that to happen as long as the GOP controls the House of Representatives  SocialmedicToo I would like to know why crippling student loan debt is not taken into account when figuring how much a person is able to pay  Student loan debt payments are not exactly optional or dischargeable through bankruptcy and do rob the individual of discretionary income  Geoffrey Cowley Means testing is generally based on your income and assets  not your obligations  Without that distinction  anyone even the rich could qualify for benefits by loading up on debt  People living on fixed assets sometimes opt into Medicaid by paying down debts until they they re poor enough to pass the means test  As you point out  the monthly payment on a student loan can have the same effect  Unfortunately  social programs just aren t set up to take that into account  Here s the upside  The ACA subsidizes health coverage for anyone earning between 100  and 400  of the federal poverty wage  11 490 to  45 960 for an individual  and the biggest subsidies go to those with the lowest incomes  If a student loan payment is taking a significant chunk out of your paycheck  chances are you fall into that range  To learn more  check out this primer on eligibility and this guide to checking your own status   cjkid1964 Section 18115 of the Affordable Care Act is titled  Freedom not to participate in Federal health insurance programs  Can you tell me more about this  Geoffrey Cowley Sure  this section simply tells insurers that they don t have to sell their plans through the exchanges or take part in other Obamacare programs  Here s the full text  No individual  company  business  nonprofit entity  or health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall be required to participate in any Federal health insurance program created under this Act  or any amendments made by this Act  or in any Federal health insurance program expanded by this Act  or any such amendments  and there shall be no penalty or fine imposed upon any such issuer for choosing not to participate in such programs  Mathies Gorm Jensen As the ACA goes forward and becomes  as Mr  Boehner has called it  the law of the land  my question concerns the projects that individual states will start running in 2017  Do you feel these may lead to more states running single payer systems if  for instance  Vermont is successful  We have seen how other states are jumping in on legal marijuana after Colorado was successful with it  Do you feel a similar parallel could be drawn to health care  Thank you  Geoffrey Cowley I suspect legal weed will prove more popular than single payer health care  at least in the short term  But yes  states are exploring a lot of interesting variations on Obamacare  So far  only 10 have embraced all three of the law s main provisions  state run exchanges  and Medicaid expansion and insurance industry reforms  But nearly all states have embraced parts of the law and several are using Obamacare funds to pursue novel approaches to health care reform  Arkansas and Vermont are both good examples  Last year  the feds approved Arkansas  bid to spend its Medicaid expansion funds on commercial insurance policies rather than government benefits  As a result  nearly 100 000 poor Arkansans now enjoy the same coverage as other private consumers  and 150 000 are still eligible  Vermont is pursuing the opposite tack hoping to pool private  state and federal resources to create its own single payer system  To succeed  the state would have to reallocate all of its federal health funds  not just those earmarked for Medicaid expansion  The feds can t legally approve that request before 2017  and some experts even those who favor a single payer solution doubt the experiment will work at the state level  But all of these experiments will hold valuable lessons for the rest of the country  And like Romneycare  the successful ones are likely to spread  Fred Orth What is going to happen to medical facilities in states that do not accept Medicaid expansion  I understand that federal payments will be reduced to reflect the compensation they would have received if their states had expanded coverage  What will the ensuing cost shift mean to charges for those insured outside of ACA  Geoffrey Cowley Hospitals could suffer huge losses in states that refuse to expand Medicaid  because they re the provider of last resort for people who lack health insurance  Under a 1986 law called EMTALA  hospitals that receive federal funding have to attend to dangerously sick or injured patients regardless of their ability to pay  Hospitals have traditionally recouped their losses from  uncompensated care  by shifting the cost onto paying patients and by drawing on a federal account called DSH  which provides partial reimbursement  It s more efficient to give people routine care than to rescue them from medical crises  so the Affordable Care Act moves money out of the DSH program and uses it to help states expand their Medicaid programs  In states that refuse to expand Medicaid  uninsured people will continue to rack up unpaid hospital bills  but the hospitals will stop getting DSH payments from the feds  That s one reason the hospital industry is pleading with recalcitrant states  e g  Florida  Georgia and Texas  to stop boycotting the Medicaid expansion    ,02/21/14 10:58 AM,drugs

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/marijuana-legalization-elites, Colorado rang in 2014 by becoming the first state to sell marijuana to its residents for recreational use  Along with Washington  Colorado legalized recreational marijuana use by state referendum in the 2012 election  Despite the fact that marijuana use is still illegal under federal law  the feds have decided to allow these two states to experiment with legalized marijuana as long as they follow certain guidelines  Along with the usual barrage of tired stoner jokes  there has been some handwringing over the possible consequences of legalized pot use  Among them  the potential health risks  the possibility of more marijuana users  and  in particular  increased use among children  But rarely do those concerned about the consequences of legalized marijuana confront the consequences of our current marijuana prohibition regime  under which some groups of Americans are swiftly labeled criminals and set on a path of being marginalized by society for what the elite and well off usually end up recalling as foolish but ultimately harmless experimentiation with drugs  Consider that at least the last three American presidents  Bill Clinton  George W  Bush  and Barack Obama  have all more or less admitted to smoking weed  Bush s former budget director and former Indiana Gov  Mitch Daniels  was arrested for possession of marijuana and other drugs while a student at Princeton  On Friday  two major newspaper columnists  Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post and David Brooks of the New York Times  admitted to using marijuana  Yet just as all three of the above presidents presided over a criminal justice system that imposes harsh punishments for marijuana use  Marcus and Brooks argue against Colorado and Washington s marijuana initiatives  on the basis that marijuana is bad for you  The real question with marijuana legalization  however  is not whether it s not healthy to consume  but whether our current system of prohibition makes things worse  Excessive consumption of alcohol is not healthy  either  but after more than a decade of banning alcohol  Americans decided the collateral consequences of prohibition were far worse than the consequences of letting people have a drink  Presumably  Brooks and Marcus don t think of themselves as criminals who should have gone to jail for their drug use  any more than our three past presidents  Marcus all but acknowledges as much  saying that  t hrowing people in jail for smoking pot is dumb and wasteful  But that s what marijuana being illegal means in most states and under federal law  It means people go to jail   It almost never means  however  that people like Brooks and Marcus go to jail  Anyone who wants to see what a de facto legalization environment looks like can visit an elite college campus  where both the trade and use of marijuana are highly visible  and where those who get caught face the relatively minor sanctions associated with breaking campus rules rather than the lifelong consequences of breaking the law  What we basically have now is a system where marijuana is practically legal for the wealthy and white and illegal for everyone else  Although marijuana use among blacks and whites is about the same  according to a 2013 report by the ACLU  blacks are almost four times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession  This startling graph from the report tells the story  According to the report  there were more than 8 million marijuana related arrests between 2001 and 2010  almost 90  of which were for possession  Marijuana arrests now make up more than half of all drug arrests in the country  And use of the drug has only increased over time  As Michelle Alexander notes in her book  The New Jim Crow  the consequences of being convicted of felony marijuana possession can be far more dire than the sentence itself  Former offenders can find themselves deprived of professional or driver s licenses  educational aid  food stamps  public housing  their right to vote  and they may find themselves fired and unable to find new employment  having been marked by society as little more than a criminal  For blacks caught up in the system it can compound the already considerable effects of ongoing racial discrimination  Yet with their own acknowledged marijuana use our current and former presidents  as well as our well respected newspaper columnists  are implicitly acknowledging that mere marijuana use does not make you a criminal who should be driven from society and made a pariah  it does not consign you to fate as an addlepated dunce or violent sociopath incapable of holding a job or raising a family  Would that the worst consequence for marijuana use was something resembling Brooks  recollection of a botched attempt to deliver a presentation in English class while stoned  Legalization means that other people  not just elites and their children  can have the opportunity to shrug off past drug use as a youthful dalliance rather than a life sentence  There are degrees of decriminalization between marijuana prohibition and legalization and people can argue how far the government should go  What s clear is that under the current system  the wealthy and connected are almost entirely shielded from the consequences of marijuana being illegal  while the poor and non white face catastrophe for engaging in the same behavior  Brooks writes that legalizing marijuana means  nurturing a moral ecology in which it is a bit harder to be the sort of person most of us want to be  The current system already can make it not a bit harder  but insurmountably hard to become the sort of person most of us want to be  But not for Brooks or Marcus  not for any of our recent presidents  and probably not for their children  Poll  Legalize it  Close video       The Cycle  1 3 14  4 23 PM ET       Not everyone is stoked about legal pot       Two days after the sale of marijuana became legal in Colorado  the law is already facing heavy criticism on multiple fronts  The Cycle panel discusses    facebook twitter embed like save share group

 a historic black neighborhood at the heart of this Florida town  Passersby honked as he strode passed shuttered storefronts and dive bars  Eyes rolled as he made his way by a barbecue joint and a tattered old pool hall  Older women offered smiles while much younger ones turned away   I m praying for you  one woman yelled out  Smith took the job as top cop just over two months ago after the

issue  he urged residents and shopkeepers   pick up the phone and call me  Smith s good will tour down one of the toughest streets in town is meant to allay long simmering tensions felt between the

front of Goldsboro Food Mart  Photo by Wayne Lawrence Institute for msnbc The boulevard is a crumbling shell lined with shuttered storefronts and dimly lit mom and pop shops with sparsely stocked shelves  At night  gunfire is common  neighbors say  And the police routinely sweep through to disperse the crowds of young people that pool on street corners and in vacant lots  It is along this road

is here where Sanford s black community will wait together for the verdict  Police initially declined to arrest George Zimmerman who claimed he shot the teen in self defense  Zimmerman is on trial in Sanford for second degree murder and has pleaded not guilty  Prosecutors say that Zimmerman profiled  followed and then killed Martin on Feb  26  2012  as Martin made his way through the neighborhood where his father s girlfriend lived  The shooting did not take place in Goldsboro but in a gated community a few miles away  Still  it highlighted a broad gulf between law enforcement and black residents that has widened through the years  Martin s killing and the lack of an immediate arrest conjured up memories for Goldsboro of a shooting that took place two years earlier  In that case  police shot and killed Eugene Scott  a black resident who had been jailed for armed robbery and was a fugitive on other charges  The shooting took place in a grocery store parking lot while police were attempting to arrest him  Scott was shot in the back  The officer who opened fire said he did so after Scott tried to run over his partner  The officer was cleared by law enforcement officials of wrong doing  but many in the black community remained unsatisfied with the findings  Mary Fudge in the passenger seat  on 13th Street  June  2013  Photo by Wayne Lawrence Institute for msnbc Along 13th Street  residents are following Zimmerman s trial closely from local bars and over games of dominoes  Some say that what hinges on the outcome of the case is what blacks here have been owed far too long  justice   People are trying to use this case to move us forward  said Pastor Valarie Houston  whose church is on the corner of Olive Avenue and 13th Street   For this community  she said  the trial brings  an opportunity for a spiritual awakening as well as a sense of hope and empowerment  A hard pill to swallow On most afternoons  older men take refuge from the biting sun under the palm and willow trees where South Pomegranate Ave  meets W  13th Street  Many of them spent years laboring in the region s citrus groves and celery fields but now commune over cold beer and boisterous games of dominoes  Their leisure time is equal parts fellowship and an informal people s court where they pass judgment on everyone from local politicians to neighborhood ne er do wells  They trade stories of run ins with white supervisors and the police  More recently the often raucous deliberations have been about Zimmerman s trial   I ll tell you this much  If he s found innocent there s going to be an uprising  said Cecil Nelson   There s going to be trouble  The collective of men let out a chorus of mm hmms above the clack clack of dominoes hitting tabletops   I had a 17 year old

Elijah Williams  L  and Horace Cain  R  a lifelong resident of Goldsboro  joined a group of men under the shade of palm trees just off 13th Street on a recent afternoon to drink beer and play dominoes  Cain lamented the death of Trayvon Martin and the long history of racial strife in Sanford   Photo by Wayne Lawrence Institute for msnbc Nelson  Cain and most of the others here remember childhoods with segregated public spaces  Most said they still don t feel comfortable going downtown  where nearly all of the businesses are white owned and patronized by white residents  The history of racial strife runs deep in Sanford  founded in 1870 by Henry Shelton Sanford  an American diplomat who served in the Congo  He later argued that the country would be better off if blacks were returned to Africa  according to historian Adam Hochschild in his seminal work  King Leopold s Ghost  In 1946 Sanford s police chief famously forced Jackie Robinson out of a minor league baseball game  refusing to let him integrate the exhibition   The Robinsons were run out of Sanford  Fla  with threats of violence  Robinson s daughter  Sharon Robinson  later wrote  In 1997 the city apologized for its treatment of Robinson  During the Civil Rights era  city leaders cemented over Sanford s lone public pool rather than allow black children to swim in it  While that time has long passed  the town remains largely segregated with the majority of blacks living in neighborhoods such as Goldsboro  About 30  of the city s 54 000 residents are black and 57  are white  according to the latest Census  Much of Sanford is the stuff of post cards  with red bricked streets downtown and a picturesque waterfront  Crooked oak and willow trees hunch over lazy roads  Further away from downtown are the fruits of Sanford s more recent sprawl  with newer developments similar to the gated community where Martin was killed  While the city has pumped millions into new projects and redeveloping its waterfront  there s been little investment in Goldsboro  Many of the streets don t have sidewalks  the sewer system is in disrepair and the closure of several public housing complexes has left acres of land pocked with shuttered cinderblock apartments and many residents displaced   I don t see how we as leaders could talk about developing Sanford to its fullest potential if you don t address the needs in the depressed areas  Velma Williams  the city s lone black commissioner  told msnbc  It s rough out there Juwann McCall  16  stands on the corner of Oleander Ave  and 13th Street on a recent

For months leading up to Martin s death  residents said there had been shootings between rival groups in the neighborhood  But Martin s death seemed to affect them in a different way  Martin s killer wasn t black  Zimmerman is of white and Hispanic descent  The deaths of other black men had not led to protests in Goldsboro but McCall joined the neighborhood rallies that followed Martin s killing  He would stand along busy streets with a pack of Skittles  like the one s Martin carried that night  holding a sign that read  Honk For Justice  A slow trickle of young men walked by and offered head nods or shouts from across the street  McCall threw up a hand or shouted back   Every day I worry  he said   So  just think like  just pray and everything should be okay but like it s a lot of crazy stuff going on around here and stuff so  I just try to stay out the mix  From her little church on the corner of Olive Avenue and 13th Street  Houston says she has witnessed the best and worst of

served as a police post mulled her community s long struggles   Seems like every so often  this race thing kicks its head up again  said Oliver  whose golden dreadlocks flowed over her shoulders and halfway down her back  Indeed  the long running racial fissure in the city of Sanford goes back more than 100 years  Goldsboro was the second town in Florida to be incorporated by blacks after Eatonville  ushered into literary history by author Zora Neal Hurston s  Their Eyes Were Watching God  Hurston lived in Goldsboro for a time and her father  John Hurston  was pastor of a local Baptist church  In 1911 Sanford expanded and stripped Goldsboro of its charter  absorbing the city into Sanford proper  Goldsboro s institutions were dismantled  including the post office  the jail and many of the black owned businesses  Streets named for Goldsboro s black founding fathers were changed to numbers instead  In more recent years there had been efforts to mend old wounds with proclamations  In 2012  a stretch of 13th Street was renamed Historic Goldsboro Blvd  in honor of the neighborhood s rich history   There were barber shops  beauty shops  restaurants  stores  even supermarkets  Oliver said of 13th Street s past  Most of those establishments have long since gone  But images of Goldsboro s past live on within the museum s walls  One photo captures William Clark  a town founder  atop his prized mule  A replica of an old barber shop that stood on 13th Street for generations is prominently on display  Century old court records document the debt Goldsboro was owed by Sanford when it was taken over in 1911  The total   10 375 80 for property and other stipulations   The Jim Crow part of Sanford is gone  Francis Oliver said   But you still gotta deal with part of segregation  As you can see  Goldsboro looks like the stepchild of Sanford  Sanford Police Chief Cecil Smith talks with a group of residents on 13th Street  which runs through the heart of Goldsboro

 More than one young man was seen with a marijuana blunt behind his ear  Many here complained that police harassment has worsened since Martin s killing   It s like they used that as an excuse to apply more pressure to the community  not help us  but to hurt us even more  said Derwin Slayton  Brenda Hartsfield  a nurse at the county jail and owner of the Goldsboro Food Mart  said that she has filed numerous complaints about the treatment of her customers by the police   I m their voice  When things happen to them  the first thing they do is they come to me  Hartsfield said   The police basically done put like a chokehold on the neighborhood  As Hartsfield and a small crowd ran down a laundry list of complaints against the police  including allegations of overzealous enforcement of loitering and open container laws  the police chief strode down the block and into the gaggle  Goldsboro residents  Trevose  Tru Tree  Scott  L  and Tony  R  on 12th Street in Goldsboro  June 2013

other problems  His officers  he said  are there  making sure that the streets are safe  making sure that people can get up and down the sidewalks  that people in the middle of the night at 2 o clock in the morning can get up and down the street  We don t want to keep people from having a good time  But there is a time and a place  Smith believes that the anger and tensions that roiled after Martin s death could have been avoided had police brass had better communication with the black community  In the wake of the shooting  then Police Chief Bill Lee publicly defended the decision not to arrest Zimmerman  He cited the state s controversial Stand Your Ground Laws and said he was legally barred from arresting Zimmerman given the lack of evidence to counter his self defense claims  Zimmerman was arrested 44 days after the killing and only after a special prosecutor was assigned to the case  Chief Lee was later fired   I m black from Chicago  coming in to a highly inflamed community  Smith said  standing outside the Food Mart   It took 50 years for people to feel the way they do now  It s going to take another 50 years to try to get people to change their mindset  It may not even happen in all of this generation  But for me  if I have the ability to change ten people s attitudes  that s a step  Smith said part of bridging the gap between the police and the people are weeding out bad apples in the department  He has fired one officer for using a racial slur on Facebook  and said others are being investigated for similar racial incidents  The fired officer  Vanessa Knode  conceded to internal affairs investigators that she used the  n word  in a Facebook post  But she told investigators that the epithet was aimed at her white husband and that she saw it as synonymous with  bro  or  these guys  Standing back to survey the scene on 13th Street one recent evening  Smith seemed satisfied with the discourse his random appearance had sparked   I could send the dogs in here and chase everybody away  or I can come in here and try to talk to people  Smith said  Wayne Lawrence contributed reporting to this article  Goldsboro is a neighborhood literally on

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/holder-snowden-plea-deal, Attorney General Eric Holder addressed the indictment of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell for the first time Thursday and vigorously defended the pursuit of political corruption cases more broadly  In an exclusive interview with msnbc  Holder also said the Justice Department would be open to plea negotiations with Edward Snowden    McDonnell and his wife Maureen were charged in federal court Tuesday for allegedly taking tens of thousands of dollars worth of gifts from a supporter who sought help from the state government  McDonnell has said he is being wrongly accused and his legal team argued that he engaged in  routine politics   The notion that public officials trade their office for their own personal gain  said Holder   is something that s inconsistent with good government  Stressing that he was speaking about corruption in general  Holder added   People who are in these positions have the public trust  they have great benefits that go with them in these positions  and they should be held  I think  to the highest standard  Some of the gifts the McDonnell s accepted included a  6 500 Rolex watch   10 000 worth of Oscar de la Renta clothing and  15 000 for his daughter s wedding expenses   I think the indictment lays out in pretty specific detail our theory of the case   ultimately a jury will decide  Holder said    Holder is a close friend of President Obama and has served as attorney general since 2009  He has devoted a significant part of his career to the Justice Department  where he spent years prosecuting political corruption cases for the public integrity section   We brought cases all the time where public officials received money  got gifts in exchange for official action   that is classic corruption  he said   Those are the kinds of cases that we traditionally bring  Holder spoke in Roanoke  Virginia  where he was visiting a federal veterans  court  part of the Justice Department s focus on prioritizing rehabilitation over prison for certain drug defendants  On the fate of Snowden  the former CIA officer and NSA contractor who leaked tens of thousands of classified documents  Holder said the prospect of amnesty  goes too far   He broke the law  he caused harm to our national security   I think he has to be held accountable for his actions  Holder said  If Snowden s lawyers sought a deal with some accountability  Holder said he would  engage in conversations  as in any plea negotiation   Returning to the US  I think  is the best resolution for the government  the public  and myself  but it s unfortunately not possible in the face of current whistleblower protection laws  which through a failure in law did not cover national security contractors like myself  Snowden said in an online chat Thursday The hundred year old law under which I ve been charged  which was never intended to be used against people working in the public interest  and forbids a public interest defense  This is especially frustrating  because it means there s no chance to have a fair trial  and no way I can come home and make my case to a jury  Snowden was granted temporary amnesty by Russia last summer  Snowden has been charged with theft and two serious charges under the espionage act   unauthorized communication of national defense information  and  willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person  Last month  a federal court in Washington ruled against an N S A  program based partly on Snowden s revelations  but Holder said such rulings do not change Snowden s status   People have really gotten hung up on the idea of whether he s a whistleblower or something else  Holder said   From my perspective  he s a defendant  He s a person that we lodged criminal charges against  I think that s the most apt title  Holder added that the debate Snowden helped spark may be good for the country  despite his actions   I think the dialogue that we are engaged is in fact something that is ultimately going to be productive   it s healthy  Holder said   but that doesn t necessarily excuse that which what he did  Holder declined to address claims by Congressional leaders that Snowden may have worked with a foreign government  citing the ongoing investigation against the former contractor  The Attorney General also addressed Obama s recent comments on marijuana   I think the positions that we re taking   in terms of setting up those eight priorities that would warrant federal intervention   are consistent with what the President said  Holder stated  referencing 2012 guidelines that leaned away from prosecuting private use   Small time small amount marijuana cases are not the kinds of things that deserve to be in the federal system  Holder said   When violence is part of the dissemination of marijuana  he added   those are the kinds of cases that should be in federal system  and those are the changes we ve made  ,01/23/14 05:00 PM,drugs

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/marijuana-scare-stories-legalization, Coverage of marijuana legalization in Colorado has often focused on rare  genuinely tragic occurrences involving overuse of the drug  But  Reefer Madness style stories coming out of Colorado won t tell us much about whether or not legalizing marijuana was a good idea   I think we ve learned very little so far from Colorado  said Mark Kleiman  a professor of public policy at UCLA who advised Washington State in developing its legal marijuana policy   There will be bad things coming out of legalization  but they re not going to happen quickly   Americans use marijuana billions of times a year  and there s very few stories like this  Keith Humphreys  Stanford University School of Medicine There s little data so far to suggest that marijuana legalization has led to serious public safety problems  Despite the proliferation of terrifying anecdotes publicized by anti legalization advocates  crime has actually dropped in Colorado since legalization  One of these stories is that of Richard Kirk  who killed his wife after possibly ingesting marijuana and prescription pain pills  Some reporting has actually omitted the pills  the interaction of the two could have contributed to the incident   leaving readers with the impression that consuming a marijuana candy bar alone may have caused the psychotic episode that led Kirk to retrieve a gun and shoot his wife Police took a blood test  but the results may not be revealed until Kirk s case goes to court  so we won t know for a while what role drugs may have played   These are all multi determined events  We know that because they re rare   if they were simply determined they d be happening more often  said Keith Humphreys  a professor of psychiatry and behavioral medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine In the aggregate  Americans use marijuana billions of times a year  and there s very few stories like this If marijuana had this effect in a prevalent fashion  these things would have been happening for years and years and years  Also prevalent has been the sad story of Levy Thamba Pongi  a 19 year old college student in Wyoming who came to Colorado and leaped off a hotel balcony after eating a marijuana cookie that  according to police documents  contained six and a half servings of THC  the compound in marijuana that leads to intoxication  The coroner concluded that marijuana intoxication was a  significant contributing factor  in Pongi s death  But these are not typical experiences  According to Humphreys  it s  highly unusual  for people  without steady use and without a tendency toward psychosis to become psychotic from using marijuana  though he said he could not comment on any specific incident  Then there s the question of overuse  New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote Tuesday of a trip to Colorado where she had a bad experience after eating a marijuana laced candy bar that left her  curled up in a hallucinatory state for the next eight hours  Kirk and Pongi are both mentioned in the column  Yet the risks of marijuana intoxication pale in comparison to the number of deaths attributable to alcohol  which Dowd describes as her own drug of choice  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention there are around 88 000 deaths related to alcohol overuse every year about 7 500 of which are the result of falls  Kleiman estimates that alcohol related falls may account for as many as two deaths per week in Colorado alone  But Dowd s column wasn t about the risks of legal alcohol  And since there are no highly motivated groups fighting for the prohibition of alcohol  they re not likely to make news  Still  Dowd s column deals with a genuine issue   unlike with smoking  people can have a hard time understanding how much THC they re taking in when they consume marijuana edibles  People consuming edibles sometimes believe they re not getting high because of a delayed reaction  and then end up much more intoxicated than they intended   a problem of which Colorado state officials are well aware  But no one would be surprised if you told them a story about someone getting in trouble after drinking an entire handle of bourbon  either  And unlike with bourbon  there s never been a documented case of someone overdosing on marijuana   There s clearly an edibles problem  meaning that Maureen Dowd is not the only idiot in the world  said Kleiman   Eating is dangerous because it s harder to control the dose  Under legality that problem should go away  because the dose is on the product  You should be able to take just the right amount  just like a drinker knows how many drinks they want to drink   Eating is dangerous because it s harder to control the dose  You should be able to take just the right amount  just like a drinker knows how many drinks they want to drink  Mark Kleiman  professor of public policy at UCLA No one is proposing we go back to the days of Prohibition  despite the fact that people often become reckless or violent when they abuse alcohol The evidence suggests that they re more likely to do so under the influence of alcohol than marijuana  But as Rolling Stone s Bruce Barcott notes   Legalization rides on the growing belief that marijuana should be treated like alcohol  not like heroin or cocaine  The perception that marijuana  independent of other factors  can turn any teenager suicidal or any husband homicidal  would alter that belief  which is why anti legalization advocates are focusing on stories like Kirk s or Pongi s  There may be greater problems with marijuana legalization down the line   particularly as the marijuana industry s political ambitions rise with their profits  But the rare scary story from Colorado or Washington doesn t tell us much about whether or not legalization is working   So far there s nothing coming out of Colorado that says they made a mistake  Kleiman

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/what-real-drug-law-reform-would-look, The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing this week to discuss an emerging tension in marijuana policy  Washington and Colorado have legalized small amounts of marijuana and 20 other states have legalized it for medical use  These policies put the federal government into something of a quandary  since marijuana is illegal for any use under federal law  should the feds enforce its laws in these states  The federal government has devised a temporary solution that skirts the problem and could create a series of new ones  Last month  the Department of Justice released new guidelines on marijuana prosecutions  The essential message was that federal prosecutors should not interfere with state marijuana laws  Prosecutions should be reserved for those who sell marijuana to minors  use state laws as a cover for illegal drug sales  or as a means to distribute marijuana in states where it remains illegal  Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy was unambiguous about his support   The absolute criminalization of personal marijuana use has contributed to our nation s soaring prison population and has disproportionately affected people of color  said the Vermont Democrat  But soon there were questions about whether marijuana television commercials would run in Colorado  or if there was a plot to addict the nation s kids to harder drugs through pot laced gummy bears  While drug legalization advocates are hailing the new guidelines as  the most heartening news to come out of Washington in a long  long time  many are skeptical  The Judiciary Committee s ranking Republican  Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa  condemned Colorado s approach and the Justice Department s new policy  He asked Deputy Attorney General James Cole  who wrote the guidelines   Why has the Justice Department decided to trust Colorado  Colorado has become a significant exporter of marijuana  But there is reason even for drug reform advocates to be wary  the new approach will do little to mitigate the failed  war on drugs  and it puts the Justice Department in an untenable position  First  the change in the Justice Department s stance is only advisory  The directive to the nation s U S  Attorneys can easily be reversed by Cole s successor  This is not an actual change to the federal drug laws  The federal government will continue to prosecute drug crimes  which trigger harsh mandatory minimum sentences  These overly punitive sentences have led to almost half the federal prison population locked up for drug convictions  Second  because of the preemption doctrine  in which federal law displaces contradictory state law  prosecutors are opting not to enforce laws they are sworn to uphold  That may be laudable when it comes to marijuana but would not be so praiseworthy if the issue were  for example  voting rights  Grassley understood this when he said it was  disastrous  that the Justice Department was  giving the green light to states that decide to ignore laws they don t like  Criminal justice reform advocates should not be diverted by this recent shift  To create genuine and lasting progress  federal drug laws must be completely revamped  Congress should remove harsh mandatory minimums for drug crimes or remove crimes like possession of marijuana from the list of jail able crimes  Better yet  it should commission and evaluate public health data on whether marijuana actually should be classified as a  dangerous  drug and if it isn t  Congress should rethink criminalizing and punishing it so harshly  In this way  the federal government can lead the nation toward a sane criminal justice system one that protects the public from the serious safety threats and prosecutes and incarcerates only when absolutely necessary  ,09/14/13 08:45 AM,drugs
