Mr. Lacalle Pou called Dr. Vzquez on Sunday night to congratulate him after several unofficial exit polls showed Dr. Vzquez winning by a comfortable margin. Official results are expected on Monday.The election came after a stretch in which Uruguays president, Jos Mujica, 79, a former guerrilla, raised the countrys profile with legislation that legalized abortion and same-sex marriage and created the marijuana market. He is set to leave office with high approval ratings.Dr. Vzquez is more moderate than Mr. Mujica, having vetoed an abortion law during his first term as president. He has also expressed opposition to parts of the marijuana law, a position shared by many Uruguayans as broad skepticism persists over the project. Still, he has said that he would enforce the law.A more important issue for many Uruguayans involved the handling of economic policy by the Broad Front, a coalition of left-wing parties, with Uruguay registering average growth of nearly 6 percent a year during the last nine years. Even as growth slowed this year, cautious economic policies were seen as shielding the country from external shocks.Practically 70 percent of Uruguayans hold a positive or very positive view of the economic situation in the country, said Jorge Lanzaro, a professor of political science at Uruguays University of the Republic. This helps a great deal.In returning Dr. Vzquez to the presidency, voters endorsed a candidate with less pizzazz on the international stage than Mr. Mujica, who eschewed many of the benefits enjoyed by heads of state. But during his first term, Dr. Vzquez also governed with his own style, reserving one morning each week to continue practicing medicine. Many voters felt comfortable having him back.We need continuity because of the government that the Broad Front has delivered, said Dr. Laura Tasende, 31, a surgeon who is now doing her residency. Still, she emphasized that improvements were needed in some areas. Education has to be a priority, because it allows people to raise their living standards so they dont need to go out and commit crimes.An increase in violent crime also weighed on voters, and Mr. Lacalle Pou, the conservative challenger and son of a former president, ran on a platform seeking to crack down on crime, reduce inflation and improve Uruguays schools. While most voters opted for his opponent, Mr. Lacalle Pou emerged as a fresh face for some.",2014-12-01,abortion
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/01/us/case-seeking-job-protections-for-pregnant-women-heads-to-supreme-court.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/01/us/PREGNANT/PREGNANT-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg,Case Seeking Job Protections for Pregnant Women Heads to Supreme Court ,The court is to consider the case of a former United Parcel Service employee who sued after being placed on unpaid leave when she became pregnant.,"WASHINGTON   Peggy Young used to drive for United Parcel Service, delivering envelopes and small packages early in the morning. I was a dependable, honorable worker, she said. I worked when I was supposed to. I did what I was supposed to.Then she got pregnant, and her doctor recommended that she avoid lifting anything heavy. The company responded by placing her on unpaid leave.I lost my health benefits, Ms. Young said. I lost my pension. And I lost my wages for seven months. And my disability benefits.She sued under the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and the Supreme Court will hear her case on Wednesday. Womens rights groups hope that Ms. Youngs case will snap their recent losing streak at the court, which has included decisions on equal pay, medical leave, abortion and contraception.Weve had some very big disappointments recently, but Im hoping it wont be a uniform set of experiences, said Marcia D. Greenberger, a co-president of the National Womens Law Center. I hope Peggy Young will break the mold.The Supreme Courts decision has the potential to affect the lives of millions of women, who make up 47 percent of the labor force and often work during and late into their pregnancies. According to the Census Bureau, an estimated 62 percent of women who had given birth in the previous year were in the labor force.Women are the sole or primary breadwinners in 40 percent of American families with children, according to a Pew Research Center study. Whether employers are required to make accommodations for their pregnancies, womens groups say, will make a tangible difference in the lives of many families.UPS has announced that it will change its policy to offer light duty to pregnant women starting in January. The new policy will strengthen UPSs commitment to treating all workers fairly and supporting women in the workplace, said Kara Ross, a spokeswoman for the company.The case before the Supreme Court, she said, is really about what the UPS policy was then. The old policy, she said, was lawful and consistently applied to our workers.The company told the justices that it had no legal obligation to make the kinds of accommodations it recently announced. The lower courts in Ms. Youngs case agreed, with a unanimous three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Va., saying the pregnancy law does not give pregnant women a most favored nation status.One may characterize the UPS policy as insufficiently charitable, Judge Allyson Kay Duncan wrote for the court, but a lack of charity does not amount to discriminatory animus directed at a protected class of employees.Ms. Young, speaking in a public relations firms conference room here, said it would have been easy for UPS to accommodate her.The parcels she delivered were so light that the lifting restriction recommended by her doctor was needless. Its envelopes or very small boxes, she said. They sat in a little basket in a seat next to me. Very rarely was it anything heavy, because its very expensive to send that way.If something heavy did turn up for an early morning delivery, a co-worker could handle it, Ms. Young said. If the company remained concerned, she said, it could have assigned her less demanding duties.She said she had worked a second job in the afternoons throughout her pregnancy, delivering flowers. They were heavier than the packages I would deliver for UPS, Ms. Young said.Business groups have filed briefs supporting UPS, saying the pregnancy law did not apply to Ms. Youngs situation. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce noted that many of its members had nonetheless decided  for a variety of reasons  to offer pregnant employees more than what federal law compels them to provide.Ms. Young has attracted a diverse array of supporters, including womens rights organizations and anti-abortion groups. The federal law, the anti-abortion groups told the justices, protects the unborn child as well as the working mother who faces economic and other difficulties in bearing and raising the child.The Obama administration also supports Ms. Young, a stance that has required it to renounce statements in earlier briefs. The administrations latest brief included a footnote acknowledging that the federal government has previously taken the position that pregnant employees with work limitations are not similarly situated to employees with similar limitations caused by on-the-job injuries.That is no longer the position of the United States, the brief said, though it added that the United States Postal Service continues to offer different treatment to its pregnant workers.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was a prominent advocate for gender equality before she became a judge, discussed Ms. Youngs case in an interview with Elle published in September.The pregnancy law, she noted, was enacted in response to the Supreme Courts 1976 decision in General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, which ruled that discrimination based on pregnancy was not a form of sex discrimination. That congressional reaction, she said, was similar to one that followed the courts decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., the 2007 ruling that said Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 imposed strict time limits for bringing workplace discrimination suits. In response, Congress passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009.As for Ms. Young, Justice Ginsburg said, this was a woman whose doctor told her she couldnt lift more than, I think, 20 pounds.For people who were temporarily disabled, she added, the employer would make an accommodation, but the employer said, Were not making an accommodation for her because shes not disabled.The case, Young v. United Parcel Service, No. 12-1226, turns on the language of the pregnancy law. It requires employers to treat women affected by pregnancy the same as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.There is no dispute that some UPS workers were offered accommodations. What the two sides disagree about is whether the law required Ms. Young to be treated the same way.The company made accommodations for workers who were injured on the job, who were covered by the Americans With Disabilities Act and who lost their driving certification from the Department of Transportation.They even accommodated people who lost their regular drivers licenses due to drunk-driving convictions, said Sharon Fast Gustafson, one of Ms. Youngs lawyers. They would give them a separate driver to drive the truck while they were delivering packages.The company countered that it had treated Ms. Young the same as other employees with similar lifting restrictions resulting from an off-the-job injury or condition.That is slicing things too finely, said Samuel Bagenstos, a law professor at the University of Michigan who will argue in the Supreme Court on behalf of Ms. Young. What went wrong here, he said, is that UPS did not treat Peggy Young as it did any other valued employee.Ms. Young, 42, left UPS in 2009 and now works for a government contractor. She has three children, and she said she would be thinking about them when the Supreme Court heard her case.I dont want my daughters to have to choose, Ms. Young said, between having a baby and supporting a family.",2014-12-01,abortion

In mid-September, about two weeks after sophomores at Highland Park High School began reading The Art of Racing in the Rain, by Garth Stein, in their English classes, they were told to stop.That book and six others were being pulled from the curriculum over parental complaints about sexual content and explicit passages, school officials said. The suspensions, however, did not last long. An uproar prompted Highland Parks superintendent, Dawson Orr, to reverse the decision two weeks later.The other books were The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, by Sherman Alexie; Song of Solomon, by Toni Morrison; Siddhartha, by Hermann Hesse; An Abundance of Katherines, by John Green; The Glass Castle, by Jeannette Walls; and The Working Poor, by David Shipler.There are no banned or suspended books in the Highland Park Independent School District today, Dr. Orr said. We are delivering curriculum to kids; we are using instructional resources; we are working very hard to deliver a level of transparency.The return of the books to classrooms has not ended the intense debate over who should determine what is read in public classrooms. Since September, two opposing groups of parents have mobilized.Speak Up for Standards wants parents to have more control over removing literature they find offensive. Its leaders include Tavia Hunt, who is married to the grandson of the oil tycoon H. L. Hunt.HP Kids Read says decisions about reading materials should be left to the teachers. The groups efforts have caught the attention of national anti-censorship advocates.Scrutiny of the books began in response to concerns from parents as early as last May, Dr. Orr said. It continued over the summer and at the start of the school year, with some parents circulating emails that highlighted sex scenes and references to rape, incest, prostitution and abortion in selected books. In Mr. Steins The Art of Racing in the Rain, a 2008 novel that follows a racecar drivers struggle to raise his daughter after his wifes death and is told from the perspective of a dog, parents identified passages they found troublesome, like a scene in which a 15-year-old girl makes sexual advances toward the driver.Dr. Orr said the district hoped the temporary suspension of the books would de-escalate the situation.Instead, the move shocked many other parents in this Dallas enclave.Weve been in this school district for 14 years, and this is the first time any of this has popped up, said John Spicer, who has two children in the Highland Park district and one who has already graduated. Kids had books figuratively pulled out of their hands.At a November school board meeting, the issue was still smoldering. Marie Briner, an elementary school parent, said she was alarmed to learn of the content of some books in the curriculum. As a former Dallas County prosecutor in the child abuse division, she said that if she had found the material in a police investigation, she would have entered it as evidence that a defendant was trying to groom potential victims.How is this any different than my sex offenders that have a diary of their fantasies? And I have to tell you, its not different at all, she said.Other parents argued that a diverse reading list that reflected a variety of socioeconomic, racial and political viewpoints was essential in the district, which serves students in one of the wealthiest ZIP codes in the state.I love Highland Park, and Ive always had faith in the district because the parents really insist on academic excellence, Lynn Dickinson, the parent of an eighth grader, said. But one thing to me that has always been a drawback is its homogeneous nature.On Wednesday, a committee of 12 parents, educators and administrators, which reviewed The Art of Racing in the Rain, determined it was appropriate for students in grade 10 or higher. Parents can still appeal that decision to administrators.Ms. Hunt was the lone dissenter on the committee. In review documents provided by the district, she said students could take concerning messages from the book on topics like seduction, rape, child pedophilia, whether oral sex is sex, premarital sex as normative, reincarnation, or that those in authority over them approve of foul language.This New York Times best seller would be a good book for someone to choose to read at the beach in the summer, she wrote. Not as required reading. Especially considering the opportunity costs of the literature they missed out on as a result of this assignment.Highland Park officials are reviewing the districts procedures for selecting instructional materials, which Dr. Orr said lacked clarity, and the way those selections may be challenged. Updates will be presented to the board on Dec. 9.Under current district policy, teachers and administrators choose the materials used. The decision of whether to request parental consent for assigned readings is also made at the campus level, said Helen Williams, a district spokeswoman.In an email, Ms. Hunt said she hoped the district would adopt changes proposed by Speak Up for Standards requiring teachers to inform parents before their children were exposed to potentially controversial materials.Some experts fear that approach, sometimes referred to as red flagging, has the same effect as pulling books off library shelves or out of classrooms. They argue that it stigmatizes texts that have educational value.Its a prescription for educational chaos, said Joan Bertin, the executive director of the National Coalition Against Censorship, which has followed the Highland Park situation since the school suspended use of the books in September. It is an extremely problematic route for the school to take.It can also put a burden on teachers, who must identify potentially inflammatory material and find alternatives for parents who object. In November, the schools English department made a pre-emptive move, sending a letter asking parents to sign off on Mark Twains The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Nathaniel Hawthornes The Scarlet Letter and Ernest Hemingways A Farewell to Arms. The books stayed.Millie Davis, who leads the Intellectual Freedom Center at the National Council of Teachers of English, called the Highland Park book suspensions distressing.Over the last five years, she said, her organization had most commonly tackled challenges to modern literature and books with multicultural themes.Its a culture war. Im not sure whats going to happen, Ms. Davis said. But nearly every day I put myself in the shoes of the teachers there, and I dont know how they go to work.",2014-11-30,abortion
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/30/us/gop-gains-by-tapping-democrats-base-for-state-candidates-.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/30/us/GOPWOMEN/GOPWOMEN-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg,G.O.P. Gains by Tapping Democrats Base for State Candidates,"In taking control of nearly 70 state legislative chambers in the midterm elections, Republicans focused on recruiting women and minorities as candidates.","WASHINGTON   As Republicans took control of an unprecedented 69 of 99 statehouse chambers in the midterm elections, they did not rely solely on a bench of older white men. Key races hinged on the strategic recruitment of women and minorities, many of them first-time candidates who are now learning the ropes and joining the pool of prospects for higher office.They include Jill Upson, the first black Republican woman elected to the West Virginia House; Victoria Seaman, the first Latina Republican elected to the Nevada Assembly; Beth Martinez Humenik, whose win gave Republicans a one-seat edge in the Colorado Senate; and Young Kim, a Korean-American woman who was elected to the California Assembly, helping to break the Democratic supermajority in the State Legislature.In Pennsylvania, Harry Lewis Jr., a retired black educator, won in a new House district that was expected to be a Democratic stronghold; he printed his campaign materials in English and Spanish. Of the 12 Latinos who will serve in statewide offices across the nation in 2015, eight are Republican.This is not just rhetoric  we spent over $6 million to identify new women and new candidates of diversity and bring them in, said Matt Walter, the executive director of the Republican State Leadership Committee. Most of these chambers were flipped because there was a woman or a person of diverse ethnicity in a key targeted seat.The wins, by candidates carefully chosen to challenge the traditional notion of the Democratic base, bode well for Republicans in future elections. They had a net gain of 59 women in state legislatures; Democrats lost 63 women. Republicans added 10 Latinos; Democrats lost five. Republicans reported 17 newly elected blacks; a comparable figure for Democrats was not available. In 2008, only about 31 percent of women in state legislatures were Republicans; in 2015, that figure will rise by eight percentage points.Sarah Maestas Barnes, 34, was raised in a working-class, Democratic, Latino household and has made a legal career of helping disabled clients win benefits. She also beat a Democratic incumbent to help Republicans secure a majority in the New Mexico House for the first time in six decades.When she arrived in Washington Nov. 20 for a training session held by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, she was surprised that only three other Republicans were in attendance. I just would have assumed that there would have been more here, she said.Democrats point to the larger context, noting that an overwhelming majority of minorities and women serving as legislators are Democrats, and arguing that the recent net gains by Republicans were a function of their huge wins over all. In other words, Democrats say, Democratic women lost because Democrats lost, not because the partys appeal to women faltered. And despite the gains, the share of Republican legislators who are women will still be lower than it was in 1993.But even some Democrats say Republicans have outclassed them, strategically speaking, in state-level politics. For example, two Democratic candidates for the Nevada Assembly, including Ms. Seamans opponent, were disqualified over residency requirements. Republican gains with Latino candidates particularly stung.The midterms were a wake-up call that this is something we need greater focus and resources around, and not just simply to take for granted and believe that we have some sort of monopoly on minority elected officials, said Nick Rathod, a former Obama administration official who leads a new organization, the State Innovation Exchange, that will seek to bolster liberal policies and candidates and to counter the success of conservative state-focused groups.The Republican State Leadership Committee introduced its recruitment effort, the Future Majority Project, in 2011, calling on state leaders and political groups  as well as less partisan organizations like the Asian American Hotel Owners Association and the National Association of Women Business Owners  to help identify potential candidates. Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico and Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada led the effort. The director, Neri Martinez, acted as a cheerleader and consultant, helping assuage fears and pairing candidates with mentors.Ms. Barnes said she had not questioned her identification as a Democrat until she was exposed to the New Mexico Legislature while acting as an advocate for descendants of Spanish land grant holders, of whom she is one. She was not impressed by what she viewed as Democratic orthodoxy.The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, he just disregarded me, she said. He didnt care about my issue. I spent the rest of the session kind of learning the process. I learned how the Democrats were doing everything, and the Republicans were in the minority. I was like: Why arent you listening to these Republicans? They have some really good ideas, especially with respect to job creation. They werent interested in those ideas because they were Republican ideas, and that really bothered me.Ms. Barnes changed her party registration in late 2010 or early 2011, and when her family moved to Albuquerque a short time later, she sought out Republican groups, thinking she would help with voter drives and show people that not every Republican is like the stereotypical Republican  older, white, male.The first time she showed up at a county party meeting, Conrad James, an African-American state representative who lost his seat to a Democrat in 2012 and won it back this year, asked if she would consider running for office. That, plus a newspaper article on New Mexicos persistently low ranking in measures of child welfare, helped make up her mind.It is not clear yet where the new Republican elected officials fall on the ideological spectrum. Several who were interviewed for this article, including Ms. Barnes, said they were focused on economic issues like job creation, not social issues like abortion and same-sex marriage. Ms. Barnes said that she had made it clear to party leaders that she would entertain good ideas no matter which party floated them, and that she had been promised the freedom to vote her conscience.It is equally unclear how far the new Republicans will advance politically. Ms. Barnes swore that she could not imagine running for a higher office than state representative. The mother of two girls, ages 4 and 6, Ms. Barnes widened her eyes in dismay when she heard an experienced legislator say during a panel discussion that her children had stopped expecting her to be home for their birthdays.But when the time came to ask questions, motherhood was not on Ms. Barness mind. How, she wanted to know, could she land the committee assignment she wanted most?Tell them, a panelist advised, you helped them win this majority.",2014-11-30,abortion

She was 65.Her death was confirmed by her spouse, Minnie Bruce Pratt, who said in a statement that the cause was complications from multiple tick-borne co-infections, including Lyme disease.Feinberg, who resisted being called Ms. or any other gender-specific honorific, wrote fiercely and furiously on behalf of those she saw as oppressed because of their sexual, ethnic, racial or other identities. A longtime member of the Workers World Party, a Marxist-Leninist group, and a prolific journalist for its newspaper, she wrote a 120-part series, from 2004 to 2008, explicating the role of socialism in the history of gender politics.Feinberg was an advocate for minorities and for the poor, as well as for gay men and lesbians and others who identified as transgender  an umbrella term, distinct from transsexual, that describes people whose life experience straddles the line between male and female and between masculine and feminine.She herself was biologically a woman but presented outwardly as male  and sometimes passed as a man for reasons of safety, a friend, Julie Enszer, said in an interview. Feinberg, in referring to herself, used the pronouns ze (for she) and hir (for her), though she often said pronoun usage was frequently a matter of context.I am female-bodied, I am a butch lesbian, a transgender lesbian  referring to me as sheher is appropriate, particularly in a non-trans setting in which referring to me as he would appear to resolve the social contradiction between my birth sex and gender expression and render my transgender expression invisible, she explained in a 2006 interview with Camp, a publication in Kansas City, Mo., aimed at gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people and their supporters.I like the gender neutral pronoun zehir, she continued, because it makes it impossible to hold on to gendersexsexuality assumptions about a person youre about to meet or youve just met. And in an all trans setting, referring to me as hehim honors my gender expression in the same way that referring to my sister drag queens as sheher does.Feinbergs books included two nonfiction studies of gender issues, Transgender Warriors: Making History From Joan of Arc to Dennis Rodman and Trans Liberation: Beyond Pink or Blue, and a second novel, Drag King.But her best-known and most influential work was Stone Butch Blues, a coming-of-age novel, drawn at least partly from her own life, about a young person, born female, who grows into adulthood at odds with her own family and comes to grips with her complicated, unconventional sexual and gender identity at a time when practicing a so-called alternative lifestyle invited stigma, open discrimination and, in many settings, menacing opprobrium.They cuffed my hands so tight I almost cried out, the protagonist, Jess Goldberg, writes in a letter to a former lover, describing a night the police raided a club they were in together. Then the cop unzipped his pants real slow, with a smirk on his face, and ordered me down on my knees. First I thought to myself, I cant! Then I said out loud to myself and to you and to him, I wont! I never told you this before but something changed inside of me at that moment. I learned the difference between what I cant do and what I refuse to do.Leslie Feinberg was born on Sept. 1, 1949, in Kansas City and grew up in Buffalo. Her family was hostile to her sexuality and gender expression, and she left home as a teenager, rejecting them as well.According to a biographical statement supplied by her spouse, Feinberg earned a living mostly in temporary low-wage jobs, including washing dishes, working in a book bindery, cleaning out ship cargo holds and interpreting sign language.In addition to writing, she pursued many causes as an activist. In 1974, she organized a march against racism in Boston after white supremacists had attacked blacks there. She helped rally support for AIDS patients and those at risk in the early days of the disease. A longtime advocate for womens reproductive rights, she returned to Buffalo to work for that cause in 1998, after an abortion provider, Dr. Barnett Slepian, was murdered in his home near there.In addition to Pratt, a poet and an activist, Feinberg is survived by an extended family of choice, according to the statement provided by her spouse. She identified as an antiracist white, working-class, secular Jewish, transgender, lesbian, female revolutionary communist, the statement said.In an essay after Feinbergs death, Shauna Miller, a writer and editor who contributes to The Atlantic, wrote on the magazines website that Stone Butch Blues was the heartbreaking holy grail of butch perspective, a book that was instrumental in her coming to terms with her own sexual and gender identity. The novel, which has been translated into several languages including Chinese and Slovenian, changed queer history, she wrote.It changed trans history. It changed dyke history.

The doctor said: Well then, Ill recommend you dont lift anything over 20 pounds,  Young recalled in a phone interview.Her job at the time involved delivering packages that were generally light. And her co-workers had made it clear that they would take care of anything heavy that did happen to come her way. But U.P.S. put her on an unpaid leave.They told me they dont provide light duty for pregnancy and that I had become a liability, she said.The case has echoes of one of the first great legal victories in the womens rights movement. More than half a century ago, Lorena Weeks, a Georgia telephone company clerk, applied for a better-paying job and was told she was ineligible because it involved lifting a piece of equipment that weighed about 30 pounds. The fact that the object in question was actually pushed around on a dolly and that Lorenas own job required her to lift a 34-pound typewriter onto her desk every morning did not appear to enter into the companys equation.Weeks lawyer, Sylvia Roberts, convinced the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals that the rule was both paternalistic and arbitrary, punctuating her argument by lifting a series of objects in the courtroom. She told me once that she believed her performance of hoisting a workbench helped win the day. That was in 1969. And, now, here we are with Peggy Young and her packages.Its ironic, really, since women of childbearing age probably spend more time picking up heavy  and frequently squirming  objects than most men. Young has two older children who were born three years apart. When she was pregnant with her second child, she noted, I had zero issues holding my 3-year-old. Who Im pretty sure weighed more than any packages theyd give me.Further irony: the courts have ruled repeatedly that the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act does not require an employer to accommodate a pregnant worker. Basically, a boss just has to prove that hed be equally unfeeling if she fell down the stairs at home and broke her leg. (U.P.S. says it believes its policy was lawful, evenly and consistently applied at the time to all employees.)Yet more irony, with a heavy overlay of pathos: During her enforced disability leave, Peggy Young still needed income, and she continued to work as a driver for a florist, lifting packages that were heavier than anything she had handled at U.P.S. And the job didnt include health benefits.Ironic finale: U.P.S. did not make accommodations for pregnant workers, but it did make accommodations for employees who get in trouble for drunken driving off the job. If you lose your license for a D.U.I., you get reassigned temporarily while you work to get your license back, said Samuel Bagenstos, the attorney who will argue Youngs case in Washington.How do you think the Supreme Court will react to all this? Its had a dismal recent history when it comes to workers rights. But history is most definitely marching on Youngs side. Since she filed her suit, Maryland has joined a number of states that require employers to make reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers. And, last month, U.P.S. sent out a notice that it would henceforth offer pregnant women temporary light-duty assignments. So itll be sort of hard to argue that Youngs demands were unreasonable.The best evidence that they can do this is ... that theyre going to do this, said Bagenstos.Youngs case is also one of the very, very, extremely rare occasions when both sides of the abortion rights divide come together. Everybody, from the American Civil Liberties Union to Americans United for Life, understands that most American mothers need to work to help support their families, and nobody wants them to have to choose between having a child and keeping their job.We have calls from pregnant women who are cashiers who cant stand for eight hours and ask if they can use a stool, or who need to take extra bathroom breaks. These kind of simple requests are being refused, said Marcia Greenberger of the National Womens Law Center. Its still very much of a problem, especially for women in low-paying jobs.Congress could, of course, clear this up by passing a federal law requiring fair treatment for pregnant workers. All thats necessary is for Republicans and Democrats to work together to . . .Never mind.",2014-11-29,abortion

The textbook, the one with the wide-eyed lemur peering off the cover, has been handed out for years to students in honors biology classes at the high schools here, offering lessons on bread-and-butter subjects like mitosis and meiosis, photosynthesis and anatomy.But now, the school board in this suburb of Phoenix has voted to excise or redact two pages deep inside the book  544 and 545  because they discuss sexually transmitted diseases and contraception, including mifepristone, a drug that can be used to prevent or halt a pregnancy.A law passed two years ago in Arizona requires schools to teach preference, encouragement and support to childbirth and adoption over abortion, and the school board decided that those pages were in violation of this law  even though the Arizona Education Department, which examined the book for compliance, found that they were not.The controversy has turned into a referendum on the 2012 law, with supporters saying the textbook content cannot be removed fast enough and opponents crying foul for any number of reasons: technical, ethical, pedagogical. But the Gilbert school board is moving forward, trying to figure out how to remove the material in question  by way of black markers or scissors, if need be  despite resistance from parents, residents, the American Civil Liberties Union and even the districts superintendent.It comes down to, its the law, and we need to be in compliance with the law, said Julie Smith, a member of the Gilbert Public Schools governing board and also a parent who raised concerns about the book. If people dont like the law, they need to take it up with their state legislator. I dont write the law. Its my job to uphold it.Other people say that the school board has misinterpreted the law and that censoring the book amounts to a violation of students First Amendment rights  and may violate copyright law as well.The answer isnt to redact pages from a science textbook, said Alessandra Soler, executive director of the A.C.L.U. of Arizona. Its an extreme interpretation, an incorrect interpretation, and I think it sends the wrong message. More information is always going to be better.It was at a heated meeting last month that the school board voted, 3 to 2, that the two pages from Campbell Biology: Concepts and Connections had to be removed somehow. The district is also reviewing three other biology books and two anatomy books. In all, just over 3,000 students in Gilberts public high schools have science books with material that could be deemed objectionable, according to district officials.The dispute has metastasized into fiery exchanges at board meetings, rumors about secret redacting sessions, and angry confrontations in local grocery stores. One school board member, an opponent of censoring the book, was so unnerved by the swirl of gossip about her that she felt compelled to post on Facebook that she had not been endorsed by Planned Parenthood.Christina M. Kishimoto, the schools superintendent in Gilbert, who started in the job just this summer, has found herself caught in the crossfire. Im constantly getting emails about so-and-so threatening this or that, she said. The accusations are going back and forth. Its a distraction. Its upsetting families.Abortion has been front and center as a legal issue in Arizona. In January, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear a case brought by people who wanted to reinstate a state law, passed in 2012 but subsequently struck down, that barred most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. In March, a federal judge in Tucson refused to block the states unusually strict laws, also passed in 2012, on the use of abortion drugs.Ms. Smith, the school board member and parent, said she had been driving her family home from church back in January when her son told her about what was in the textbook. I almost drove off the road, she said.Im Catholic; we do not contracept, Ms. Smith said. It is a grave sin. By including those pages in the curriculum, she added, you have violated my religious rights.She and other parents offended by the material said they thought it could be in violation of a law signed in 2012, called SB 1009, which required Arizona schools to teach in a way that favored a womans taking a pregnancy to term over terminating it.The textbook speaks about abortion, it touches on childbirth, but theres not a mention of adoption, said Christine Accurso, a mother of three who moved her children out of the school district well before the issue arose but got involved nevertheless. It was blatant. It was obvious.Ms. Accurso reached out to the Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal advocacy group that has been active in conservative causes. The organization, based in Scottsdale, has been particularly busy in Arizona: It championed a bill, passed by the State Legislature but vetoed by Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, that would have allowed business owners to cite religious beliefs as a reason to deny service to same-sex couples. More recently, the group has challenged the school district in Tempe, also on the grounds of violating SB 1009, for taking material from Planned Parenthood in developing a new sex-education curriculum.In August, after lawyers for the Alliance Defending Freedom sent a letter to Gilbert school officials, the officials asked the Arizona Education Department for guidance. The departments lawyers and officials reviewed the pages in question and found that they did not violate the law, as long as teachers filled in the lesson with the necessary context.Just simply stating a fact, a particular drug and its function, doesnt mean you favor that particular course of action, said Chris Kotterman, the departments deputy director of policy development and government relations. Thats not how textbooks work. Thats not how any other academic exercise works. You provide the context for whatever youre talking about over the course of a unit of instruction.The laws sponsor, State Senator Nancy Barto, Republican of Phoenix, disagreed: To her, there is no doubt this textbook breaks the rules.Sex education by any other name is sex education, and all the rules apply, she said. She argued that even a straightforward description of how drugs like mifepristone work could not be value neutral because it failed to promote adoption and childbirth, as the law prescribes. The only solution, she said, is the removal of the material, either by redaction or changing the book.After the districts governing board agreed, Ms. Kishimoto, the superintendent, reiterated her concerns, which include possible copyright infringement and the alienation of teachers, who took the boards move as a vote of no-confidence. (Pearson, the books publisher, declined through a spokesman to comment for this article; the books authors, when reached for comment, deferred to the company.)Parents also said they worried that the redactions might put students in an Advanced Placement course at a disadvantage when they take a national exam on the material.Present all the facts and let the students apply their critical thinking and moral values to that information, instead of censoring those facts, Tammy Brady, a parent whose children have used the textbook, said at a recent school board meeting. You are suggesting to redact and limit our childrens possibilities.There is a chance the board could reverse its decision before the end of the school year: An election this month changed its composition, and a more moderate majority will take control in January. And Ms. Kishimoto, who said she had to carry out the directive whether she agreed with it or not, aims to postpone redacting the textbooks until the summer, limiting the disruption to students.Jill Humpherys, a member of the board opposed to redacting, said there was no better way to call attention to the material than to try to remove it. If you hand a high school student a book with words marked out or a sticker over parts of it, thats going to be the most-read page in the textbook, said Ms. Humpherys, a mother of five. Ive raised enough children to know that.",2014-11-28,abortion

I recently witnessed a Supreme Court police officer approach a group of demonstrators and ask who they were and what group they were from, and then radio the information to someone inside the building.This micromanagement of gatherings is in line with the courts refusal to allow individuals or groups to assemble on the sizable plaza in front of the building; in fact, the Justice Department is prosecuting a plaza demonstrator. But ironically the court has disallowed protest-free buffer zones around abortion clinics and military funerals.Its no wonder, then, that the relationship between the public and the justices  who dont allow cameras during hearings, dont post their financial disclosure reports online and dont publicly state reasons for their periodic recusals  remains strained.The justices hold an honored place in our democracy and should follow the tenets of the First Amendment that they are charged with safeguarding and let the demonstrators be.GABE ROTH Washington, Nov. 19, 2014 The writer is executive director of Fix the Court, a national nonprofit that advocates institutional reforms to make the Supreme Court more open and accountable.",2014-11-28,abortion

The young woman lived in Dallas, 650 miles from Albuquerque, but that was where she would have to go for an abortion, she was told. New state regulations had forced several of Dallass six abortion clinics to close, creating weekslong waiting lists. By the time the woman could get in, she would be up against the Texas ban on abortions after 20 weeks gestation.But she could not afford the trip to New Mexico.So it was that she had left a phone message with a hotline in Austin and, on a recent evening, heard back from Lenzi Sheible, the 20-year-old founder of a fund to help low-income women pay the unexpected costs of traveling for abortions in Texas  or to states beyond. They spoke four times that night as the woman wavered about going to Albuquerque alone.You can always call me when you get to New Mexico; just talk to me, Ms. Sheible said. By the end of the evening, she had texted the woman confirmation numbers for a flight the next day, $680 round trip, and four nights stay at an Albuquerque hotel, with shuttle service to the clinic.Like an entrepreneur meeting a new market demand, Ms. Sheible, among others, has stepped up as women are finding it increasingly difficult to get abortions across large areas of the United States. In just over three years, according to the Guttmacher Institute, states have passed 231 laws restricting abortion, more than any time in the four decades since the Supreme Court established a constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade.Although longtime groups like Planned Parenthood remain active, and other organizations subsidize poor womens costs for abortion procedures, Ms. Sheible is filling what she calls a new need in Texas for help with lodging and transportation  bus or plane tickets, gas money, taxi fare.The entire western half of Texas is an abortion clinic desert, Ms. Sheible wrote on the website of the nonprofit organization, Fund Texas Choice, that she started 15 months ago.To Kimberly I. McGuire, a director at the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, groups like Ms. Sheibles are crucial. Its a reaction to a sense of desperation across the country as more clinics close, as more communities are left without providers, especially communities of low-income minority and rural women, she said.Ms. Sheible, now pregnant with her second child, quickly drew the attention of the anti-abortion movement in the state. Texas Right to Life published an article in April that compared her fund to trains that brought Jews to Auschwitz. She occasionally gets voice mail messages like one last month: Youre really not about helping women; youre about killing children.Her own past is as rough as that of any of the women she helps. Born to a troubled woman who gave her up at age 7 to married friends  Ms. Sheible does not know her biological father  she spent a month of her senior year in a drug rehabilitation center. But she graduated as valedictorian, with enough academic credits to get through the University of Texas in two years. She now attends its law school.Lenzi is one of the most brilliant kids Ive ever taught, said Erik Ostergren, her dean at Westside High School. Wed always say, Lenzi could go in one of two directions: She could do something amazing and be fantastic, or really go off the rails.In summer 2013, Ms. Sheible, then pregnant with her first child, Cora, started her fund immediately after Texas enacted some of the toughest abortion restrictions in the nation. The laws, both in Texas and in other Republican-dominated states, commonly impose at least a 24-hour wait between a womans first clinic visit and an abortion, forcing many out-of-towners to book hotels. They require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, and mandate that clinics meet the same costly equipment, building and staffing standards as an ambulatory surgical center. Clinics that cannot comply must close.Supporters say the laws protect womens health in case of emergencies. Abortion-rights advocates counter that the regulations are not only unnecessary, given the safety record of abortions and the availability of emergency room care, but also unconstitutional because of a Supreme Court ruling against undue burdens on women seeking abortions.More such laws are expected, however, now that Republicans expanded their control of state and federal offices in this months elections. The next Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, wants to make a ban on abortions after 20 weeks the law of the land.Given legal challenges to the laws in states including Alabama, Mississippi, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin, both sides say the Supreme Court will have to settle the matter. In the meantime, numerous clinics have closed from Arizona to North Carolina, with more closings likely. Ohio is down to eight clinics from 14, and three more are in jeopardy. Only temporary court orders have kept open the last clinic in Toledo, as well as in Mississippi.But in few places have the changes and effects been as drastic as in sprawling Texas. From 42 abortion clinics in 13 cities in May 2013, the state now has about 20 clinics and soon may be down to eight providers in four metropolitan areas  Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio, according to Naral Pro-Choice Texas  assuming, as many do, that advocates lose their appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.Pending the outcome, the Supreme Court last month stayed the surgery-center standards and also allowed clinics in El Paso and McAllen, distant points on the Rio Grande border, to operate without admitting privileges.Ms. Sheibles fund now has a seven-member board that includes her husband, Warren Sheible. In January, the group will have its first paid staff member. In just over a year, she said, the fund received about $60,000, mostly in small amounts, and has spent about $25,000 to help 106 women statewide.Ms. Sheible estimated that roughly a quarter of the women she helps do not make the trips, usually because the women change their minds or cannot arrange child care or a ride to a bus station or airport. Ms. Sheible quickly learned to buy only refundable tickets. (The pregnant woman from Dallas did fly to Albuquerque, Ms. Sheible said, but after a 12-hour delay because of a canceled flight, which forced the clinic to reschedule her appointment to the next day.)Over an evening in her sparsely furnished apartment, where she sipped soda to ease nausea from her pregnancy, Ms. Sheible expressed some surprise that running a nonprofit group has turned her from a self-described wild child into someone super-conventional. But four tattoos and a fifth that is not visible still suggest otherwise.Down one arm is the Transco Tower in Houston, a symbol of the city where Ms. Sheible was born. On her left arm is the University of Texas Tower. The hidden tattoo, inside her lower lip, says babygirl  a nickname from a family that took her in during her senior year in high school, after her adoptive parents kicked her out and before she went into rehab. Her adoptive father paid for her treatment.Heather Busby, executive director of Naral Pro-Choice Texas, said that when she speaks before audiences of older abortion rights advocates  the pre-Roe generation, she calls them  They ask, Where are the younger people? Why arent they getting involved? With women like Ms. Sheible in mind, she said she tells them, Look at the abortion funds. Thats where they are.",2014-11-28,abortion
