NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/11/05/us/politics/ap-us-election-the-voters-glance-.html,WASHINGTON   A sharp drop in turnout a wave of voter unhappiness with both parties and a geographically favorable slate of Senate races combined to give the GOP the advantage it needed to pull off an unexpectedly strong victory Tuesday according to exit polls conducted for The Associated Press and television networksDisdain toward both parties dominatedThe vast majority of voters had a negative view of one or both parties and about either President Barack Obama or Republican leaders in Congress Where those groups overlapped  among voters who had an unfavorable opinion of both Democrats and Republicans 17 percent and those who were dissatisfied or angry with both the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress 28 percent  Republicans gained a clear advantage These voters favored Republican candidates by about a 21 marginThese groups took negative views on two key issues too Threequarters of those who were unhappy with both Obama and Republican leadership felt that the economy is getting worse or is already bad and stagnating Twothirds of them said the 2010 health care law went too far They were more likely to feel anger toward Obama than GOP leaders 38 percent to 25 percentAmong those who said they had an unfavorable view of both parties pessimism reigned Eight in 10 said the country is on the wrong track twothirds said life will be worse for the next generation Seven in 10 think the government is doing too many things better left to businesses and individualsAcross eight states  Colorado Florida Iowa Michigan North Carolina Ohio Virginia and Wisconsin  that are typically competitive or Democraticleaning in presidential election years the same pattern emerged Majorities expressed generally unfavorable views of each partyIn the five states in this group with Senate races 58 percent said they were angry or dissatisfied with the Obama administration and 63 percent felt that way about the Republican leaders in Congress Colorado voters were most apt to express dissatisfaction with both 37 percent and these voters broke by a 31 margin in GOP Rep Cory Gardners favorA look at how turnout and discontent combined to produce a big night for Republicans___WHO DID COSTLY TURNOUT OPERATIONS REACHThe Republican National Committee attributed much of the partys success to its costly voter turnout program that targeted lowpropensity Republican voters GOP officials spent millions of dollars on technology upgrades and new staff to collect data on prospective voters and ensure they cast ballots claiming Wednesday that it had fundamentally changed its strategy and expanded the electorateThe exit polls suggest partisan turnout efforts may have had equal impact in several key states In Iowa for example 44 percent of voters said they had been contacted about voting for Democratic Senate nominee Bruce Braley while the same share said someone had reached out to them on behalf of Joni Ernst Still the group contacted by either campaign remains somewhat slim 42 percent of voters said they hadnt been contacted___AND THE RESULT LOWEST TURNOUT IN DECADESMichael McDonald an associate professor at the University of Florida who specializes in voting rates estimates that about 37 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot in the midterm elections down from 41 percent in the last midterms in 2010 If that number holds once all votes are counted it would be the lowest turnout since 1942 when voting during World War II dropped to 34 percentThat can be blamed partly on Democrats losing enthusiasm But McDonald said there are other structural reasons Three big states  California New York and Texas  didnt have a highprofile statewide race to attract voters he said which drove down the national figureWhere there are competitive elections people are voting McDonald said___SENATE STATESCOLORADOIn Colorado more than 6 in 10 voters said abortion should be legal in all or most cases Yet Sen Mark Udalls campaign focused almost exclusively on abortion failed to pull as much backing from supporters of his positions as Gardner drew among opponents Among those who think abortion ought to be legal most of the time or always 62 percent backed Udall while 82 percent of those who say it should be illegal in all or most cases backed his Republican opponentIOWAUnmarried women made up 19 percent of the electorate in Iowa about the same as in 2012 and Democrat Bruce Braley tried to appeal to them on issues like birth control and access to legal abortions They agreed on the issue according to exit polls with twothirds saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases yet Braley captured just 56 percent of their votes 15 points below Obamas support in 2012NORTH CAROLINAAlthough men slightly outnumbered women in the electorates of some competitive states women made up 53 percent of voters in North Carolina about the same as in 2008 They broke for Democrat Kay Hagan by virtually the same margin as when she won office that year At the same time black voters made up 21 percent of the electorate in North Carolina similar to the 19 percent they comprised in 2008 Despite what seem like turnout successes Hagan still lostVIRGINIAVirginia voters were most likely to say they had a negative impression of both parties 21 percent of those who voted Tuesday said they viewed both negatively and those voters broke heavily for Republican candidate Ed GillespieThe Democratic incumbent Mark Warner may have been saved by his own likability 56 percent had a favorable view of Warner just 48 percent said the same about Gillespie___METHODOLOGYExit polls of voters nationally and in 27 states were conducted for AP and the television networks by Edison Research Most interviews were conducted among randomly selected voters at a random sample of precincts nationwide and in each state In addition nationally and in 12 states with a high percentage of absentee or early voters telephone polls were conducted between Oct 24 and Nov 2 to ensure that the views of those who voted early or absentee were reflected Results

NYT,http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/the-republican-party-in-triumph/,David Brooks Well that was pretty much a complete drubbingGail Collins Dont rub it in DavidDavid I guess the Republicans will pick up between eight and 10 Senate seats once the dust settles in Alaska Virginia and Louisiana The victories at the gubernatorial level are even more impressive Scott Walkers win in Wisconsin was pretty significant The biggest surprise to me was Larry Hogan getting himself elected governor of thoroughly blue Maryland Plus Bruce Rauners win as governor of Illinois was unexpected and huge This was a national verdictGail Yeah things were even worse than I expected The most depressing result for me was Sam Brownback being reelected governor in Kansas If you can wreck the states economy and not get punished at all  I dont know what there is to sayDavid It seems to me the Republican challenge is to understand what the party has done right without getting carried away by triumphalism The Democratic challenge is to understand where the party went wrong without giving way to despair Maybe we can talk about strengths and weaknessesGail Well I guess thats better than staying here under the bed curled in a fetal position You firstDavid I guess the beginning of Republican wisdom is to understand that this was more a case of the Democrats losing this particular election than it was a case of the Republicans winning it The Democrats have talked a lot about wage stagnation and income inequality but they have offered nothing compelling to address these problems President Obama lost the House four years ago because he seemed too liberal for the country after the passage of Obamacare He lost the Senate this year because he seemed too passive not competent not in control The rollout of Obamacare was the crucial moment of his second termGail I agree that the president has often seemed passive And theres been a lot of misspeaking for somebody whos supposed to be a great communicator But I dont buy the idea that the Democrats failed to address wage stagnation and income inequality Raise the minimum wage create good jobs improve the nations roads and bridges expand quality preK programs to give the next generation a boost  thats pretty much all they talked aboutDavid The big Republican accomplishment is that they have detoxified their brand Four years ago they seemed scary and extreme to a lot of people They no longer seem that way The wins in purple states like North Carolina Iowa and Colorado are clear indications that the party can at least gain a hearing among swing voters And if the GOP presents a reasonable candidate and this years crop was very good then Republicans can win anywhere I think weve left the Sarah Palin phase and entered the Tom Cotton phaseGail I wouldnt call this years crop very good except in the sense that theyre definitely a less extreme group than we saw in the last few seasons Although some  like Joni Ernst who won the Senate seat in Iowa  are still downright scaryBut the Republicans have gotten very good at teaching their candidates how to tamp down political screechinessDavid I was especially struck by Ed Gillespies amazing showing in Virginia He ran one of the more policyoriented campaigns in the country At a time when consultants around the nation insulted voters intelligence with dumb campaigns he honored their intelligence by talking about policy and was rewarded for it win or lose Maybe it takes a guy who has been a professional consultant to not listen to the consultantsGail Virginia shocked me And Kay Hagans loss in North Carolina saddened me The new Democratic South seems to exist mainly in theoryDavid Scott Walkers victory in Wisconsin is also significant The public is clearly unhappy with public sector unions even in a traditionally progressive place like Wisconsin Faced with a budget crisis a mayor or governor can take on those unions and survive and even thrive Hell become a compelling national figure in 2016Gail Yeah when the only unions left standing are the ones composed of people who work for the taxpayers the labor movement is in a pretty sad shape The Republicans have done a very good job of making it almost impossible to organize in the private sectorDavid I wouldnt give up on private sector unions I suspect some institution will grow up to give workers more bargaining power against employers even if it doesnt look like the 20thcentury modelRepublicans should be wary of overinterpreting their mandate Scott Brown ran hard against immigration reform and he was a rare Republican loser last nightGail That seemed like a weird choice of themes for New Hampshire but maybe Brown just forgot which state he was campaigning in I will refrain from making any jokes about how his next move will be to buy a camper and head for California where Barbara Boxer is up for reelection in 2016 There will always be a woman running for the Senate somewhere who he can challengeDavid I would love to see a BrownBoxer race Sort of a setup for a UPS advertising campaign The deeper problem for Republicans is their party still has no growth agenda Figuring out a set of policies commensurate with the size of the structural economic issues is the next big taskGail See thats the frustrating thing For the last two years the Senate has had Democratic committee chairs who went out of their way to work with Republicans on economic issues But they were stonewalled by the Republican leadership And then the voters blamed the Democratic incumbents for gridlockDavid For Democrats I guess one big lesson is Stop talking to each other Democratic politicians spent the early part of the year running against the Koch brothers That argument may scare a lot of people in liberal bastions but no one outside of these bastions knows about them or caresGail Its totally true that politicians and the media care much more about campaign contributors than voters do I always secretly thought that if God wanted Americans to care about campaign finance reform he would have made it easier to explain Although there was that one brief shining moment in 2000  John McCain Presidential primary New Hampshire Amazing to think back on how that one guy in a bus just went from town meeting to town meeting talking about how to get money out of politicsGone but not quite forgottenDavid Then the Democrats came back with the 2012 playbook  all the talk about contraception and womens issues That was tone deaf given where the country isGail I dont agree at all Of course you cant give the impression that reproductive rights is the only thing youre running on But the real problem for the Democrats was that the Republicans figured out how to defuse the issueAsk me about abortion and Ill tell you that birth control pills should be sold over the counterThe Democrats arent going to have the luxury of running against the kind of CroMagnon candidates the Republicans were putting up a few years ago Although I was tickled to see that the congressman in Florida who held the menonly gathering went down the drain You know the one who felt guys needed to be by themselves so they could feel free to drink smoke and discuss serious topicsDavid Democrats also need to ask themselves what it will take for them to be a congressional party once again That means winning in places likes Arkansas once solid Democratic states Over the near term it means shelving theories about an emerging Democratic majority  hoping that a tide of Democratic voters will sweep the Democrats into permanent power That still may happen over the long term but Democrats are just terrible at appealing to white voters especially lesseducated white votersGail No matter what the demographics of the future are going to look like you obviously want candidates who can appeal to poor white and poor minority candidates at the same time But its not easy to do I dont think the Republicans are meeting uneducated white voters needs Theyre just appealing to their fear of changeDavid The core problem for Democrats it seems to me is that voters are just too skeptical of government  at least as it currently exists Obamacare may not have been a huge issue but Republicans ran lots of ads about it and it remains deeply unpopular Democrats somehow need to figure out how to offer government programs when people are innately suspicious of government as something alien and ineffectiveGail The Republicans have done a terrific job of making their base hate government even when they benefit greatly from government programs And its ironic that President Obama who ran as a great communicator has been so awful at countering that messageDavid The final point is that this election marks the end of the Obama presidencys power on the domestic front In 2008 I would not have expected it to come to this The verdict is still out on what Obamas legacy will be but its certainly true that he did not succeed where FDR Reagan and even Clinton did  in building a plausible majority for his partyGail I know that the rule of our pundit profession is that now we must turn our attention completely away from the current administration and do nothing but speculate about the presidential race in 2016 But I want to give Obama a little more time before I declare him a goner If he leaves behind a national health care program and a significant start to the battle against climate change hell have actually accomplished much more as president than Clinton did But I guess the nation wont learn to appreciate him unless hes impeached,20141105,abortion
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/11/05/us/politics/05reuters-usa-elections-women.html,WASHINGTON   Democrats hoped women voters would help them weather a tough election year but weariness with President Barack Obama and disgust with relentless partisan warfare in Washington prompted many to abandon the party they had backed two years earlierIn a bitter election marked by record spending Obamas Democrats battled a powerful headwind of frustration among women voters who said they had grown tired of the relentless attack ads on TV and unceasing warfare between Democratic and Republican lawmakersFemale voters expressed disgust with both parties but on Election Day it was the Democrats who suffered most They needed to win the womens vote by a wide margin in order to offset Republicans huge advantage among white menIn the end Democrats won women by 5 percentage points over Republicans according to exit polls  far short of the doubledigit margins they have racked up in more successful yearsDemocrats lost women voters even in states like Colorado where they ran a relentless campaign accusing Republicans of threatening access to abortion and birth control Voters tossed out Democratic Senator Mark Udall even as they rejected an antiabortion ballot initiativeMany of the dozen women interviewed by Reuters in battleground states said while they supported abortion rights they were more concerned by what they described as faltering leadership in the White House and a tendency by candidates from both parties to focus on negative attacks rather than explain what they wanted to achieveI cant vote for people who allow such negativity because it doesnt say much for their characters Theyre being politicians  theyre not being the kind of leader I want said Maxine Schein 69 a lifelong Democrat who this year voted for a thirdparty candidateWomen voters have been crucial to Democrats fortunes in recent elections to offset Republicans advantage with men Democrats captured 56 percent of the womens vote in 2006 when they won both chambers of Congress and Obama carried women by doubledigit margins in his successful 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns Republicans won 51 percent of the womens vote in the 2010 midterms when they delivered a shellacking to Democrats and regained control of the HouseDemocrats did better than that this year winning women by 52 percent versus 47 percent for Republicans according to national exit pollsRepublicans won male voters by 56 percent to 42 percentAs in other elections Democrats performed markedly better among nonmarried women carrying them by a 22point margin That was not enough to offset Republicans strong showing among married women who they carried by 10 percentage points and married and unmarried menLOSING FAITHMany said they had lost faith in Obamas ability to lead the country New militant threats abroad and stumbles at home such as the botched rollout of Obamas healthcare overhaul cast doubt on the presidents ability to keep the nation safe and the government running smoothlyI just dont feel that hes taking leadership of the country said Carol Roodvoets 46 of Grand Rapids MichiganIn recent years Democrats advantage has been bolstered by tonedeaf comments about rape by Republican candidates and a wave of personhood bills that would outlaw abortion from the moment of conception  an approach that could outlaw some kinds of birth controlAt the beginning of 2013 only 16 percent of US women polled by ReutersIpsos thought the Republican party better served their needsDemocrats in Congress pressed their advantage this year by trying to strengthen laws that require employers to pay equal wages to men and women doing the same type of work as well as campaigning heavily against Republicans who had backed personhood billsIn Colorado nearly one out of two TV ads run by Udall and his allies mentioned reproductive rights earning him the unflattering nickname Mark Uterus and a slap from the Denver Post which chided his obnoxious oneissue campaign when it endorsed his Republican challenger Cory GardnerUdalls focus on womens issues was not enough to sway voters like Tracy Marshall 57 an abortionrights supporter who backed Obama in the last two presidential electionsThe Colorado Springs homemaker said she had grown tired of the anemic economy and relentless partisan infighting She said she voted for thirdparty candidates this timeI blame both parties because I dont think anyone has been magnanimous or willing to cooperate Its embarrassing its very sad and I just feel like weve wasted so much time and so much money Marshall saidReproductive rights didnt feature as prominently in other Senate races where Democrats sought to emphasize economic issues They faced a significant disadvantage as many of the Senate races were in states where Obama and his liberal policies are not popularIn Kentucky electrician Denise AthertonBentley worried that Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes would side with Obama and permit more immigration Grimes failed to oust incumbent Republican Senator Mitch McConnell on TuesdayTheyre taking our jobs they really are And its going to destroy the middle class AthertonBentley 57 said of immigrantsIn Georgia retiree Joyce Burns said Obama was risking a biblical apocalypse by criticizing Israel The lifelong Democrat said she voted

incoming Republican majority in the Senate and expanded majority in the House might take action to approve the longdelayed CanadatoTexas Keystone XL oil pipeline joined by some Democratic lawmakers who support the environmentally contentious project Also Sen Mitch McConnell in line to become Senate majority leader could make common cause with President Barack Obama on trade agreements and some tax changes But plenty of conflict looms in the even more sharply divided government Immigration policy is one likely flashpoint___BIPARTISAN HAPPY HOURObama says hed like to drink bourbon with McConnell the Kentuckian The two have rarely met one on one The president tried to call McConnell after midnight to congratulate him on the big night for the GOP but the senator was in bed they talked later Wednesday___SCORECARDRepublicans claimed at least 52 seats in the next Senate a gain of seven with the outcome still to be decided in Alaska Virginia and Louisiana which has a runoff election Dec 6House Republicans expanded their majority swelling their numbers to heights not seen for perhaps 60 years They added more than a dozen members and were on track to meet or exceed the 246 seats they held during President Harry S Trumans administration___GOVERNORSHighlights Republicans scored upsets in Maryland Massachusetts and Illinois won hardfought reelection in presidential swing states including Florida Ohio Illinois and prevailed in Wisconsin where Gov Scott Walker may use his victory as a springboard for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination contest They also flipped Arkansas and held on in Kansas where Gov Sam Brownback narrowly won reelectionIn Colorado Democratic Gov John Hickenlooper won a nailbiter that was not decided until late Wednesday morning So did Democratic Gov Dannel Malloy in a Connecticut contest decided even later Democrats achieved a turnover in Pennsylvania where Tom Wolf ousted Gov Tom Corbett___WHAT THEYRE SAYINGMcConnell in a message meant in part for tea partyers whove blocked budget progress in the past There will be no government shutdown or default on the national debtMcConnell on Obamas vow to change immigration policy unilaterally if Congress doesnt act Its like waving a red flag in front of a bull to say if you guys dont do what I want Im going to do it on my ownObama on the election results  To everyone who voted I want you to know that I hear you To the twothirds of voters who chose not to participate in the process yesterday I hear you too All of us have to give more Americans a reason to feel like the ground is stable beneath their feet that the future is secure that there is a path for young people to succeed and that folks here in Washington are concerned about them___WHAT NOWIn short much talk of a bipartisan working relationship in Washington Easier said than doneThe GOP Senate takeover complicates Obamas agenda in his final two years in office and places more expectations on Republicans to use their dual legislative majorities to govern not just hold up what Obama wants to doBut Obama can still veto GOP legislation Senate Democrats can employ the same delaying tactics on GOP initiatives that Republicans have used against themStill its a new order The levers of power that come with the majority  committee chairmanships enhanced abilities to launch investigations that embarrass Democrats increased budget influence and more  now will fall to the GOP___SO OBAMAS HEALTH LAW IS DEADNo Its aliveRepealing Obamacare has been the Republican rallying cry for four years But they might not be any closer to that goalThe president is bound to veto bills repealing his chief domestic accomplishment Republicans would need a twothirds vote in each chamber to override Obama Senate Democrats could delay a straightforward repeal billA potentially more promising route for Republicans would be to pick off unpopular parts of the law such as some of its taxes and mandatesIf they ever do succeed in repealing the health care overhaul Republicans could find themselves in a tight spot What would they do about the estimated 10 million uninsured people who have gained coverage as a result of the law___HOW THEY DID ITOn the march to Senate control the GOP switched open seats that had been held by Democrats to their column Then they added Arkansas where incumbent Democrat Mark Pryor lost a closely fought race to Republican Tom Cotton Colorado made it five pickups Republicans avoided possible losses in Kansas Georgia and Kentucky Then came victory in North Carolina for a net gain of six seats and the Democratic Senate majority was toastA Republican turnover in Iowa made it a gain of seven___ALSO ON THE BALLOTNearly 150 ballot measures were decided Tuesday Oregon and the District of Columbia legalized the use of recreational pot In Colorado and North Dakota voters rejected measures that opponents feared could lead to bans on abortion while Tennessee voters approved a measure that

wages bringing the number of states that have passed such laws to 29 and reflecting widespread dissatisfaction with Congresss failure to increase the federal minimum of 725Residents of Washington DC and Oregon voted to allow recreational use of marijuana following the lead of Colorado and Washington State But in Florida a hotly contested measure to expand the use of marijuana for medical treatment now permitted in 23 states failed narrowly Though a majority of voters approved the measure the margin fell short of the 60 percent it needed to passSupport for lowwage workers and marijuana legalization were just two issues among the many that voters considered in 146 state ballot measures in 41 states covering such topics as genetically modified food the right to bear arms and the right to bait bearsIn Massachusetts voters upheld by a wide margin a 2011 law to allow casino gambling after heavy spending by gambling interests and in another lift for workers rights they required employers to give employees paid sick leaveThough it may seem as if voters had an overwhelming number of issues to decide the numbers of ballot measures are actually trending down according to the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California The number of citizenled initiatives and referendums was at its lowest in an evennumbered year since 1974 in part because some states have made it more difficult to put measures on the ballotJust as notable perhaps is what was not subject to the popular vote Amendments defining marriage as a heterosexual institution were missing as were measures requiring voter identification  though several initiatives dealt with early voting and voter registration States for the most part avoided the hotly disputed topic of immigration except in Oregon where voters rejected a measure that would have allowed illegal immigrants to get drivers licensesSome ballot measures are used as a political tool to raise voter interest Republican critics said some of the measures to increase the minimum wage had been placed on the ballot to bolster turnout for vulnerable Democrats but support for raising the minimum wage has historically crossed party linesI cant stress how popular of an issue it is among voters regardless of political affiliation said Tsedeye Gebreselassie a senior staff lawyer for the National Employment Law Project And the federal minimum wage has been stuck at 725 since 2009Four states  Alaska Arkansas Nebraska and South Dakota  passed measures to increase the minimum wage Alaskas measure will increase the minimum wage to 975 in 2016 the Arkansas measure raises the minimum wage to 850 by 2017 Nebraskas will rise to 9 by 2016 and South Dakotas goes to 850 By a wide margin Illinois voters also recommended an increase to the minimum wage but the vote was nonbindingBoth advocates and opponents of marijuana legalization had expected voters to approve the Oregon and Washington DC measuresThe Washington initiative makes it legal for adults to possess and grow limited amounts of marijuana for personal use while Oregons allows adults age 21 and over to have up to eight ounces of marijuana in their home and up to four plants The manufacture and sale of marijuana products would be licensed and regulated by the State Liquor Control Commission Congress may attempt to block Washingtons vote on marijuana and Representative Andy Harris a Republican from Maryland has already promised to do soBut Mason Tvert a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project which supports legalization said The movement toward ending marijuana prohibition will not go backward its simply a question of how quickly it moves forwardVoters in Alaska also moved to legalized marijuanaIn Florida where the marijuana issue figured in the governors race the story was different There John Morgan a prominent trial lawyer and a supporter of the Democratic challenger Charlie Crist spent 38 million supporting the medical marijuana measure according to Ballotpedia an online politics encyclopedia that tracks ballot initiatives Sheldon Adelson a casino magnate spent even more 55 million opposing it according to committee filingsMr Crist favored the measure and even said it might bring more younger voters to the polls potentially bolstering his support while the Republican incumbent Rick Scott and former Gov Jeb Bush also a Republican opposed it Support for the measure started strong but slipped in recent polls and Mr Crist lost to Mr ScottThe vast majority of America has not legalized marijuana so I dont think its a foregone conclusion that the nation will follow Colorado and Washington State both of which legalized recreational use of marijuana in 2012 said Kevin Sabet the head of Smart Approaches to Marijuana which opposes legalizing the recreational use of the drug As the negative effects show up it could start to turn people offAnother perennial issue gambling has become more urgent as states wrestle with casino closings and bankruptcies In Massachusetts a 2011 law allowed for three casinos and one slotmachine parlor none of which have been built The initiative to repeal the law attracted deeppocketed opposition from the gambling industry which vastly outspent anticasino groups and argued that gambling would create jobs and that the slot parlor which was under construction had already done soNo state has repealed a law expanding gambling since the era of the modern casino began in 1931 according to Clyde W Barrow a political scientist at the University of TexasPan AmericanCalifornia had perhaps the most expensive ballot measure fight in the country pitting trial lawyers against doctors over a measure that would have required doctors to take drug and alcohol tests and would also have raised the cap on pain and suffering awards in medical malpractice casesThe measure failed as doctors and insurance companies spent heavily to defeat it together the two deeppocketed sides raised more than 70 millionCalifornias governor Jerry Brown who won reelection Tuesday also spent more on television ads supporting two ballot measures than he did on his own campaign Both measures passed easily One authorizes 71 billion in water infrastructure projects during a historic drought and the other requires the state to save more in its rainyday fund and to pay down more debtCalifornia voters also approved a ballot measure intended to address prison overcrowding by reducing many nonviolent felonies to misdemeanorsSome hotbutton issues like abortion and gun control were scarce on this years ballots but in Colorado the group Personhood USA backed an amendment to defined an unborn human as a person in Colorados criminal code and wrongfuldeath act The group has twice failed to win passage of a broader amendment that would have granted personhood to an unborn human being in all areas of law and its more limited measure was again rejected by voters on TuesdayIn North Dakota voters rejected a similar amendment that said life begins at conception But in Tennessee voters approved an amendment allowing the legislature to regulate abortion a power that was denied by a State Supreme Court decision in 2000Also in Washington voters approved a measure that would expand background checks on all gun sales as well as transfers including private transactions A second rival measure that would have prevented the state from expanding checks beyond what federal requirements was trailing,20141105,abortion

midterm elections  broadly distrustful of government overwhelmingly disapproving of Congress convinced that the nations economic system favors the wealthy and doubtful that the next generation will inherit a better economic futureRepublicans went into the contest heavily favored to make significant gains typically the presidents party is on the defensive in midterm elections and most of this years battles for Senate seats were in conservative states But voters surveyed after casting their ballots both at the polls on Tuesday and by phone for those who voted early signaled deep dismay with both parties and were at least as negative about Republican congressional leaders as about President ObamaMr Obama was at the center of the campaign debate if not on the ballot as Republicans sought to exploit his unpopularity by tying Democratic candidates to him especially in the fight for control of the Senate A majority of voters said they disapproved of how the president was doing his job and about eight in 10 of those who disapproved supported RepublicansAs bleak as Democrats prospects were the party succeeded to some degree in its strategy of focusing on female voters especially minorities and single women by attacking Republicans for their legislative actions to limit access to abortion and birth controlDemocrats won a majority of women a traditionally supportive group but one that sided with Republicans by a single percentage point in 2010 the previous midterm election year That setback four years ago was a big factor in enabling Republicans to win control of the House and of many state legislatures and governorshipsOn Tuesday single women supported Democrats over Republicans by more than 20 points In Senate battlegrounds like Colorado Georgia Iowa and North Carolina Democratic candidates also won a majority of women But it was not enough to avert losses given the overwhelming support male voters provided for the RepublicansYet political independents  a group that six years ago helped propel Mr Obama to the presidency  once again supported Republicans though by a smaller margin than in 2010 Democrats also failed again in other ways to rebuild Mr Obamas broad coalition of 2008 losing among middleaged voters suburbanites and Catholics though not as badly as in 2010Democrats did hold onto groups that form their base union households gays blacks Hispanics Asians younger voters lowerincome Americans political moderates Northeasterners city dwellers Jewish voters and both those without high school educations and those with graduate degreesThe surveys of voters showed that Republicans also won their core supporters whites men older voters Southerners white Protestants veterans higherincome people weekly churchgoers white evangelical Christians and rural residents Edison Research conducted the surveys for a consortium of news media organizationsAs was true in polls throughout the year the economy was the top issue on most voters minds Nearly half selected this issue as their top concern  nearly double the number that picked health care the next most pressing issue Fewer than one in five voters named foreign policy or immigration as their primary concernDespite a range of good economic news of late including a declining unemployment rate many voters are not believersMore than threequarters said they were worried about where the economy is headed in the next year a majority of those supported Republicans Voters split evenly on whether the economy is getting better worsening or staying the same those who see it getting better backed Democrats by a threetoone margin while those who foresee conditions getting worse similarly supported RepublicansBut perhaps the most telling sign of Americans downbeat state of mind was the measure of their confidence  or lack of it  in the American dream About half the voters said they expect that the next generation will not enjoy a better life than Americans today That was a significant increase from 2010 The pessimistic voters backed Republicans two to one while the half of Americans who believe the next generation will enjoy the same or better lives voted by a similar margin for DemocratsOver all more than half of voters expressed negative feelings toward both the Democratic and Republican parties In a cautionary note for Republicans about reading too much into their victories onequarter of the voters who supported the partys candidates did so despite harboring bad feelings about the party Among voters who backed Democrats a significantly smaller share was negative toward that partyVoters stances on a number of issues emphasized the stark differences between Democrats and Republicans and suggested why it has been years since many Americans claimed they saw no difference between the partiesVoters closely split on whether samesex marriage or marijuana should be legal for example with those in favor overwhelmingly supporting Democrats and those opposed supporting Republicans by similar marginsOn several issues majorities expressed views in sync with Democrats A slim majority said abortion should remain legal supporters favored Democrats and opponents Republicans A larger majority agreed that climate change is a serious problem and those who did overwhelmingly supported Democrats while those who disagreed backed Republicans And most voters favored allowing immigrants here illegally to have a chance to seek legal status  a position at odds with Republican opposition that hardened in the course of the years campaignsVoters remain evenly divided over Mr Obamas signature Affordable Care Act which Republicans sought for a third election cycle to make an albatross around Democrats necks On that issue too voters who support the law

who got things done  not just gave memorable speeches  by recording highprofile victories legalizing samesex marriage capping property tax increases and tightening guncontrol laws He faced an unknown underfinanced socially conservative opponentInstead Mr Cuomo 56 who easily won reelection on Tuesday  but with what appeared to be a considerably smaller majority than the 65 percent that Gov Mario M Cuomo got during his bid for a second term in 1986  enters the next four years with less political clout than when the campaign began Gone is the aura of invincibility that made Albany lawmakers clear out of his path The governors future is uncertain with a presidential bid presumably blocked by Hillary Rodham ClintonMr Cuomo has hinted occasionally at the makings of a broad if workmanlike agenda for the next four years creating jobs particularly upstate rebuilding infrastructure including upgrading New Yorks aging airports demanding better performance from the states public schools But his basic message to voters has been simpler Keep this state moving forward he urged More of the sameWe are just getting started Mr Cuomo said to a jubilant crowd celebrating his victory on Tuesday night

feelings on the part of voters who in interviews frequently complained about the lack of an acceptable option Hes somewhat progressive as far as womans issues said Jeff Arberman 58 an information technology programmer who voted in Cobble Hill Brooklyn But he added that he mainly voted for Mr Cuomo because he saw him as the lesser of two evilsIn the end Mr Cuomo fell short of his own result in 2010 when he won over 62 percent of the vote against Carl P Paladino a Republican businessman from BuffaloBut Mr Cuomo also is measured against an inherited set of benchmarks His father Mario Cuomo after all won a landslide victory in his first reelection in 1986 against another Westchester County executive Andrew P ORourke  a campaign that Andrew Cuomo managedMr Cuomo himself has ruminated lately on both the pride he takes in his fathers record as a threeterm governor and the burden it imposed upon him In his memoir All Things Possible he praises his fathers unshakable sense of right and wrong And at his celebration Tuesday night he saluted him as the father of the modern Democratic Party a man who is all about principle and inspirationBut in an interview with Charlie Rose last month Mr Cuomo said that he had a different mission than his father focused more on concrete results than on philosophical inspirationMy father convinced people of the concept of progressive government especially in opposition to the Reagan era Mr Cuomo said I see my mission as proving to them that it can actually work efficiently effectivelyHe added more pointedly I heard the speeches Ive heard them all I want to see the results and the performanceYet with Mr Cuomos reputation for political mastery dented slightly some longtime Cuomo observers suggested that the governor could benefit from laying out a bolder animating vision for the next four yearsNorman Adler a semiretired political consultant recalled that Mr Cuomo had called him soon after his election in 2010 and asked What would you doMr Adler who had worked for Mario Cuomo said he urged the new governor to become an agent of serious political reform  and that if asked he would give him the same advice todayBobby Wagner went from being a Tammany Hall hack to a great reformer Mr Adler said referring to a threeterm New York City mayor Andrew could redefine himself tooFor Mr Cuomo the campaign for reelection seemed like a bother to be dispatched with rather than a victory lap to be savored Relying on his prodigious fundraising he blanketed the state with television advertising painting Mr Astorino as a dangerous ultraconservative whose views on issues like abortion were unacceptableIn contrast to the turnaround project of the past four years in which he proudly enacted ontime budgets each March Mr Cuomo heads into his second term with more of a blank slateAnd though he rattled off a list of liberal priorities as his own on Tuesday night in the same speech Mr Cuomo made clear that a centrist path was where he felt most comfortable He boasted of having resisted being pushed or pulled by the extreme forces on the left or the rightSome liberal leaders were already sounding enraged by the election results in which Republicans claimed a majority in the State Senate Mr Cuomo had promised to help Democrats take over the Senate but he was almost invisible as their candidates struggled in tight races while he devoted considerable energy promoting a new ballot line he created called the Womens Equality PartyGovernor Cuomo spent his time and money creating a fake party instead of fighting for the State Senate and congressional candidates of the party he is supposedly a member of said Bill Lipton the state director of the Working Families Party a group of labor unions and liberal activistsWith Republicans in control of the State Senate Mr Cuomo will have a smoother path to continuing his efforts to hold down spending and cut taxes But it could also prevent the governor from achieving several of his leading campaign priorities including legislation relating to immigration abortion rights the minimum wage and campaign finance reformHe has asked to be judged by the prose of governing rather than the poetry of politics said Bruce N Gyory a Democratic political consultant So the question becomes Can he continue to produce works of prose that deliver,20141105,abortion

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/upshot/election-spending-is-changing-not-just-getting-bigger.html,The title of Most Expensive Midterm Election can obscure the fact that campaigns raise and spend money very differentlyYes television advertising is still the largest line item in nearly every federal campaigns budget and it will remain so through 2016 and beyond But television advertising is being changed by access to new data about viewership while spending on digital formats is on the riseSuper PACs are here to stay but they also are different than they were four years ago In some cases they operate as a part of the party structure in others as hubs for a growing network of donors Getoutthevote work once the province of the parties and labor unions has expanded to include other advocacy organizations that have formed their own turnout operationsSo while this election like every one before it in recent times featured record amounts of spending its worth paying attention to how that money was spent and the changes affecting the election system Heres why Those changes will allow groups to reach voters with more specific political messages which can harden partisans views but also potentially bring together new and perhaps unlikely voting coalitionsIn effect the political parties which have been a dominant organizing principle in American elections have new competition for both existing voters and new audiences The changes give other organizations not just the ability to deliver a barrage of television advertisements but also and far more important the opportunity to develop their relationships with voters in a deeper wayIn the 2012 congressional elections the committees that made the most independent expenditures were national party committees This year it was the Senate Majority PAC a super PAC offshoot of the Democratic Party It spent at least 697 million directly on races It and the House Majority PAC as well as the Congressional Leadership Fund which backed House Republicans have become fixtures in campaigns Senate Republicans opted for a let a dozen super PACs bloom approach in their races this year a change from 2010 when the American Crossroads PACs did the heavy liftingThe same could be true of the Chamber of Commerce which for the first time waded into direct advocacy It has disclosed that it has spent more than 35 millionWhile Citizens United remains the law of the land there is little chance that business and union groups that have formed super PACs will not opt to use them The American Chemistry Council a trade association began making independent expenditures in the 2010 election and reported 19 million in spending in this oneOther super PACs have become like political banks for state organizations NextGen Climate Action the super PAC funded almost entirely by Thomas F Steyer a billionaire hedge fund manager and philanthropist not only spent directly in races but also put millions into environmental organizations around the nation NextGen Climate Action raised 761 million through Oct 15 The Movers  While Mr Steyers largess  he is the top overall donor to super PACs since they were created  has generated headlines the fundraising clout of other environmental organizations has also grown The League of Conservation Voters 501c4 arm and super PAC both spent more than 9 million this cycle in congressional races more than three times what the group spent in 2012 The Sierra Club spent 15 millionCombined with NextGen Climate Action the environmental movement had its biggest independent spending this cycle 47 million Should Republicans take the Senate majority it would give environmental groups a focus for rallying supporters during the next two yearsAlthough it waited until the campaigns final months to start collecting donations Freedom Partners Action Fund backed by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch spent more on campaigns this cycle than did American Crossroads the veteran Republican super PAC Freedom Partners topped 21 million in independent expenditures as did the Ending Spending Action Fund another alternative to the Republican establishmentOther groups expanded their voter turnout operations including Americans for Prosperity another Kochbacked nonprofit that claimed a network of more than 500 paid staff members across 32 states The group is not required to file spending reports outside of certain broadcast advertisements so it is unknown exactly how much the group spent on its field workPlanned Parenthood created an affiliate called Community Outreach Group that runs doortodoor canvassing operations and hires campaign staff for local Planned Parenthood organizations and its national political wings Planned Parenthoods super PAC spent nearly 15 million for turnout work this cycle The Digital Frontier  Tom Cole an Oklahoma Republican probably did not need to advertise on Pandora the online streaming music service But he did so anyway in May paying 6750 to promote his reelection to the House of RepresentativesSpending on digital platforms like Facebook is now normal nearly 500 federal candidates and committees reported direct payments to the social media company this cycle and the national party committees paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for advertising on itBut other smaller services  both social media platforms and tools used to oversee them  are attracting attention and money from political campaigns Twitter which has a smaller audience than Facebook but teems with political messages is one option for advertising dollars TrendPo which specializes in posting replies on social media platforms for political organizations and HootSuite which provides social media management are being used to help campaigns keep track of their online activityTheres greater investment on both sides of the aisle said Brian Donahue a partner at Craft MediaDigital a Republican firm that does both traditional advertising and online work for political campaigns and corporate clients It used to be only young people were reachable via mobile and online but older people are now on social media and using smartphones Its become not just a choice but criticalA growing number of firms sell online services including advertising data management and social media consulting Campaigns and committees can buy a voter file and have it enhanced with additional demographic and political information by a number of firms like Haystaq DNA founded by former staff members of President Obamas 2008 campaignRepublican committees can make targeted

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/opinion/elections-2014-the-campaign-in-north-carolina-is-not-about-nothing.html,Chapel Hill NC  Over the last few weeks it has become fashionable to ridicule this election as a jumble of debates that dont resonate with the average American The Washington Post deemed these midterms kind of  with apologies to Seinfeld  an election about nothing and many other journalists have echoed the comparison The joke is an old one as the reigning clich had it 2002 was the Seinfeld election  an election about nothing Frank Rich wrote in these pages 12 years agoTo say that an election is about nothing means that no coherent national narrative has emerged  other than the medias obsession with the tight race for control of the Senate Pundits and pollsters have published reams of charts predicting the final tally but this obsession with data has further fragmented the story rather than explained what a Republican takeover would mean Journalists have said comparatively little about what the party might do if it winsIn my state of North Carolina the neckandneck contest between the Democratic senator Kay Hagan and the Republican Thom Tillis speaker of the state House seems to turn on one question Who has provoked more voter outrage the federal government or the state legislature But this notoriously ugly and expensive race may help explain what the 2014 midterm elections are really about The answer is not nothingMs Hagan and the super PACs that aid her have mainly aimed to mobilize women and minority voters going so far as to accuse Mr Tillis of leading the effort to pass the kind of Stand Your Ground laws that caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin Mr Tilliss supporters have done their share of fearmongering among black voters too Does Kay Hagan care that one out of three babies aborted in America are black asks one radio spot Mr Tillis has mostly run against President Obama and the senator who goes right along with him in the words of one TV adBut for North Carolinians the Senate race also serves as a referendum on the recent ideological revolution in the state libertarians and social conservatives who gained control of both houses of the legislature in 2010 and the governors mansion in 2012 have obstructed access to abortion blocked the advance of gay rights cut taxes mainly for the wealthy and shrunk government investment in social servicesOn the left this election is about identity politics convincing particular groups mainly women AfricanAmericans and Latinos that they are getting a raw deal and that they should be angry Dont be fooled by the fact that socalled mainstream Republicans who want to stick tightly to the antiObama script have tried to sideline the most clamorous voices in the Tea Party and the Christian Right On the right this is a contest over ideology will North Carolinians capitulate to secularism and socialist welfare spending or will they stand strong on the principles of Christian family values and the free marketHere in North Carolina the silences speak louder than the noisy vitriol Ms Hagan  like most of her Democratic colleagues nationwide  has avoided speaking in ideological terms Her vague references to North Carolina values do not offer a clear vision of the role of government in balancing equality with liberty or personal autonomy with communal responsibility Meanwhile Republican supporters of Mr Tillis have painstakingly avoided the identity politics at work in his base where the preponderance of middleaged white men is no secretThis election has affirmed a persistent truth of American politics over the last half century The left cant talk openly about ideology while the right pretends to ignore its own identity politics The countrys political conversation is boring and unsatisfying precisely because its unspoken rules forbid politicians from acknowledging what is really going on and encourage them to talk past one anotherThe right has so thoroughly captured the terms of economic debate that American liberals  uniquely in the Western world  champion cultural issues like samesex marriage equality while avoiding serious confrontation with the structural sources of socioeconomic inequality Their ideological cowardice has left them turning sensible reform proposals like singlepayer health insurance into the Frankensteins monster of governmentsubsidized private enterprise that is the Affordable Care Act Its tough to cheerlead for a clumsy compromised law that satisfies no one no wonder they have failed to persuasively defend it in this electionOn the right the steady expansion of civil rights and the onward march of secularization have compelled conservatives to accept the political rules of multiculturalism while occasionally reserving the right to protest in the name of religious liberty But the fact that most Republican leaders  at least those deemed fit for prime time  have mastered politically correct language does not mean that the party admits that liberal identity politics reflect legitimate minority grievances Nor does it mean that they have confronted the prejudice and selfinterest in their own ranksAmericans like to think of themselves as downtoearth problemsolvers who live in a postideological society  even in their more Pollyannaish moments an almostpostracial one They imagine they are immune to the noxious isms that wracked 20thcentury Europe In 1960 the sociologist Daniel Bell proclaimed the end of ideology a good thing in his view An ideology he wrote looks at the world with eyes wide shut a closed system which prefabricates answers to any questions that might be asked At their worst ideologies are indeed smelly little orthodoxies as George Orwell put it  and identity politics can close minds too But at their best they force us to confront the assumptions that drive our kneejerk reactions to acknowledge the logic of our own beliefs and to follow that logic to its political conclusion They force honest debate about how to balance competition between worthy but conflicting goals and can yield imaginative solutions to the challenge of living together in free societyWhen I ask students in my history classes to read part of Bells book they always tell me that now that theyve stopped to look they see that he spoke too soon We all have assumptions and allegiances that shape our priorities and our reactions to new information Creeds and tribalisms abound This election is not about nothing It turns on the basic philosophical divides and racial tensions that have defined American politics since the countrys founding Its just too bad hardly anyone is talking about it,20141105,abortion
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/us/politics/midterm-elections.html,Resurgent Republicans took control of the Senate on Tuesday night expanded their hold on the House and defended some of the most closely contested governors races in a repudiation of President Obama that will reorder the political map in his final years in officePropelled by economic dissatisfaction and anger toward the president Republicans grabbed Democratic Senate seats in North Carolina Colorado Iowa West Virginia Arkansas Montana and South Dakota to gain their first Senate majority since 2006 Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky a shrewd Republican tactician cruised to reelection and stood poised to achieve a goal he has pursued for years  Senate majority leaderAn election that started as trench warfare state by state and district by district crested into a sweeping Republican victory Contests that were expected to be close were not and races expected to go Democratic broke narrowly for the Republicans The uneven character of the economic recovery added to a sense of anxiety leaving voters in a punishing mood particularly for Democrats in Southern states and the Mountain West where political polarization deepenedThe biggest surprises of the night came in North Carolina where the Republican Thom Tillis came from behind to beat Senator Kay Hagan and in Virginia There Senator Mark Warner a former Democratic governor of the state was thought to be one of the safest incumbents in his party and instead found himself clinging to the narrowest of leads against a former Republican Party chairman Ed GillespieThose contests were measures of how difficult the terrain was for Democrats in an election where Republicans put together their strategy as a referendum on the competence of government embodied by Mr ObamaHouse seats where Democrats had fought off Republican encroachment for years were finally toppled Gov Scott Walker a Republican was easily reelected in Wisconsin a state that voted twice for Mr Obama In Florida Gov Rick Scott once considered endangered finished the night on top And states that had seemingly been trending Democratic like Colorado and Iowa fell into Republican handsWith at least a nineseat gain and most likely more House Republicans will have close to 245 seats the largest Republican majority since the Truman administrationBarack Obama has our country in a ditch and many of his lieutenants running for the Senate were right there with him said Reince Priebus chairman of the Republican National Committee The punishment is going to be broad and its going to be pretty seriousThe breadth of the Republican victories also reset the political landscape ahead of the 2016 presidential campaign And it left Mr Obama with a decision to make Will he move toward Republicans in his final years in areas of common interest such as tax reform and trade or will he dig in and hope Republican overreach will give his party a lane for a comebackJust because we have a twoparty system doesnt mean we have to be in perpetual conflict vowed Mr McConnell in a victory speechWhite House officials accepted the overture and said Mr Obama had invited the bipartisan leadership of Congress to the White House on FridayFor Republicans the victories piled up winning not only Senate Democratic seats they were expected to take  Montana West Virginia South Dakota and Arkansas  but also in states that were supposed to be close Representative Cory Gardner a Republican crushed Senator Mark Udall in Colorado In Georgia the Democrat Michelle Nunn daughter of former Senator Sam Nunn was widely expected to force David Perdue a Republican businessman into a runoff for the Senate seat of Saxby Chambliss a retiring Republican Instead Mr Perdue won more than half the vote to take the race outrightSenator Pat Roberts a Kansas Republican also fended off the independent challenger Greg Orman who just weeks ago appeared headed to victoryAnd for Democrats it could get worse Votes were still being tallied in Alaska where Senator Mark Begich a Democrat was trying to hold back the wave Senator Mary L Landrieu of Louisiana was able to force her strongest Republican foe Representative Bill Cassidy into a Dec 6 runoff But the combined vote of the top two Republicans in the race easily eclipsed hersI think its a message from the American people about their concern about the direction of the country and the competency of the current administration said Senator Rob Portman of Ohio vice chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee Most people have voted to end the dysfunction and to get back to legislating on issues that will help them and their families and I think thats something that both parties need to listen toOne bright spot for Democrats came in New Hampshire where Senator Jeanne Shaheen the Democratic incumbent fended off Scott Brown the former Republican senator from Massachusetts according to projections by The Associated Press In Pennsylvania Tom Wolf a Democrat and political novice easily defeated the Republican governor Tom CorbettAnd in the panhandle of Florida Gwen Graham daughter of a former Democratic senator and governor defeated Representative Steve Southerland a Tea Party favoriteBut those high notes were swamped by the lows for the presidents party In Arkansas Representative Tom Cotton a freshman Republican and an Iraq War veteran defeated Senator Mark Pryor despite the efforts of former President Bill ClintonIn Colorado Mr Udall tried to replicate the storied ground game that helped propel his Democratic colleague Senator Michael Bennet to an unexpected victory in 2010 He was not even close and drew further criticism for running a campaign that some felt was too focused on abortion rights and contraceptionAnd in West Virginia Representative Shelley Moore Capito a Republican won the Senate seat long held by Jay Rockefeller a Democrat to become that states first female senator and the first Republican elected to the Senate from West Virginia since 1956 In Iowa Joni Ernst also made history by becoming the first woman to be elected in that states congressional delegationTwo years after handing Democrats broad victories voters again seemed to be reaching for a way to end Washington inertia Yet the results on Tuesday may serve only to reinforce it Voters appeared unsure of just what they wanted according to surveys Among those who voted for a Democrat only one out of eight expressed an unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party Republican voters were more conflicted among those who voted Republican one of four viewed the party unfavorablyMr Obama is left with the prospect of finding a new path to work with Republicans something for which he has shown little inclination and Republicans must find a way to demonstrate they are more than the party of noEven though a record 4 billion poured into the election  from the campaigns parties and outside groups for advertising and other candidate support  the money did little to stir enthusiasm as the campaign set a more dubious mark for its low levels of voter interestFor their part Democrats were hindered by their inability to persuade members of the coalition that delivered the White House to Mr Obama  young voters women and minorities  to turn out at levels seen in presidential elections Decisions like Mr Obamas delay of executive action on behalf of illegal immigrants also angered crucial constituenciesEven the president conceded the steep climb his allies facedThis is possibly the worst possible group of states for Democrats since Dwight Eisenhower Mr Obama told a Connecticut public radio station on Tuesday There are a lot of states that are being contested where they just tend to tilt RepublicanDemocratic midterm losses during the Obama presidency now rival those of both Richard M Nixon in 1974 and Bill Clinton in 1994 as the most destructive to his partys political standing in Congress in the postWorld War II era It was a stunning reversal for the president who was the first Democrat since Franklin D Roosevelt to twice win a majority of the national voteThe top issue is not jobs and the economy its ending gridlock in Washington said Mr Portman Second there is a desire to hold the administration accountable for incompetence on issues like ISIS and Ebola I dont think those goals are inconsistentWith the political climate and the electoral map playing to their decided advantage Republicans were determined not to relive the elections of 2010 and 2012 when infighting between establishment Republicans and Tea Party insurgents damaged the partys brand and elevated candidates who could not winFrom the beginning party officials decided to take sides when fierce primary challenges emerged The party establishment crushed challengers to Mr McConnell in Kentucky and to Senators Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and Lamar Alexander in TennesseeThe establishment also sent reinforcements to help Senator Thad Cochran eke out a runoff victory against a Tea Party firebrand in Mississippi cleared the Republican field for Mr Gardner in Colorado and backed winning primary candidates in Iowa North Carolina New Hampshire and AlaskaDemocrats tried to distance themselves from the presidents health care law and economic policies despite signs that both may be working In Colorado Mr Udall relied on the playbook that propelled his Colorado colleague and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chairman Senator Michael Bennet to victory in 2010 speaking almost exclusively about abortion rights and contraception That cost him the endorsement of The Denver Post which castigated him for an obnoxious oneissue campaignLost was Mr Udalls work in the Senate opposing Mr Obamas policies on security surveillance and privacyIn Kentucky Alison Lundergan Grimes considered a strong challenger to Mr McConnell lost some support when she refused to say whether she voted for Mr Obama and ran a riskaverse campaignBut mainly Democrats were working off a map heavily tilted toward Republicans in states like West Virginia South Dakota Montana Arkansas and Alaska in a year when disengaged frustrated voters and Mr Obamas low approval ratings were inevitably going to be a millstone,20141105,abortion

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/11/04/us/politics/ap-us-exit-poll.html,WASHINGTON   The glum voters who handed Republicans full control of Congress on Tuesday feel the US is stagnating under President Barack Obamas leadership but put little faith in politicians of either partyMost voters leaving polling places said they dont have much trust in government and feel the nation is off on the wrong track They were twice as likely to predict life will be worse for the next generation than to say it will get better Those feeling pessimistic were more likely to vote for Republican congressional candidatesAbove all voters worried about the economy exit polls show That angst helped Republicans take control of the Senate and add to their dominance in the HousePeople who said their own financial situation grew worse in the past two years voted for Republican congressional candidates by a 21 marginIn Concord New Hampshire Julie Votaw said she chose a straight Republican ticket to protest a lack of leadership from the White HouseI want to send a statement to the Obama administration that Im very upset the 50yearold homemaker said adding I just feel like no one is in controlOverall more than half of voters disapproved of the way Obama is handling his jobBut Republican candidates had to overcome voters displeasure with their own party leaders too More than a third of those voting for a Republican House candidate were dissatisfied or even angry with GOP leaders in Congress A quarter of Democratic voters were similarly upset with ObamaI feel we need a change in Washington somehow someway said Jodi Beauchene 44 a food merchandiser in Fargo North Dakota who turned to the Libertarian congressional candidate because shes fed up with both major partiesWhat was on voters minds___ISSUES CUT BOTH WAYSThe exit polls show just over half of voters think the government is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals a Republican mantra About twothirds feel the nation is seriously off on the wrong track  slightly more than thought that when Republicans won control of the House in 2010But on some issues most voters took positions that align more with the Democratic PartyA majority favor offering immigrants who are in the country illegally a way to stay A little more than half think abortion ought to be legal in most cases and most of the voters consider climate change a serious problemNearly twothirds think the US economic system favors the wealthy a common theme among Democratic candidatesHealth care complaints came from both sides People who said health care is their top issue were about as likely to say Obamas overhaul didnt go far enough as to say it went too far Overall those people tended to vote DemocraticPeople who said either immigration or foreign policy was their top issue tended to vote Republican___ITS THE ECONOMY STILLThe economy remains the big issue for more than 4 in 10 voters who rank it ahead of health care immigration or foreign policy And economic worries played to Republicans advantageDespite the stock markets recovery and improvements in hiring most say the US economy is stagnating or even getting worse these days the exit poll showsThe third who say the economy is improving strongly backed DemocratsA big reason voters feel glum Almost half say their own familys financial situation hasnt improved much over the past two years and a fourth say its gotten worse___WHO VOTED HOWDemocrats lost some of the female support that helped reelect Obama and Senate Democrats in 2012Still more women supported Democrats this time than in 2010As usual men leaned RepublicanWhite voters favored Republicans by a more than 20point margin Twothirds of Hispanics voted Democratic in House races and black voters were overwhelmingly for the DemocratsRepublicans did better among married people whether male or female and rural residentsSingle women and city dwellers were especially DemocraticRegular churchgoers favored Republicans while those who never attend religious services overwhelmingly voted for DemocratsVoters with incomes under 50000 generally voted for Democrats those who earn more tended to support Republicans___DISSATISFIED CUSTOMERSAntiObama feeling was a significant drag on Democrats A third of voters said their congressional choice was partly a repudiation of ObamaBut Republicans still have a lot to prove to disgruntled Americans Six in 10 voters were either dissatisfied or angry with Republican leaders in CongressBoth political parties were viewed unfavorably by a majority of midterm votersA whopping 8 in 10 disapprove of the way Congress has been doing its job while power was divided between Republicans and Democrats according to the exit poll___The survey of 19436 voters nationwide was conducted for AP and the television networks by Edison Research This includes results from interviews conducted as voters left a random sample of 281 precincts Tuesday as well as 3113 who voted early or absentee and were interviewed by landline or cellular telephone from Oct 24 through Nov 2 Results for the full sample were subject to sampling error of plus or minus 2

marijuana activists who hope to extend their winning streak across the countryOregon will join the company of Colorado and Washington state where voters approved the recreational use of marijuana two years ago The District of Columbia is on the same path unless Congress which has review power blocks the moveAnother marijuanalegalization measure in Alaska was maintaining a steady lead in early returnsOther volatile issues on state ballots on Tuesday include gambling and abortion Voters in Washington state faced with two competing measures on gun sales approved an expansion of background checks And several states including Arkansas and South Dakota approved minimum wage increasesThe District of Columbias marijuana measure would make it legal to possess up to two ounces of pot and up to three mature marijuana plants for personal use but it does not provide for the legal sale of marijuana leaving that matter up to the DC Council Thats different from the measures in Oregon and Alaska which would follow the example of Colorado and Washington state in setting up systems for regulating and taxing retail sales of marijuanaThe Drug Policy Alliance one of the leaders of the legalization campaign said Tuesdays results would bolster its efforts to push through a ballot measure in California in 2016The pace of reform is accelerating other states are sure to follow and even Congress is poised to wake from its slumber said Ethan Nadelmann the alliances executive directorOregons measure calls for pot legalization by July 1 and requires the state Liquor Control Commission to adopt regulations by Jan 1 2016   The states sheriffs were among the laws chief opponents contending that legalization would give children access to marijuana and could lead to more people driving under the influenceThe campaign in DC included a debate about race  the measures supporters said blacks in the city had been disproportionately targeted for marijuana arrestsThe criminal justice system is getting bogged down by marijuana use and a lot of the people who use marijuana arent criminals said Gary Fulwood a support staffer for the citys fire and EMS department who voted for the

showed it getting about 57 percent of the vote Twentythree states allow medical marijuanaSome of the other questions before voters TuesdayABORTIONIn Colorado and North Dakota voters rejected measures that opponents feared could lead to bans on abortionThe Colorado proposal would have added unborn human beings to the states criminal code It was the third measure on Colorado ballots in recent years seeking to grant personhood to the unbornNorth Dakota voters rejected an amendment that would have declared in the state constitution the inalienable right to life of every human being at every stage of development must be recognized and protectedIn Tennessee voters approved a measure that will give state legislators more power to regulate abortion Opponents fear it will lead to tough new laws that would jeopardize womens access to abortionsMINIMUM WAGEVoters in four states approved increases in the state minimum wage In Arkansas it will rise from 625 an hour to 850 by 2017 in Nebraska from 725 to 9 and in South Dakota from 725 to 850 In Alaska it will increase 2 an hour to 975 in 2016GUN SALESIn Washington state voters approved a measure to expand background checks on gun sales and transfers the checks will extended to private transactions and many loans and gifts The rival measure would have prevented the state from expanding checks in that fashion it was trailing statewideLike

TIMEMassachusetts voters approved a measure that supporters say will establish the nations strongest requirement for providing paid sick time to workers Workers will be able to accrue up to 40 hours

foods produced entirely or partially by genetic engineering but not apply to food served in restaurantsA similar measure was too close to call early Wednesday in OregonOpponents of the requirements  including food corporations and biotech firms  said mandatory labels would mislead consumers into thinking engineered ingredients are unsafe which scientists have not provenSUGARY DRINKSVoters in

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/opinion/what-does-2014-tell-us-about-2016.html,The 2014 election will be a fourpart test that will tell us more than who will win control of the SenateFirst how much damage has been inflicted over the past six years on the Democratic Partys brandSecond has the political calculus shifted enough to give Democratic presidential candidates a shot at Georgia breaking the Republican Partys grip on the Deep South Have two traditionally Democratic states in the Midwest Michigan and Wisconsin become viable targets for Republicans in 2016Third after the investment of millions of dollars by the Republican National Committee and conservative organizations affiliated with the Koch brothers has the Republican Party caught up with or surpassed Democrats in this years technologyintensive datadriven voter turnout operationsFourth have Republican candidates found ways to lessen the liabilities of hard right views on abortion same sex marriage contraception and other sex and reproduction linked issuesA Pew poll on Oct 23 found that voters believe Republicans could do a better job than Democrats of dealing with the threat of terrorism plus 17 points the budget deficit plus 15 the economy plus 6 and immigration plus 5 On health care traditionally an issue that favors Democrats by double digit margins the Democrats had only a 6 point edgeThe Republican advantage on national security and terrorism is of particular importance because of the growing political salience of the threat posed by the Islamic State militant organization known as ISIS An October Wall Street JournalNBC poll found that 29 percent of voters put the threat from the Islamic State at the top of all issue priorities these voters support Republicans over Democrats by a two to one marginSimilarly Gallup found that 24 percent of the public worries about the Ebola virus and confidence in the ability of the federal government to deal with the threat declined from 61 percent to 52 percent in a matter of two weeks from Oct 5 to Oct 19 The drop in confidence was much sharper among Republicans and voters who lean Republican than it was among Democratic votersThe current finding that voters prefer Republicans over Democrats on immigration differs from polls in 2013 and earlier which showed a preference for Democrats on the issue The shift suggests that the recent surge of immigrant children crossing the border illegally has moved a substantial proportion of voters toward the more hardline policies advocated by RepublicansEqually if not more critical loyalty to the Democratic Party among two key constituencies  Hispanics according to the Pew Research Center and young voters according to Harvards Institute of Politics  has diminished In addition the level of support for the Democratic Party among whites especially working class whites continues to fall according to an NBCWall Street Journal June 2014 pollIn 2010 Pew found that Hispanic support for Democrats over Republicans stood at 6522 Going into the current election support for Democrats over Republicans declined 14 points to 5728The Harvard Institute of Politics Millennial voter survey found that among 18 to 29yearolds who definitely will vote 51 percent said they would prefer a Republicanrun Congress 47 percent said they favored Democratic control This compares to a 5543 margin in support of Democratic control of Congress in a 2010 IOP survey of this age groupThe Gallup Poll has found a slow but steady reduction in Democratic support among whites over the past two decades and a parallel increase in support among white voters for the Republican Party In the Clinton years whites favored Republicans over Democrats by 41 percentage points in the Bush years the Republican advantage grew to 54 points in the Obama years the Republican Party has pulled ahead by 95 pointsExtensive polling has already demonstrated that some of the states considered reliable sources of Democratic or Republican Electoral College votes are shifting to a more competitive statusIn Georgia two Democratic candidates Michelle Nunn who is the daughter of former Senator Sam Nunn and Jason Carter a grandson of Jimmy Carter have mounted surprisingly strong bids for Senate and governor respectively against David Purdue a Republican businessman and Nathan Deal the incumbent Republican governorWin or lose Nunn and Carters respectable showing in a low turnout midterm election is virtually certain to turn Georgia into a Democratic presidential target in 2016 The last Democratic presidential candidate to carry Georgia was Bill Clinton in 1992 who then lost Georgia to Bob Dole in 1996At the same time if two Republican governors Scott Walker in Wisconsin and Rick Snyder in Michigan win reelection these two Midwestern states will shift in 2016 from the reliably Democratic column to competitive statusDetails down to precinct level results in all the competitive races this year will be studied closely by party officials and political scientists to determine whether Republicans have caught up with Democrats in the world of bigdata hightech voter mobilizationIn the last two presidential elections the Obama campaign and Democratic interest groups remained far ahead of Republicans in the socalled ground war techniques of locating favorable voters wherever they can be found registering citizens likely to be supportive and making sure every supporter casts a ballot in person by mail or through early voting processesIn the current contest however both the Republican National Committee and the network of conservative groups allied with the Koch brothers have invested millions in microtargeting innovation and are attempting to level the playing fieldEstimates of the effectiveness of microtargeting vary but if the 2016 election is close new digital strategies developed in recent years to marshal favorable voters will be crucial to the outcomeAs the election campaign comes to a close polls suggest that Republican candidates vulnerable to war on women accusations have learned how to successfully revampSenate candidates in Virginia North Carolina and Colorado have adopted the strategy of signaling support for womens reproductive rights by pointedly endorsing access to overthecounter morning after contraceptive pillsRepresentative Cory Gardner the Republican challenging Senator Mark Udall of Colorado has not only called for the availability of the dayafter pill he has repudiated his past support for a personhood constitutional amendment that would effectively ban all abortions Initially considered the underdog Gardner has pulled ahead of Udall in most polls leading up to Election DayIf Republicans find an effective means to combat Democratic charges that the Republican Party is antiwomen Democrats will lose one of their most potent political weaponsThe 2014 election suggests that the intermittently heralded new Democratic majority in presidential elections is not inevitable that the strong allegiance of core Democratic constituencies is not assured and that the statebystate Electoral College map is changingTaken together the current contest and the 2010 election demonstrate the strength of the Republican Party in lowturnout midterm years Perhaps the most significant development in 2014 is the ability of Republican candidates to break with hard right conservative orthodoxy  even candidates whose own roots are in the hard right This capacity insofar as it is carried over into 2016 has the potential to break the proDemocratic tilt of presidential elections and to force a major strategic reevaluation by politicians and operatives in both

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/us/politics/a-guide-to-what-to-watch-for-on-election-night.html,WASHINGTON   It is a recipe for sensory overload Election returns will start flooding every device and screen Tuesday evening capturing the outcomes of 36 governors contests the battle for control of the Senate nearly 50 competitive House races and countless ballot questionsSome trends are clear A big night is expected for Republicans a dreary one for DemocratsBut some mysteries and many intriguing questions remain and their answers will emerge throughout the evening Here is a guide to what to watch for on election night and how to cut through the cacophonyHow big of a win will this be for Republicans To gauge Republican strength watch the Senate races in states that President Obama won in 2008 or 2012 If Republicans who need to pick up six seats to gain the Senate majority win in Colorado Iowa New Hampshire and North Carolina they are all but certain to take control If they lose them all or split them the fate of the Senate may not be known for some time That is because the Louisiana and Georgia contests could go to runoffs Louisiana in December Georgia in January and the results of the Alaska race may not be known for at least another dayWhat do the results tell us about the 2016 presidential raceIt can be dangerous to extrapolate too much from midterm elections But the two parties are eyeing key state races for clues about their presidential leaningsRepublicans are closely watching Colorado where Senator Mark Udall and Gov John W Hickenlooper both Democrats are in danger of losing Mr Obama won the state twice and with a younger increasingly progressive population Colorado has been trending Democratic If Representative Cory Gardner can defeat Mr Udall who made his campaign almost exclusively about abortion rights and contraception it will demonstrate that Republicans still have strength in a state that could be essential to regaining the presidencyDemocrats are hoping their Georgia candidates Michelle Nunn for the Senate and Jason Carter for governor can either win or at least post strong showings Of the states that the two parties did not compete for in the 2012 presidential race Georgia was the closest Mr Obama lost by seven points and it is gradually becoming more of a polyglot hub than an Old South vestige If Ms Nunn or Mr Carter wins or loses narrowly while drawing less than 30 percent of the white vote it suggests that Georgia will be a competitive presidential state sooner than many observers expectedDo the Clintons still have their magicWith Mr Obama largely sidelined because of unpopularity Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton became their partys most indemand figures on the campaign trail Between them they visited 25 states for more than 30 Democratic candidates Yet some of the candidates they care most about are in peril Mr Clinton visited his native Arkansas three times in the campaigns final month but his longtime friends running for governor Mike Ross and senator Mark Pryor the incumbent are both underdogs So is Alison Lundergan Grimes the Democrat challenging Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky Ms Grimess family has been close to the Clintons for over two decades but there is only so much that Clintoncentered rallies fundraisers and commercials in these Republicantilting states can do  raising the question of whether Mrs Clinton if she runs for the White House in 2016 will try to compete in states that backed her husband for president but embraced Republicans during the Obama yearsWhat can be gleaned from the House racesThere are fewer than 50 truly competitive House races and the only mystery is whether the Republicans increase their alreadysizable majority by more or fewer than 10 seats But there are a handful of contests that could make a larger statement particularly about whether voters who strongly favor one party in presidential races will elect candidates from the opposite party to the House Is America on an inexorable road to a more polarized nationalized style of politics Watch Richard Tiseis bid to become the first Republican from Massachusetts to be elected to the House in 20 years Gwen Graham the Democratic daughter of Bob Graham a former governorturnedsenator who is trying to oust a conservative Republican in Floridas panhandle and Nick J Rahall II a Democrat seeking his 20th term in West Virginia coal country a historically Democratic region that has turned sharply RepublicanWill governors races mirror the congressional racesThree governors races will play an outsize role in shaping the postelection narrative Those are in Florida Michigan and Wisconsin where Republican governors are locked in tight reelection contests in states that voted for Mr Obama in 2012Democrats seem to have their best shot in Florida where the states former Republican governor Charlie Crist is running as a Democrat against the Republican incumbent Rick Scott The polls also show upintheair races in Michigan and Wisconsin where the Republican incumbents Rick Snyder and Scott Walker appear to hold nominal leadsIf the Republicans lose one or two of these races it will complicate what might otherwise be an impressive performance for them in governors contests nationwide Republican governors in competitive states have no business losing in what should be a good year for the partyWhat happens to the Obama coalitionEvery vote counts of course but some constituencies  especially those that made up Mr Obamas victories  will play a crucial role in shaping the outcomes on TuesdayDemocrats will need to counter a strong Republican advantage with men by winning women by nearly as much That might require an even larger gender gap in some states than the 18point one in the 2012 presidential election Democrats will also need a much stronger turnout among nonwhite voters than they received in 2010 Black turnout in Georgia and North Carolina will be especially important Follow whether the black share of the electorate approaches or exceeds 2012 when blacks represented 23 percent of North Carolina voters and 30 percent in GeorgiaWho will get credit if Republicans win and who deserves it A Republican victory will have a thousand fathers As you watch the returns watch for the wewerecrucial talking points as the evening wears on Just a handful of those who will likely claim credit the Republican National Committee Senate Republicans the Karl Rovebacked American Crossroads groups aligned with the conservative Koch brothers the US Chamber of Commerce and Senator Rand Paul of KentuckyIf Democrats hold the Senate the biggest praise will not go to a person or committee but to the partys sophisticated turnout operation which was vaunted after Mr Obamas

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/opinion/elections-2014-quick-takes-from-columnists-and-contributors.html,As America completes another costly polarized and exhausting election cycle its commonplace to characterize our society as being divided into warring tribes of liberals and conservatives But this view oversimplifies the causes of our political differencesMost people arent ideologically pure and most dont derive their opinions from abstract ideologies and principles People are more strongly influenced by the effects of policies on themselves their families and their wider social networks Their views in short are often based on selfinterestThis point may seem obvious but it is overlooked by many political scientists who focus on other explanations parents and peers schools and universities political parties and leaders and that abstract and nebulous catchall values But the most straightforward explanation demographics is also the most persuasiveConsider the evidence Unemployed people are more than twice as likely as people working full time to want unemployment benefits increased AfricanAmericans are by far the most likely proponents of affirmative action and government help for AfricanAmericans Rich white men are especially likely to oppose income redistribution Of course there are many exceptions from AfricanAmerican conservatives like Herman Cain and Ben Carson to redistributionloving tycoons like Warren E Buffett and Bill Gates But they are not typicalSelfinterest is not limited to economics People who want to have sex but dont at the moment want babies are especially likely to support policies that ensure access to birth control and abortion Immigrants favor generous immigration policies Lesbians and gay men are far more likely to oppose discrimination based on sexual orientation Those who arent Christian are far more likely to oppose discrimination based on religion Those who do best under meritocracy  people who have a lot of education and excel on tests  are far more likely to want to reduce groupbased preferences like affirmative actionA focus on selfinterest helps explain why threequarters of people who went to church as children dont attend church in their 20s The young people most likely to abandon the church are those engaging in the kinds of lifestyles  involving alcohol recreational drugs premarital sex and nonmarital cohabitation  that religious conservatives condemnSomething similar explains the economic views held by collegeeducated people Most end up leaning right on taxandspend issues later in life because  having been to college  they have higher incomes Despite their early socialization as adults start making their own decisions their religion and politics usually align with their interestsRepublicans and Democrats differ in another important way in their commitments to policies that favor members of some groups over others Democrats for instance favor policies that protect racial minorities immigrants gays and nonChristians For this reason they attract members of these groups especially those with the most education Republicans in contrast favor policies that work against members of these groupsRaising the issue of interests in politics often leads to this question What about workingclass whites who vote Republican Our research confirms what other scholars have pointed out Its not true that these voters ignore their economic interests Over the past decade among whites with household incomes in the bottom fifth there have been roughly eight Republican voters for every 10 Democratic ones Among the top fifth there are around 16 Republican voters for every 10 Democratic votersIn short when lesseducated white nativeborn heterosexual Christians vote for Republicans theyre not necessarily ignoring their interests They simultaneously hold conservative views on discrimination issues and liberal views on taxandspend issues They often dont vote but when they do they split relatively evenly between the partiesAfricanAmerican churchgoers are similarly divided  conservative on lifestyle issues liberal on economic ones  but tend to favor DemocratsIf the United States set policy simply by polling its residents it would look quite different There would be greater spending on the poor health care Social Security and education Immigration would be reduced School prayer would be allowed AntiAmerican speech by Muslims would be restricted Abortion would be legal in cases of rape and fetal deformity but illegal if the abortion was motivated by not wanting more children by being poor or by being singleWhy doesnt America look like this Negotiations at the federal level result in more conservative economic policies and more liberal social policies Thats because they involve one set of highly educated wealthy representatives negotiating with another and the policies that result reflect their own core interestsJason Weeden a lawyer and psychology

on Monday while his Republican challenger Rob Astorino hunted for votes across New York City and its northern suburbs as time waned on a campaign with little suspense anywhere but in the State SenateMr Cuomo was widely expected to win a second term on Tuesday Mr Astorino the Westchester County executive has never seriously dented Mr Cuomos lead in the polls as the governor spent heavily to try to ensure an impressive and potentially statureraising margin of victoryBut there remained serious questions about whether Mr Cuomos appeal would be strong enough to deliver the State Senate into the hands of the Democrats something the governor had sworn to fight for but spent little time stumping for as the election season progressedOn Monday Mr Cuomo held a noontime getoutthevote rally in Times Square  with Kathy Hochul a former congresswoman from western New York who is his candidate for lieutenant governor The mood seemed celebratory with placardcarrying supporters in abundance  many of them members of labor unions supporting the governor  as befuddled tourists looked onAddressing the crowd Mr Cuomo brought up a recent comment by a supporter of Mr Astorinos who had suggested that New York City voters would not turn out because they were lazyTomorrow we speak with one voice the governor said They say were lazy  you show them the biggest vote in historyAlso on hand were two Democratic statewide elected officials with whom the governor has clashed Attorney General Eric T Schneiderman and State Comptroller Thomas P DiNapoli who each spoke briefly Both also hold comfortable leads in the pollsMr Astorino campaigned more aggressively with a dozen events and interviews on the agenda capped by an evening rally at a golf course in Yonkers alongside John P Cahill the Republican candidate for state attorney generalMr Astorino struck a confident tone throughout the day telling a morning radio interviewer that Tuesday would offer a lesson in how the mighty have fallenLater he stumped on Staten Island with Representative Michael G Grimm who is seeking reelection but is under indictment on charges of fraud tax evasion and perjuryIt was a sometimes ungainly pairing At a supermarket stop Mr Grimm was heckled by one passerby who told him Youre a crook You should be in jail as Mr Astorino stood silently nearbyMr Astorino later defended Mr Grimm predicting that he would be eventually cleared of the charges against him He also said he did not see any inconsistencies in campaigning with Mr Grimm while also reminding voters of another ethics imbroglio the Moreland Commission the anticorruption panel that Mr Cuomo formed and then hastily disbanded in March leading to a federal investigationGovernor Cuomo disrespected the people of New York Mr Astorino said between campaign stops He should be indicted and thrown out of officeAt an afternoon event in Albany Mr Cuomo continued to paint Mr Astorino as an extreme conservative whose views including opposition to abortion rights were out of step with New York valuesThey have offered this state nothing except a step back he said adding that their philosophy is basically this in society it is every man for themselvesIn his first four years Mr Cuomo has struck a less aggressive pose toward many other Republicans in Albany working with the rival party to pass four ontime budgets something he has consistently promoted during the campaignThe governor who fended off a primary challenge from the left in September has also promised to return control of the Senate to Democrats but has only campaigned in earnest for a fewAmong those attending the Albany event were State Senator Cecilia Tkaczyk a freshman legislator who is in a fierce rematch with George Amedore a former state assemblyman in the 46th District near AlbanyPolls have shown Ms Tkaczyk trailing Mr Amedore by 11 points Two other Democratic incumbents State Senators Ted OBrien of Rochester and Terry Gipson of Rhinebeck are also seen as vulnerableMr Cuomo said a Democratic majority would be critical to the success of his legislative goals for a second term It all rests on the Senate he saidBut in a bit of expectationadjusting he also suggested that the outcome of State Senate races rested less on his own ability to carry the Democratic ticket than on hotbutton regional issues like hydraulic fracturing the contested form of natural gas extraction that his administration has yet to make a decision about despite years of scientific study and a national trend toward Republican candidatesI dont think its going to be about coattails he told reportersMr Astorino was probably hoping the same thing as he wrapped a whirlwind day at an event at the Dunwoodie Golf Course in Yonkers He was introduced by former Gov George E Pataki who spoke about his defeat of a Democratic incumbent  Gov Mario M Cuomo in 1994 It was a surprising victory that Mr Astorino said he would love to replicateAre you ready he

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/us/montana-judicial-race-joins-big-money-fray.html,HELENA Mont   In a coffee shop on Last Chance Gulch a woman approached Mike Wheat to say she was planning to knock on doors for him Its getting pretty brutal out there she saidMr Wheat a State Supreme Court justice running in the most expensive judicial race on record in Montana nodded In a parade of menacing television ads paid for by conservative groups he has been attacked for a history of supporting extreme partisan measures voting to raise fees on hunting licenses and for allowing convicted criminals to use legal loopholes to go free On the other side unions and trial lawyers have accused his opponent Lawrence VanDyke of being in the pocket of outofstate special interestsWhen Justice Wheat 66 decided to run for another eightyear term on the court he said I never really anticipated that I would end up with a race like this I never thought it would turn into this gigantic money battleBut judicial races have been evolving into another political battleground for big money A lastminute surge of spending brought the total spent on television commercials to 121 million in 10 states according to two groups that track judicial campaign spending This election cycle the spending race has been fueled by the Republican State Leadership Committee which pledged to spend 5 million on a judicial fairness initiative and contributed 400000 in North Carolina last weekIn the one election that has already taken place in August conservative efforts were unsuccessful Despite spending more than 500000 to unseat three justices Tennessee voters retained themIn Montana independent conservative groups have spent about 640000  469000 by a political action committee financed by the Republican State Leadership Committee and 170000 by Americans for Prosperity the conservative group backed by the brothers David H and Charles G Koch according to figures provided by the Brennan Center for Justice in New York and Americans for ProsperityIn response a political action committee financed largely by Montana trial lawyers and unions has spent 475000 The money dwarfs what the candidates have raised under Montanas strict individual contribution limit of 320 132000 for Mr VanDyke and 143000 for Justice Wheat according to the most recent campaign filingsIts becoming one more log on the fire of the growth in bigmoney pressure politics said Bert Brandenburg the executive director of Justice at Stake which advocates judicial election reform Whats different is of course we want judges to be different We pay legislators to make a promise and keep a promise we pay judges to decide a case one at a time and ignore outside pressure If money affects a legislators vote it stinks If money affects a judges decision youve just violated the ConstitutionJustice Wheat a trial lawyer grew up in Montana served in the Marine Corps in Vietnam and began practicing law in 1978 He was elected to the State Legislature as a Democrat and ran unsuccessfully for attorney general before being appointed to the Supreme Court the states highest court in 2010 by a Democratic governor The next election he was subjected as all appointed justices are to a retention vote and wonHe has participated in hundreds of cases voting to require a wealthy landowner to allow access to a public waterways and to allow samesex couples to receive benefits and dissenting from the court when it allowed new gas wells to be drilled  because he said the required environmental impact studies had not been conducted In criminal cases he has sided with both the accused and the prosecution He is friendly to plaintiffs and trial lawyers voting to allow a bat manufacturer to be held liable for the death of a teenager hit in the head by a baseball and dissenting in a case in which the court denied a 12 million fee arrangement for lawyersNonetheless he has been endorsed by former justices and Republican officeholders who say they resent outofstate interference and what they view as an injection of partisanshipTo take a little sliver of my record and bend it to a political message that theyre trying to get across its wrong its disingenuous and its misleading to the voters Justice Wheat saidHis challenger Mr VanDyke 41 grew up in Montana and worked for his fathers construction company earning an engineering degree before winning a scholarship to Harvard Law School As an editor on the Law Review he defended a book that argued that it was constitutional to teach intelligent design in public school After graduating he worked in Washington and Dallas for Gibson Dunn  Crutcher the large corporate law firm that has given rise to prominent conservatives like Kenneth StarrHe came back to Montana when Tim Fox a Republican was elected attorney general in 2012 and appointed Mr VanDyke to the post of solicitor general There Mr VanDyke placed a special emphasis on writing amicus briefs supporting gun rights and antiabortion laws In one brief he wrote with Mr Fox they argued that Roe v Wade the Supreme Court decision preserving a womans right to an abortion should be reconsidered in the light of recent compelling evidence of fetal pain But he quit in May after conflicts with colleaguesAsked about critics who say he has tried to hide the extent of his conservatism from voters he said I am running on the platform that I am going to follow the law regardless of my personal preferencesCorporate interests who say they are trying to preserve jobs and create growth and trial lawyers who say they represent the voiceless against the wealthy and powerful have long gone head to head in judicial elections As in any arms race both sides say they are just trying to defend against the otherRightofcenter interests have been long outspent by leftofcenter interests on judicial races said Matt Walter the executive director of the Republican State Leadership Committee So we feel like weve provided some measure of balance for voters to make an educated choiceAlicia Bannon a lawyer at the Brennan Center said there have been some races where business groups have been vastly outspent But nationally she continued conservatives have been the bigger spenders According to her analysis Among the top 10 spenders on Supreme Court races from 2000 to 2009 69 percent of spending came from business interests and conservative groups In 2009 to 2010 the figure was 70 percent In 201112 things were more evenly divided Among the top 10 spenders in 201112 52 percent of spending came from business interests and conservative groupsMr VanDyke said courts in Montana had long been controlled by trial lawyers who funded election campaigns in a paytoplay scheme pointing to a 2004 race in which the Montana Trial Lawyers Association contributed 326000 to retain a justice James C NelsonThere is no way that I could have a chance against the trial lawyer money machine without independent expenditures coming in and helping me Mr VanDyke saidAl Smith the executive director of the trial lawyers group said lawyers were trying to ensure that candidates were credible and had experience with Montana law In 2004 he said the challenger was inexperienced and the group anticipated a large amount of spending from the US Chamber of Commerce that never materializedIn 2006 2008 10 12 we didnt spend anything  nothing zero he said The idea that weve been spending all this money for decades is absolutely false,20141103,abortion

cinnamonorange tea inside a roadside cafe here in the mountains but as a dozen Democrats waited for Senator Mark Udalls campaign bus to arrive for a lastminute pep rally the air was laced with dreadIn the final polls before Election Day Mr Udall was trailing his Republican challenger Representative Cory Gardner Early voter returns tracking Colorados first major election run entirely through mailin ballots showed that Republicans had turned in 104000 more ballots than Democrats though they were hoping to close the gapDemocrats had spent the campaign assailing Mr Gardners positions on abortion and birth control trying to paint him as a CroMagnon opponent of womens reproductive rights  was their strategy failing themIm really worried about Gardner and Udall said Michael Merrifield a Democrat running for a State Senate seat who attended the Udall rally Ive even had Democrats say to me Im just tired of hearing about the womens issueI live in a Democratic district said Alma Cremonesi a property manager in nearby Colorado Springs Theyre not votingMs Cremonesi said she had a thick stack of papers with the names and contact information of hundreds of likely Democratic voters  the fruits of sophisticated voter turnout operations that in recent years have helped push Democrats over the top here and in tight elections across the country There are about 600 registered Democrats in her precinct and Ms Cremonesi said her job was to reach the 400 who had not yet mailed in their ballots It was really overwhelming she saidYears of Republican stumbles combined with booming growth along the diverse and increasingly urban Front Range of the Rocky Mountains have helped Democrats turn this states political roster as blue as the cloudless sky on this autumn morning Democrats control both Senate seats and the governors mansion and have majorities in both chambers of the state legislature But this year Republicans believe they can ride a wave of voter discontent  with new guncontrol laws health care reform and an uneven economic recovery  back into powerLets claw back that lost territory Bob Beauprez the Republican hoping to unseat Gov John W Hickenlooper said at a rally last week Lets make Colorado a red state againAs the campaign closes Democrats are still trying to convince voters that Mr Gardner is more conservative than the earnest grinning Republican who has lofted ahead in polls and won an endorsement from The Denver Post Speaking to students on the campus of Colorado College in Colorado Springs Mr Udall pointed out that Mr Gardner opposes samesex marriage and said Mr Gardners positions on climate change renewable energy and college loans showed no vision for the futureAs he does at many stops Mr Udall brought up his passion for mountain climbing to describe what has become a bitter highspending race You dont schmooze your way up a mountain he said You dont climb it by accident You dont trashtalk your way up a mountain You just go climb itThe airwaves are a blizzard of Senate campaign ads  more than 55000 have aired since January 2013 according to the Wesleyan Media Project Highpowered proxies are flying in to rouse the faithful Bill Clinton Michelle Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have come out for Mr Udall Jeb Bush the former governor of Florida and Gov Chris Christie of New Jersey are stumping for RepublicansLast week dozens of Republican volunteers packed Mr Gardners campaign offices in the college towns of Boulder and Fort Collins to get a handshake or selfie with the ampedup candidate Spotting a boy in a Denver Broncos football jersey Mr Gardner whipped out his cellphone and showed him a photo of John Elway the Broncos general manager and Hall of Fame quarterback who has donated to Mr Gardners campaignThe boys father Dave Holdbrook a truck driver who has been on disability for several years after a jobrelated injury said he had already mailed in his ballot for Mr GardnerIm really concerned about whats going to happen with Obamacare he said Spendings just out of control and Udalls lined up with Obama 100 percent of the wayMr Gardner pivoting between reporters voters and volunteers offered a rapidfire recitation of his case against the Democrats Mr Udall is a socialissues warrior who does not represent the entire states values The economic recovery may have cut unemployment to 47 percent in Colorado but it has left too many people behind especially in cities like Pueblo and Colorado Springs Government is choking off small businesses Coloradans are working harder and harder and falling further behind People in much of the state feel they have been forgotten There should never be a forgotten Colorado Mr Gardner saidOutside his Boulder office a group of students supporting immigration reform lined up to heckle Mr Gardner about his opposition to granting citizenship to undocumented immigrants Republican volunteers faced them down shouting Udall lies

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/education/edlife/legally-high-marijuana-on-campus-colorado.html,In an apartment complex just outside the western edge of the University of Colorados flagship campus a 22yearold psychology major named Zach has just leaned over an expensive oil rig  a twisting glass tube that he will use to smoke shatter a hash oil concentrate Once he lights up his high will be rapid and intenseZach spends hundreds of dollars on smoking devices But he has a side income This evenings session was preceded by visits to three medical marijuana dispensaries where using his stateissued card he bought pot products to sell to friends at a markup Runners  campus argot as in running around buying for others  are an open secret on campusZach takes a seat on his overstuffed sectional and tells how it happened His first day living on campus a sophomore had taken him to a dispensary for a pizza with marijuana baked in He asked how he could get his own card and friends coached him on telling a doctor about anxiety nausea or back pain I just said I had a bike accident when I was younger and that caused lower back pain which caused nausea and that caused anxiety he recalls I was afraid it wouldnt happen so I just got all three knocked out He presented a bill mailed to his dorm as proof he was a state resident which he wasnt and received a card allowing him to access medical marijuana immediately two ounces at a timeSome of Zachs clients are under 21 and cannot buy recreational cannabis legally But others are older students who simply dont want to pay the hefty tax  three times that levied on medical marijuana So despite the abundance of recreational cannabis products since the first retail shops opened in January there is still a vibrant black market for medical marijuana which has been legal in Colorado since 2001 with a doctors recommendationTheres definitely still the demand says Zach who is on track to graduate in December He makes anywhere from a few dollars to a thousand a month depending on how much he hustles but he says that overall sales have declined a bit what with retail shops student growers and all the medical cardsIts difficult to say if students are smoking more There is no longterm data by age but statewide about 16000 18 to 24yearolds are on the medical marijuana registry Thats 14 percent of all cardholders City of Boulder tax revenue for medical marijuana for the first six months of 2014 was up 30 percent at 500000  about equal to revenue on recreational marijuanaNationally marijuana use among young adults has clearly been trending upward The percentage of college students who reported smoking within the previous year plummeted from a high of 51 percent in 1981 to a low of 265 percent in 1991 and has been zigzagging back up to some 36 percent in 2013 according to the Monitoring the Future Study at the University of Michigan Data released in September show that one of 20 college students one of 11 men gets high daily or near daily the highest rate since 1981 To put that in perspective from 1990 to 1994 fewer than one in 50 students used pot that frequentlyExperts say that the increase is surely a reflection of relaxed laws governing marijuana in some states a movement gaining momentum Floridians will face a ballot initiative on Tuesday on whether to legalize medical marijuana which is allowed in almost half the states Alaska Oregon and District of Columbia voters will decide whether to follow Colorado and Washington State where recreational marijuana has been legal since 2012The amendments ban smoking in public  on streets and in parks shops and restaurants The same holds for campuses including university housingDr Donald A Misch associate vice chancellor for health and wellness at the University of Colorado says that his main concern about the way legalization will affect students is that the industry  and associated advertising and commercialization  promotes the notion that cannabis is harmless Monitoring the Future asks high school seniors if they see great harm in smoking regularly 60 percent do not In 2005 42 percent did notDr Misch is working with other campus officials to increase awareness about the effects of the substance including its impact on learning It is not going to turn you into an ax murderer he says but what I tell people is The good news is that marijuana is in many ways better than alcohol The bad news is its not as benign as many people want you to believe Tucked away in a windowless basement room in the universitys Wardenburg Health Center three cleancut undergraduates are examining how marijuana is affecting them Breathe  a sign suggests in the softly lit room Backpacks slung to the floor the students form a restless crescent  pencils tapping legs jiggling  around a newage rug of concentric circlesDid anybody get in more trouble over the weekend asks Stephen Bentley a substance abuse counselor They hadnt The session designed to help them see the discrepancy between getting high and reaching their goals is one of three they have been mandated to attend All are under 21 and were caught smokingMarijuana citations by the campus police are in fact down  154 as of Oct 3 compared with almost 256 in the same period last year Christina Gonzales dean of students says the university is moving from a punitive stance to a more educational approach easing up on enforcement But last year 718 students who had been sent to the health center by the courts or university after a substancerelated offense mostly alcohol were found to be engaged in pot use that put them at riskMichael a sophomore from Colorado was caught over the summer in a Boulder park for possession A bike cop came up and saw me exhale He paid fines and fees of about 150 performed 24 hours of community service and had to complete Mr Bentleys threepart class If he stays out of trouble for several months the court will wipe his record clean During the summer he was smoking about five times a week but has slowed down with the start of classesMr Bentley asks the group about problems with memory which seems to resonate with Michael If I get high a number of times per week he says I notice that my memory slumps a littleMr Bentley empathizes You cant remember your car keys phoneNo its not like that If a friend tells me an answer to a problem when Im working on homework and Im not quite there yet I cant remember itSo you cant hold it in your mind Mr Bentley affirms No judgment no confrontation no labels This is the mantraMr Bentley and counselors at other universities say they are seeing a small but growing number of students who have been smoking since age 14 and are serious users He mentions dabs an exponentially powerful form of marijuana Last year he got an email from a member of the housing staff Students were wielding a butane torch in the dorm The kids were saying Were making crme brle on the hot plate Not exactly The torches heat a nail A dab of pot concentrate is placed on the head Vapors are inhaledThats the way things work in this culture says Mr Bentley who has more than 20 years in the addiction field 10 at Boulder People on the front lines are playing catchup a lot of times Word spread quickly through the staff of the potential fire hazardUniversities are searching for ways to respond to marijuana the most abused substance on campuses after alcohol But interventions are often adaptations of programs for heavy drinkers that dont capture the marijuana experience says Jason R Kilmer an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Washington In a typical program for experienced smokers students answer questions adapted from a widely used index of alcoholrelated problems Has the student ever passed out after using Got into a fight But they arent asked about eating too much coughing and problems with sleep motivation memory and attention  top unwanted effects of marijuana named in a recent survey of students by Dr Kilmer and colleagues Helping students recognize problems can prompt them to reduce consumptionSome colleges including the University of North Carolina at Wilmington Boston College and the University of Southern Indiana have been adding programs tailored to marijuana users CUBoulder offers a tier of psychoeducational options  two levels of individual sessions for mild and more serious users and a group program for moderate and heavier users For students unable to curb their use a more extensive program is being planned to help them add structure to their lives and find relaxation alternatives  yoga maybeIts a retention strategy as well Mr Bentley says Users even infrequent are more likely to drop out according to a 2013 report from the University of MarylandAlan J Budney a researcher and professor at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth ticks off academic fallout Not getting to class changing majors the B average becomes a C average  they are small things that arent disastrous but they can change the course of where you are headingResearch on universities efforts is scant Several studies have shown encouraging if shortterm results Three months after a brief intervention students from two campuses in the Northwest reported smoking less and experiencing fewer potrelated consequences ditto for Wilmington students one month after their programAt the heart of the sessions is motivational interviewing which gets students to voice their own ambivalence about their use and eventually consider changing itStudents first discuss whats good about getting high how it lubricates social interactions and dissipates boredom and stress Michael a driven computer engineering major tells Mr Bentleys group that pot helps him feel his emotions Marijuana changed my point of view on life not to take things so hard and go easier on myself And of course there are the perceptionaltering qualities Ben a junior smiles and says When youre high watching a movie or going to a concert is freaking awesomeThey also discuss whats not so good words like bad are taboo Spending too much I dont want to even think about that says Kevin the third member of the group who smoked multiple times a day as a freshman but has cut back to three or four times a week Lack of motivation scores too And anxiety If you have anxiety in your life regularly it amplifies it Ben offersAs students reveal their dislikes counselors listen intently for signs of selfmedication for anxiety depression attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder But mostly they listen for any hook that might motivate a student to cut backRelationship troubles caused by a partners disapproval of their marijuana use is a biggie says Rebecca Caldwell director of the substance abuse program in Wilmington So are slipping grades a factor motivating the three in Mr Bentleys session For an athlete it might be diminished lung capacityBecause marijuanas effects are subtle some students dont connect the dots with say feeling tired after a nights sleep Some dont want to see the connection Pot becomes part of who they are

around a table garnished for an evening of casual indulgence beers playing cards tubes of medical marijuana and a bong All are 21 or almost there and from other statesSeveral voice sentiments that are shared in other corners of campus They didnt come here simply because its located in a permissive pot town but cannabis culture certainly played a role I could have went to a bunch of sweet public schools says Erik Mingo and I chose this one because I knew it was pretty accepted here I knew people had an open mindMr Mingo dropped out after the spring semester to work at a startup He has largely quit smoking and isnt indulging on this night I just didnt really need it anymore he explains It helped me relax and think about myself and the world and I just wasnt getting the same return His

an allinclusive inside dive into the realm of cannabis cultureThe goal was to have a very nuanced discussion about marijuana said Caitlin Pratt 23 Mr Ryders colleague in student government Panelists discussed making money in the industry the effects of cannabis on the mind and efforts to legalize the substance in other states One of the most popular panels was led by Nolan Kane a CU professor

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/us/democrats-count-on-edge-with-women-to-limit-election-losses.html,WASHINGTON   Democrats are nervously counting on an enduring edge among female voters in most states to prevent a Republican rout in Tuesdays elections Yet so great is the uncertainty that even before the returns are in some are secondguessing the partys strategy of focusing more on issues like abortion and birth control than on jobs and the economyThe danger for Democratic candidates is that their advantage among women could be so reduced by dissatisfaction with President Obama and the countrys course that it is not enough to offset Republicans usual edge among the smaller population of male voters Should that happen a party pollster Geoff Garin acknowledged Theyll loseBut he and other Democratic strategists professed optimism however tempered for the partys imperiled Senate majority among other things Mr Garin pointed to surveys of states with the most competitive Senate contests showing that on average Democratic candidates lead among women by about 12 points while men favor the Republican by an average of nine points Since women account for more than half the electorate Democrats theoretically can withstand some erosion of supportAs for the partys emphasis on womens issues he said If Democrats werent running on these issues the situation would be much worseThe headwinds that you get from Obama and other factors affect everybody  they dont only blow in the faces of men Mr Garin added Even in the face of those headwinds Democrats are still much better able to succeed with women voters than with men votersIn Kentucky and Louisiana new polls grabbed attention for suggesting that Republican Senate candidates had made inroads with women Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the Senates Republican leader was essentially tied among women with the Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes in a Bluegrass Poll taken Oct 2529 But the poll by SurveyUSA does not meet polling standards of The New York Times because it was partly conducted using automated phone callsLouisianas embattled Democratic senator Mary Landrieu narrowly led her Republican challenger Bill Cassidy among women and men likely to vote by Tuesday according to a poll conducted Oct 1124 by the University of New Orleans Survey Research Center But both groups flipped in Mr Cassidys favor for the expected December runoff election that will be required by state law assuming neither candidate exceeds 50 percentYet in a number of battleground states for the Senate and for governor Democrats continue to have enough of an advantage among women to be in contention even though many of the states are heavily RepublicanThat was true for Senate candidates in Colorado Iowa Georgia Arkansas New Hampshire and North Carolina recent polls indicated In Iowa a Democrat Bruce Braley had a 12point advantage among women over his Republican rival Joni Ernst who led by 15 percentage points among men in a poll conducted for CNNORC International this week over all the two were statistically tied Ms Ernst has been a particular target of womens groups because  unlike Cory Gardner in Colorado another Republican Senate candidate  she has not backed off her support for a personhood amendment conferring constitutional rights at conception which would effectively outlaw abortion and some fertility treatments and birth control methodsBoth parties strategists are scouring the rush of final polls and state tallies of early voters to gauge whether Democrats are succeeding at their ambitious goal that has defined this campaign season persuading and turning out women particularly minority and unmarried women Those are Democrats most reliable supporters but also the groups most likely to skip voting in a nonpresidential election year Married white women are more likely to vote and tilt toward RepublicansDemocrats and allied womens groups say they are confident the partys candidates will do better among women than in 2010 the previous midterm election year when Republicans overall won female voters by a single percentage point and captured a majority of the House and many state legislatures Page Gardner founder of the Voter Participation Center which works to increase voting among unmarried women said single women are more engaged than earlier in the year A recent Washington PostABC News poll however suggested their interest is lower than in recent electionsIts certainly true that wed be doing better if we were doing better with women but I do not see a disproportionate drop with women relative to men said Anna Greenberg a Democratic pollsterTrends are hard to discern from the array of state and national polls The evidence about womens leanings is mixed and sometimes contradictoryIn Arkansas the Republican candidate Tom Cotton was tied with Senator Mark Pryor among women in a poll of likely voters conducted Oct 47 by Fox News Yet Mr Pryor had an 11point edge among women in an Oct 1923 poll for NBC News and Marist Colleges Institute for Public OpinionOn balance I am not convinced the Democrats will make sufficient inroads with white women to make up for the margin by which they are going to lose white men said Bill McInturff a Republican pollster Democrats have not won a majority of white women since 1992Tuesdays results Mr McInturff added would tell whether it is possible that the singleminded focus that most Democratic candidates attached to the war on women meant they never conveyed an economic and jobs message that might have led a higher chunk of the persuadable male vote to vote DemocratRepublicans increasingly make that argument that Democrats miscalculated in their zeal to galvanize women who otherwise would not vote in a midterm election  especially since The Denver Post this month endorsed Mr Gardner the Republican candidate for Senate criticizing the Democratic senator Mark Udall for an obnoxious oneissue campaign about contraceptivesDemocrats counter that Republicans use the phrase Republicans war on women more than Democrats to stoke a backlash among older and married women who reject partisan feministsounding rhetoric and lean Republican Ms Greenberg said Republicans were deliberately misconstruing Democrats legitimate attacks Yet she and other Democratic strategists complain their party has not effectively espoused a broader economic agenda when women tell pollsters their top concern is jobs and the economyWhite House aides say the president has tried to show how to make the case for Democratic policies and to take some credit for the economys growth yet Mr Obama himself is an unwelcome messenger given his unpopularity Nonetheless on Friday the

a case study of how a Republican can cultivate win over and retain an unusually high level of support from Democrats in a swing district while adhering to Republican positionsWhat many predicted would

right nowA former high school point guard who grew up in the town of Kinderhook Mr Gibson has run on a message of studied moderation boasting of his role with the group No Labels which has sought to counter the prevailing partisanship in WashingtonIn an interview he spoke warmly of Democratic colleagues calling Representative Peter Welch of Vermont a good friend marvelous and fantastic and saying I really like Representative Sean Patrick Maloney who has the seat Ms Hayworth hopes to reclaim and has sponsored bills with Mr GibsonHis record stands out for its ideological haziness He voted against cutting federal funds for National Public Radio and in favor of research into the causes of climate change He was the rare House Republican to support legislation prohibiting most employer discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and to oppose sending American ground troops to fight the Islamic StateOutside a school in Grand Gorge Mr Gibson ran down the motley list of groups that have endorsed or supported him The Environmental Defense Fund the National Rifle Association the state teachers union the US Chamber of Commerce How often he asked do you look at a group like that and see such an eclectic set of interests getting behind the same candidateEven voters who disagree with him over emotional issues like abortion rights he supports restrictions after 21 weeks samesex marriage he opposes it and the Affordable Care Act he voted to repeal it appreciate his rigor visibility and openness he saidIm in all these communities he said adding Voters appreciate thatIt was a not entirely implicit rebuke of Mr Eldridge who moved into the district in 2013 buying a 2 million home an hour from the 5 million Hudson Valley house he already owned with his husband Chris Hughes  and prompting claims that he had moved just to run for CongressMr Eldridge in an interview on Wednesday said that he was disheartened by Mr Gibsons electoral strength at this late stage Look to be frank he said I think his popularity is higher than one would like it to be a week out When I took on this race I certainly understood that I was challenging an incumbent who was relatively popular in the grand scheme of thingsBut he said Mr Gibsons reputation for moderation was both unearned and overstated I dont believe its moderate to vote to defund Planned Parenthood and to restrict a womans right to choose at every opportunity as hes done in Congress Mr Eldridge said at the crowded home of a Democratic councilwoman in Plattekill on Wednesday drawing nods from the party faithful most of them womenMr Eldridge a Brown University graduate who started a company that invests in local businesses built a robust political operation with seven campaign offices and 1000 volunteers But at times he has run a discordantly national race in a district deeply protective of its local identity focusing on issues like the minimum wage campaignfinance reform and abortion rightsLocal leaders said casting Mr Gibson as out of step with his neighbors had failed for a simple reason He is well liked and those neighbors do not recognize the demonized view of him in ads from Mr Eldridge and his

State Representative Joe Radinovich announces that he is there to introduce himself and in case you want to yell at me about somethingThere is reason to anticipate yellingMr Radinovich and his fellow

Medicaid expansion for the poor and approval of samesex marriageNow Mr Radinovich 28 is facing the same Republican rival he defeated by just 323 votes in 2012 and his opponent is mounting a blunt aggressive campaign accusing Democrats of overreachingThe only thing people are more disgusted with than deadlock in St Paul is oneparty control in St Paul said Dale Lueck 65 a Navy retiree who raises beef cattle and is Mr Radinovichs challenger Even people who thought that was a good idea at one point have come to be concerned about the kind of excesses that happened Mr Lueck said the other day then rumbled off in his white pickup to knock on more voters doorsTwentythree states are now controlled by Republicans and 13 by Democrats the most states under singleparty rule in six decadesWith Mr Obamas poll ratings poor and midterm elections traditionally favoring the party that does not control the White House Republicans are hoping to add Iowa and Arkansas to the states entirely under their control as well as to break the Democrats lock on power in places like Colorado and here in MinnesotaDemocrats view the governors races in Wisconsin Kansas and Michigan as among their best hopes of defeating a Republican incumbent and regaining at least some voice in those Republicanheld state capitals and are pouring energy and money into final efforts to get out the voteThe trend toward oneparty control of statehouses has made the states a testing ground for party policies in an era of gridlock in WashingtonColorado dominated entirely by Democrats approved limits on ammunition magazines background checks on private gun sales and instate college tuition for some illegal immigrants and expanded mailin voting Wisconsin held solely by Republicans sharply limited collective bargaining rights for most public sector workers reduced early voting and expanded school vouchers In both states recall elections followed and in Wisconsin thousands of protesters marched for weeks around the Capitol while some counties in Colorado called for secessionThe last two years were the most active policymaking years in states in years said Tim Storey an elections analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures And in some places I think voters may be saying Well wait a minute I think we need divided government or maybe some more balance hereAmong 36 governors races about a dozen are seen as especially close including several that will decide whether a single party keeps full control of a state What has happened now has been uncommonly extreme and harsh said Dick Bond a former Kansas Senate president who is among a group of Republicans supporting Paul Davis the Democrat challenging Gov Sam Brownback whose party has carried out a firm agenda of tax cuts since 2011With more than 6000 state legislative elections dominance in about 15 state legislative chambers might shift and the parties are fighting strategically for the few seats that would allow them to take control of a legislative chamber  and either gain singleparty control or in more cases end it for the other partyRepublicans have their eyes on upper houses in Colorado Iowa Maine Nevada and Oregon and lower houses in Kentucky Minnesota New Hampshire New Mexico and West Virginia Democrats say they see possibilities for taking control of State Senates in places like Pennsylvania and

requirements that workers pay fees to unions as a condition of employment taxing retirees pension income and increasing regulation of abortion facilitiesBut Dick DeVos a leading Republican donor in the state who once ran for governor said he believed that one team having the ball had proved its value in four short years particularly given the state of the economy when the Republicans took overIn Michigan we were not at a time where we had to be careful about making mistakes Mr DeVos said Having partisan bickering and no action we would have been stuck in Michigan for years We didnt have time for that Wed be stuck in last place Did they do it perfectly No Is it a better place YesIn Colorado where the Democrats won full control in 2012 there has already been fallout Two Democrats were

exceedingly close two years agoHere the Democratic Legislatures decision to approve samesex marriage in 2013 raised eyebrows a year earlier a ballot measure amending the State Constitution to define

recently feared was vulnerableShe is the one who has set the tempo of this race said Gary Rose chairman of the political science department at Sacred Heart University adding that Mr Greenberg was running a relatively lackluster campaignIn 2012 Ms Esty lent her campaign 600000 to clinch her victory against Andrew W Roraback a wellregarded Republican state legislator who was expected to seek a rematch but who was plucked by the states Democratic governor for a judgeship Many considered the move a shrewd way of sidelining a strong competitorAs this years incumbent Ms Esty has had enough help from Democratic organizations and groups to avoid having to dip into family assets giving her a bigger campaign war chest than Mr Greenberg a man she paints as an outoftouch millionaireShe has also proved to be a cagey fighter willing to engage in roughandtumble tactics but with a smile She has exploited her opponents bluntness about political hotbutton issues and cast herself as independent of President Obama a man she slathered in praise on election night in 2012As a longtime Cheshire resident who has observed her political ascendancy Professor Rose said She can be ruthless I dont mind saying thatDespite their mutual status as welltodo Ivy Leaguers  Mr Greenberg roots for Cornell while Ms Esty attended Harvard College and Yale Law School  the two candidates present stark contrastsOn abortion Mr Greenberg who has run for Congress twice says he is prolifer Ms Esty is unabashedly prochoiceShe wants to raise the income limits on the Social Security tax Mr Greenberg prefers enacting a gradual rise in the retirement age that would mostly affect those under 50Representing a district that includes the site of the Newtown school massacre in 2012 Ms Esty supports background checks for people who want to buy guns Mr Greenberg supports a barebones check but is leery of further restrictions  I believe in the Constitution is his typical refrainThere is also the delicate matter of former Gov John G Rowland Convicted in 2004 of abusing his office he now faces a return to prison for a second set of crimes resulting from efforts he made to inject himself surreptitiously into Congressional races in 2010 and 2012 in the district Ms Esty and Mr Greenberg are vying to representMr Greenberg helped the prosecutions case last month when he testified that Mr Rowland offered to help him with his 2010 race but wanted to be paid offthebooks in a manner that would have been hard to detectMr Greenberg resisted Mr Rowlands overtures and was never charged with wrongdoing Yet Ms Esty rarely misses a chance to demand that Mr Greenberg come clean about his ties to the disgraced governorHer questions are justified she has told reporters because her opponent never personally said no to RowlandIn fact Mr Greenberg had sent Mr Rowland an email explaining that he had decided to continue on my present course until the finish line and would not be needing additional consultantsThe candidates have also sparred over caustic items contained in opposition research about Mr Greenberg compiled by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that was revealed by The Hartford Courant Mr Greenberg calls the document 99 pages of hateThe bulk of the research dwells on lawsuits filed against Mr Greenberg or affiliates in his real estate business The dossier also states that Mr Greenberg identifies as Jewish a remark he found offensive especially paired with its repeated assertions that he was a shady landlord As a real estate investor Mr Greenberg has amassed a large portfolio of properties in New York and Connecticut ranging from Manhattan coops to suburban shopping centersMs Esty has disavowed any responsibility for the documents contents or existence and argues that the only one making an issue out of Mr Greenbergs religion is Mr GreenbergThe document is filled with erroneous information For example one lawsuit involving a baby sickened by lead paint had nothing to do with Mr Greenberg and after reporters pointed that out the Congressional Campaign Committee removed references to the suit from the dossier With so much hitting below the belt going on joint appearances have begun to resemble a Punch and Judy showAt a debate in Waterbury Mr Greenberg accused Ms Esty of lying in her commercials and held aloft an enlarged copy of a newspaper article that castigated her for running a dramatically misleading ad unsubstantiated by the facts that falsely claimed Mr Greenberg wanted to dismantle Social Security because he once called the system a failureI strongly disagree with the reporters assessment Ms Esty retorted claiming that the ad was assembled from the candidates own wordsThe candidates were back sharing a stage more recently at Cheshire High School There a member of the Young Republican Club challenged them to explain why campaigns engage in attack adsElections are about choices and part of what you do is draw that contrast Ms Esty saidMr Greenberg was having none of it We have a very nasty campaign where lies have been hurled at me he said prompting applause They should stopLeaning against the stage after Mondays appearance Mr Greenberg was in good spirits He said that if voters rejected him again on Tuesday there would be no fourth try With a wife five children a sprawling real estate business and an animal shelter that he and his wife built in Bloomfield to rescue animals he would keep busy I can take a hint he said smiling as he sauntered off for another cup of coffee and another round of

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/us/politics/tearful-displays-enliven-close-massachusetts-race-.html,BOSTON   It was a slightly odd question tossed to the candidates for governor during a lightning round of their last debate When was the last time you criedMartha Coakley the Democrat said she had cried that very day at the funeral of a friend who had died of leukemiaCharlie Baker the Republican ignoring the time constraint told a lengthy story about meeting a commercial fisherman who said he had ruined his sons lives when he told them to reject college football scholarships and follow him into the dying fishing industry Mr Baker choked up as he recounted the meetingIt is a mark of how lackluster this race for governor has been that the Baker fish story quickly became the only really memorable moment of the entire campaign The story took on heightened interest the next day when the Baker campaign said that the encounter had taken place in 2009 and a hunt by the news media for the fisherman had come up emptyhandedAs the Massachusetts governors race comes down to the wire with recent polls giving Mr Baker a slight edge over Ms Coakley many were left puzzling whether tearful displays of emotion help or hurt a candidate But perhaps most significantly the episode shifted the spotlight away from Ms Coakley whose campaign style has been the dominant subject of the raceIn 2010 she suffered a humiliating defeat losing to Scott Brown a Republican for the United States Senate seat long held by Edward M Kennedy She was roundly criticized for being too aloof and seeming to take the race for grantedThis time Ms Coakley 61 the state attorney general promised that no one would work harder and the news media has scrutinized her every step of the way The conclusion seems to be that for a career prosecutor who is used to keeping her emotions in check she has improved She connects with voters better shows flashes of humor and passion and makes fullthroated pleas for peoples votes And certainly she has pounded the pavement from one end of the state to the otherThe question now is whether that has been enoughVoters view Mr Baker 57 a former health care executive more favorably according to polls He too has transformed himself after a 2010 defeat when he lost the race for governor and was criticized as too harsh and angry Ms Coakley has portrayed him as a coldhearted numbers guy more concerned with the bottom line than with people this time he has sought to project a kinder gentler self People who know him say he is by nature weepy but the fish story was the first evidence of it in publicBaker 20 is not a threatening guy said Maurice Cunningham a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts Boston Hes very moderate as opposed to four years agoAll the newspapers that have made endorsements including The Boston Globe have endorsed Mr Baker who served in the administrations of two Republican governors And he leads among independents who make up 55 percent of voters in Massachusetts Only 11 percent are registered Republicans and 33 percent are DemocratsPerhaps most worrisome for Ms Coakley her money is drying up After a draining primary fight she started the fall campaign with less cash on hand As of midOctober she had 300000 in the till Mr Baker had 12 millionMr Baker has also received more outside money  an infusion of 83 million compared with 56 million for Ms CoakleyShes a better candidate than she was in 2010 shes run a better campaign and she has better people around her said Mary Anne Marsh a Democratic strategist But the one thing that hasnt changed is that shes short on moneyMs Coakley waves away questions about how the Democratic nominee could be lagging in Massachusetts where Democrats hold all statewide offices all seats in the congressional delegation and majorities in both houses of the State LegislatureWeve been making headway she said Sunday as she left a church in South Boston We know because of the ideas we have and the organizing we have were going to win this raceBut Massachusetts has never elected a female governor it was only two years ago that it elected Elizabeth Warren as its first female senatorAnd Ms Coakley is not benefiting from the kind of gender gap that helped propel Ms Warren into office Independent women are tacking away from the Democrat said David Paleologos a pollster at Suffolk University His polling released Thursday found Ms Coakley with a mere fivepercentagepoint advantage among women whereas Ms Warren enjoyed a 20point advantage in polls in 2012Mr Baker has stressed the need to balance the states oneparty rule as he points to recent embarrassments  the deaths of children supposedly under state protection the breakdown of the website for the states health insurance marketplace scandals at the states drug labMr Baker avoids mentioning that he is a Republican Ms Coakley mentions it often Mr Baker tries to blur policy differences between himself and Ms Coakley she emphasizes their differences and priorities such as her support for early childhood education reducing the costs of student loans and backing a ballot measure to give employees up to 40 hours of sick timeAlways supportive of abortion rights Mr Baker this year has emphasized his support for samesex marriage even making a campaign commercial with his gay brother He has at least neutralized Ms Coakleys leadership on that issue  as attorney general she filed an early challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act which forbade recognition of samesex marriagesMr Baker has gone after traditional Democratic voters in other ways putting forth an urban agenda for example that includes increasing the states earnedincome tax credit to help lowincome workers He promoted it Sunday among Haitian voters in the distressed Mattapan section of BostonGov Deval Patrick has been dubious about the repackaged Mr Baker He is singing the same tune in a sweeter key but the lyrics are exactly the same Mr Patrick told Democrats in Lowell last weekend as he sought to fire them up to canvass the neighborhoods for Ms CoakleyDemocrats have a vaunted getoutthevote operation and if Ms Coakley does win much of the credit will go to the party organizationI cant challenge that 8 million thats come in in negative advertising because we dont have the money she told those same canvassers in Lowell But we have the feet and we have the hands and we have the votes and thats how were going to win Right,20141031,abortion

the campaign trailGov Pat Quinn of Illinois has thrown open his arms to the president who told a crowd of 6000 recently I care about what happens hereGovernor Quinn desperately needs black voters who still adore President Obama to turn out in force for him on Election Day For his part the president wants to avoid the embarrassment of losing deepblue IllinoisBut despite Mr Obamas support and some positive economic news this year Governor Quinn is running no better than neckandneck with a wealthy political novice Bruce Rauner Promising to use his business skills to tame state government Mr Rauner has poured 26 million of his fortune into tapping voter fatigue over high taxes and oneparty rule in Springfield the state capitalIn their final debate last week both candidates reduced their messages to single words numbingly repeated The governor battered Mr Rauner as a billionaire and Mr Rauner labeled Governor Quinn a failureThe unexpectedly close race has become a battle over geography and demographics with Mr Rauner looking to maximize support in the suburbs north and west of Chicago especially among white women while Governor Quinn reaches out to blacks in the city and southern suburbsIn visits to three AfricanAmerican churches on Sunday the governor harped on one issue to motivate voters raising the state minimum wage to 10 an hour He quoted the prophet Amos One of the things he said was Woe to those who afflict the poor Governor Quinn said at the Lighthouse Church of All Nations And that is why I believe in raising the minimum wage in IllinoisThe Quinn campaign points to tapes of Mr Rauner advocating a position he no longer says he holds that the state would be better off if its 825 minimum wage was 1 lower It rarely misses a chance to highlight the Republicans extreme wealth  his nine homes and ranches a 140000 membership in a wine clubStill Mr Rauner 58 has gained support by promising relief from Illinoiss sordid political history He tells audiences of his teenage daughter who did not want him to become governor because then she feared he would go to prison Two recent Illinois governors were convicted of corruption George Ryan a Republican and Rod R Blagojevich a Democrat whose 2009 impeachment ushered Mr Quinn the lieutenant governor into officeGovernor Quinn was elected governor in his own right by a thin margin in 2010 but he continues to suffer from perceptions that he is in some ways an accidental governor and not the true boss in Springfield where entrenched Democratic lawmakers have held power for decades The Chicago Tribune measured the governors job approval at only 34 percent last weekAt a restaurant that Mr Rauner visited on the northern edge of Cook County on Saturday diners mostly white complained of a state tax hike on personal and business incomes in 2011 originally meant to be temporary which Governor Quinn now says should be permanentI have never voted for a Republican anything in my life but I voted for Rauner said Paulette Kirscher 69 a school teacherturnedbusiness owner who cast her ballot in early voting I am very unhappy about these Illinois politicians I think things need to changeThe Tribune poll suggests that Mr Rauner has pulled essentially even with Governor Quinn because of voters like Ms Kirscher white suburban women who strongly favored the RepublicanMs Kirscher said she would not have broken her lifelong Democratic allegiance if not for assurances that Mr Rauner would protect abortion rights He says he has no social agenda Asked on Saturday about a charge that Gloria Steinem the womens rights activist made at a Quinn rally  that Mr Rauner could not be trusted to protect abortion rights  he replied Thats baloneyI have an agenda that is about jobs and schools and taxes and fighting corruption he said I dont have a social agendaSenator Mark S Kirk of Illinois the second Republican in the Senate to support samesex marriage said that being a social moderate and fiscal conservative was the key to a Republican winning statewide in Illinois He praised Mr Rauners choice to steer clear of recent Chicago appearances by two Republican firebrands Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of TexasMr Rauner promises to roll back the 67 percent personal income tax increase of 2011 The tax raise was originally sold as a way to fix Illinoiss budget crisis including 100 billion owed to retired public employees the worst pension mess in the nation Governor Quinn forced through a separate pension rescue last year which unions are fighting in courtThe governor maintains that a tax rollback would cost the state 4 billion and lead to teacher layoffs and cuts to social services like child careMr Rauners pitch is simple Democrats have had their chance and failed But he has offered few details about how to balance the states books In an interview he said taxes could be lowered without cutting into schools by eliminating wasteful spendingIllinois has become the worstrun state in America he said I can really shake it up in a way that a standard politician cantThe Quinn campaign has dug into Mr Rauners career as a private equity investor to portray him as heartlessMr Rauner whose 2013 income was 601 million was chairman of the private equity partnership GTCR which bought and sold interests in hundreds of companies He boasts of making millions of dollars for the Illinois teachers pension fund but some investments ran into trouble Three officials of one company went to prison for accounting fraud At a trial now underway in Florida GTCR is accused of selling a nursing home operator to avoid damages in wrongful death suits Mr Rauner has said he was unaware of such problemsOver lunch at a McDonalds  a choice in keeping with the governors portrayal of himself as more in touch with everyday people  he had harsh words for Mr Rauners careerHe calls himself a businessman the governor said as he opened the packaging of a second apple pie Hes not a businessman Hes a profiteer Hes had 12 bankruptcies caused great harm to many people Hes given himself a lot of money out of it Hes using it now to have a hostile takeover of the government of IllinoisTo counter this caricature Mr Rauner tells audiences about inheriting a work ethic and a desire to give back to the community from his family He omits mention of his father a senior executive at Motorola and paints a portrait of a Swedishspeaking grandfather who milked dairy cows and lived in a doublewide trailer He always gave back in church Mr Rauner told

illustrates the challenge ahead for candidates and their allies trying to rally voters around traditional wedge issues such as abortion and gay marriage This fall voters just have other matters on their mindsSocial issues are eclipsed by concerns about the economy health care the Islamic State group and Ebola the poll finds And hovering over each of these individual issues is a broad dissatisfaction with President Barack Obama and Republican leaders in CongressOnly 32 percent of likely voters called gay marriage an important issue compared with 91 percent ranking the economy important 78 percent with similar concerns about health care and 74 percent naming Ebola important The issue that some Democrats have emphasized most of all  abortion rights  also has been a relatively low priority with only 43 percent of likely voters in a September poll ranking it importantYet womens health and reproductive rights have been at the center of campaigns for US Senate in Alaska Iowa North Carolina and especially Colorado There half of the ads aired by Democratic Sen Mark Udall and those backing his reelection have criticized his GOP opponent Rep Cory Gardner on womens health issues They include a contention that the 40yearold congressman from eastern Colorado wants to ban some forms of birth controlDemocrats this year clearly think that all that you need is that silver bullet of social issues said Katy Atkinson a GOP political consultant in Denver Its not You need moreVoters views on domestic issues ahead of Tuesdays electionsACCESS TO BIRTH CONTROLGardner may have been able to parry the offensive by proposing that birth control pills be sold over the counter After he began airing an ad on his proposal last month  as security concerns rose amid US military action against the Islamic State group in the Middle East and the West Africa outbreak of the Ebola virus  Gardner moved ahead in public pollsGardner isnt the only Republican to propose the sale of birth control without a prescription So too have Republicans running for Senate in North Carolina Virginia and MinnesotaThe poll shows this birth control pill plan is more popular with Democrats than Republicans nationally Overall 50 percent of likely voters are in favor of allowing the sale of oral contraceptives over the counter including 60 percent of Democrats and just 42 percent of RepublicansAt the same time a narrow majority of all likely voters back the Affordable Care Act requirement that prescription contraception be fully covered by insurance Notably that latter provision means selling birth control pills without a prescription would actually raise the outofpocket costs for consumers___HEALTH OVERHAULOne domestic issue that remains a priority for Americans is health care Only 3 in 10 say they support the overhaul passed in 2010 while nearly half 48 percent oppose itMore Americans overall trust the Democratic Party 33 percent than the Republican Party 24 percent to handle the issue but among likely voters the Democratic advantage narrows to 4 points 36 percent to 32 percentIf forced to choose a fate for the law more voters say it should be repealed completely rather than implemented as written 58 percent to 40 percent On the other hand most believe the law will go into effect in something close to its current form 16 percent think the law will be implemented as passed and 47 percent expect only minor changes Just a third expect major changes or a complete repealEven among those who expect Republicans to control both the House and Senate after this years election 51 percent expect at most minor changes to the law___SAMESEX MARRIAGEEarlier this month the Supreme Court allowed samesex marriages to proceed in five states where federal judges had overturned statelevel bans The issue remains a low priority for votersA majority of likely voters 56 percent say they think such rulings are inappropriate and 59 percent say laws about samesex marriage ought to be the responsibility of state governments Voters are divided on samesex marriage in their own state however with 44 percent in favor and 45 percent opposed while 10 percent are neutralStill most see the fight over gay marriage as one thats largely decided Nearly twothirds say samesex marriage is likely to be legal nationwide in the next five years___IMMIGRATIONThe poll suggests immigration is fading from voters minds as campaigns and the government in Washington have focused elsewhereSixtyfive percent of likely voters and 57 percent of all Americans now call immigration an extremely or very important issue The number among all Americans is down slightly from 62 percent in a July poll that was conducted amid news of a rising number of unaccompanied children attempting to cross the borderSix in 10 likely voters 61 percent say illegal immigration is an extremely or very serious problem for the country and the share of adults saying so has fallen 12 points since July from 67 percent to 55 percent Fiftythree percent favor providing a way for immigrants already in the United States illegally to become citizens___The APGfK Poll was conducted Oct

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/opinion/a-supreme-court-misstep-on-voting-rights.html,Two articles about young people in search of an education caught my attention last week Both appeared in The Times on the same day One celebrated the improbable journey of a young man from a Rwandan dump to the halls of Harvard Justus Uwayesu photographed in front of the iconic John Harvard statue in Harvard Yard didnt run as the other children did when a American charity worker approached them more than a decade ago as they scavenged for food I want to go to school the boy told his American rescuer This fall he enrolled as a freshman at HarvardThe other story reported the intervention of New York State officials in a scandalous situation in suburban school districts in the New York City area Faced with an influx of undocumented Central American children whom immigration authorities have released to live with relatives or other sponsors school districts in the region seem to be doing their best to keep these kids out of schoolSchool officials know they cant demand proof of legal immigration status thanks to Plyler v Doe a 1982 decision in which the Supreme Court ruled that states cant exclude undocumented children from the free public education provided to all other children So school systems have been demanding proof of residency in the district which families who are trying to make the best of patchwork and lastminute arrangements often cant provide The bureaucratic impasse has left these children finally safe from the gang violence that led to their long journeys north languishing in their new homes The state is investigating The students have a constitutional right to be educated John B King Jr New Yorks education commissioner said last weekHuman potential enabled and human potential suppressed The two stories are opposite sides of the coin Ill focus here on the undocumented children and on the brief shining moment 32 years ago when the conservative Burger court ruled for the undocumented children But this isnt just a walk down memory lane The story of Plyler v Doe contains a lesson for the Roberts court todayThe alien children case as Plyler v Doe was known at the court was big news in its day But it soon faded from view because the state that had tried to keep the children out of school was an outlier Big surprise it was Texas No other state had dreamed up such a policy so the decision had no immediate impact outside a single states borders The decision was scarcely heard from again until the wave of antiimmigrant legislation in the past decade Im quite sure that Arizona and other show me your papers states would have barred the schoolhouse door to undocumented children if they thought they could get away with itAlso Plyler v Doe was a selfconsciously nonexpansive decision The vote was 5 to 4 The question the court addressed was whether consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment Texas may deny to undocumented schoolage children the free public education that it provides to children who are citizens of the United States or legally admitted aliens Note that Justice William J Brennan Jr whose majority opinion I just quoted was a man ahead of his time in his use of undocumented when the much more common word choice in this newspaper and nearly everywhere else was illegal alienThe court answered the question precisely addressing only the right of the children and only their right to an education As became clear when several justices papers were opened to the public years later the majority opinion was the result of an intense behindthescenes struggle between Justice Brennan the leader of the courts shrinking liberal bloc and Justice Lewis F Powell Jr a Nixon appointee well to Justice Brennans rightJustice Brennans initial instinct was to use the case with its sympathetic facts to accomplish two cherished goals to declare that education was in constitutional terms a fundamental right and to give the most exacting judicial scrutiny to government policies that drew distinctions between legal residents and undocumented aliens The result would have been greatly enhanced constitutional protection for noncitizens Brennan had four votes for these propositions but he needed a fifthThe only potential fifth vote was that of Justice Powell a former head of the Richmond Va school board who believed strongly in the value of public education He agreed from the outset that the Texas policy was unconstitutional But he refused to sign on to Justice Brennans sweeping constitutional vision In 1973 over Justice Brennans dissent he had written the majority opinion in San Antonio Independent School District v Rodriguez holding that the inequality resulting from local propertytaxbased school financing did not violate the Constitution and rejecting the notion that education was a fundamental rightAs I reconstructed the Plyler v Doe backstory based on the justices papers Justices Brennan and Powell engaged in a genteel but deadly earnest fencing match over what the opinion should say Powell stood his ground insisting that he would sign no opinion broader than necessary to resolve the problem at hand Brennan scaled back his ambitions bit by bit until he reached Powells comfort zone Even the narrow final result went too far for a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department who made his disappointment clear to his boss Attorney General William French Smith This is a case in which our supposed litigation program to encourage judicial restraint did not get off the ground and should have John G Roberts Jr wrote in a memo that came to light when he was named to the Supreme CourtMy point in this narrative is to bring us to Justice Powells concurring opinion He emphasized the unique character of the case  in other words take this decision for what it is and dont try to extrapolate It hardly can be argued rationally he said that anyone benefits from the creation within our borders of a subclass of illiterate persons many of whom will remain in the state adding to the problems and costs of both state and national governments attendant upon unemployment welfare and crimeThis wasnt poetry and it wasnt elaborate constitutional doctrine It was common sense Justice Powell argued not from the vantage point of the children so much as from that of American society as a whole The Supreme Court in his view was appropriately intervening to save the country from a policy demonstrably destructive of the social fabricThat brings me as promised to the Roberts court Late on a Friday night earlier this month the Supreme Court voted in another case from Texas to permit the states voter ID law the strictest in the country to take effect A federal district judge in Corpus Christi found after a nineday trial that the laws stringent requirements for particular forms of identification would prevent as many as 600000 Texans 45 percent of all those registered from voting next month The impact Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos found would fall disproportionately on black and Latino Texans She ruled that the law violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965  the section that remains functional after the Supreme Court cut the heart out of that law last year  and that it operated as an unconstitutional poll tax Judge Ramos issued a permanent injunction to bar the state from applying the lawThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  yes the same court that brought us the Texas abortion clinic closings before the Supreme Court granted a reprieve two weeks ago  gave Texas an immediate stay of the ruling putting the voter ID law back into effect for next weeks election The plaintiffs then asked the Supreme Court to lift the stayThe six justices who let the stay remain in effect didnt bother to explain themselves beyond the word denied That left it to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and two others Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan to explain in dissent what was wrong with that outcome Where was Justice Stephen G Breyer I have no idea The dissent was issued shortly after 5 am on the morning of Saturday Oct 18 the 81yearold Justice Ginsburg having stayed up all night to finish itThe greatest threat to public confidence in elections in this case Justice Ginsburg said is the prospect of enforcing a purposefully discriminatory law one that likely imposes an unconstitutional poll tax and risks denying the right to vote to hundreds of thousands of eligible voters A law in other words that in the full glare of publicity and on the verge of a highly polarized election threatens destruction to the social fabric in the most dangerous way by shutting thousands of citizens out of the democratic process of choosing their leadersThere is no right more basic in our democracy than the right to participate in electing our political leaders Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr wrote for the court in April of this year His subject then was the right to spend money in politics not the right to vote If people conclude that the current Supreme Court majority cares more about

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/us/politics/national-concerns-drain-color-from-politics-in-louisiana.html,NEW ROADS La  A politician at a street fair is usually an inconvenience an ordeal to be endured as he thrusts a flier at your chest and a smile at your face But the silverhaired candidate pushing his 1yearold in a stroller through the funnelcake stands and craft booths at the harvest festival here did not have to try so hard The gladhanders rushed up to himId vote for you I voted for you plenty of times shouted Mark Wells 58 a retired state employeeEdwin W Edwards 87 a fourterm former governor and eightyear former federal inmate is back on the trail this time as a longshot Democratic contender for a House seat and salvation for magazine feature writers in a dreary election yearFor all his color though Mr Edwards the populist rogue who embodied Louisiana politics from the 1960s to the 1990s charming one half of the state and mortifying the other might as well be a ghostThe main political event this year the Senate race could not be further removed from the Edwards era No one here at the harvest festival was particularly excited about Senator Mary L Landrieu a threeterm Democrat or Representative Bill Cassidy the Republican challenger who will most likely face Ms Landrieu in a runoff A few said they might vote for Rob Maness a hardright Tea Party favorite and retired Air Force colonel who is also running though most acknowledge his chances are slimThey used to say that the biggest sin in Louisiana politics was to be boring said R Michael McHale a lawyer in Lake Charles Now Louisianas become more like Washington To a certain extent elections arent even about Louisiana anymoreLouisianans will say and perhaps scorn you if you disagree that theirs is an exceptional stateExchanges in French can still occasionally be heard among the older people on the bayou and at a Starbucks on a bland commercial strip in Lafayette it is possible to have a conversation with a woman about trapping and cleaning muskrat Much of Louisianas distinctiveness is innate given a set of natural resources  the mouth of an important river abundant oil and gas reserves underground and off the coast and a rich but exceedingly fragile coastline  that guarantee singular benefits and liabilitiesBut among the greatest expressions of Louisianas particularity have been its politics populist locally attuned based on personality rather than party fond of dealcutting often ethically dubious but above all interesting Or at least that used to be the caseRoughly 40 million has been spent on the Senate race here by campaigns and outside groups and television is saturated with a wave of nasty ads that have exasperated the factcheckers But it is not the most expensive race in the country nor is it remarkably nastier than the rest of the paintbynumbers Senate campaigns this yearMr Cassidy is running a generic if effective Republican campaign tying Ms Landrieu to President Obama to Harry Reid and to Washington in general Ms Landrieu could be described as the standardbearer for an older style of Louisiana politics with a bringhomethebacon campaign But even she is relying for her survival on millions of national ad dollars and a typical Democratic constituency of black voters and womenThere are reasons for this Over the past decade the bungled government responses to a series of hurricanes including Katrina and to the BP oil spill have drained the appeal of entertaining politicians an aversion to taxes has rendered the old populism model unsustainable and perhaps most of all the effects of 24hour news channels national political debates on television and the Internet have left hyperlocal politicking a mostly fading memoryPolitics is more nationalized now said John Breaux a former senator and among the last of the Cajun Democrats who could routinely win statewideMr Breaux was discussing the states politics over lunch at a whitecloth Italian restaurant in Washington where like many retired Louisiana legislators he is a lobbyist It used to be folks were not that concerned about what was happening everywhere else they were concerned about their own state Now theyre watching Fox News every night You have an opinion that is national in scope not Louisiana in scope he saidIn states where politics has served as a drab backdrop to daily life this might not be such a big deal But politics in Louisiana which the writer AJ Liebling once described as having an intensity and complexity matched only in the republic of Lebanon has traditionally taken center stage Even as it came to be seen as a malevolent force across the South government remained an organizing part of life here The states old Robin Hoodstyle populism  in which oil companies were heavily soaked if otherwise given full rein while taxpayers were spared  was considered quite agreeable Spending on education health care and infrastructure was generous and the people did not have to pay for itPoliticians were allowed to be funny because the idea was they werent stealing your money they were stealing Standard Oils money said Gov Bobby Jindal of LouisianaThis arrangement fell apart after the big oil bust of the 1980s The shortfall was somewhat remedied by gambling proceeds sales taxes and income taxes but these sources brought along with them corruption indictments and antitax crusades With a major boom in petrochemical activity the heady days may return But for now state services have been cut to the marrow and a 12 billion shortfall may await in next years budgetEven as the economics changed Louisianas politics remained unusual The state was alone in the Deep South in voting twice for Bill Clinton and is now the only one of the five Deep South states with a Democrat in the SenateThis distinctiveness endures in part because the state has three broad categories of voters  not two as in most other Southern states White Protestants have mostly been reliable conservatives in northern Louisiana An engaged black electorate in New Orleans and elsewhere forms a Democratic counterweightThe white Catholic voters spread across southern Louisiana many of whom identify themselves as Cajun make up the third and often electorally decisive group This bloc resists ideological labeling Cajuns are traditional and conservative but in part because of the history of discrimination against the Cajun culture in Louisiana can also be receptive to appeals about obligations to the poor and a little more forgiving on matters of personal virtueFurthermore said J Curtis Joubert 83 a former mayor of the Cajun town of Eunice they knew how to enjoy a good electionWhen chickens started hearing the sound trucks roll into town theyd hide under the houses because they knew the barbecues were going to be starting up Mr Joubert recalled The chickens dont run and hide anymore Theyre all inside watching televisionThe Waning Cult of PersonalityOver a late afternoon beer at a bar in the southern Louisiana city of Houma Norby Chabert lamented this state of affairsRetail politics is now virtually nonexistent said Mr Chabert a state senator He is a son of a populist political dynasty  his fathers name is on the local hospital But he switched parties to become a Republican in 2011 part of a wave of defections that followed the election of Mr Obama and the success of unapologetic partisans like Senator David Vitter a RepublicanNow its just BS man he said of the campaign trail Its TV and radio and direct mail Your personal style has to matter for 30 secondsFor much of the Senate race the frontrunner has been the Republican Mr Cassidy a gastroenterologist with a much milder disposition than the hardhitting antiObama message his campaign suggestsTracy Donovan Smith a lobbyist in Baton Rouge recalls one afternoon years ago when he Mr Cassidy and Mr Cassidys wife were racing down the highway to make it to a Republican gathering in New Orleans Mr Smith said he had looked up from the back seat and had been surprised to see what the Cassidys were doing in the front discussing a daily Bible lessonIts like were going to this convention we have to do our Bible study Mr Smith said admiringly I think they still do itEdwin W Edwards this is notIn an interview at a mostly empty Baton Rouge restaurant Mr Cassidy attacked the Affordable Care Act but he said he had little interest in politicsIn one sense I enjoy running for office he said Am I a political junkie Absolutely not I read biographies Of presidents But I also read Knowledge and Power by George GilderAs Louisiana politicians in either party note when his name comes up Mr Cassidy does not come off as particularly charming or polished Cassidy is as bland as this tablecloth Mr Breaux said His mannerisms arent translating was how Mr Chabert put it During the interview the impression was reinforced when Mr Cassidy guffawed in the middle of a question pointing to a television and remarking about a football player hitting another in the groin with his helmet But there is a tradition here of drytoast politicians For all their attempts at change they have tended to be remembered mostly by the punch lines about them delivered by the very rogues they were trying to oust from officeFormer Gov Earl K Long used to puncture his reformminded opponents as humorless highhats Mr Edwards used to joked of one opponent for governor David C Treen that he was so slow that it took him an hour and a half to watch 60 MinutesThese days a lack of pizazz is worn by some Louisiana Republicans as a badge of honor a sign of seriousness of purposeMr Cassidy talked of the widespread anger at the old way of politics that set in after the disasters of the last decade a fury that led to a flourishing of muckraking journalism and civic activity in New Orleans postKatrinaBilly Tauzin a DemocraticturnedRepublican former congressman and now naturally a Washingtonbased lobbyist put it this way Breaux Tauzin and Edwards were colorful And I hope we were competent But they just want competence now They want professional peopleA Change in PitchBurt Tietje is not sure it is that straightforwardMr Tietje 59 is a farmer in rural Jefferson Davis Parish in the heart of what used to be the Seventh Congressional District now extinct which sent so many Cajun Democrats to Washington including Mr Edwards and Mr BreauxMr Tietje was never attracted to that crowd His mother lost her job as a schoolteacher because of her familys opposition to the Long dynasty He was a lonely but proud Republican because that stood for good government Until it became something else he saidHe saw the Republican pitch change sometime in the 1990s A message of disdain for populism and cronyism was overshadowed by an antipathy to abortion and gun control a change driven by the Internet and cable news Any backlash to the bungled government response to the hurricanes Mr Tietje said was just a lagging indicatorThe only thing I hear in stump speeches now is national Republican issues Mr Tietje said Nobody talks about local issues anymore I watched the entire Seventh District move from populist Democrats to this rightwing guntoting majorityIn 1996 the year Ms Landrieu won a squeaker for her first Senate term the archbishop of New Orleans declared that voting for her with her advocacy of abortion rights could be considered a sin Now drivers on the way to Lafayette are greeted by a large billboard denouncing Ms Landrieus 100 proabortion voting recordAbortion and gun control are not the only issues that have driven the people of southern Louisiana away from the Democrats When there is less money to go around a populist economic agenda gives way to older resentmentsFormer Gov Mike Foster another DemocratturnedRepublican from Cajun country in a common theme here cited voters angered by welfare benefits which he called the giveaway stuff He said They drive through cities see people walking through streets or on their porches drinking beer and on some sort of take and they dont like thatPicking a SideA smattering of politicians and local officials gathered under a tent in the parking lot of St Leo the Great Church in the nostoplight town of Leonville waiting for Ms Landrieu She was coming to announce that thanks to a federal grant Leonville was finally to begin construction on a drainage culvertThis was the kind of visit that Ms Landrieu whose political family name is esteemed in New Orleans but carries less sway outside the city has been making all over the state Her case for reelection has largely been based on the clout she would have as a fourterm senatorIt is hardly a populist pitch  her campaign highlights endorsements from happy oil company executives  but it does hew to an old Louisiana line that an unfriendly federal government can be made to work for the state if properly wrangled The members of the courthouse crowds wondered if the state had changed too much for this still to work Bill OReillys takenoprisoners mentality has passed on to a lot of people said Earl Taylor the parish district attorney Its gotten so divisive You cant live in the middle ground anymore like John Breaux didNow with everyone having to pick a side even a populist appeal such as it exists comes in two starkly different varietiesOn one side is the view as explained by Mr Cassidy that an overreaching and evergrowing government personified by the deeply unpopular Mr Obama stifles industry and thus the livelihoods of the working class This is a strong message in an oilandgas state where people bump up frequently against federal regulatorsMs Landrieus version is that rampant privatization and an agenda of slashing services as personified by the deeply unpopular Governor Jindal have proved to be much more painful in practice than in theory This message has its own resonance in a state quite visibly dependent on federal money like flood insurance and disaster aidIn a brief interview under the outdoor tent Ms Landrieu talked of constituent services But she then veered into an optimistic reading of Catholic Cajun swing voters suggesting perhaps somewhat wishfully that they are being swayed by a higher power than Mr ObamaI actually feel its starting to change back Ms Landrieu said And you know whos helping Pope Francis Pope Francis is having a major impact on the way that people in Louisiana are feeling about issues of the social gospel and helping the poor and getting back to the roots of the Catholic ChurchA Wider FocusThe onetime hotbed for Cajun Democrats was Crowley a town that bills itself as the rice capital of America Both Mr Breaux and Mr Edwards got their start thereThe annual rice festival is one of the oldest festivals in the state Mr Cassidy visited on one of the days Ms Landrieu did not attend but her campaign team has highlighted her votes for price supports for rice farmers and for funding an expansion project for a nearby stretch of InterstateNone of this seemed to be on the minds of the people in the crowds The Affordable Care Act came up quickly amid an antipathy to the president generally Border security was a chief concernWhos in charge of this country the immigrants or us asked Gregory Mouton a 28yearold car salesman with bright red hair who goes by the name TRouge He was speculating on why Mr Obama seemed so reluctant to declare an Ebolarelated travel banMr Mouton the son of accordion makers said he was open to politicians of any party But he was against anyone who was as supportive of the Obama agenda as Ms Landrieu appeared to beAsked whether a politician like Mr Breaux could win this year on his kind of platform Mr Mouton pausedI dont know John Breaux he said Ive heard the name,20141030,abortion

hes talking about abortion and the economy to get his candidates across the finish lineSteyer a hedge fund manager turned environmentalist launched a stateoftheart operation to push voters to elect governors and senators willing to confront global warming His NextGen Climate Action political committee is on track to spend more than 55 million in this election  an unprecedented amount for an environmentalist groupBut NextGen and other green groups are not talking about climate change as much as one would expectInstead they are paying for TV ads that attack Republican candidates on job creation and corruption not carbon emissions Doortodoor canvassers talk about clean water and reproductive rights not the controversial Keystone XL pipeline that would carry crude oil from Canada to US refineriesThe reason is simple climate change isnt a top concern for most voters Only 3 percent think it should be the countrys top priority according to ReutersIpsos pollingNextGen and other green groups say theyre simply doing what it takes to elect the candidates they supportThat means working with Democratic allies to ensure a consistent message that resonates with a broad crosssection of voters not trying to raise awareness about the perils of climate change Doortodoor canvassers aim to motivate loyalists to vote not persuade skepticsThe goal is to win the election and using climate as part of that victory said Craig Hughes a NextGen adviser in Colorado This is not about throwing up an ad about polar bears and butterflies going into extinction This is making it relevant to the votersThe effort also serves as a dry run for 2016 when voters will elect a successor to Democratic President Barack Obama Many of the most hotly contested races this year are in states that will be competitive in the presidential election as well and green groups say they will review this years results to find out what tactics worked bestBut the winfirst approach has its risks as Republicans can  argue that the groups unwillingness to let the climate message stand on its own is proof that it doesnt matter to votersClimate change is like an afterthought in the wider message which is a tacit admission that on its own it doesnt move the dial said Republican strategist Josh PenryWith climate change crowded out by other issues that has created an information vacuum for some voters who say that candidates stance on the issue would affect their vote  if only the candidates would talk about itClimate change is a huge issue that were just pushing under the rug and not dealing with said Emily Rowe 19 as she twirled a hula hoop on the campus of the University of Colorado Im assuming the Democratic Party is more for that Thats about all I knowROCKY MOUNTAIN WAYEnvironmentalists say they are making progress in the broader public debate While climate change barely surfaced in the 2012 presidential election the 2014 election is on track to be the biggest yet for energy and environmentrelated TV ads according to Elizabeth Wilner of Kantar MediaCMAG which tracks political advertisingBut not all of those ads are environmentally friendly In many Republicans accuse Democrats of hurting the economy by supporting environmental measures and in others Democrats in oilfriendly states like Louisiana and Alaska boast of their close ties to the industryThe dividing lines are clear in Colorado home to ski resorts wind farms and a booming oil and gas industryDemocratic Senator Mark Udall backs efforts to reduce the carbon emissions that scientists say fuel global warming His Republican challenger Rep Cory Gardner opposes such curbsUdall is backed by public opinion According to ReutersIpsos polling 49 percent of likely voters in Colorado want the government to curb global warming while 38 percent oppose action The environment is also the most important issue for 6 percent of likely voters in Colorado twice the national figureBut even here the environment has taken a back seat as Udall and his allies have concentrated on reproductive issues which they say resonate with a broad swath of votersUdall has relentlessly attacked Gardner for sponsoring legislation that could outlaw abortion from the moment of conception Nearly two out of three ads run by Udall and allied outside groups in early October mentioned abortion or other womens health topics according to the Wesleyan Media ProjectMAKING A LINKNextGen and the League of Conservation Voters have underlined the theme with ads that draw a link between reproductive rights and environmental concernsHed like to make some of your most private choices for you and some of your notsoprivate ones too  like the environment you live in a female voice says in one NextGen ad referring to GardnerThe common thread between the two issues green groups say is that Gardner is trying to downplay his position on both to avoid alienating moderate votersCory Gardner is trying to hide who he really is and what hes really done in his four years of Congress said Daniel J Weiss senior vice president for campaigns for LCV which is on track to spend 25 million this election cycle five times what it spent on the 2010 midterm electionsGardners campaign has used NextGens Steyer to argue that Udall is beholden to outofstate interests Its unfortunate that Senator Udall has embraced a radical outofstate billionaire like Tom Steyer said Gardner spokesman Matt ConnellyGreenfunded TV ads in other races also tackle different themes that have little to do with the environment In Iowa LCV says Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst wants to dismantle Social Security In New Hampshire NextGen says Republican Scott Brown doesnt care about job creationThat focus is because many voters could balk at a carbon tax or other measures to slow climate change analysts sayOne population segment needs no convincing voters under 35 years old who unlike older voters see climate change as a top issue Green groups are targeting young voters as well as Hispanic and AfricanAmerican voters with a sophisticated digital and doorknocking campaign to make sure they dont stay home on election dayIn some cases the campaign is finely calibrated to local concerns Canvassers in black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Denver for example talk about curbing nearby pollutersBut many say theyre not hearing enough about the issueLeaving a Udall rally at the University of Colorado environmentalstudies major Meredith Kee 19 said she was unclear which candidate was a better bet to tackle climate change even

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/29/us/politics/29reuters-usa-elections-marijuana.html,WASHINGTON   Voters in the US capital and two West Coast states will decide in the  Nov 4 elections whether to legalize marijuana pushing closer to the mainstream a notion that was once consigned to the political fringeBallot initiatives in Oregon and Alaska would set up a network of regulated pot stores similar to those already operating in Colorado and Washington state A measure in the District of Columbia would allow possession but not retail salesIf successful the ballot initiatives could build momentum for legalization in other states and force candidates in the 2016 presidential election to take a stand on the issuePublic opinion on marijuana has shifted sharply in the past several years and polls indicate more Americans now support legalization than oppose it Advocates say that like gay marriage legal pot is an idea that gains support once people see it in actionThe more public dialogue that goes on about this issue the more support there is said Mason Tvert of the Marijuana Policy Project which is supporting the legalization drive in AlaskaOpponents say legalization will create an aggressive new industry that like the tobacco business will profit by marketing an addictive product to teens Unlike gay marriage legal pot will have harmful effects many sayI dont know anybody who looks around and says My life is better when everybody around me is stoned said Kevin Sabet a former White House drugpolicy adviser who now heads up Smart Approaches to Marijuana an antilegalization groupFew elected officials in the country support legalization  and observers do not expect that to change any time soonIt seems that this is an area where the public is out in front of their elected officials said Jake Weigler an Oregon Democratic strategist not affiliated with the legalization effortSo for the moment advocates are focused on ballot initiatives Such referendums allow voters to shape policy directly at the state level this year alone ballots in various states include measures to raise the minimum wage restrict abortion and ban certain types of bear huntingOn the marijuana issue voters in the District of Columbia back legalization by a twotoone margin according to recent polling while a narrow majority supports legal pot in Oregon Opinion polls in Alaska have been inconsistentNationwide roughly one in four Americans say they have used pot according to ReutersIpsos polling Some 47 percent support legalization and 35 percent oppose itMarijuana remains illegal under federal law but President Barack Obama has allowed Colorado and Washington to move forward with legalization Federal prosecutors have been told to focus enforcement on areas such as interstate trafficking and selling to minors rather than possession The next president will have to decide whether to continue that approach or to insist that federal law trumps local concernsCHANGES OVER TWO DECADESMarijuana has been edging toward legal status across the country since California became the first state to allow its use for medical purposes in 1996The medical use of marijuana to ease ailments ranging from glaucoma to chronic pain is now legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia Florida may become the first state in the South to approve medical pot in NovemberSome 18 states have also removed criminal penalties for possession of small amounts as policymakers on the left and the right have questioned the social and fiscal costs of imprisoning nonviolent drug users Nationwide about 650000 people were arrested for marijuana possession in 2012 FBI statistics showColorado and Washington opened the first statelicensed pot stores earlier this year following legalization referendums in 2012Beau Kilmer a drug policy expert at the RAND Corporation a nonpartisan think tank said it is too soon to determine how those efforts are faring because there is not enough data to determine whether legalization has led to more crime higher rates of underage use or more people driving while highColorado residents are split on legalizations merits Some 51 percent of likely voters in the state support it and 41 percent oppose it according to ReutersIpsos pollingOpponents of legal marijuana are not like the antidrug warriors of past decades Many support decriminalization and medical use if done carefully but argue that other states should not be in such a hurry to follow Colorado and Washington all the way to legal pot shopsI dont want to speak for the next couple of years but right now its not the right choice said Charles Fedullo a spokesman for Big Marijuana Big Mistake which opposes the legalization drive in AlaskaAdvocates have plenty of money to spend In liberalleaning Oregon backers are spending 2 million on a primetime TV ad campaign Opponents meanwhile have raised a mere 168000 largely from lawenforcement groups In Alaska a

Maine and Representative Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia both of them RepublicanThe other 13 are either trailing badly or like Ms Ernst in tight races Among incumbents Kay Hagan of North Carolina Mary L Landrieu of Louisiana and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire all Democrats are fighting to hang on to their seats Two other bright Democratic prospects  Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky and Michelle Nunn in Georgia  are in tough races in red statesMs Ernst who beat four men in the primary stands out as the lone Republican woman in a cliffhanger campaign If she beats her Democratic opponent Representative Bruce Braley in the race to succeed Tom Harkin she will deprive Democrats of a seat they have held for nearly 30 years  and perhaps help Republicans take over the SenateShes a model for the Republican success story said Celinda Lake a Democratic pollster They have run rightwing women before but they havent had a rightwing woman before who was able to give so many genderbased cues while still maintaining their baseAnalysts liken Ms Ernsts approach on gender to that of President Obama on raceYou would be hardpressed to find a clip of Senator Obama running in 2008 to be the first AfricanAmerican president said Kellyanne Conway a Republican pollster She advises Republicans like Ms Ernst against running overtly as a womanBut Ms Ernst is hardly ignoring her gender Her ads offer a playful take on masculine endeavors There she is firing a gun There she is riding a HarleyDavidson There she is boasting about castrating hogs on an Iowa farmBut interspersed among those images are other softer cues In one new ad she is seated at a kitchen table talking about the Iowa we leave our children in another she says she learned the key to a great biscuit while working at a fastfood restaurantAround the country Democratic women are running more explicit appeals to womenIn Kentucky an ad for Ms Grimes features Democratic women in the Senate Shatter the glass Break the ceiling Its time for Alison they declare In Georgia Ms Nunns advertisement asks of her Republican opponent Can the women of Georgia trust David PerdueAnd in Iowa Staci Appel a Democratic House candidate pitches herself as running a race to elect the first woman to Congress from the state of Iowa  even though the same could be said of Ms ErnstIf Ms Ernst winds up in Washington it will be largely because Iowas men sent her there Ms Ernst has a 12point advantage among men deemed most likely to vote while she and Mr Braley are closely divided among such women according to an NBC NewsMarist College poll released this week But in previous polls Mr Braley was doing much better among women  a hint that in the campaigns waning days Ms Ernst may be narrowing the gender gap as she makes inroads among older womenIn an election season in which Republicans have gained traction by talking about the threat of Islamic extremism Ms Ernst emphasizes her national security credentials  a strong sell with Republicans and especially menLast week she traveled the state with Senator Lindsey Graham a South Carolina Republican and an Air Force reservist Here in Hamlin population 252 as of the latest census Mr Graham talked up Ms Ernsts military credentials to the dinner crowd at Darrells Place a roadside restaurant where the pork tenderloin sandwiches sell for 525 and the beer signs flash in neonIt would be nice to have somebody in the Senate Mr Graham said who doesnt talk about boots on the ground but has had her boots on the groundMr Graham says Republicans are hungry for more candidates like Ms Ernst Were a party of short white guys he said selfdeprecatingly and we need to reflect AmericaNationally Democrats have long outpaced Republicans in nominating women for high elective office and 2014 has followed that trend A recent analysis by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University found that there are twice as many as female Democrats running in Senate House and governors races this year than there are Republican womenDebbie Walsh the centers director said Democrats had more infrastructure to support female candidates through political action committees like Emilys List And Republican women tend to be more moderate and have difficulty surviving conservative primariesMs Ernst is an exception Her breakout moment was the hog castrating ad in which she vowed to rein in Washingtons big spenders declaring Lets make em squeal The ad delighted Republican men but made some Republican women queasyWhen I saw that ad I said Ew I dont know if I like that said Christine Hensley a member of the Des Moines City Council Then Ms Hensley said she mentioned it to Gov Terry E Branstad of Iowa and he said Isnt that ad greatIf Mr Braley has a hope of winning said Ms Lake the Democratic strategist it is by tying Ms Ernst to the socalled Republican war on women Recently Mr Braley campaigned with Cecile Richards the president of Planned Parenthood the reproductive rights organization which has attacked Ms Ernst for her antiabortion stance and support of personhood rights for fetuses using the slogan Women are watchingAt the University of Iowa last week Ms Ernst was just four minutes into her stump speech promoting her Iowa values when several young women began shouting her down The scene grew so raucous that the candidate cut her talk short ducking inside a classroom building to slip out a backdoorWomen are watching Women are watching the protesters chanted as she left Stacia Scott a 22yearold social worker who helped lead the protest echoed Democrats talking points about Ms Ernst Joni Ernst she said is not a woman for womenIn the end analysts say the race may come down to the womens vote The

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/opinion/nothing-in-moderation.html,What if the notion that a large segment of the electorate is made up of moderates who hunger for centrist compromise is illusory What if ordinary voters are in many respects even more extreme in their views than members of CongressTwo political science graduate students at Berkeley David E Broockman and Douglas J Ahler have made a persuasive case that not only are there few voters who are actually centrist or moderate but that many voters  and on some issues a majority of voters  are further to the left or right than the congressmen and legislators who represent themThe BroockmanAhler argument if its correct undermines advocacy organizations think tanks and commissions premised on the belief that moderates remain a powerful but untapped source of support in federal elections Such organizations include Third Way a proDemocratic think tank which contends that In the eleven most competitive Senate races of 2014 moderates hold the key to Democratic wins the Centrist Project which asserts that Most Americans Are Moderates the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget the Bipartisan Policy Center the Progressive Policy Institute the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform the Concord Coalition No Labels and the Campaign to Fix the DebtPolitical scientists have long debated how polarized ordinary voters are compared with political elites In a paper completed earlier this month An Artificial Disconnect Broockman disputes in detail the work of scholars and activists who have sought to promote an ambitious reform agenda based on the widely accepted empirical finding that voters reliably support more moderate policies than elites The mistake here Broockman writes is to crucially rely on the assumption that voters preferences can be summarized on one dimensionBroockman explains the problem as followsOne voter might support liberal policies calling for much higher taxes on the rich and also support a conservative stand in opposition to samesex marriage When the two responses are averaged though he or she would be defined as a moderateMeanwhile lets say that our hypothetical voters congressman supports relatively conservative policies in both cases and reliably casts relatively conservative votes Because of the legislators ideological consistency he or she is estimated to be  extreme on the continuum as Broockman puts it But who is actually the extremistEarlier this year to further strengthen their case Broockman and Ahler designed and conducted an innovative online survey of 1240 respondents recruited by Survey Sampling International The survey asked voters not only whether they supported the Democratic centrist or Republican positions on a range of issues but also offered respondents the option of taking more extreme positions  further to the left or right  than most Democratic and Republican members of Congress would be willing to supportIn the case of taxes for example the survey offered respondents seven choices of which four were extremeThe extreme choices on taxes on the left are to establish a maximum annual income with all income over 1000000 per year taxed at a rate of 100 percent and to decrease federal taxes on the poor and provide more services beneting the middle class and the poor or to increase federal income taxes on those making more than 250000 per year to pre1990s levels more than 5 percent above current rates Use the savings to signicantly lower taxes and provide more services to those making less and to invest in infrastructure projectsThe extreme choices on taxes the survey offers on the right are to move to a completely at income tax system where all individuals pay the same percentage of their income in taxes accomplished by decreasing government services or to move to a at consumption tax where all individuals pay the same percentage of their purchases in taxes banning the income tax even if this means the poor pay more in taxes than the rich Signicantly decrease government services in the processThe results challenge those committed to the moderate voter thesis The policies supported by a majority of respondents 59 percent were more extreme than the policies that political elites typically support Of the 59 percent 40 percent swung left and 19 percent to the right The distribution is shown in Figure 1When Broockman and Ahler performed the same analysis combining survey respondents responses to 12 survey questions going beyond taxes  guns abortion immigration Medicare health environment Social Security gay rights labor unions contraception and education  49 percent of the respondents took more extreme stands than those taken by partisan elites 30 percent to the left and 19 percent to the right Figure 2 illustrates their analysisIn a separate study Ahler and Broockman sought to determine whether voters adopted extreme positions in surveys because there were no consequences whereas in the real world of governing these same voters might prefer their elected officials to take more moderate stands This proved not to be the case voters support for a politician who adopts their previously expressed issue views including their more extreme views does not abate even when explicitly informed that an alternative politician is more moderateBroockman and Ahler appear to be exercising influence in the debate over polarization and moderationI asked Morris Fiorina a political scientist at Stanford who is the author of the book Culture War The Myth of a Polarized America for his views on the Broockman paper Fiorina wrote back I think everyone who has read his paper believes he really nailed that pointIn an extended email exchange I conducted with Broockman he pointed out that some of his and Ahlers findings raise the question Should elected officials cast votes reflecting the majority views of their constituentsI asked Broockman if a politician could more successfully represent constituents by casting each legislative vote to reflect majority opinion in his or her district Broockman repliedIf voters are more extreme than the politicians who represent them where does this leave usIn an additional paper published in September How Ideological Moderation Conceals Support for Immoderate Policies A New Perspective on the Disconnect in American Politics Ahler and Broockman reach a pessimistic conclusionThey continueIn other words Americans can look forward to a recurrence of public dissatisfaction for which there is no remedy and to intractable conflict among elites resulting in the inability of either side to enact a durable agenda,20141029,abortion
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/upshot/mark-udall-faces-a-turnout-challenge-in-colorado.html,Perhaps no campaign figures more prominently in the pantheon of modern political mythology than Senator Michael Bennets election in 2010 Mr Bennet a Democrat won a comefrombehind victory in Colorado after trailing in just about every poll of the final weeks of the raceIt is hard to overstate the lore surrounding the Bennet campaign The story leads Sasha Issenbergs book The Victory Lab The legend holds that the Bennet campaign employed cuttingedge field methods presaging President Obamas reelection to turn out enough irregular voters to mount a comeback The Democrats named their huge 2014 turnout effort the Bannock Street Project after the road where the Bennet campaign resided for four years In part because of this history many assumed that Mark Udall a Democratic incumbent was a clean favorite to win reelectionInstead Colorado has emerged as a state where Democrats desperately need to do a better job of turning out voters than they did in 2010 Mr Udall trails in the polls by an even wider margin than Mr Bennet did four years ago and hell need an even more favorable electorate to defy the odds againMr Bennets victory is so impressive because he won despite facing a hostile electorate  one in which most voters probably supported Mitt Romney in 2012 Mr Bennet pulled it off in no small part because he faced Ken Buck a candidate who alienated many moderate women with his views on rape and abortion Mr Bennet attacked Mr Buck as an extremist for his views on the states personhood amendmentHow well did Mr Bennet do among unaffiliated and Republican voters Think about it like this Almost 40 percent of registered voters in Colorado were Republican in 2010 but Mr Buck managed to win only 46 percent of the vote He suffered big defections among registered Republican voters and was clobbered among the states already Democraticleaning registered unaffiliated votersMr Udall tried and apparently failed to make similar gains with similar attacks against Cory Gardners past support for the states personhood amendment By most accounts Mr Gardner has run a smart race As a result Mr Udall does not seem poised to run so far ahead of Mr Obama he could easily even run behind Mr Obama He now needs to make up for it with a more Democratic electorate than the one that narrowly elected Mr Bennet four years agoHow much more Democratic would the electorate need to get for Mr Udall to win A very rough guess is that he needs an electorate about halfway between 2010 when Republicans outnumbered Democrats by more than six points and 2012 when Republicans outnumbered Democrats by two points and when unaffiliated young voters represented a much larger share of the electorateThat rough guess is illustrated by data provided by SurveyUSA and Monmouth University which both conducted public polls from lists of registered voters On average the polls found Mr Udall ahead by five percentage points among registered unaffiliated voters with Mr Udall enjoying a smidgen more support among registered Democrats than Mr Gardner did among registered RepublicansIf we assume those averages are right  and obviously you should not take the averages of two sets of subsamples to the bank  Mr Gardner would win by about two percentage points if the partisan makeup of the electorate resembled 2010 but he would lose by two points if party affiliation matched 2012 Since many of the unaffiliated voters joining in a 2012type electorate would be younger and more diverse than the ones deemed likely to vote in recent polls the tally might underestimate how Mr Udall would actually do with the 2012 electorateHalving the gap between the 2012 and 2010 electorates would not be easy If the Udall campaign wanted to do it strictly by mobilizing more voters it could take getting at least an additional 50000 Democraticleaning voters to the polls  or perhaps onefifth of the registered Democrats voters who voted in 2012 but not in 2010 when Democrats had their celebrated getoutthevote effort If the Gardner campaign could mobilize additional voters of its own then Mr Udalls requirement would jump furtherMr Udall however is not just counting on brute mobilization The Democrats have one big thing working in their favor the advent of universal mail voting For the first time in Colorado all registered voters will receive a ballot in the mail  whether they request one or notThe question is how many of the voters who didnt participate in 2010 will choose to do so once a ballot arrives at their door No one knows exactly what to expect but both campaigns will surely spend the next week chasing down the voters who havent submitted their ballotsDemocrats are hoping that the combination of universal mail voting and their mobilization efforts will substantially enlarge the electorate drawing from the pool of young Democraticleaning voters who did not participate in 2010 but did in 2012 Data from the voter registration file indicates that these voters are indeed substantially more favorable to Democrats than the 2010 voters and a new Democraticsponsored poll found that these voters support Mr Udall by a 14point marginIf the new voters break for Mr Udall by that margin Democrats will need more than 250000 voters to close a twopoint deficit among voters returning from 2010 It could easily take more if Mr Udalls deficit is larger than two points or if new voters are still somewhat more Republican older or whiter than the overall pool of voters who did not participate in 2010 but did in 2012Given the degree of uncertainty about eventual turnout with universal mail voting you can start to imagine why Democrats think they still have a way to defy the odds in ColoradoThe good news for observers is that the composition of the Colorado electorate wont stay in the realm of speculation for long Universal mail voting means that about 85 percent of ballots will probably be tabulated by Election Day Thanks to The Upshots subscription to the Colorado voter file well have a good sense of the partisan and demographic makeup of Colorado voters well before the polls closeSo far the early vote looks pretty good for Mr Gardner More than 650000 ballots had been tabulated by Sunday night and registered Republicans outnumbered registered Democrats by 105 points 428 to 323 If it holds that will be even better for Republicans than 2010But it is clear that the earliest mailin ballots are unrepresentative Fortythree percent of early voters are 65 or over and disproportionately from Republican jurisdictions And buried in the data is a number that might augur well for Democrats Twentyone percent did not participate in 2010 and those voters are far more Democratic than those who participated in 2010 If the pace continues and everyone from 2010 returns to the polls turnout will grow by 450000 votersTheres not much question that Democrats will gain as the remaining young voters from Democratic jurisdictions mail in their ballots The question is how much and whether it will be enough,20141029,abortion

last few weeks building up his national image and winning good will among party membersBut there is a special strategy to Mr Pauls scheduleGeorgia Kansas and North Carolina are more than states with Republican Senate candidates in need of Mr Pauls star power They are all states with Libertarian candidates on the ballot who could draw a few percentage points away from the RepublicansAnd in a close race those points could make all the differenceAs something of a hero of the Libertarian movement Mr Paul and his support for Republicans could help sway voters who would otherwise back the Libertarian At least thats what party officials hopeBut Mr Paul is taking a risk that the Libertarian faithful will abandon him entirely in 2016 because he is so openly opposing that partys candidates this year His political action committee will start advertising on cable television on Tuesday for Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas and will run online ads in North Carolina to help Thom Tillis the

running for reelection here are probably well aware that a recent history of their seats looks a bit like musical chairsMs SheaPorter won her seat in the First District on the wings of voter frustration with President George W Bush in 2006 the same year a Democrat named Paul Hodes ousted the longtime Republican representative in the Second District Charles BassIn 2010 Ms SheaPorter lost her seat to Frank Guinta a Republican and the former mayor of Manchester and Mr Bass won his seat back beating Ms Kuster in her first try for the job as voters across the nation revolted against the Affordable Care ActAnd in 2012 as voters gave President Obama a second term Ms SheaPorter was elected again while Ms Kuster beat Mr BassNow Ms SheaPorter and Ms Kuster are locked in tight reelection battles with opponents who are eager to tie them to President Obama who has a 40 percent approval rating here If the backandforth of recent history is any guide their races could be a bellwether for the broader national political order when the dust settles after Election DayThe two races are playing out in genuine swing districts  the number of which according to The Cook Political Report decreased by 45 percent between 1998 and 2013  with large groups of independent voters who are susceptible to political mood swings and a variable turnout between midterm and presidential election yearsThese voters tend to take out their frustrations with whoever they perceive to be in charge when things arent going right said David Wasserman the House editor of The Cook Political Report Thats made these districts look like PingPong ballsThe Second District runs from the bottom to the top of the state while the First District looks like a jagged bite out of its eastern side and both encompass college towns suburbs and mountainous swaths where the states motto Live Free or Die feels particularly aptThere just arent that many purple states so New Hampshire kind of sticks out said Linda L Fowler a professor of government at Dartmouth College Were going to continue to see this kind of shifting back and forthThis wasnt always the case The First District was held by Republicans from 1985 to 2007 except for about a month when it was empty while the Second District saw just one Democrat serve for two terms between 1915 and 2007This was not a swing district Ms SheaPorter says of her district until I made it oneMs SheaPorter 61 was a littleknown but vocally antiwar social worker when she won her districts 2006 Democratic primary and then eked out a victory against the Republican incumbent Jeb Bradley with no help from national DemocratsIn 2006 I kept saying the middle class is stumbling the poor have fallen said Ms SheaPorter I think that struck a nerve and it still doesThe district leans slightly Republican with a broad base of independents and so Ms SheaPorter is always on the edge  and lately as it turns out stuck in a tugofwar with Mr Guinta After taking Ms SheaPorters seat and then losing it back to her Mr Guinta who has worked as an insurance consultant has returned for a third round and Politico has identified Ms SheaPorter as one of the five most endangered House membersThat district in particular really seems to rise and fall with the fortunes of the president and the incumbent party nationally said Dean Spiliotes a civic scholar at Southern New Hampshire University He added I think shes extremely vulnerableAt a Rotary Club forum here late last month Ms SheaPorter and Mr Guinta shared a stage for the first time since their 2012 campaignThis country is going in the wrong direction Mr Guinta 44 said after telling the audience that he had been a productive congressman Ms SheaPorter worked to distance herself from Mr Obama pointing out that she had voted against arming moderate Syrian rebels last month and that she had called for the resignation of Kathleen Sebelius the secretary of Health and Human Services who presided over the disastrous launch of the online federal health exchangeMost recent polling has shown the race to be close The Cook Political Report rates it a tossupRepresentative Kuster a 58yearold lawyer and exlobbyist whom many in the Second District call Annie comes from a long line of New Hampshire politicians She faces Marilinda Garcia a 31yearold state representative and harp teacher Ms Garcia who has been identified as a rising star by the national Republican Party has drawn supporters like House Speaker John A Boehner and Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul to appear at fundraisers and campaign stops with her Conservative outside groups like the Club for Growth have made big media buys on her behalf but her fundraising lags behind Ms KustersMs Garcia has repeatedly criticized Ms Kuster for not appearing enough around the state At a town hall in Littleton just north of the White Mountains earlier this month Ms Garcia stood next to a cardboard cutout of Ms Kuster and answered questions selected by a moderator about health careIn an interview Ms Garcia sought to link her opponent with Mr Obama and referred to a statement he made in Illinois  much to Democrats chagrin  that tied him to the midterm elections As he said himself the other day basically his policies are on the ballot said Ms Garcia She added Representative Kuster isnt really establishing or setting herself apart as an individual or her own personMs Kuster has focused her campaign on retail stops at diners and local businesses where she greets voters with zeal and has released a bevy of television ads that say Ms Garcias views  and votes in the State House  on abortion and womens health issues are too extreme for New HampshireThe presidents not on the ballot these issues are whats on the ballot Ms Kuster said after a campaign stop at a whiskey distillery in NashuaRecent polling shows a singledigit race and Real Clear Politics recently rated it a tossupAnalysts says Ms SheaPorter is more likely to lose her seat than Ms Kuster New Hampshire has not split its House delegation since the early 1990sWho knows said Mr Spiliotes the civic scholar Sometimes you just get these big waves and suddenly

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/us/supreme-court-with-terse-orders-has-judges-and-lawyers-reading-tea-leaves.html,WASHINGTON   People used to complain that Supreme Court decisions were too long and tangled Those were the daysIn recent weeks the court has addressed cases on the great issues of the day without favoring the nation with even a whisper of explanation In terse orders the court expanded the availability of samesex marriage let a dozen abortion clinics in Texas reopen and made it harder to vote in three states and easier in oneJudges and lawyers who used to have to try to make sense of endless opaque opinions now have to divine what the Supreme Courts silence meansThere is something odd about the courts docket these days When the court considers a minor case on say teeth whitening it receives a pile of briefs hears an hour of arguments and issues a carefully reasoned decision noting every justices positionWhen the stakes are higher the court turns oracularThe courts unexplained orders dont always live up to its otherwise high standards of legal craft said William Baude a law professor at the University of Chicago The court doesnt tell us its reasoning and we dont even know for sure which justices agree with the resultIt is probably useful to distinguish between two kinds of orders ones denying petitions urging the court to hear appeals and ones taking action on emergency applications in cases pending in the lower courtsOn Oct 6 the court issued the first kind of order turning down seven petitions asking it to review appeals court decisions striking down bans on samesex marriage The Supreme Courts move in short order effectively increased the number of states that allow gay couples to marry to 35 from 19The court receives about 8000 petitions seeking review every year and accepts roughly 75 It would be a lot of work to explain why it turns down the restIf the court is to do its work it would not be feasible to give reasons however brief for refusing to take these cases Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in a 1950 opinionIt takes four votes to add a case to the Supreme Courts docket All a denial means Justice Frankfurter said is that fewer than four justices thought it was a good idea to hear that caseThis court has rigorously insisted that such a denial carries with it no implication whatever regarding the courts views on the merits of a case which it has declined to review he wrote The court has said this again and again again and again the admonition has to be repeatedThomas C Horne Arizonas attorney general may need another reminder In explaining why he would not appeal a federal judges order striking down his states ban on samesex marriage he said the Supreme Court has shown an unwillingness to accept review of the issueIn light of that Mr Horne said it would be foolhardy to pursue an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco and then to the Supreme CourtThe probability of persuading the Ninth Circuit to reverse todays decision is zero he said The probability of the United States Supreme Court accepting review of the Ninth Circuit decision is also zeroThat may well be right But it is an inference from vanishingly thin evidence And that evidence the Supreme Court has repeatedly instructed judges and lawyers should be ignoredThe Supreme Courts other recent orders came in response to emergency applications concerning elections and abortion It is less clear why those orders did not give reasons particularly as some of them came with dissentsThe orders certainly gave lowercourt judges very little guidanceConsider Judge Edith Brown Clement who recently had to try to figure out what to make of three of the courts orders in election cases The justices had allowed Ohio to cut back on early voting and let North Carolina bar sameday registration and the counting of votes cast in the wrong precinct But they had stopped Wisconsin from requiring voters there to provide photo identificationJudge Clement of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans did the best she could to identify a themeWhile the Supreme Court has not explained its reasons for issuing these stays the common thread is clearly that the decision of the court of appeals would change the rules of the election too soon before the election date she wrote on Oct 14 The stayed decisions have both upheld and struck down state statutes and affirmed and reversed district court decisions so the timing of the decisions rather than their merits seems to be the keyJudge Clement guessed right The Fifth Circuit allowed Texas to use its strict voter ID law in the November election and a few days later the Supreme Court agreed again without explanationProfessor Baude said a murmur of reasoning might have been in orderThe justices are being cautious but too cautious he said Theyre used to having time to be thoughtful When they issue an order under time pressure they may want to avoid saying too much and setting a bad precedent But when the order reverses a lower court or disagrees with a dissent they should tell us why at least a little bitAt his confirmation hearing Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr said he would strive to make the courts opinions clear and accessibleI hope we havent gotten to the point where the Supreme Courts opinions are so abstruse that the educated layperson cant pick them up and read them and understand them he saidIn a way he has achieved his goal The courts opinions in this falls orders are not abstruse They are absent,20141028,abortion

should say a prayer of thanks for Christian conservativesAlthough they get little attention from candidates white evangelical Christian voters are likely to be fundamental to any Republican victories in the key Senate races especially in the SouthReutersIpsos polling data shows evangelicals are more enthusiastic than the general population about the midtermsThe religious rights influence may be much reduced since the days of Moral Majority leader Jerry Falwells alliances with Republican presidentsBut Christian conservatives will probably vote in greater numbers on Nov 4 than others giving them an outsized say in who runs Congress Fortynine percent of evangelicals say they have a great deal of interest or quite a bit of interest in news about the elections compared to 38 percent of nonevangelicalsIt strongly shows that the evangelical population is very engaged very interested in whats happening and much easier to turn out for an election than the population as a whole said Ipsos pollster Chris JacksonAlmost 40 percent of Republicans said they were bornagain or evangelical Christians according to the online surveyThe party loyalty is striking given that Republican candidates have largely avoided evangelicals pet topics like opposition to abortion and gay marriage for fear of alienating moderate voters in tight US Senate racesIn one of the few Senate contests where social issues have taken center stage Colorado Republican Cory Gardner distanced himself from his earlier support for personhood bills backed by evangelicals Such bills would define fetuses as people and could lead to abortion and some forms of birth control being declared as murderIn Iowa Republican Senate hopeful Joni Ernst seemingly softened her strong opposition to abortion when she suggested in a debate this month that there could be exceptions if the mothers life is at riskThe Supreme Courts decision earlier this month to allow gay marriages by rejecting appeals from five states seeking to ban them was a landmark in longrunning culture wars but it passed without much fuss on midterm campaign trailsThe candidates certainly the Democratic candidates are not talking about these issues and in most cases the Republican candidates arent talking about these issues so we are going to talk about them said veteran conservative activist Ralph ReedHis Faith and Freedom Coalition has launched what Reed said is its most muscular turnout operation yet It includes making 10 million phone calls to potential voters and an aggressive ad campaign of online videosThe idea is to ensure enough evangelical turnout to swing Senate races in states such as Arkansas Georgia Louisiana Iowa Colorado North Carolina and Kentucky where polls show the average gap between the top candidates is in the low single digits Republicans need a net gain of six seats to win the SenateIn some ways Reed is preaching to the choir White evangelicals have long had a high rate of midterm voting and more than threequarters of them backed Republican Mitt Romney against President Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential electionEvangelicals have in fact become one of the core constituencies in the Republican Party Because they see themselves that way we see their willingness to vote consistently Republican even though you could point to a number of issues where the Republicanled House of Representativesreally hasnt moved much on their agenda said Robert P Jones of the Public Religion Research Institute polling groupMORE THAN GAY MARRIAGEChad Connelly the Republican National Committees pointman for faith voters said evangelical voters are motivated by worry about the economy and mistrust of Obama adding its too much of a cliche to think they care mostly about social policyConservative Christians at a Baptist church in Springdale Arkansas had a long list of issues that matter to themWhere a candidate stands on marriage immigration the economy its all important I dont think Obamas doing a good job with terrorism either said Mary Baker a retireeNevertheless the stress was on social issues when she and some 20 others at the church watched a national webcast by evangelical leaders who urged the faithful to support Biblical values at polling boothsWhile the hosts did not specifically ask people to vote Republican they told Christians to back candidates who hold conservative positions on abortion freedom of religious expression and samesex marriageThe congregation mostly agreed Some voiced disappointment that Republicans failed to choose a Christian conservative as presidential nominee at the last two electionsWe end up with a crippled duck every time said Charles Fast 70 a former policemanIn the Arkansas Senate race a Fox News poll this month gave Republican Tom Cotton a 34point lead over Democratic Sen Mark Pryor among white bornagain Christian votersEven if their votes sway the next Congress Christian conservatives are going through a difficult period of soul searching over falling church attendance and Americas shifting attitudes toward gay rightsWhen samesex marriages are being conducted in Oklahoma the culture has shifted

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/nyregion/a-gap-within-a-gender-in-new-york-politics.html,On Monday Gloria Steinem still feminisms leading oracle sent an email to 200000 New Yorkers urging them to vote for Gov Andrew M Cuomo and other candidates seeking election on the Working Families Party line Her note pointed to the organizations work on paid sick leave she mentioned it twice on raising wages for the underclass on fighting for tax increases on the wealthy and for expanded rights for domestic workersNew York should be a beacon to the nation by telling the truth Ms Steinem wrote Our society is more unequal than ever Things are toughest for lowincome women people of color and the children who depend on themIn his four years in office Governor Cuomo has appeared as a champion of the invisible roughly as often as the brokers on Million Dollar Listing have shilled for small modest apartments But the more votes the Democratic governor receives on the Working Families line the more  one might presume  he will feel bound to honor progressive promises that narrowly secured him the partys endorsement in the first placeWhat threatens a robust count is the sudden formation announced by Governor Cuomos running mate Kathy Hochul over the summer of the Womens Equality Party a component of a branding effort on the part of the governor to appeal to female votersThe campaign has the governor and his running mate touring the state on a bus called the Womens Equality Express holding rallies on abortion rights and other aspects of the governors Womens Equality Act which languished in the State Legislature In one significant sense the marketing would seem to have been successful Although recent polling data from the Siena Research Institute reveals the governors favorability ratings at a relatively low 54 percent the gender gap is significant with 65 percent of women surveyed saying they have a favorable opinion of him and only 41 percent of menNoticeably absent from Ms Steinems email is any reference to abortion at all Mr Cuomo has talked about the issue repeatedly in the course of the campaign reminding voters during a televised debate on Wednesday night for instance that he would stand up for a womans right to choose as if it were truly imperiled in a state that has one of the strongest laws protecting abortion in the country and some of the richest and most liberal women on earthThe Womens Equality Act which includes a welcome strengthening of laws on sexual harassment and discrimination stalled on a proposition that would have altered language around restrictions to abortions occurring after 24 weeks As the law currently stands these thirdtrimester abortions are permissible when a womans life is in danger under the rewording they would also be allowed when a womans health was jeopardized On the one hand this is no small distinction But on the other hand even staunch advocates of revising the law cannot recall the last time  or possibly any time  since abortion was legalized that a patient or physician in New York was prosecuted for terminating a thirdtrimester pregnancyThe Cuomo campaign has arguably resurrected a longstanding divide in the womens movement between those more singularly concerned about issues of sexuality and reproductive rights and those focused on the grittier economic issues that affect womens lives more broadly if not always as dramatically The Womens Equality Party has a number of celebrities who have lent their names in support including Lena Dunham the creator of Girls Anna Wintour the editor of Vogue and leaders of Planned Parenthood and Naral The face of the movement belongs to Christine C Quinn former speaker of the New York City Council who has spoken often about the importance of reproductive choice but who opposed paid sick leave for a long time during her tenure on the CouncilOn Thursday Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke on behalf of the governors feminist credentials invoking her own past struggles as a young lawyer and mother The same day the Working Families Party released a video featuring prominent female politicians and activists urging voters to cast their ballots on the Working Families line and by implication to spurn the Womens Equality Party The women  among them the Manhattan borough president Gale A Brewer and Representative Nydia M Velzquez both Democrats who had initially lent their names to the womens party and found themselves quickly disillusioned  are essentially arguing that progressive economic policies are what will ultimately bring women closer to parityThe Working Families Party to me represents since its creation all the progressive ideals that are important to women and families  paid family leave choice  to women and lowincome women working two and three jobs Ms Velzquez told me explaining that she hadnt participated in any events for the Womens Equality PartyAlso appearing in the video is Aijen Poo a recent recipient of a MacArthur grant for her advocacy around rights for domestic workers Earlier in the month State Senator Liz Krueger a Manhattan Democrat declined offers to attend events for the Womens Equality Party In an email that she wrote to Ms Quinn and that was published on the website Capital New York Ms Krueger wrote Women are 54 percent of the voters in this state When they vote on the Democratic line Democrats win I do not wish women to be relegated to some non partyTheres another matter on the minds of some political women as well So many ballot lines are simply too confusing People understand Republicans and Democrats Zenaida Mendez the leader of New York States chapter of the National Organization for Women told me It took me a half an hour to explain all of this to

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/us/abortion-capital-of-bible-belt-tennessee-vote-tests-that-idea.html,MEMPHIS   The online video features idyllic snatches of Tennessee daily life guitar players old barns church socials  and the official Tennessee welcome sign glimpsed through the window of a car passing over the state lineBut then there is a strategically placed and purely fictional detail The welcome sign announces Tennessee as Your Abortion DestinationThe video was designed by abortion opponents here who believe that Tennessee has for too long been a Bible Belt outlier due to a State Supreme Court decision in 2000 that ruled that the states constitutional guarantee of a right to privacy includes the right to an abortion Over the years the ruling has served as a partial bulwark against the wave of abortion restrictions that have swept other conservatives statesNow antiabortion forces are trying to change that at the ballot box by passing Amendment 1 which states that nothing in the Tennessee Constitution secures or protects a right to abortionTwo other states Colorado and North Dakota are also trying to restrict abortion this Election Day with so called personhood ballot measures which would extend extra rights and protections to the unborn Colorado has previously voted twice against versions of the measureHere in Tennessee the ballot fight has taken center stage this political season and abortion opponents are buoyed by the Democratic Partys comically poor chances of recapturing the governors mansion The partys challenger to incumbent Bill Haslam a Republican is Charles V Brown a retired construction worker and political neophyte best known for his suggestion that Mr Haslam be strapped to an electric chairWhen theres no real candidate to vote for its hard said Rebecca Terrell the executive director of Choices a clinic in Memphis that offers abortions in acknowledging that abortion rights forces face a hard time getting out the liberal voteGovernor Haslam has voiced his support for Amendment 1 as have many members of the Republicandominated state government Supporters say the amendment would allow legislators to bring the state in line with the rest of the region rather than serve as what to them is a kind of abortion haven The Tennessee health department says that 23 percent of women who received abortions in 2013 lived outside TennesseeFor a woman in the fastgrowing city of Southaven Miss for example the trip to Mississippis sole abortion clinic in Jackson is three hours by car Mississippi law requires women to undergo counseling and a 24hour waiting period before an abortion may be performedBut the same patient can be at Choices one of two Memphis abortion clinics in 20 minutes Tennessee requires no special counseling and no waiting periodShould Tennessee be the abortion capital of the Bible Belt said Russell Moore president of the Ethics  Religious Liberty Commission of the Nashvillebased Southern Baptist Convention in a post on Twitter last monthAbortion rights advocates reject such characterizations noting that even with the 2000 ruling legislators have enacted abortion regulations including a 2012 law mandating that physicians who perform abortions have admitting privileges at a local hospitalThey also argue that the percentage of outofstate patients fails to account for Tennessees geographic setting It is surrounded by eight states whose residents often travel to places like Memphis for all kinds of bigcity servicesThe 2000 ruling was the result of a lawsuit brought against the governor at the time Don Sundquist by groups including the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood The court ruled that a womans right to terminate her pregnancy is a vital part of the right to privacy under the State Constitution making any regulations of that right subject to a rigorous strict scrutiny standard Both abortion rights advocates and antiabortion forces agree that it created a level of protection for abortion higher than that afforded by the federal courtsIn the ruling the state court also struck down three abortionrelated provisions including a required twoday waiting period a mandate that only physicians may give informed consent to an abortion patient and a requirement that all abortions after the first trimester be performed in a hospitalAntiabortion campaigners have been trying to undo the ruling for years They were helped along by the election of a wave of conservative antiabortion candidates to the State Legislature in 2010 These members in 2011 helped Amendment 1 garner the twothirds supermajority necessary to put it on the ballot in the next election for governorBrian Harris a coordinator of the Yes on 1 campaign and president of Tennessee Right to Life said the court ruling has left state law out of character with the states culturally conservative populaceMr Harris said Tennesseans should have the same rights to enact abortion regulations as their counterparts in neighboring statesThe debate in Tennessee is playing out as the federal judiciary struggles to determine how much regulation of the abortion industry is permissible and how few and far between abortion clinics may be until a womans constitutional right to an abortion is violatedEarlier this month the Supreme Court blocked a Texas law that would have imposed new standards on clinics forcing many of them to closeThe battle here over the abortion amendment has grown fierce By the end of September the campaign committee Vote No on One Tennessee Inc had raised 19 million the bulk of it from the states two Planned Parenthood chapters The Yes on 1 Ballot Committee had raised just over 900000 much of it coming from smaller donations from individuals churches and local antiabortion groupsA key argument of the Vote No group is that the measure would restrict privacy rights and allow politicians to meddle in personal decisionsSteven Hershkowitz a Vote No on One spokesman said the group hoped to appeal to conservative voters who were generally antiabortion but believed that there should be some exceptionsMr Hershkowitz noted that if Tennessee were to pass Amendment 1 and the United States Supreme Court at some later date were to overturn its Roe v Wade ruling making abortion legal the State Legislature would be free to restrict abortion even in cases of rape incest or a grave health threat to the motherMr Harris said the Vote Yes faction despite being outspent is counting on rallying motivated evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholics The group was running a television ad in which people walk down a city street with mouths covered in tape as an announcer says the state high court ruling silenced the right of the people to enforce reasonable regulation of abortionIn a Vanderbilt University poll conducted in April and May 71 percent of respondents said they opposed the idea of giving the Legislature the authority to regulate abortion And opponents are somewhat cheered by a state law that requires that the amendment earn more than 50 percent of the total number of votes cast in the governors raceOutside of the Planned Parenthood branch in Memphis recently many of the protesters who keep vigil in front of the clinics parking lot were eager to vote yesThe laws are more lenient  thats why more people are coming here said Elizabeth Orians 52 who was holding a sign that said Pray to End AbortionBut not all were of the same mind John Brindley 46 an industrial supply salesman spent a recent Friday morning seeking allies in the men who had driven women to the Planned Parenthood clinicHe said he would be voting against Amendment 1 He unquestionably believes that abortion is a great evil But allowing it to be regulated more he said would only create cleaner facilities to murder children in,20141025,abortion
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/us/in-a-scandal-new-attention-to-mikvahs.html,NEWTON Mass  Lets think about the immediate reactions that different Jews had to the Oct 14 arrest of Rabbi Barry Freundel the spiritual leader of congregation Kesher Israel in Washington who has been accused of using a secret camera to spy on women immersing in a mikvah the Jewish ritual bathJews throughout modern Orthodoxy the branch of Judaism in which Rabbi Freundel is so prominent were horrified and ashamed that one of theirs could be accused of an act so pervertedSecular Reform and Conservative Jews rolled their eyes The mikvah is principally used by Orthodox women who after not touching their husbands while menstruating must immerse in a mikvah before resuming sexual relations  a rule that strikes liberal Jews as sexist and anachronistic While feeling compassion these Jews may have also thought Why are 21stcentury women still going to the mikvahOrthodox women who had immersed at the Georgetown mikvah that Rabbi Freundel supervises felt violated and angry Carrie Bornstein the executive director of Mayyim Hayyim Living Waters a community mikvah here outside of Boston described one such woman who happened to visit her mikvah on the night the news brokeShe had been a regular user at the Kesher Israel mikvah Ms Bornstein wrote in The Times of Israel and our mikvah guide recounted that when she arrived she looked ashen and could hardly speak about what happened Allegedly happened that isAnd me Amazingly I had never seen a mikvah  and this in an age when mikvah use is spreading to the nonOrthodox to children and the elderly and to more men In fact Rabbi Freundels arrest brought attention to the kind of mikvah  for the Orthodox controlled by a man  that activists have been working to make a thing of the pastSo I came to meet Ms Bornstein whose Mayyim Hayyim which opened in 2004 is the bestknown of the community mikvahs which are designed to be more welcoming safer and more theologically innovative than traditional Orthodox mikvahs The website of Mayyim Hayyim which means living waters in Hebrew lists 32 mikvahs in its network across the United States and in Canada and IsraelThe community mikvahs are kosher for traditional uses for women who have finished menstruating for men purifying themselves before the Sabbath for brides or grooms before their wedding day as the final act of a conversion to Judaism But they operate with the progressive philosophy that individuals can decide for themselves how to observe this ritualSo if a Jewish woman wants to immerse in the mikvah to help the healing process after an abortion or a suicide attempt thats fine according to those who run community mikvahs If a young boy wants to immerse to mark his becoming a bar mitzvah thats OK too New rituals can be created and indeed should be Many of the newfashioned mikvahs are housed at or near Conservative or Reform synagogues whose members not feeling religiously obliged to immerse sometimes embrace the mikvah as part of their individualized spiritual practiceThe mikvah has also caught on among some feminists as a separate womans space with special meaning at times of miscarriage or menopauseAbove all a community mikvah should be safe and private said Ms Bornstein a professional educator who in 2012 became Mayyim Hayyims second director Which is why Rabbi Freundels arrest cut so deepI was horrified Ms Bornstein said This organization and my lifes work every minute of the day that I am pouring into this is around protecting safety and privacyMs Bornstein worries that a fear of voyeurism would now be added to all the other fraught emotions that women bring to the mikvah You are coming to a strange building you have never been to have to take off all your clothes there might be somebody in the room with you you are speaking Hebrew you are getting married or becoming Jewish or have just finished treatment for breast cancer You are in a moment of transition and you are already on edgeSara Luria a Reform rabbi who runs ImmerseNYC which uses an Orthodox mikvah in Manhattan but provides its own specially trained guides said that Rabbi Freundels arrest affirmed her sense of callingMy first thoughts were Thank God were doing what were doing  Rabbi Luria said Women tell us stories about how they werent safe at their mikvah Sometimes the female mikvah attendant was intrusive Other times the water wasnt clean or they didnt have what they needed in the changing room or they waited for an hour in the prep room  naked  and the buzzer didnt work and they couldnt go out to check There are so many issues of safety at the mikvahMayyim Hayyim was conceived in 2001 by Anita Diamant the author of the bestselling novel The Red Tent She was upset by the cold assemblyline feel of many mikvahs in particular by what message they sent to convertsPeople converting to Judaism were not being given the kind of welcome they deserved Ms Diamant saidSo Mayyim Hayyim was designed to be welcoming and to embody the Jewish principle of hiddur mitzvah that commandments should be performed beautifully It is a converted Victorian house with cozy rooms for sitting and study and with space for art exhibitions When I visited the gallery displayed works by the potter Steven Branfman from the year of mourning after his son died when he threw a pot every dayDasi Fruchter is an Orthodox Jew who grew up near Washington where Rabbi Freundels wife was once her teacher Women from her community typically use Orthodoxcontrolled mikvahs But Ms Fruchter a thirdyear student at Yeshivat Maharat a New York City yeshiva that is the first to ordain Orthodox women as clergy is a rabbinical intern at ImmerseNYC And she says that she is less worried about other cases of voyeurism than about overreaction to themOne thing I and my colleagues at other mikvahs worry about is a hypervigilance around the mikvah that there is more fear Ms Fruchter said She echoed a hope that I hear elsewhere that the modern mikvah movement as Rabbi Luria calls it makes mikvahs less hidden and more talked aboutI hope this incident moves the mikvah from something secret to something private  Ms Fruchter saidBefore I left Mayyim Hayyim I asked if I could immerse in the mikvah It seemed the thing to do to have even the barest sense of how vulnerable the experience can feel And I did  my first time ever It was a bit scary and it felt a bit forced since I was on journalistic assignment But everyone there was supportive and kind The water was wonderfully warm Id expected it to be chilly And I was totally confident there were no hidden cameras,20141025,abortion

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/nyregion/with-gun-act-cuomo-alienates-upstate-new-york-constituency.html,In large stretches of upstate New York it is the reason Gov Andrew M Cuomo is deeply unpopular To many voters in New York City and its suburbs it is one of his crowning achievementsMr Cuomo a Democrat made New York the first state to pass a broad package of new gun laws after the mass shooting in Newtown Conn in 2012 Seizing a singular political moment he called it the Safe Act and he implored Congress to follow his leadNearly two years later as he seeks a second term Mr Cuomo presents the act to his supporters as one of his greatest successes and Democrats are assailing the governors Republican challenger Rob Astorino for being lax on guns It remains one of the most farreaching pieces of guncontrol legislation passed in response to the Newtown shootingBut in pushing for passage of strict new gun laws Mr Cuomo alienated a vocal constituency across upstate New York a region he has otherwise wooed In court gun owners have challenged the constitutionality of the laws on lawn signs and bumper stickers in places like the Catskills and western New York they demand their repealCounties towns and villages have passed resolutions denouncing the laws and some counties have even demanded that their official seals not be used on any paperwork relating to them In response to an open records request the governors office shared hundreds of pages of such resolutions from farflung places like the Adirondack town of North Hudson with 238 residents to more populous areas like Erie CountyThe calculation when it was passed was people were going to get mad for a little while and then get over it Stephen J Aldstadt the president of the Shooters Committee on Political Education said I dont think people are getting over it Despite its scope the Safe Act was not everything it was originally intended to be and there were stumbles A provision limiting the size of gun magazines for example turned out to be unworkableThirtytwo days after the shooting in Newtown on Jan 15 2013 Mr Cuomo signed the act into law The measure included an expanded ban on assault weapons and highcapacity magazines as well as a broader requirement for background checks and tougher penalties for gun crimesThe Safe Act really meets the test of good gun policy Leah Gunn Barrett the executive director of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence said It keeps guns out of the wrong hands and I think it does that quite effectivelyThe legislation also sought to keep guns out of the hands of people with mental illnesses by requiring mental health professionals to report to the authorities any patient who was likely to be dangerous As a result about 34500 people in New York are now barred from having guns some mental health advocates have expressed concern that too many people have been categorized as dangerousSo far New York lawmakers have allocated 34 million to cover the costs associated with the laws such as informationtechnology upgrades according to the state budget officeSome gun owners have complained that the process that produced the legislation moved far too quickly and state officials have run into legal hiccups and technological challenges since the laws were enacted Critics also say the Cuomo administration has not been transparent in putting the laws into effectOne provision included in the act was struck down by a federal judge because of a spelling error Another which limited the size of gun magazines to seven rounds had to be revised after the governor conceded sevenround magazines were not widely availableThe laws were amended to allow the sale of 10round magazines with gun owners prohibited from loading more than seven rounds at a time But the same judge struck down the  restriction on loading more than seven rounds calling it arbitrary The state is appealing that rulingA requirement that ammunition sales be subject to background checks another aspect of the laws has not been put into effect because the state has not yet established a system for conducting the checks And there are lingering questions among officials as varied as sheriffs and county clerks about what the laws require of themIts been a long and difficult road since January of last year said Alex M Wilson a lawyer for the New York State Sheriffs Association which has filed amicus briefs asserting that the Safe Act violates the Second AmendmentOne of the most controversial elements of the Safe Act was its requirement that the owners of firearms defined under the laws as assault weapons register them with the State PoliceMany gun owners said they would not comply the deadline for registering passed on April 15 The State Police have refused to say how many gun owners have registered a spokeswoman Darcy Wells said that such information was exempt from disclosure under New Yorks Freedom of Information LawThe State Police have received requests for aggregate registration data from numerous people including Michael Genier an engineer from Horseheads NY His request was denied as was a subsequent appeal In an interview Mr Genier said he suspected that Mr Cuomo did not want the data publicized because it would show that few people had registered You may or not like the law he said but you cant change it without proper informationIn an Oct 3 advisory opinion the states Committee on Open Government said the State Police had no legal basis to keep the aggregate data secret and a firearms instructor from the Rochester area filed a lawsuit in state court this month seeking the information Ms Wells the State Police spokeswoman said the agency was reviewing the advisory opinionSome data released by the state shows that one major fear among gun owners has not come to fruition Law enforcement officials have not gone out of their way to enforce provisions of the Safe Act against otherwise lawabiding state residentsThrough late September when data was most recently available the states Division of Criminal Justice Services said no arrests had been reported to the agency for the misdemeanor of failing to register an assault weapon  the requirement that many gun owners have openly defiedIn total there have been about 3300 instances in which a person was charged with at least one offense established by or strengthened under the Safe Act such as possessing a weapon on school grounds or buying a gun for another person who is forbidden to have one In those instances in which a person was charged with multiple Safe Act offenses state records showed only the most serious chargeIn 92 percent of cases the charge was criminal firearm possession a newly created felony most of those were in either Brooklyn or the Bronx The district attorneys in those boroughs said that in some instances in the past those found with an unlicensed handgun could be charged only with a misdemeanor now they can be charged with a felony which carries a stiffer sentenceAs he campaigns for reelection Mr Cuomo has trumpeted the Safe Act in some but not all of his appearances At a rally in the Riverdale section of the Bronx in September he spoke of his work on gun control samesex marriage and abortion rights to show how he was trying to restore New York as the progressive capital of the nationWe said lets take those tough issues and solve them and show leadership the governor said Lets take the issue of gun violence where too many innocent people have died and lets pass sensible gun control once and for all and dont tell me it cant be done Ill show you it can be done And that law is going to save livesAt a speech three days later in Buffalo Mr Cuomo discussed only samesex marriage and abortion rights not

and 63 percent in the citys suburbs approved of the laws compared with only 45 percent in upstate New YorkThe Safe Act is viewed very differently depending on which county youre in Frank A Sedita III the Erie County district attorney said Mr Sedita said the new laws have had a negligible effect on how I do my job in prosecuting gun crimesOn a Sunday in late September more than 400 gunrights

NYT,http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/changing-the-debate-katha-pollitt-talks-about-pro/,In her new book Pro Katha Pollitt a longtime columnist for The Nation argues that We need to see abortion as an urgent practical decision that is just as moral as the decision to have a child  indeed sometimes more moral In a recent email interview Ms Pollitt discussed how she wants to change the debate about abortion the importance of women sharing their stories and more Below are edited excerpts from the conversation What do you see as the biggest difference between societys attitude toward abortion now and its attitude when Roe v Wade was decidedToday Roe looks like a bolt out of the blue but in 1973 it looked like the logical next step in the rapid advance of womens rights privacy rights and public health The fact is women were having large numbers of illegal abortions before Roe everyone knew this So Roe was seen as a way to make abortion safe and as enabling doctors to care for their patients as they thought best Justice Harry Blackmuns decision was very practical he focused a lot on doctors rights to give good patient care and on the injuries and deaths caused by illegal abortion  mostly to poor women who could not travel to New York where abortion was already legal Women of color were much more likely to die in clandestine abortions and unlike today the court was troubled by laws that disproportionately affected minoritiesToday weve forgotten that history Abortion is a symbol  of social decay sexual irresponsibility hedonism and of course womens autonomy about which we are deeply ambivalent Even prochoicers prefer to talk about rape victims and wanted pregnancies that turn into medical catastrophes when the truth is most unwanted pregnancies are the result of voluntary sex and most abortions now as before Roe are for social economic and personal reasonsYour book is an argument against using the language of safe legal and rare that is so common on the prochoice side But could fighting that language potentially alienate the muddled middle you describe and turn some people who take comfort in the safe legal and rare rhetoric away from supporting prochoice policies I think we should say safe legal and available Rare opens up a whole can of worms it could mean lets have more birth control which of course would be great and something prochoicers support  and the organized antiabortion movement opposes  but it could also mean lets make it harder for women to get abortions because right now its too easy It implies theres an ideal number of abortions and you know what it is But in fact a lot of women have babies now because thanks to the Hyde amendment which bars federal funds for Medicaid abortions they cant afford to end a pregnancy especially given the way restrictions have ratcheted up the cost travel motel child care time off work Fact is we dont really know how many abortions there would be if every woman who wanted one could have oneThe book includes stories about individual women and their experiences Was it difficult to get people to talkI found women were eager to tell their stories So much had been bottled up for so long I got emails from all sorts of women  ones who had had illegal abortions 60 years ago and ones who had ended pregnancies quite recently Women buttonholed me at parties Oh I hear youre looking for women to talk about their abortions Well heres mineIn the 1970s several prominent women Gloria Steinem Nora Ephron and others signed a statement in Ms magazine saying they had had abortions Do we need more of that kind of openness from wellknown people todayYes and from ordinary people too Three in 10 American women will have had an abortion by menopause and many will have had more than one That is a lot of women And most of those women had help  from parents boyfriends husbands friends Abortion is part of the fabric of American life and always has been But fear and shame keep women silent and in that silence misogynist stereotypes flourish the girl or woman who ends a pregnancy is a slut or a childhating coldhearted career woman Actually most women who have abortions already have children 61percent are mothersWhat did you learn while researching the book that surprised you mostDid you know that in the late 1960s the Southern Baptists came out for liberalizing abortion laws That in 1968 Ronald Reagan then governor of California signed what was at the time the most liberal abortion law in the land Like religious fundamentalism the antiabortion movement is not as ancient as it looks Its a contemporary phenomenon formed by the marriage of patriarchal religion and rightwing politics And I know some readers are raising their eyebrows at my use of the word patriarchal But the home base of the antiabortion movement is in religious denominations where women are formally subordinate  the Catholic church where women are shut out of the priesthood which is where the power is and the Southern Baptist and other evangelicalfundamentalist churches where wives are commanded to submit to their husbands If thats not patriarchy what isYou write that the abortion debate suffers from disregard for the seriousness of motherhood How soWhen people talk about abortion as a matter of convenience theyre saying having a baby is no big deal Anyone can do it even a 12yearold But pregnancy and childbirth are huge events and mothering a child is serious lifechanging work If we respected that work we would respect womens intense desire to time it well And we would help mothers a lot more  we dont even have paid maternity leave let alone affordable daycare Theres a lot of job discrimination against pregnant women and women with kids And a lot of poverty Its as if we say to pregnant women you had sex now you have to have a baby But once the baby is here we say not my problem whyd you have a baby if you cant support it  Are there any arguments on the other side of the debate that either give you pause or that you respect on a purely intellectual if not practical levelSomeone actually a prochoicer at a Planned Parenthood fundraiser said to me its okay to say youre not going to have a baby now but its wrong to say youre not going to have this baby now I struggle with abortion for say Down syndrome At the same time I ask myself if Down syndrome could be prevented that would be a good thing so why does abortion feel different since its not yet a person I dont find the antichoice perspective intellectually persuasive at all  the personhood of the fertilized egg sex as a kind of contract to have a baby But emotionally there is something appealing about accepting life with all its imperfections and difficulties and even sorrow rising to the occasion and making something good out of it  The problem is they want to force this view on others and by others I mean women because they have no more interest than the culture at large in demanding real sacrifice by men who get women pregnant The culture seems to be talking about this issue all the time but rarely in ways that move the conversation in a new direction How do you hope your book can do that My aim is to turn the abortion paradigm on its head We talk about abortion as a bad thing  even prochoicers fall into this language when we say its an agonizing decision the hardest decision a woman ever makes Really A woman who had no thought of becoming a mother before she got accidentally pregnant and is in no position to care for a child now suddenly thinks I should have a baby I argue that legal abortion is a social good It benefits us all everyone gains when women have babies when they can best raise them well  men children families society ,20141024,abortion

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/us/board-taking-last-pass-at-social-studies-textbook.html,AUSTIN   Two hours into a late October meeting called to parse revisions to new social studies textbooks for Texas schoolchildren and a month before the deadline for final approval the State Board of Education found itself confronting a tricky question Was Sam Houston a liberalA board member Pat Hardy Republican of Fort Worth believed that Houston hero of the Texas revolution and twotime president of the Republic of Texas might balk at the description in a textbook up for reviewI dont know if he would like that or not she said I just never hear Sam Houston referred to as a liberal And those of us who liked Sam Houston want to keep him on our sideIn November the 15member elected board is set to approve new social studies materials including books and online tools that will be used in Texas public schools for the next eight yearsPublishers have spent 18 months developing their versions of world United States and Texas history and shepherding them through rounds of expert reviews revisions and public comments hoping to get their texts into the Texas marketThe final edit is now in the hands of a Republicancontrolled board whose bruising political battles over curriculum standards including infighting over everything from creationism to what caused the Civil War have previously flared into national viewIn the textbookapproval process state law limits the role of the education board to vetting instructional materials for factual errors and ensuring they meet Texas curriculum standards But the process can still provide an opening for strongwilled board members to wield outsize influence such as pushing to include pet historical figures or alter the presentation of politically charged topics like climate change or Islamic fundamentalismGuidelines from the Texas Education Agency define a factual error as an objective inaccuracy or a bias so severe that it interferes with student learning The latter category creates a large gray area said a board member Thomas Ratliff Republican of Mount PleasantIn the nebulous world of interfering with student learning said Mr Ratliff whose district crosses 31 counties in Northeast Texas when does bias become so bad that it becomes an errorCase in point the question whether Sam Houston was a liberal Asked by a colleague to explain how that constituted a factual error Ms Hardy said it was methodologicalWhen you give a modern context to a historical event that is a factual error in my opinion she said Its almost like an anachronismThe process of reviewing the more than 100 social studies products has revealed obvious mistakes like grammatical errors or incorrect answers on endofchapter quizzes But more often potential flaws have fallen into less objective territory whether an account of the ArabIsraeli conflict strikes an appropriate balance for example or whether a profile of Hillary Rodham Clinton should be included in a section on American leadersAt the recent meeting board members suggested that publishers make it clearer that Jews were the primary target of the Holocaust add context to show that not all antiabortion campaigners use violence and note that the bodyguards who assassinated the Indian leader Indira Gandhi were SikhsAnother time as food for thought the boards chairwoman Barbara Cargill Republican of The Woodlands told a publisher that while she appreciated a texts discussion of the role of religion in the French Revolution there could be greater coverage of how it played in the American RevolutionAn exchange between a board member Ken Mercer Republican of San Antonio and Rhonda Haynes a vice president for textbook publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt illustrated the challenge that publishers faceMr Mercer questioned whether a section on world religions included balanced coverage of the good and the bad of Islam as required by the state curriculum standards known as the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills or TEKSMs Haynes said it depended on who is defining balance The size of a textbook and then the need to meet certain TEKS it limits opportunities to include a greater discussion she said To add more we are just stuck There is not enough room to do itA 2011 law diluted some of the boards control over instructional materials in part to limit the ability of members to force publishers into making lastminute changesThe law ended a requirement that any approved materials cover 100 percent of Texas curriculum standards which curbed the boards ability to knock a textbook off the list over a few errors It also shifted the responsibility for buying instructional materials from the state level to the local level allowing school districts to buy products outside of the state boards recommended listBut most Texas school districts still look for the state boards seal of approval when selecting their instructional materialsThe boards vetting process carries weight as an assurance that instructional materials meet a certain quality threshold said Alicia Thomas who has served as as an academic officer for both San Antonios North East Independent School District and the Houston school district where she worked until 2012It provides a foundation upon which school districts can make individual decisions she said adding that without the board each school district would need to undergo that process at the local levelBoard members continue to control the state curriculum standards last updated for social studies in 2010 that publishers aim to followThe whole structure is in a way a charade said Jacqueline Jones the chairwoman of the history department at the University of Texas at Austin UTAustin is a corporate sponsor of The Texas TribuneIn September Dr Jones delivered a detailed report to the state board identifying severe biases and omissions of fact in an American history textbook up for approval that she said encouraged ideological biases that are either outside the boundaries of established mainstream scholarship or just plain wrongIt was very frustrating she said to realize when she testified before the board in September that most of the errors were the result of publishers following curriculum standards set by the state four years ago meaning they were unlikely to be correctedThe whole thing is very bizarre to me that people can just say we want to glorify this country and we dont want students to dwell on unpleasant aspects of the past she saidSuch a sanitized version of history would cause students to alternate between getting cynical and being bored she addedThey know we live in a hyperpartisan society today that there are real debates about all kinds of things she said For textbooks to sweep that under the rug strikes me as very odd,20141024,abortion

ought to be the end of the story here in southern West Virginia with its beleaguered mining industry and largely white population that fills the pews of evangelical churches on a Wednesday night as readily as on Sunday morningThe region voted overwhelmingly Republican in the presidential contest two years ago part of the historic defection of West Virginia Democrats who hold a 2to1 registration advantage from the national party over social issues like abortion and more recently opposition to environmental regulationAnd yet a Democratic congressman Nick J Rahall II has defiantly held onto his seat here in the sparsely populated Third District which runs from the rugged Appalachian coal fields in the west to the famed whitewater rafting of the New River GorgeFirst elected in 1976 Mr Rahall has had his campaign for a 20th term against the Republican candidate Evan Jenkins become one of the most ferocious House races in the country There is a torrent of outside money blistering ads from conservative groups supported by the billionaire Koch brothers and a contest that after nearly 14 million in spending has come down two weeks before voting to a tossupWhile the race will not affect partisan control of the House considered safely in Republican hands it will make a statement about whether Democrats can survive in southern border states The millions of dollars coursing through the inexpensive television markets of the state in Mr Rahills contest are far more than in the race for West Virginias open Senate seat where a Republican Shelley Moore Capito has taken a comfortable leadIf Mr Rahall hangs on it will be because his ties to voters cemented over four decades  what supporters call his brand  overcome the antipathy of West Virginians to President Obama and especially White House energy policy that many blame for hard times in coal countryRepublicans have really turned the anger at Obama and the coal issue into an organizing principle Mr Rahall said on Saturday during the Mercer County Democratic Party bean dinner in Princeton I probably have the most antiObama district represented by a Democrat in the nationThe race is clouded with distortions from both sides Mr Rahall says that Mr Jenkins would take away miners black lung benefits Mr Jenkins accuses Mr Rahall of supporting a carbon tax that raised electric rates Factcheckers have been busy debunking both claimsSome of the antipathy of West Virginians to the White House would seem to defy economic selfinterest Mr Rahalls district includes some of the poorest counties in the state where reliance on food stamps Medicaid and other federal benefits is high All would be rolled back under budgets passed by the Houses Republican majorityThe coal industrys long decline is economically complex When Alpha Natural Resources one of West Virginias largest coal operators warned 1100 employees of potential layoffs in July it blamed a worldwide glut of coal competition from cheaper natural gas and lowercost coal from western basins  as well as Environmental Protection Agency regulationsBut in the charged political arena complexities fade and both sides identify a sole culprit for the industrys struggles the administrations anticoal regulationsEveryone knows Obama declared a war on coal Nick Rahall stands with him says a television ad running this month by Freedom Partners Action Fund a group supported by Charles G and David H KochMr Rahall and his supporters have tried to turn the tables by attacking Mr Jenkins wealthy backers The Koch brothers coming in here from New York spending millions trying to elect Evan Jenkins Theyre not welcome they dont belong a miner says in an ad run by the Democratic Congressional Campaign CommitteeIn a debate last week Mr Rahall boasted of standing up to my party to stop the overreaching overzealous jobkilling EPA agendaIt is a tough argument to win however given the presidents desire to leave an environmental legacy of lower carbon emissions from power plants as proposed by the EPA this yearMr Rahall has struggled to explain his vote in 2013 for a budget proposal by the Congressional Progressive Caucus which included a 25 per ton carbon tax He has said that he does not support a carbon tax and that he voted for the liberal budget blueprint which badly failed in the House to make a statement against Representative Paul D Ryans Republican budget with its many cuts to social programs That plan passed the House but not the SenateMr Jenkins who served in the State Legislature as a Democrat before switching parties last year does not buy it This president has written off West Virginia he said Hes written off coal and unfortunately weve got a congressman who has helped him every step of the wayThe air blitz against Mr Rahall 65 began nearly a year ago almost unheardof so early when Republicanleaning national groups like the Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Prosperity  also supported by the Kochs  began attacking his vote for the Affordable Care ActDemocratic groups sensed trouble and jumped in to counter the attacks We were effective in at least fighting back said Matt Thornton a spokesman for the House Majority PAC citing private polls that showed Mr Rahall rebounding in the springThe National Republican Congressional Committee which considers Mr Rahall one of its top three House targets this year has pumped more than 2 million into the race I think this is the first time people are starting to say maybe we like Nick Rahall but we dont like what hes doing in Washington anymore said Ian Prior a spokesman for the Republican campaign committeeNeither side is confident of victory and ads are booked through Election Day for a total of 138 million for the cycle according to a Democratic

repliedKathy McGaha a retiree also offered support saying she did not like Mr Rahall He voted for everything with Obummer she saidBernard Meadows who worked in a coal mine in Mercer County for two

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/us/politics/in-colorado-ever-in-transition-a-fight-for-power.html,ERIE Colo  To trace the border between the liberal and conservative corners of the American West head down East County Line Road a twolane asphalt stripe parting the plains here in Northern ColoradoTo the east lies Weld County a conservative stronghold where 20000 oil and gas wells pump day and night and Republicans are so dominant that they are running unchallenged for county assessor clerk and a commissioners seat Fifteen miles to the west is Boulder where a Buddhistinspired university offers classes in yoga and the Tibetan language and nature activists are working to carve out legal rights for ecosystems and wild speciesStraddling those divisions is Erie a town of 21500 whose perch along County Line Road embodies the shifting politics and demographics of a Western swing state where Republicans are waging a spirited battle to reclaim power after recent years of Democratic gains Two prominent Democrats Gov John W Hickenlooper and Senator Mark Udall are in fierce reelection fights and both parties are spending millions to claim a bellwether winColorado is subjected to extremes said Roy Romer a former governor Its not just blue and red Its also urban and rural We have a history to thisTo some the social and demographic changes that have shaded Colorado blue in recent elections are welcome But Colorados political leanings have tilted back and forth in surprising ways since it became a state in 1876 sometimes marching in lock step with Republican ranching and mining magnates and other times bolting to support populists or socalled Silver Republicans who detested the oncedominant gold standardThis is not a blue state said Ted Trimpa a lawyer and political strategist who helped to craft the Democratic rise to power in the statehouse over the past decade This is very much an independent state and more and more reflects where people in the rest of the country areThe contest between Mr Udall and his Republican challenger Representative Cory Gardner a secondterm congressman from far eastern Colorado has become one of the most competitive and expensive Senate races in the country It is a musthold seat if Democrats have a shred of hope of retaining their Senate majority For Republicans it offers a longsought chance to reclaim a marquee statewide office and show that they can once again win in a Western state that is growing more urban Hispanic and socially liberalThe campaign has touched on energy drilling and the economy President Obamas health care law and the size and role of government but at its core has been a battle for the votes of women and Latinos In 2010 Democrat Michael Bennet defied a nationwide Republican surge to win a Senate race here in large part because Democrats hammered his Republican opponent on abortion and contraception As for Latinos they now represent 14 percent of Colorados electorate and 21 percent of its population and while many are reliably Democratic Republicans have been going door to door to try to sway themDemocrats are pressing their advantages with both groups in campaigning against Mr Gardner casting him as an antiimmigrant conservative who wants to broadly outlaw abortion Mr Gardner does oppose abortion but he has tried hard to soften his conservatism and appeal to the center saying he wants to make birth control available over the counter and no longer supports a personhood referendum that would grant legal rights to embryosThis will also be the first major election to test Colorados new allmail voting system in which ballots were sent to all registered voters three weeks before Election Day ideally  in the eyes of those who proposed the change  increasing turnout The new law which will also allow people to register to vote up through Election Day was approved by the Democraticcontrolled legislature over loud Republican objectionsA CliffhangerAnalysts say this may be the closest Senate race in the country and so candidates are fanning out across the heavily Democratic neighborhoods of Denver the deeply Republican suburbs of Douglas County and growing bedroom communities like ErieHere new homes From the 300s declare billboards are cropping up on old pastureland gazing out at new oilandgas well pads Construction and a drilling boom have helped to pull Colorado out of the recession pushing unemployment down to 47 percent and reviving tax revenue But economists say that job growth has not kept up with the states explosive population growthOne of Eries largest employers a gunmagazine manufacturer named Magpul is leaving town out of disgust with new guncontrol laws passed last year by Democrats As many as 200 jobs are leaving for Texas and Wyoming Joe Wilson a former mayor and National Rifle Association member said he was not upset with Magpul for leaving but with politicians for tightening gun lawsIt was nuts in a down economy to have an industry ejected from the state he said It shocked peopleEries partisan hues mirror the rest of the state About 30 percent of voters here are Democrats and 32 percent are Republicans but each party is outnumbered by independent voters Residents say the towns politics and demographics are changing fast with the arrival of more people priced out of the Boulder areaEverybodys a transplant at this point said Shawne Beeson who moved here in September from the northern Denver suburb of Westminster beckoned by good schools and affordable homes He opened a computerrepair shop in a shopping plazaIm just part of whats happening he said I think this place is going to become a lot more Boulder As prices shift theyre all going to come hereAs a diehard Democrat Mr Beeson said living in a politically diverse town has required some concessions to civility He said he listened politely when he disagreed with a customer but admitted that he once snapped at a man who was fuming about this summers influx of young Central American refugeesI sort of went off the rails he saidGrowth and DiversityThe last two decades brought growth and diversity in Denver and the towns that spill eastward from the Front Range of the Rockies and cluster along Colorados two major interstates The area is now a polyglot quilt of immigrants from East Africa Central America and Southeast Asia Vietnamese noodle houses line Federal Boulevard in Denver Somali and Burmese refugees slaughter cows at the meatpacking plants outside Fort MorganTwentyfive years ago Colorados population was about twothirds the size it is today and much whiter and more conservative In 1991 Focus on the Family moved its headquarters to Colorado Springs becoming a clarion voice of Christian conservatism in the national and local culture warsOn the northeastern plains near the Nebraska border Mr Gardners hometown Yuma embodies a white rural conservatism that is changing fast It is a solidly Republican agricultural and ranching city where hunters arrive every autumn for pheasant season and Mr Gardners family still runs a farmequipment businessIn the last 30 years though waves of oncemigrant workers from Mexicos Chihuahua State have settled here drawn by jobs picking beets and pumpkins and working in the dairies and hogfeed lots Latinos now make up about 40 percent of Yumas population compared with 4 percent in 1990 Half the preschoolers and nearly half the elementaryschool students in Yuma come from Spanishspeaking families said Margo Ebersole with the Rural Communities Resource CenterThe Latino community has been growing faster by threefold than any other community in Colorado said Jessie Ulibarri a Democrat and one of a dozen Hispanic legislators in the state house But cultural acceptance has not always matched demographics People look at us and still perceive us to be perpetual foreigners he said I dont know how many times Ive been told by people that if I stand up for immigrants I should go back homeOver the summer when the push for immigration reform stalled in Washington Hispanic activists flocked to Mr Gardners district offices in northeastern Colorado to pressure him to vote for a comprehensive package that passed the Democratcontrolled Senate supported by Mr Udall But Mr Gardner says that granting citizenship or its benefits to millions of undocumented immigrants will only encourage more illegal immigrationToward the southern border of the state where the county names change from Lincoln and Custer to Huerfano and Costilla a Republican state representative named Clarice NavarroRatzlaff said she believed conservative messages about small government low taxes and family values could resonate with the states Hispanic populationAs she drives across her district Ms NavarroRatzlaff said she sometimes stopped at homes with Latinos for Obama signs in the yard She tells her story of being a fifthgeneration Coloradan who was raised by a single mother Of how she worked nights in a pickle plant and is still paying off her college loans She talks about how she registered as a Democrat because her mother told her to but found a home in the Republican Party And in a state where borders and state lines were drawn up around Hispanic families who had lived here for centuries Ms Navarro said the Republican message on immigration has the potential to resonateOur Hispanic culture believes in securing our borders she said We want to honor the lawabiding citizens that have followed the appropriate steps to becoming an American Democrats have used this against us but the fact remains that illegal is illegalRugged CollaborationThe tourists are back in Estes Park a summertime Brigadoon at the foot of Rocky Mountain National Park Last September all of this was water mud and devastationAs the worst floods in a generation carved a 29 billion trail of devastation through the state they washed out roads in Estes Park swept homes off their foundations and wrecked the floors of Julie Piepers mainstreet restaurant Mama RosesOn this diamondclear summer day Ms Pieper was serving up turkeybacon wraps and homemade potato chips to about 100 supporters who had come to see Mr Udall A passionate mountain climber who lives in the mountain town of Eldorado Springs Mr Udall completed a quest this summer to scale Colorados 100 highest peaks He looked at home weaving through the sunbronzed crowd which included hikers kayakers and Dr Thomas F Hornbein a climber whose ascent up the West Ridge of Mount Everest remains one of the greatest feats of mountaineeringMr Udalls pitch to the crowd was rugged collaboration He said the phrase exemplified how government agencies and nonprofits residents and businesses worked together after the floods People took in neighbors who had been washed out They set up zip lines to cross torrential rivers In a year much of the devastation has been repaired or is well on the wayThe response was spectacular Ms Pieper said Ive got friends who are Republicans who support this crew because of the responseMr Udall has attacked Mr Gardner for his votes during last years government shutdown which came as floodstricken towns remained cut off from the world and scores of families were still homeless In Estes Park he called it irresponsible and disqualifying in my view to being a United States senatorMr Gardner said he had pushed to find a solution to the shutdown as it dragged on for two weeks last October and said he and Mr Udall had worked together to get federal money for recovery here We were in helicopters together overseeing the efforts in the days following the flood Mr Gardner said in an interview It is below the office of the United States Senate to attack a member of the delegation he knows was a partnerThe Udall campaign and other groups have also attacked Mr Gardner for cosponsoring the Life at Conception Act a bill that would grant full legal rights to people from the moment of fertilization It would potentially outlaw abortion at any stage and  critics contend  some forms of birth control While Mr Gardner said he no longer supported a similar personhood measure on the ballot this November in Colorado he has been forced in debates and interviews to explain why he is still backing the federal billFor Democrats the focus on abortion is part of a strategy aimed at making Mr Gardner appear as antiwoman as possible to voters like Ann Cerny a pathologists assistant in Erie She said her views on spending and government made her a Republican at her core but that working with fetal tissue samples every day in her lab had put womens health issues front and center this electionAs a woman I want to make sure womens health care is OK she said Personhood anything with abortion  thats my job I have to have freedom of choice Her conclusion I cannot vote RepublicanBut to Debbie Brown a former Republican campaign manager who now leads a statewide womens group the attention to reproductive issues is maddening In 2010 Ms Brown watched Democrats win 56 percent of the womens vote in the 2010 Senate race in part by portraying Republicans as dogmatic enemies of abortion and birth control She organized the Colorado Womens Alliance as a conservative counterweight to liberals whom she says are obsessed with reproductive politicsWhat else you got she asked over coffee one rainy morning I could care less about birth control Its widely available and I think thats awesome Theres not a crisisWhile Mr Gardners campaign argues that his positions are being distorted by the Udall camp Ms Brown and her group are trying to change the definition of what constitutes an electionyear womens issue What about energy she asked What about jobs wages and health care In panels she has assembled Ms Brown said women felt that the laserlike focus on reproductive issues was a ploy for their votesWhen money is so tight that your family disconnects the phone line and cable and wears sweaters to save on heating worrying about abortion laws seems like an unaffordable luxury said Margo Branscomb a single mother in the southern Denver suburb of CentennialEverybody needs to stay out of the bedroom she said It should be an individuals choice in all respects whether its a wedding or all these social issuesIn Erie from behind the counter of his gold and silver shop Levi Hatgi is watching the changes rippling through Colorado He works with a Smith  Wesson handgun strapped to his hip but says guns need to be kept out of certain peoples hands He says politicians have tilted tax policies to favor big corporations over small businesses and he knows smallbusiness owners who have been hurt by the Affordable Health Care Act But he says he feels alienated from Republicans because of their tight embrace of religionIt has been a year since he and his fiance Megan Huckaby moved to Erie and Ms Huckaby has drawn one firm conclusion about its place here in this battleground Its right on the line,20141024,abortion

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/22/world/europe/22reuters-pope-reform.html,VATICAN CITY   After winning praise around the world for his fresh and open style the honeymoon period seems to be over for Pope FrancisA tumultuous twoweek Vatican synod exposed polarization in the Catholic Church over his push to reform its traditional approach to sexual morality by becoming more welcoming to gays and easing restrictions on divorced and remarried CatholicsA Jesuit unafraid of frank debate Francis has set off a clash of opinions not seen since the reformist Second Vatican Council of 19621965 Rather than impose his views as a pope can he has chosen the difficult path to reform by opting to have his bishops freely discuss Catholic teaching on sexThe pope won a standing ovation from almost 200 bishops at the synods close on Saturday and general support for his reform drive But a vocal minority backed by what one cardinal called a massive wave of attacks on the pope from traditionalist media emerged to block some of the reform proposalsThe synod will meet again in October 2015 to make its final recommendations to the pope In the meantime he is counting on discussions among Catholics to increase support for reforms His critics say they will use the time to rally against themThe pope has put his authority on the line said French Vatican expert JeanMarie Guenois author of the new book Jusquouira Francois How Far Will Francis Go If he fails to find a solution it will be his failureMassimo Faggioli a church historian at Saint Thomas University in Minnesota saw different Catholic cultures emerging and said keeping them together is going to be the biggest gamble for Francis in the next 12 monthsIt could become more difficult for him to speak to all Catholics he said adding some conservatives nostalgic for his more doctrinaire predecessors John Paul and Benedict will think he should leave right awayUNAFRAID OF DEBATEThe bishops are meant to continue discussions with clergy and laity in their dioceses before the second synod meets Francis said the process would allow ideas to mature without saying exactly what he wanted to see emerge from the processThe challenge will be to find a consensus among mostly westerners open to changing lifestyles and traditionalists The latter are especially strong in Africa where the Church is growing homosexuality is seen as taboo and polygamy rather than divorce or cohabitation is the main problem for Catholic marriageWhat the Catholic Church is trying to do is a sociological adventure Munich Cardinal Reinhard Marx a senior advisor to Francis said during the synodFinding a common language on such existential themes as sexuality and marriage in Africa Asia Manhattan and the Roman district of Trastevere is actually not possible he saidWhen Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected pope in March 2013 his fellow cardinals gave him a clear mandate to clean up the Vaticans murky finances reorganize the Curia bureaucracy and deal with the crisis of priests sexually abusing minorsBut the former archbishop of Buenos Aires had even wider ambitions including a less imperial papacy and more mercy for the divorced gays or unmarried couples living together despite the Churchs traditional disapprovalWho am I to judge he said of gay Catholics in July 2013 comments that clearly signaled the new tone at the Vatican even though he declared he would not change ageold doctrinesAn unprecedented global survey Francis ordered last year showed widespread disagreement with Church teaching on sex especially among the young in western countriesThe frank survey became the basis for debate at the synods whereas previous synods had been carefully managed affairs with little real debateTRADITIONALIST REACTIONAfter his election last year many Catholic traditionalists argued Francis papacy was a continuation of Benedicts Among their proofs was his opposition to farreaching reforms such as ordaining women priests or approving of abortionBut as preparations for the synod progressed they saw his  open approach resembled that of the 1960s Council known among Catholics as Vatican II which they blame for many modern problems in the Church John Paul and Benedict spent years redefining the Councils legacy in a more conservative wayThey began to organizeFive cardinals including Franciss own doctrinal watchdog Gerhard Mueller published a book arguing that easing a ban on divorced and remarried Catholics receiving the sacraments was impossible because Jesus himself condemned divorceDuring the synod archconservative Catholics many from the United States and Africa complained the meeting was stagemanaged to approve liberal reforms US Cardinal Raymond Burke the Vaticans top judge accused the pope of harming the ChurchWhen an interim text said the Church should welcome gays and accept homosexuality they had the English translation watered down even though the Italian original remained the official oneIn the end the bishops agreed to almost all the synod proposals except three dealing with gays and divorced Catholics even though they had been toned down from the interim textFrancis unexpectedly left the three rejected paragraphs in the final document and published the usually secret vote totals to show they fell just short of the twothirds majority needed to be accepted thereby ensuring they would stay in the debate and have a chance of approval by the next synodDespite his deft bending of the rules it is not clear exactly how much reform Francis wants or what he will decidePredicting outcomes is further complicated by the fact that not all delegates to the next synod will be the same as the firstFrancis ended the synod with a moving address warning traditionalists against hostile inflexibility and liberals against a destructive dogooder approachUte Eberl a German family counselor attending the synod said the session aimed to get the Church out of its comfort zone  to hear about real life for families around the worldAfter hearing the popes final address to the bishops and their fiveminute standing ovation in response she said Pope Franciss plan is

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/opinion/election-2014-andrew-cuomo-for-governor-of-new-york.html,For nearly four years Gov Andrew Cuomo has used his formidable political skills to achieve major advances for New York He pressured and ultimately persuaded some Republican legislators to allow samesex marriage in the state in 2011 That provided momentum for marriage equality nationally and changed many lives for the better At least 30000 samesex couples have celebrated legal marriages in the state since the law changedHe pushed through the strongest guncontrol measure in the country after the mass killing of schoolchildren in Newtown Conn in 2012 The new law expanded the ban on automatic weapons and big ammunition magazines and requires background checks for private gun sales changes that are an improvement to public safety Many voters upstate have antiCuomo bumper stickers and lawn signs registering their anger at the gun control bill These are badges of political courage for Mr CuomoHis budgets have been on time and though his tax policies have favored the wealthy he managed to get higher credit ratings for the state for the first time in decadesWhile The Timess editorial board chose not to make an endorsement in the Democratic primary in September we recommend Mr Cuomo for reelection on the basis of these achievements His Republican challenger Rob Astorino the Westchester County executive does not have broad experience and on many issues is out of step with most New Yorkers and the needs of this stateThe decision not to endorse in the primary between Mr Cuomo and his challenger Zephyr Teachout a national expert on political corruption and campaign reforms reflected our disappointment with Mr Cuomos failure to make good on his promise  made four years ago  to clean up Albany It is our hope that if Mr Cuomo is elected to a second term he will devote the next four years to achieving genuine meaningful reform of Albanys political culture which remains mired in corruptionHis first order of business should be to use his political muscle to change the sham campaign finance laws that have turned Albany into a place that best serves moneyed interests and the politicians in hock to themThat means reducing contribution limits to candidates ending unlimited donations to party housekeeping accounts and prohibiting contributions from limited liability corporations which are used by corporations and individuals to give essentially unlimited amounts of money to candidates And the most crucial reform is public financing for campaigns  the best way to inject competition into legislative races now almost controlled entirely by incumbentsMr Cuomo himself has benefited from lax rules that have allowed him to raise nearly half of the 45 million for his campaign mostly from the developers and lobbyists giving 40000 or more Mr Cuomo has said that while he supports reforms the Legislature refuses to play ball He could set a decent example for Albany lawmakers by refusing to take tainted albeit legal pots of money himself That might allow him to shame the Legislature into acting now lawmakers can point to his finances and jeer Reforming his own practices might also help restore his reputation after his sudden shutdown of the anticorruption Moreland Commission which had started looking into issues that may have involved his political supporters A United States attorney has now taken up that workAnother major disappointment was Mr Cuomos failure to veto redistricting maps in 2012 Those maps were designed by legislators to thwart competition and harden the status quo in Albany A state constitutional amendment on the November ballot  Proposal One on revising the states redistricting procedure  would undoubtedly make things worse Mr Cuomo should stop pushing for this deeply flawed measureMr Cuomos Republican opponent Mr Astorino has not shown that he is ready to take over such a large and diverse state He was reelected in 2013 to a second term as executive of Westchester County a relatively wealthy swath of suburban New York City He is against abortion rights and he has said that he wants to weaken the Cuomo guncontrol law His tax policies would provide even more rewards for the wealthy than Mr Cuomos His continuing attempts to fight a 2009 court order to end segregation patterns in zoning have resulted in the loss of millions of federal dollars to his community Mr Astorino also wants to get rid of the Common Core education standards a crucial effort to improve academics across the state That would be another mistakeAnother candidate Howie Hawkins of the Green Party is a dedicated environmentalist who wants a minimum wage of 15 an hour and free tuition to state colleges among other progressive proposals His candidacy is unrealistic but his ambitious ideas are useful goads to the governor from the leftMr Cuomo has proposed a new list of campaign promises including an infrastructure bank that would use some of the money from recent bank settlements and other sources to help repair bridges or other facilities around the state If done right that bank could help with another promise to transform LaGuardia Airport other state airports and transit facilities in the New York City areaMr Cuomo promises that he would push the Legislature to pass the entire Womens Equality Act It includes pay equity tougher human trafficking laws and stronger state protections for abortion rights He wants to expand cooperation between businesses that need skilled workers and the states education system He vows to fight to raise the minimum wage to 1010 an hour and pass an expanded Dream Act to allow immigrants to apply for tuition assistance at state colleges And he says he would seek public financing of all statewide and legislative races as part of extensive campaign finance reformsFor those reasons despite our criticisms we support Mr Cuomo for reelection He is a strong governor who has shown he can end legislative inertia when it suits him He needs to use those powers to clean up New York States government,20141021,abortion

he supports similar federal legislationAfter attacks from Udall Gardner proposed allowing birth control pills to be bought overthecounter The idea could increase costs on consumers but is aimed at

dominate on the ground this year Republicans in Colorado and elsewhere in the nation have upped their focus on getting out the vote But GOP and conservative opponents know the ground game remains a potent Democratic weaponThe question in Colorado is is the lefts ability to organize combined with allmail ballots enough to overcome a voting record from Udall that is clearly out of step with the state said Tim Phillips executive director of Americans For Prosperity the conservative group funded by the billionaire Koch brothersColorado has symbolized the Democrats Obamaera electoral edge  a coalition of Hispanics white collegeeducated single women and younger voters coupled with the partys getoutthevote machine That combination has helped Democrats win every topoftheticket race in Colorado for the past decade despite an electorate that is evenly divided between Republicans Democrats and voters not affiliated with either partyGardner 40 represents Republicans best chance to break that cycle and demonstrate that this state cant be taken for granted by DemocratsCory is such a talented dynamic guy that if we cant win with him when are we going to win said Dick Wadhams a GOP consultant and former state party chair who is predicting a Gardner victoryThe race had been deadlocked in public polls since Gardner considered a rising star in the U S House declared his candidacy in late February But both sides agree the Republican has gained ground amid escalating worries over the Middle East instability and the spread of EbolaGardner has shifted to the center on immigration And he has disavowed a state measure that would grant legal rights to fertilized eggs outlawing abortion and possibly some forms of birth control  even though he supports similar federal legislationAfter attacks from Udall Gardner proposed allowing birth control pills to be bought overthecounter The idea could increase costs on consumers but is aimed at showing the father of two is not opposed to the concept of birth controlJust the campaign that Gardner has run and the kind of candidate he is has already turned the tide of Republican fortunes  to have a candidate who is not gaffeprone who is hard to characterize as out of the mainstream said Rob Witwer a former Republican state legislator who coauthored a book on how Democrats took over the stateThough Bennet and then Udall were both upbeat as they cheered on volunteers in Aurora some of their canvassers recognized the strain of a tight raceJulie Gonzales a union organizer said shes even more nervous about Udalls prospects than she was about Bennets in 2010 She blamed Republicans for sapping peoples hopes and the publics disgust with the past four years of nothing getting done in WashingtonThey expect miracles

each raised last month and how much they had on hand as October beganDemocrats campaign committee for House races picked up 167 million in September despite long odds of winning a majority  surpassing both parties campaign arms focused on the Senate which is very much in play If Republicans net six Senate seats and win handily as expected in the House they will control both chambers in Congress for the final two years of President Barack Obamas termNo shortage of money is behind both parties effortsHighlightsDONORS FLOOD SENATE PANELSThe two party committees dedicated to electing senators raised more than a combined 1 million each day in September as donors began reacting to an increasingly possible Republican takeover of the Senate Each had a record month for fundraisingThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee raised 16 million in September and began October with more than 14 million ready to spend The group also spent 27 million over a 30day period in September emptying bank accounts that have collected 127 million since January 2013The National Republican Senatorial Committee meanwhile raised 155 million last month  roughly four times its average monthly haul this cycle The group did not disclose how much the committee spent last month or how much it had saved for the final weeks of an already bruising campaign The Republicans have collected 98 million since January 2013Democrats have consistently bested Republicans when it comes to getting supporters to open their wallets The DSCC has outraised the NRSC in 19 of the 21 months this campaign cycle  and every month this yearThat 29 million advantage has allowed Senate Democrats political machine to hire staff in crucial races to knock on doors call voters and help candidates campaign against Republicans It also has allowed them to spend in races that previously were considered off limits such as the Republicanfavored race in South Dakota where Democrats are now spending 1 million on ads___YET DEMS STILL FUNDING FORCE IN HOUSEDespite an uphill climb to topple Republicans majority House Democrats campaign committee raised 167 million last month and began October with more than 34 million for final weeks before Election Day That puts the DCCC atop the pile both in terms of cash raised and cash banked among the parties major campaign committeeAt the same time House Republicans campaign effort raised more than 11 million last month and started October sitting on 33 million for what is expected to be an easy task of defending their majorityCombined the Democratic Congressional Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee have now raised more than a quarter billion  288 million to be exact  and have spent 221 millionDespite a fundraising advantage Democrats face tough odds for denying Republicans their majority Only a handful of races are seen as competitive because onceadecade redistricting favors Republicans and President Barack Obama remains deeply unpopular in many House districtsEven so the DCCC has raised 163 million since January of 2013 The NRCC has raised 125 million in the same timeIf it needs it the NRCC has secured a 20 million line of credit The DNC has pledged 5 million to help the DCCCRepublicans hold 233 seats and Democrats have 199 in the current Congress There are three vacancies___PARTIES ALSO THROWING CASH TO SENATEBoth parties national organizations are spending heavily to tilt the balance of power in SenateThe Republican National Committee has borrowed 4 million to help the NRSC The committee also is promising donors that every dollar raised between now and Election Day will be earmarked to help Senate hopefulsThe RNC also has sent 15 million to state parties to help getoutthevote efforts in competitive Senate racesThe Democratic National Committee also is doublingdown on the Senate The DNC had planned to give the DSCC 2 million but last week bumped that figure up to 5 millionThe DNC was working to open a line of credit from which they could borrow for the final weeks Because the documents were not signed before Oct 15 details about that decision will not be disclosed until postelection financial forms are filed on Dec 4The RNC raised 135 million in September The DNC raised almost 102 million The RNC has now outraised the DNC in 12 of the previous 21 months the DNC prevailed in six of the first nine months of this year___OUTSIDE GROUPS STILL HOLD SWAY American Crossroads the super PAC backed by former George W Bush political adviser Karl Rove raised almost 114 million last month The biggest check came from selfstorage billionaire Wayne Hughes He wrote a 2 million check taking his total giving to the super PAC to 25 million American Crossroads largest donor this campaign cycle remains New Yorkbased hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer He wrote a 125 million check to Crossroads in September taking his giving to 26 million American Crossroads has now raised more than 25 million Officials

Independence USA PAC in September The billionaire former mayor gave his super PAC roughly 900000 last month Bloomberg is the only individual contributor to the group which has spent more than 8 million since January 2013 He also gave 1 million in September to the proabortion rights Planned Parenthood Votes roughly half of what it raised last month The Senate Majority PAC collected 92 million in September to help keep Democrats in power The group which has ties to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has banked  and spent  more than 40 this year Its donors last month included New York

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/20/world/americas/20reuters-uruguay-marijuana.html,MONTEVIDEO   Uruguay is struggling to roll out the commercial production and sale of marijuana and its groundbreaking experiment could be dropped or watered down if an opposition candidate wins this months presidential electionThe South American country is the worlds first to permit the cultivation distribution and use of marijuana aiming to wrest control of the trade from drug gangs while at the same regulating and even taxing its consumptionThe reform is being followed closely across Latin America where the legalization or decriminalization of some narcotics is increasingly viewed as a better way to end the violence spawned by drug trafficking than the USled war on drugsBut first Uruguay needs to work out how to ensure criminal gangs do not finance producers how to regulate the supply and quality of locally produced marijuana and how to satisfy neighboring states that legally grown dope will not be sold illegally on their streetsThe government has missed its own deadlines in implementing the changes that were passed into law last DecemberWeve been working on this since the very beginning since the first day But I just dont know if well manage it  said one government source familiar with the legalization programSebastian Sabini a lawmaker of the ruling coalition who put forward the law said its implementation required the creation of institutions that existed nowhere elseThe plan to start selling marijuana in pharmacies late this year looks unlikely as the government is still tendering cultivation licenses and identifying where seeds can be purchased fromGiven the delays leftist President Jose Mujica now faces a race against time to push through the changes before the countrys next leader takes office in MarchVoters go to the polls to elect a new president on Oct 26Mujica a 79year old exguerilla is constitutionally barred from running for a second consecutive termThe candidate for the leftwing Frente Amplio Broad Front ruling coalition Tabare Vazquez has endorsed the marijuana law though he is less enthusiastic about it than MujicaVazquezs main opponent in the tight race Luis Lacalle Pou of the centrist National Party endorsed a bill in 2010 that would have allowed personal cultivation of marijuana but he says the current reform is inapplicable in realityI am against the state producing and selling drugs and earning money with this he saidLacalle Pou who is the son of a previous president told TV station Canal 10 the law would be difficult to implement adding it meant the state abandons its role of protecting public health and trying to prevent addictionsIf Lacalle Pou wins and the marijuana law has not been rolled out he could simply shelve the project Otherwise he would have to pass a new bill overturning itEDGY SMOKERSThe Netherlands permits the sale of marijuana in coffee shops Canada allows terminally ill patients to grow and smoke their own marijuana and the US states of Washington and Colorado have legalized its cultivation and consumption but only Uruguay has passed legislation to allow commercial productionUruguay is one of Latin Americas most liberal societies and smoking marijuana has been legal here since 1998Even so opinion polls ahead of the election have shown almost two out of three Uruguayans disapprove of the state playing the role of narcotics regulatorMujicas critics say his liberal policies which also include the legalization of abortion and gay marriage have often been more widely acclaimed abroad than at homeAn opinion poll by consultancy group Factum earlier this month showed Vazquez with the support of 42 percent of voters and Lacalle Pou in second place with 32 percentWith both men projected to fall short of the absolute majority needed for a firstround victory they will likely go to a runoff where polls show them running neckandneckVazquez 74 has been largely silent on the marijuana issue and while Lacalle Pou has reiterated his opposition to the law  it has not flared into a hot campaign issue Voters are more concerned about crime health and educationThe marijuana legislation allows each household to grow up to six plants while registered users may buy up to 40 grams per person a month at pharmaciesOut of an estimated 150000 recreational smokers however only 600 have registered to be allowed to grow cannabis at homeOne of them civil servant Renzo Dodera 49 welcomes the change recalling how police last year destroyed his crop after a neighbor snitched on him But he says the law has left some pot smokers feeling uncomfortableThey feel the register can be a way of keeping track of cannabis users in a system that still discriminates against them said Dodera They are worried it may make it impossible for them to get workPricing has proved to be another headache Uruguay wants to undercut cheap Paraguayan cannabis that is often mixed with dirt and sell top grade marijuana that sells at nearly 4 per gram on the street for just 1At those prices some producers may decide there is not enough profit to make it worthwhile Uruguay received 22 applications for commercial production licenses after there were about 100 initial inquiriesStill some smokers back the governments moves and say they are unfazed by the risk of Mujica failing to see through the law before he steps downWe have been fighting for this for 10 years said Juan Vaz chairman of the Association of Cannabis Studies of Uruguay and the first Uruguayan to register as a

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/us/politics/outspoken-governor-tries-to-squeak-by-in-3-way-maine-race.html,WATERVILLE Me  In a state with a long tradition of electing moderates and independents Gov Paul R LePage a fierce partisan is definitely a departureWith Tea Party backing he burst onto the scene in 2010 breathing antiwelfare fire bludgeoning Democrats and bristling with unapologetic comments that bordered on the profaneA former millworker with a back story out of Dickens  the oldest of 18 children of an abusive alcoholic father he ran away from home at 11  Mr LePage 66 has earned his share of admirersA majority of voters however did not want him as governor in the first place Yet he could win another term in November  again without a majorityIn 2010 Mr LePage a Republican squeaked into office with 38 percent of the vote against two major candidates Now after four turbulent years polls show him at about that same level as he again faces two challengers who have divided the forces against himBut his task this year appears harderHis Democratic opponent Representative Michael H Michaud 59 a sixterm congressman and former president of the State Senate is much better positioned than the Democratic nominee in 2010Mr Michaud whose name has been pronounced as both MeSHOW and MeSHOO he has no preference enjoys the support of national Democrats unions and environmentalists President Obama still more popular than unpopular among Democrats here is stumping for him this month Mr Michaud is a former millworker as well but unlike the governor he did not attend college If elected he would become the countrys first governor who is openly gayMr Michaud and Mr LePage are in a tight race according to a University of New Hampshire poll conducted last month for The Portland Press Herald with Mr Michaud at 40 percent and Mr LePage at 38 percentWorking in Mr LePages favor again this year is the presence of a third candidate Eliot Cutler an independent Mr Cutler 68 a wealthy lawyer and businessman ran against Mr LePage in 2010 and nearly beat him with 36 percent of the vote This time Mr Cutler trails in third place  partly because of Democratic resolve to unite behind Mr Michaud  but he still diffuses the antiLePage voteThe higher Mr Cutler climbs in the polls analysts say the more likely he is to siphon votes from Mr Michaud and hand the election to Mr LePage If Mr Cutler were not in the race the University of New Hampshire poll showed Mr Michaud would lead Mr LePage 50 percent to 44 percentIn other words Mr LePage needs Mr Cutler This dynamic is shaping the race and has been evident at the three debates held so far An animated Mr LePage something of a ham on stage has nodded and smiled at many of Mr Cutlers comments while shaking his head in exasperation at many of Mr Michauds Mr LePage and Mr Cutler have even exchanged highfives prompting Democrats to call their unlikely relationship a bromanceThe crosscurrents can be confusing to voters Nate Blair 28 a hotel manager here said he was leaning toward Mr Michaud but wanted to hear what Cutler has to say He will not vote for Mr LePage He makes Maine look uneducated but worries that a vote for Mr Cutler is a vote for Mr LePageSome analysts say fostering such confusion is Mr LePages goal Theres an attempt to create a certain degree of chaos so that antiLePage voters who havent gone to Cutler yet will say that Michaud cant win and will move to Cutler said Amy Fried a political scientist at the University of MaineA crafty Mr LePage played into this dynamic last week at a debate in Augusta Given a chance to question his opponents Mr LePage had Mr Cutler acknowledge that Democratic leaders had asked him to be their candidate before they went to Mr Michaud The state party chairman Ben Grant has said however that he never asked Mr Cutler to be the nomineeWhatever the strategy the barrelchested Mr LePage who evokes Broderick Crawford the actor who played a Huey Longlike politician in the film All the Kings Men has dominated Maine politics for the last four yearsHe boasts of enacting the largest tax cut in Maine history paying off 500 million that the state owed to hospitals and helping the private sector create 22000 jobs The centerpiece of his candidacy is his visceral opposition to welfare especially those who take advantage of the system He has placed a fiveyear cap on some welfare benefits leading to a 41 percent reduction in welfare casesBut he is best known for making inflammatory remarks As your governor he declared during the 2010 campaign youre going to be seeing a lot of me on the front page saying Governor LePage tells Obama to go to hell  He has compared the Internal Revenue Service to the Gestapo Most infamously when members of the NAACP complained of his skipping a ceremony for Martin Luther Kings Birthday he told reporters Tell them to kiss my buttAt one debate Mr LePage explained his most incendiary comments by saying he had uttered them in his first two years as governor So even a Frenchman can be taught to cool down he said drawing laughter from the audienceHis campaign portrays his bluntness as a virtue Voters in one television ad praise him as brutally honest and extremely candidMr LePage sees himself as having an executive personality with little patience for political nicetiesIm not the best and most polished politician he said at a debate in Portland In fact I hate the word politician I prefer the word businessman because thats what Ive done my whole career and I believe my actions speak for themselvesMr Michaud has framed his campaign as a referendum on Mr LePage who he says has hurt the state and damaged its reputationPeople are fed up Mr Michaud said Theyre tired of the divisiveness the partisanship and the failed policy of this administrationMr LePage vetoed five separate bills to expand Medicaid coverage and he cut existing Medicaid coverage for nearly 38000 people Maine is one of only two states with New Jersey where the number of people without health insurance has increased And last year Forbes ranked Maine as the worst state for doing business for the fourth straight yearMr Michaud has represented the conservative Second Congressional District in rural northern Maine since 2003 His votes earned him high marks from the National Rifle Association and the enmity of abortionrights groups But he says he has evolved on abortion and he now has the backing of abortionrights groups That move  and his coming out last year as gay  was seen as helpful in more liberal southern MaineMr LePage paints Mr Michaud as an oldline Democrat and backbencher in Congress who has accomplished little Its so easy to work across party lines when you do nothing Mr LePage snapped at a debateMr Cutler blames both parties for Maines economic nose dive and says the state is being run like a 5yearold runs a lemonade standBut he has become more critical of Mr Michaud attacking him at the debate in Augusta for suggesting that his votes against abortion rights came in the distant pastIm glad Mike has evolved but hes not being honest Mr Cutler said He cast those votes when he was 24 34 44 and even 54 It took him 30 years to evolveAll this has left Mr Cutlers supporters and some Michaud supporters in a difficult position toggling between a sense that Mr Cutler might make a better governor but that only Mr Michaud can beat Mr LePageEdward J Suslovic a Portland city councilman who backs Mr Cutler said he was getting pressure from fellow Democrats to switch to Mr Michaud But privately they acknowledge that Eliot is smarter and he has a more developed plan to get Maine out of the economic doldrums Mr Suslovic saidMr Michaud said in an interview that he expected Mr Cutlers backers to move his way Some tell me they feel obligated to him but if it looks like he cant win theyll support me he saidNot so fast said Mr Cutler He has suggested that if his support has not surged in the polls by late October he might release his supporters In an interview Mr Cutler did not slam the door on that option but he sounded like a candidate who was in the contest to stay asserting I dont have any intention at all of getting out of this race,20141019,abortion

looked forward to when I was a child was voting Voting was your own business a governmentsanctioned secret I was told that no one would ever ask me whom I voted for and if for some reason of ignorance or terrible manners they did ask I didnt have to tell The notion that I got to choose the person who ran the country a minor misconception of how voting worked without admitting that I was the one who had done it appealed to me greatlySay so long to secrets Now we wear our voting intentions across our chests and on our bumpers We assert our political selves in every aspect of social media I know who everybody  my friends my neighbors my movie stars  is voting for Life would be so much more peaceful if I didnt Eventually what I considered to be a better part of my character was worn down by this barrage of selfexpression In 2008 I had a pin on my book bag that read My Mama Votes Obama thus outing both my mother and myself Not that I needed the button I drive a PriusIf you feel its presumptuous to guess peoples voting record by looking at their cars go straight to the irrefutable evidence and look in their yards Where I live the lawns bristle with campaign signs People on corner lots often opt for oversize signs on wooden bases that must be delivered by flatbed truck while those who live midblock content themselves with three or four identical signs so that you will not only know whom theyre voting for but also the strength of their convictionsSo convinced are some in the power of their message that they campaign not only to undecided voters but also to undecided candidates Perhaps they imagine Jeb Bush or Elizabeth Warren will walk down their street see their own name in the shrubbery and think Well if its important enough for that person to put up a yard sign then maybe I should just go for itThose signs remain through the seasons pelted by sprinklers baked by the sun buried beneath leaves encrusted in ice until finally the boys from the prep school down the street jump up and down on them in the middle of the night after a football game Trust me Ive seen itTennessee has voted for Republican presidential candidates since Bill Clinton left office Nashville the states capital leans slightly Democratic not that it does anybody any good Our nextdoor neighbor bucked this trend in 2008 with a profusion of Sarah Palin signs the ones with the big smack of red lipstick Our houses are close together and our neighbor owns a foot of grass on our side of his driveway We water that strip of grass and mow it and aerate the soil but he owns it which is why he could put one of those lipstick signs on it making it look for all the world like his affection for Governor Palin was our affection for Governor PalinWere voting for McCain now my husband asked after coming home from workLike the prep school boys I waited until the middle of the night and then moved the sign to the other side of my neighbors driveway There it stayed never mentioned while the neighbor and I continued to nod to each other politely on evening walks I looked forward to the end of that particular political season for a million different reasons but especially because I wanted never to have to look at those red lips againI dont know who relies on yard signs to choose their president but I will admit I sometimes rely on them for less consequential elections Our recent primary for the 2014 midterm was such small potatoes I was feeling too lazy to bother voting My neighbors involved citizens every one had signs declaring their intentions in State Senate races State House races the office of county clerk and a school board seat I looked at the names in befuddlement A barrage of robocalls came in from morning until night and on the weekends the candidates themselves knocked on our doorsFRANKLY the Democrats all sounded more or less alike I was more interested in the Republican primary Our twoterm senior United States senator Lamar Alexander whose moderate nature I often admire was being hounded by a Tea Party candidate But because I am a registered Democrat I would have had to request a separate ballot to vote for him There was also a hot Republican primary race in the Fourth Congressional District not mine The incumbent Scott DesJarlais a physician who had vocally opposed abortion rights and samesex marriage was found to have supported his exwifes two abortions and tried to pressure his mistress into having one as well He still ended up winning the primary with a margin of 38 votes out of nearly 70000 castSo I decided not to vote in the primary I would show up for the midterm election in November surely that would be enough I tried not to think about the fact that I was giving up a privilege others had fought for  a privilege that black men didnt have in this country until 1870 nor women until 1920 nor the very poor until the 24th Amendment abolished the poll tax in 1964Thankfully an article in the newspaper changed my mind Three sitting State Supreme Court justices appointed by Tennessees former Democratic governor could be ousted in part as a result of an initiative funded by Americans for Prosperity the conservative political advocacy group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers Just when I thought it was safe to nap through a little local primary election I was reminded that enjoying democracy meant getting off the sofaAfter dinner my husband and I walked the three blocks to our polling place at the fire station in a light summer rain I knew how to vote for the justices but the school board still stumped me I will admit I was leaning heavily on my neighbors yard signs Up and down the street the signs were divided equally between Becky Sharpe and Mary Pierce I had read the handouts each candidate left at our door and they both seemed like good choicesOutside the fire station three people holding signs stood the prescribed 500 feet from the door Among them was our most politically active neighbor with a sign for John Ray Clemmons a candidate for state representative I have enough civic passion to go and vote in the rain but I doubt Ill ever have enough civic passion to hold a sign outside a voting precinct in the rain Another man also had a Clemmons sign and beside him was a man with a sign that said Becky Sharpe Since I so easily could have been swayed in one direction or the other where the school board was concerned I decided to cast my vote for the woman who so nearly shared her name with Thackerays antihero in Vanity Fair I believe that more important votes have been cast on less rationale than thatThe fire station was empty except for a few dedicated poll workers They explained that the ballot was long and complicated and that we should take our time Standing not too far from my husband I went to work There was one group of names that were completely unfamiliar me and since there was no curtain between us and no one else there voting I asked him for helpNo he whispered sharply Vote for yourself I realized then if we had gone to high school together he never would have let me cheat off his testI skipped that question but I did OK on the rest I voted to keep the justices and the justices I am pleased to report remain in their jobs I put my I voted sticker on my shirt and thanked the poll workers for their help We would all be back for the November election I experienced a familiar rush of good civic feelingVoting is like brickwork  the trick is to keep at it every election season laying brick after brick Not just the presidential elections The midterms The primaries Because if you miss one the whole thing starts to slideI said good night to my neighbor who was still standing outside in the drizzle My husband stopped to ask the man with the Becky Sharpe sign if he actually knew Becky Sharpe though I figured he must No one would stand in the rain with a sign for a school board candidate unless he knew that personShes my wife

Aragao a political analyst for the Brasiliabased Arko Advice consulting firm The parliament in an armwrestling contest against the presidency would win  because the parliaments main weapon is just crossing their arms and not voting on matters that are of strong interest to the governmentDespite its anythinggoes appearance Brazil is like many predominantly Roman Catholic nations in Latin America socially conservative In recent opinion polls for example more than 80 percent of Brazilians said they oppose loosening their restrictive abortion laws or legalizing marijuana and just over half oppose gay marriageHowever since Brazils return to democracy in 1985 the nations presidents and its judiciary have pushed through progressive projects either by decree or rulings  such as protecting huge swaths of jungle as indigenous reserves a highcourt ruling permitting samesex civil unions and the creation of Bolsa Familia a program that gives monthly cash payments to Brazils poorest familiesSome predict such changes could be rolled back by the growing conservative forcesThe evangelical caucus votes in lockstep on hotbutton social issues and is willing to block projects put forth by the presidency because its members know they represent a growing segment of the electorate While Catholics remain the majority in Brazil since 1970 their portion of the population has fallen from more than 90 percent to 65 percent while those identifying as Protestants have grown from 5 percent to 22 percent according to the Pew Research CenterIn Rousseffs first term the evangelical caucus blocked her effort to promote gaytolerance teaching in schools and managed to have their most outspoken antigay legislator Deputy Marco Feliciano named head of the bodys human rights commission  a move that provoked condemnation from Amnesty International and other activist groups In the Oct 5 election Feliciano was reelected to his Sao Paulo district with nearly double the votes he won four years agoThe ruralista caucus also grew and now has about 200 members who support its agenda These lawmakers showed their strength in 2012 forcing weakening of environmental protection laws which critics say contributed to a 29 percent jump in the number of Amazon acres deforested over the last yearAnd while the lawandorder block is small with only about 20 members it wields influence on security issues The caucus members defend tougher penal codes for young offenders and want to block the sort of drug liberalization seen in neighboring countries even as Brazil copes with overcrowded prisons and years of failed efforts to suppress powerful drug gangsBut its the evangelical lawmakers who are at the heart of Brazils growing conservatism and theyve shown an ability to rally the other groups behind their main cause defeating any attempt to legalize gay marriage or advance protections for LGBT communitiesToni Reis who heads the gay rights advocacy group Dignidade noted it took a landmark Supreme Court decision to legalize samesex civil unions in 2011 following years of congressional stalling on the matter Now he said gay rights groups are focused not on gay marriage but on advancing legislation to criminalize discrimination against gaysGiven the new legislative reality Reis acknowledged it will be an uphill battleWere going to have to work twice as hard he saidJean Wyllys Brazils first openly gay congressman said progressive lawmakers wont give upTheres no doubt its going to be more difficult said Wyllys who represents Rio de Janeiro state But I also have my allies  We are a political force capable of blocking their the evangelicals legislative projectsBut Brazils most influential evangelical pastor Silas Malafaia who campaigned for several Pentecostal politicians says the conservatives dont intend to impose stances out of step with the electorateI am against gay marriage Lets hold a referendum and let society decide Malafaia said in an interview If the people decide that they want abortions to be legalized I will always be against it but I will respect those decisions Were not evangelical extremists trying to impose what we think with an iron fist___Associated Press writer Brad Brooks contributed to this report___,20141018,abortion
NYT,http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/the-knick-recap-season-1-finale/,Season 1 Episode 10 CrutchfieldMost seasons end with cliffhangers The Season 1 finale of The Knick on Friday night was more like a slowmoving avalanche that left every major character buried   in grief remorse apprehension fear addiction It began with Cornelia Robertson sneaking off for a clandestine abortion and ended with John Thackery sneaking into a new type of hospital to try to kick his cocaine habitHeres where the director and show runner Steven Soderbergh and the writers Jack Amiel and Michael Begler left everyone heading into Season 2 already promised for next year on CinemaxCornelia  She aborted Algernons baby surprised to be driven to the secret location by the Knicks ambulance man Cleary and operated on by the Knicks midwife Sister Harriet The nun encouraged her to keep the baby since she was about to marry anyway Cornelia couldnt tell her the real problem that the childs father was black To compound her misery Cornelia then had to go ahead and marry Phillip  after a brief tearful scene with Algernon the father who coldly told her  You were looking for a risk to take and I was it and said she would barely remember all this mess She put on a smile for the wedding until she saw the smug visage of her sexually predatory new fatherinlaw during the ceremony Last seen looking like a zombie as she rode away with Phillip the next dayAlgernon  On the day of the wedding which he didnt or couldnt  attend he picked the latest in his series of bareknuckle alley fights this time with a man he knew he couldnt beat Shots of him being repeatedly knocked down alternated with shots of Cornelias wedding Last seen lying unconscious and bloody in the street At the hospital he has become the de facto chief surgeon by virtue of Everett Gallingers absence and Thackerys obsession see below But he still isnt getting much respect  Thackery interrupted him in the middle of an operation and Everett went to the hospital to physically attack him in front of the whole staffEverett  His wife Eleanor was not only in a mental institution but also at the mercy of a quack who in a twisted echo of the pioneering surgeons at the Knick was committed to an experimental course of treatment that involved pulling all her teeth If she didnt improve her tonsils adenoids and colon were next in line Blaming Algernon for his crashing fortunes Everett attacked him but was dragged away and chastised by Thackery  Last seen sitting silently with his disturbed and toothless wifeHerman Still 9000 in debt to Bunky Collier Herman Barrow was interrupted in the middle of sex yelled at and for good measure punched in the groin In desperation he went to Ping Wu the pimp and opium dispenser who owed Thackery his life and told him that Thackery wanted Bunky dead In a scene that was just a little over the top Ping appeared at Bunkys office slashed his underlings throats and threw an ax that split Bunkys forehead He then appeared at Hermans office where he announced that he had found Bunkys account book and knew that the debt was Hermans So now Herman owes Ping the 9000 Last seen attending a Knick board meeting at which a vote was finally held on whether to move the hospital uptown and stop taking charity cases The result of the vote An actual cliffhangerBertie Caught in Thackerys obsessive onesided rivalry with the surgeon Levi Zinberg kindly Bertie was dispatched to spy on Zinberg and learn what he could about his research on blood transfusions Zinberg who actually wants to be collegial handed Bertie his notes which led Bertie   smarter than anyone gives him credit for  to discover that Thackerys ideas were wrong Fatally as it turned out When Thackery completely crashed it was Bertie who reluctantly came to the rescue asking his father to get Thackery admitted to the Cromartie Hospital to dry out All this despite Berties anguish that Nurse Lucy prefers Thackery to him Last seen finally angry chastising Lucy for her concern for ThackeryLucy She didnt really do much besides worry over Thackery Last seen sitting silently while Bertie yelled at herThackery  Pushed over the edge by his paranoid jealousy of Zinberg he tried to cure a young  patient by transfusing blood directly from his arm into hers  one of two medical horror scenes in the episode the other involving an openbrain surgery It didnt work Finally allowing himself to be treated for his addiction he checked in under the alias Crutchfield  the episodes title and we learned his mothers maiden name The doctor treating him explained that to alleviate the pain of withdrawal hed be receiving injections of a new wonder drug  one that came from the Bayer company meaning it had to be safe Last seen in bed closing his eyes as the cameras focus shifted and we could see the label on the miracle drug HeroinSome noticeable things amid the Sturm und Drang Bertie has assumed the central role in the narrative once held by Algernon who has faded into the background since he became a fullfledged upstairs surgeon Eve Hewsons performance as Lucy which earlier in the season seemed interestingly reserved now seems oddly flat  As the character has become more important entwined with Thackery during his cocaine crisis the performance hasnt developedAs always there were some impressively cinematic moments The best was one of the episodes least important scenes Everetts assault on Algernon It was a single 80second shot following Everett down a hallway pausing and swerving to pick up Thackery as he saw Everett following them both into the ward and then standing outside a window and observing from a distance as the attack took place and Everett was subdued The camera then pivoted and followed Everett and Thackery as they left retracing their route back to the hallway and stopping to watch again as Thackery dressed him down Virtuosic and completely unobtrusiveLet us know in the comments what you thought of Crutchfield and of the first season of The Knick in general And looking ahead Will Cornelia go west with Phillip Will Thackery become a heroin addict Will the Knick stay downtown Well check back in with you in 2015,20141017,abortion

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/us/texas-abortion-clinics-set-to-reopen-despite-future-in-legal-limbo.html,A day after the Supreme Court blocked a Texas law that had forced abortion clinics to close some of the shuttered facilities prepared to reopen pleased at the reprieve but mindful that the legal fight was far from overTuesdays order increased the chances legal experts said of a major faceoff in the Supreme Court over a crucial question What restrictions add up to an undue burden on a womans right to abortionThat question was raised by two provisions in the sweeping antiabortion measure that Texas passed last year The law required doctors at all abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals which proved impossible in many smaller cities The number of facilities providing abortions in the state fell to about 20 from 41Still more stringent was a rule requiring all clinics to meet the costly building and staffing standards of ambulatory care centers A federal appeals court on Oct 2 allowed that provision to take effect forcing all but eight abortion providers in Texas to closeTogether the rules had left one in six Texas women living at least 150 miles from the nearest facility providing abortions according to clinic operators who argued in court that this posed intolerable burdens especially for poor minority women in South and West Texas The state said the measures were needed to protect patients but medical experts called them transparent attempts to curb access to abortionIn a terse order on Tuesday the Supreme Court said that the surgerycenter requirement should be stayed and that clinics in El Paso and McAllen could operate without admitting privilegesWhile the order did not necessarily reveal how or whether the Supreme Court might ultimately rule it did indicate that the justices saw the potentially irrevocable damage if the clinics were forced to close said Caitlin E Borgmann a professor at the CUNY School of Law in New YorkFor now at least it will prevent a large share of the remaining Texas abortion providers from closing down for good which would have rendered any future rulings pointlessThe basic issue Ms Borgmann said is how much a state may restrict abortion without banning it altogetherHow much travel is too much How much do costs matter These are questions the Supreme Court has never answered Ms Borgmann said adding that appeals of the Texas law could give the court an opportunity to clarify the issueThe practical effect of the courts order was evident Wednesday in Texas as some of the affected clinics restocked supplies called scattered employees and prepared to see patients as soon as ThursdayIn Dallas the Routh Street Womens Clinic which had stopped offering abortions two weeks ago began scheduling appointmentsVirginia Braun the owner said that the clinic had been within weeks of a permanent shutdown as bills mounted and that some longtime staff members had leftWe will take it one day at a time but weve got appointments for tomorrow Ms Braun saidAmy Hagstrom Miller the president of Whole Womans Health which operates several clinics in the state said that because of the need to rehire employees and assemble supplies reopening the clinics is not as simple as it might seemMs Hagstrom Miller said that her companys clinic in McAllen in the Rio Grande Valley would begin seeing patients on Friday but that it remained unclear when or whether its facilities in Austin Beaumont and Fort Worth would reopenThe undueburden standard dates to 1992 and the landmark case Planned Parenthood v Casey In that decision the Supreme Court affirmed a womans right to an abortion before the fetus was viable but said a state could enact a restriction as long as it did not have the purpose or effect of imposing an undue burden on women seeking an abortionThe court declared without fully explaining why that a 24hour waiting period was not an undue burden but that requiring a married woman to notify her husband was The law has been confused since then said Michael C Dorf a professor at Cornell Law SchoolTuesdays Supreme Court order gave about 15 Texas clinics a reprieve of at least a few months Next a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans will hear arguments on the merits of the law The suing clinics and the state have been ordered to file briefs by Dec 8Once the appeals court rules the losing side could appeal to the Supreme Court At the same time or alternately the abortion clinics could appeal a recent decision by the Fifth Circuit that upheld the statewide application of the admittingprivileges requirementLawyers at the Center for Reproductive Rights in New York which argued the Texas appeals said they were considering how to proceed in the two casesChallenges to the Texas law have already resulted in sharply contrasting definitions of an unconstitutional burdenOn Aug 29 Judge Lee Yeakel of the United States District Court in Austin ruled that the surgerycenter mandate imposed an undue burden because for some poor and working women long travel times and other impediments would be as drastic as a complete ban on abortionBut two weeks ago a panel of the Fifth Circuit overruled Judge Yeakel saying the law should take effect while it considered appeals The panel accepted the states argument that the clinics had failed to show that a large fraction of Texas women would be adversely affectedThe term large fraction appears in the Casey decision but courts have disagreed on its meaning since then said Ms Borgmann the CUNY law professor Is it a fraction of all Texas women of childbearing age as the state argued or of women in the specific regions left without clinicsYou can never predict that the Supreme Court will provide clear guidance Ms Borgmann said but appeals of the Texas law will present them with the opportunity,20141016,abortion
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/opinion/the-supreme-court-acts-for-texas-women.html,With a brief unsigned order on Tuesday the Supreme Court acted to prevent Texas from enforcing two key parts of the states 2013 package of extreme new abortion restrictions While the legal battle over the provisions continues and is very likely to land back at the court before long the order was a significant victory for women in Texas The important result is that it will allow more clinics offering safe and legal abortion care to continue operating pending a final court resolutionThe procedural order came without explanation apart from a brief statement that Justices Antonin Scalia Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito Jr would have allowed the law to remain in force It does not necessarily foretell how the court would rule on the merits But it provided hope at least that a majority of justices recognize the radical impact of the Texas law  part of a broad wave of burdensome but medically unnecessary abortion restrictions enacted by Republicanled states under the phony guise of protecting womens healthAnd it came as a great relief to supporters of reproductive rights who had feared a repeat of last Novembers refusal by the Supreme Court to similarly intercede in a separate case challenging the Texas lawThe current case focuses on two rules One requires doctors at abortion facilities to have admitting privileges at a local a hospital which are often impossible to obtain because of local hostility to abortion rights The other requires that clinics meet state standards for ambulatory surgical centers which are prohibitively costlyTogether these provisions have left the vast state of Texas with only eight abortion providers down from 41 before the law All eight are clustered in metropolitan areas with none in the Rio Grande Valley or West Texas The stay is expected to bring the total number of abortion providers back up to about 20 Lawyers for the Center for Reproductive Rights felt they had no choice but seek a stay from the Supreme Court once the federal Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit allowed the two damaging requirements go forward while it considered the states appeal of a sound lower court ruling in AugustThat ruling by Judge Lee Yeakel of Federal District Court in Austin found that the provisions imposed an undue burden on women seeking an abortion violating the Supreme Courts standard for permissible restrictions and that the states justifications were a shamIn its request for a stay the Center for Reproductive Rights argued that allowing the provisions to go into effect now would inflict irreversible damageThe clinics forced to remain closed during the appeals process will likely never reopen the lawyers told the justices This in turn would leave more than 900000 Texas women of reproductive age living over 150 miles from the nearest Texas abortion providerAnother Fifth Circuit panel is likely to hear the states appeal of the substance of Judge Yeakels ruling in late December or early January The Supreme Courts move was just an interim step toward sanity This fight is far from over,20141016,abortion
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/opinion/something-happening-here.html,Has there ever been such a crazy opening to a Supreme Court term One so confoundingly opaque yet mattering so muchIn the space of eight days the justices managed to touch on American societys hottest of hotbutton issues samesex marriage access to the polls and finally  inevitably  abortion and all without actually issuing an opinion Review denied stays granted stays lifted newsmaking orders appearing randomly at odd hours from an institution usually so predictable in its schedule that you can set a clock by its yearly calendar What on earth is the court doing and what  with saying hardly a word  is it telling usI keep thinking of Chief Justice John Marshalls famous declaration in Marbury v Madison 211 years ago that launched the Supreme Court on its project of judicial review It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is OK at this point I would settle for something less ambitious Id be grateful if the Supreme Court would say somethingI cant pretend to have come up with a grand theory to explain the courts behavior I actually doubt that there is a grand theory Rather I suspect that theres something more prosaic going on justices acting from different motivations and happening to coalesce around outcomes that serve a current purpose but that are in no ones particular interest to explain Explanations after all may bind Silence keeps options open If that leaves things in a muddle well maybe thats the point Were at liberty to come up with explanations of our own So what follows are a couple of mineStart with the courts denial of appeals from rulings by three federal appellate circuits that in recent months had declared the samesex marriage bans in Virginia Indiana Wisconsin Oklahoma and Utah to be unconstitutional Defying the expectations of nearly everyone the court turned the cases down without a word It shouldnt have been quite such a surprise as I suggested last month with the appeals courts in agreement the cases didnt meet the Supreme Courts usual circuitconflictdriven criterion for review Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was explicit about that shortly before the term opened telling an audience at the University of Minnesota Law School that there was no need for us to rush into the marriage issue unless and until one of the remaining circuits ruled the other way While it would have been helpful to see that explanation in a published opinion rather than in a single justices offthecuff remark Justice Ginsburg may have been expressing just her personal viewIts true that the court doesnt usually explain itself when it turns a case down But individual justices sometimes offer explanations in formal statements labeled respecting the denial of certiorari Or more often a justice publishes a dissent from a denial a strategic move that that serves to highlight the case and force into view a debate that otherwise would have remained behind closed doors Justice Ginsburg in fact joined Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in just such an exercise on Tuesday dissenting from the courts denial of review in a criminal appeal that raised an important sentencing issueObviously then the justices do know how to explain themselves So what explains the silence in the marriage casesIt takes the votes of four justices to grant a case for review and theres been much speculation about which group might have voted which way at the closeddoor conference that preceded the openingday list of orders Perhaps according to this line of thinking neither side of a court that is closely divided on gay rights issues felt sufficiently confident that Justice Anthony M Kennedy would provide a fifth vote So perhaps the outcome was what political scientists call a defensive denialI dont buy that scenario My own theory is that there was in fact no scramble for votes and probably not even any discussion To back up a bit Its helpful to understand that the default fate of every Supreme Court petition is denied Only if a justice lifts a petition from the voluminous and automatic dead list and adds it to the relative handful of cases to be discussed at the justices weekly conference does a petition have even a theoretical chance of being granted That the marriage cases were denied at the first possible moment in the term suggests to me that instead of a discussion there was an unspoken understanding that a grant at this point served no ones interest  even though the individual interests differed some irreconcilablyFor Justice Ginsburg and Justice Elena Kagan both of whom have officiated at samesex weddings the reason to deny the appeals might have been that events outside the court are moving so decisively in the right direction that there is no necessity for the court to spend any of its own capital to achieve the same result Justices Stephen G Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor plausibly see the situation the same wayAs for the courts conservatives It might have occurred to Justice Scalia that he was unlikely to win and had little to gain from taking the case and losing After all he had already declared defeat on samesex marriage in the dissenting opinion he issued last year when the court by a vote of 5 to 4 invalidated a central part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act In that case United States v Windsor he had this to say about Justice Kennedys majority opinion It takes real cheek for todays majority to assure us as it is going out the door that a constitutional requirement to give formal recognition to same sex marriage is not at issue here The majority would be limited Justice Scalia charged only by its sense of what it can get away with Whatever Justice Scalia intended by this rhetorical blast federal judges around the country have taken his dissenting opinion as an announcement that the moment for samesex marriage is already here Citing his opinion they have ruled accordinglyAs for Justice Kennedy he is the author not only of last years DOMA decision but of the two other decisions by which the Supreme Court has extended rights to gay men and lesbians Romer v Evans in 1996 and Lawrence v Texas in 2003 I have little doubt that he would like to extend this streak to include marriage He will probably get his chance There are some very conservative circuits that have yet to be heard from and that may well produce the circuit conflict that the court is waiting to resolve These include the antediluvian Fifth Circuit the appeals court that made such a flagrant botch of abortion law in the Texas clinicclosing case that the Supreme Court intervened on Tuesday night and granted a stay to permit 13 clinics to reopen The Fifth Circuit on Tuesday issued an order putting back into effect the Texas voter ID law that a federal district judge had declared unconstitutional that case is headed to the Supreme Court tooThe Texas abortion case in which the Supreme Court intervened this week presented a dynamic very different from the marriage cases To grant the emergency request filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights required five votes The New Yorkbased center represents the clinics forced to close last week when the Fifth Circuit issued a stay of a Federal District Court decision in late August that the law requiring the clinics to be constructed and equipped as mini hospitals was unconstitutional Texas is appealing the district courts decision The center asked the justices to vacate the stay in order to permit the clinics to remain open while the states appeal goes forwardMost people including me wouldnt have given a nickel for the chance that the court would grant the request Just last November the justices voted 5 to 4 against granting a similar request to keep the admittingprivilege requirement of the Texas law on hold while appeals of that portion of the states antiabortion law went forward Something changed but whatThe order Tuesday night announcing that the court was vacating the Fifth Circuits stay noted only that Justice Scalia Justice Thomas and Justice Alito would deny the application in its entirety The three dissenters didnt write and neither did any of the six other justices at least five of whom must have voted to grant the application That means that Justice Kennedy or Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr or both went over to the other side and joined the four Justices Ginsburg Breyer Sotomayor and Kagan who had dissented when the court allowed the admittingprivileges requirement to go into effectCertainly the situation facing the clinics was dire The Center for Reproductive Rights plausibly argued that if the clinics remained shuttered for much longer it was likely they would never be able to reopen This is the kind of irreparable harm that courts insist on finding in order to grant an injunction that preserves the status quo But the same argument was made last fall on behalf of clinics that faced closure because nearby hospitals wouldnt give their doctors the required admitting privilegesfSo something else was going on here I think The precedent that currently governs abortion law is Planned Parenthood v Casey from 1992 With Justice Kennedys support it preserved the right to abortion prohibiting restrictions that have the purpose or effect of placing an obstacle in the path of a woman seeking to terminate a pregnancy before viability In holding that the forced closing of every abortion clinic south and west of San Antonio requiring women to travel hundreds of miles to exercise their constitutional right was not an undue burden in purpose or effect the Fifth Circuit ruled in blatant disregard of the Casey standard Could Justice Kennedy really put up with this without at least preserving the status quo in order to allow the appeal to proceedAs the justices must know chances are quite good that the court will eventually hear an appeal in the Texas clinic case The Fifth Circuit took the unusual step of acknowledging that its analysis was contrary to the approach that other courts have taken in applying the undue burden standard to the recent rash of regulations Judge Richard A Posner of the Seventh Circuit along with others have balanced the burden imposed by the law against the benefits that the state claimed for it In the clinicclosing context the burdens are obviously great while as Federal District Judge Lee Yeakel found in the Texas case there is no reason for imposing the hospitallike requirement on clinics that have been operating in safety and in conformance with existing regulations for many years The appeals court rejected that analysis In our circuit we do not balance the wisdom or effectiveness of a law against the burdens the law imposes Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod wroteThat might have been enough to get the attention even of Chief Justice Roberts Im reminded of the crisis the Supreme Court created for itself over the death penalty in the mid1980s when there were four votes to hear a deathrow inmates appeal but not the five votes necessary to grant a stay of execution As the execution hour approached Justice Lewis F Powell Jr blinked and provided the fifth vote for a stay The inmate Willie Darden went on to lose his appeal and he was eventually executed The Texas abortion clinics may eventually be forced to close again But for the moment someone blinked and rationality prevails Maybe without saying anything the Roberts court told us something after all,20141016,abortion

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/us/supreme-court-allows-texas-abortion-clinics-to-stay-open.html,WASHINGTON   The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed more than a dozen Texas abortion clinics to reopen blocking a state law that had imposed strict requirements on abortion providers Had the law been allowed to stand it would have caused all but eight of the states abortion clinics to close and would have required many women to travel more than 150 miles to the nearest abortion providerThe Supreme Courts order  five sentences long and with no explanation of the justices reasoning  represents an interim step in a legal fight that is far from over But abortion rights advocates welcomed what they said was the enormous practical impact of the move Had the clinics been forced to remain closed while appeals went forward they said they might never have reopenedState officials said the laws requirements were needed to protect womens health Abortion providers said the regulations were expensive unnecessary and a ruse meant to put many of them out of businessThe justices addressed two parts of the Texas law that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit had provisionally let stand while it considered an appealOne of them required all abortion clinics in the state to meet the standards for ambulatory surgical centers including regulations concerning buildings equipment and staffing The other required doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospitalThe Supreme Court in an unsigned order apparently reflecting the views of six justices blocked the surgicalcenter requirement entirely and the admittingprivileges requirement as it applied to clinics in McAllen Tex and El PasoJustices Antonin Scalia Clarence Thomas and Samuel A Alito Jr said they would have allowed the law to be enforcedAbortion rights advocates praised the orderTomorrow 13 clinics across the state will be allowed to reopen and provide women with safe and legal abortion care in their own communities said Nancy Northup president of the Center for Reproductive Rights adding that advocates were still pursuing appeals This fight against Texas sham abortion law is not overThe appeals courts decision had left only eight clinics open in Texas all clustered in metropolitan regions in the eastern part of the state No abortion facilities were operating west or south of San AntonioIf the stay entered by the Fifth Circuit is not vacated lawyers with the Center for Reproductive Rights told the Supreme Court the clinics forced to remain closed during the appeals process will likely never reopenThe appeals courts ruling the centers brief said meant that over 900000 Texas women of reproductive age more than a sixth of all such women in Texas now reside more than 150 miles from the nearest Texas abortion provider up from 86000 prior to the enactment of the challenged actIn response Greg Abbott Texas attorney general and the Republican candidate for governor told the justices that it is undisputed that the vast majority of Texas residents more than 83 percent still live within a comfortable driving distance 150 miles of an abortion clinic in compliance with the law Others live in parts of the state he said that did not have nearby clinics in the first placeThose in the El Paso area Mr Abbott continued could obtain abortions across the state line in New MexicoThe appeals court drawing on the Supreme Courts last major abortion decision said the laws challengers had not shown that a large fraction of women seeking abortions would face an unconstitutional burden thanks to the lawThe law in question which includes some of the nations toughest abortion restrictions was enacted last year by the Republicanled Legislature Before it came into force 41 medical practices were licensed to provide abortions in TexasThe law was passed after a marathon filibuster that turned a Democratic state senator Wendy Davis into a national political star and set the stage for her campaign for governor against Mr AbbottThe court recognized that these deeply personal decisions should be made by a woman with the guidance of her family and her doctor Ms Davis said Tuesday night in a statement The actions by Austin politicians like Greg Abbott had closed all but eight Texas reproductive health centers and harmed the health and safety of hundreds of thousands of women throughout the stateIn August Judge Lee Yeakel of the Federal District Court in Austin ruled that the surgicalcenter rule imposed an unconstitutional burden on women seeking abortions The number and location of the clinics it would effectively close the judge wrote burdened the exercise of a constitutional right for many women just as drastically as a complete ban on abortionOn Tuesday Yvonne Gutierrez the executive director of Planned Parenthoods Texas political action committee said the Supreme Courts action was a rebuke to Mr AbbottToday the Supreme Court ruled that Greg Abbott cannot force nearly a million Texas women to drive over 300 miles to access their constitutionally protected right to safe and legal abortion Ms Gutierrez said adding that the justices had rejected his contention that the law created a manageable inconvenienceA spokeswoman for Mr Abbott Lauren Bean said on Tuesday night The attorney generals office will continue to defend the law just as we defend all state laws when they are challenged in courtLast November the Supreme Court in a 5to4 ruling rejected a request to intercede in a separate case challenging the law one that centered on the admittingprivileges requirement In dissent Justice Stephen G Breyer said he expected the Supreme Court to agree to hear an appeal in that case regardless of how the Fifth Circuit ultimately ruledA threejudge panel of the appeals court upheld the admittingprivileges requirement in March On Thursday the full Fifth Circuit refused 12 to 3 to reconsider that ruling In light of Justice Breyers comment Supreme Court review of the admittingprivileges case appears likely,20141015,abortion

Astorino the Republican candidate for governor on Nov 4Shopping at a Home Depot here Mr Stalaj 59 a building manager said that he disliked the Democratic incumbent Andrew M Cuomo because he believed that Mr Cuomo was using the governors office as a steppingstone for the presidency Also Mr Stalaj has formed a favorable impression of Mr Astorino as the man who runs Westchester County and has held the line on property taxesI like his conservative views because in Westchester were overtaxed Mr Stalaj said alluding to reports that list the county as having some of the highest property taxes in the state He owns a home in PurchaseIf Mr Astorino is to realize his longshot quest to defeat Mr Cuomo he must win over thousands more people like Mr Stalaj Democrats and unaffiliated voters willing to look past party label and social issues like gun control and abortion rights over which Mr Cuomo has been relentlessly hammering Mr Astorino as an ultraconservativeMr Astorino has a long way to go Democrats have a 2to1 edge in voter registration in New York State and the latest Quinnipiac University poll showed Mr Cuomo with a 20percentagepoint lead among likely voters And while Mr Astorino has tried to introduce himself across the state the governors barrage of pungent television advertisements have been demonizing Mr Astorino not just as conservative on social issues but also as insensitive to older residents and as a threat to Medicaid patientsMr Astorino has faced uphill climbs before Although Democrats have the same lopsided registration advantage in Westchester County he was elected county executive in a close contest in 2009 and was reelected in 2013 with over 55 percent of the voteInterviews with dozens of Westchester residents show that Mr Astorinos fiscal and economic record  including having balanced the county budget without raising taxes  has intrigued both centrist Democrats and those who describe themselves as conservativeHes done a pretty good job in Westchester being a good fiscal manager said Anthony Mast a retired aerospace machinist who said he voted for Mr Cuomo in 2010 but was leaning toward Mr Astorino this yearThen again Westchester residents have had years to get to know Mr Astorino up close in a job where a personal touch can do much to create good willJohn DeCicco 66 a Democrat who owns a familyrun chain of 10 suburban supermarkets said he appreciated that his county taxes  admittedly a small portion of his overall tax bill  had not risenHe also said he liked Mr Astorinos attentiveness to the needs of small businessesMr DeCicco recalled that when his family opened a market in Armonk last June creating 120 jobs Mr Astorino sent a representative who offered to help find ways for the company to reduce its high electricity costs Then Mr Astorino showed up himselfHes been very supportive Mr DeCicco saidStill Mr Cuomos portrayal of Mr Astorino as staunchly rightleaning on social issues appears to be resonating with many Westchester Democrats especially womenKaren Dorfman 71 a real estate agent from New Rochelle said she was already predisposed to vote against Mr Astorino because he seemed to be using the county executives position as a springboard for the governorship but she became firmly persuaded when she saw Mr Cuomos ads attacking Mr AstorinoIf hes antigun control and a womans right to choose those are totally against my views she saidOf course there are Democrats who share Mr Astorinos views on social issues Mr Mast 76 said he was a churchgoing Roman Catholic and planned to support Mr Astorino in November in part because they were likeminded on samesex marriage and abortionBut the interviews suggested Mr Cuomo had lost more support among Westchester Democrats over his abrupt disbanding of an anticorruption commission that he formed last year to investigate political chicanery in AlbanyJoe Kucera 83 a Korean War veteran from Rye Brook said he voted for Mr Cuomo in 2010 but was supporting Mr Astorino this year in protest of the ethics commissions shutdownAs he did in his reelection campaign Mr Astorino has tried to cultivate support among minority voters in Westchester He has made a point of visiting churches and merchants in predominantly black communities like Mount Vernon He even traveled to New Orleans last month to speak at a convention of black Baptist ministers many of whom support his views on samesex marriageOne supporter Bishop Collie N Edwers the pastor of Friendship Worship Center in Mount Vernon praised Mr Astorinos efforts and complained that the governor by contrast seemed missing in actionBut it was among smallbusiness owners  the shopkeepers and restaurateurs in places like Mount Vernon and New Rochelle  that Mr Astorino seemed to find his sturdiest supportOn Main Street in New Rochelle John Contreras 49 the owner of the Mexican Corner restaurant said Mr Astorino ate there a year ago and talked with him about the challenges

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/us/for-supreme-court-first-amendment-sometimes-has-a-limit-its-doorstep.html,WASHINGTON   The First Amendment is strong medicine the Supreme Court keeps telling us and it even requires vulnerable people to listen to things they do not want to hearChief Justice John G Roberts Jr explained this in 2011 to the father of a fallen soldier who had to endure a hateful protest while he tried to lay his son to rest The First Amendment the chief justice said protects even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debateIn June Chief Justice Roberts told women seeking abortions essentially the same thing in a decision striking down buffer zones around clinics in Massachusetts Vital First Amendment interests he said required women to hear from opponents of abortion in the fraught moments before they entered those clinicsBut the Supreme Courts devotion to the First Amendment has its limits It stops at the edge of the grand marble plaza outside its own courthouseThat vast and inviting space with its benches and fountains seems better suited to public debate than a military funeral or the sidewalk outside an abortion clinic But the court insists on banning free speech on the plaza Court police officers have been known to instruct visitors to remove small buttons bearing political messagesLast year a federal judge struck down the law that bans protests on the plaza calling it irreconcilable with the First Amendment Pamela Talkin the marshal of the Supreme Court appealed the decision and last month a threejudge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard argumentsThe case involves Harold H Hodge Jr a student from Maryland who was arrested on the plaza in 2011 His crime was wearing a sign that read US Gov Allows Police to Illegally Murder and Brutalize African Americans and Hispanic PeopleSuch a statement on a topic of urgent public interest would seem to be precisely what the First Amendment was intended to protect Then again a Supreme Court police officer once threatened a woman with arrest for displaying a sign bearing the verbatim text of the First AmendmentThe law invoked by the officers enacted in 1949 bars processions or assemblages or the display of a flag banner or device designed or adapted to bring into public notice a party organization or movement in the Supreme Court building or on its groundsThe Supreme Court addressed the law in 1983 in United States v Grace ruling that it could not be applied to demonstrations on the public sidewalks around the court Since then the sidewalks which are broad and set off by stairs from the plaza have been regularly used for protests of all kindsBut the First Amendment vanishes when concrete turns to marble Justice Department lawyers representing Ms Talkin told the appeals court Their primary argument for the distinction was a curious oneDemonstrations outside courthouses might give rise to actual or apparent efforts to subject judicial officers to improper influence they said in a briefThe idea that the justices would actually be swayed by protest signs on the plaza borders on the silly If they were susceptible to that sort of influence there would be no reason to think that signs on the sidewalk would be less effectiveThat leaves the question of public perception In the 1983 decision the court said the law might be justified by a desire to prevent the public from thinking that the Supreme Court is subject to outside influenceThe fear here is not that the justices would in fact respond to protests but that people would mistakenly think they did That is not a flattering view of the populaceIt is also at odds with one of the core messages of the Citizens United decision which assumed that people in a democracy would respond with skeptical discernment to the political messages that bombard them before electionsWe honor the First Amendment Justice Anthony M Kennedy wrote for the majority by allowing everyone to speak and entrusting the people to judge what is true and what is falseThe Supreme Court is not even particularly consistent in how it treats speech on its plazaIn a sworn statement in 2012 Timothy Dolan deputy chief of the Supreme Courts police force conceded that the court allows attorneys and parties in cases that have been argued to address the media on the plaza immediately following argument The court also occasionally permits commercial or professional filming on the plaza he saidIt seems that people with power or connections can use the plaza Mr Hodge who sought to call attention to police brutality cannotJustice Thurgood Marshall who knew something about the power of protests dissented in the 1983 case Visitors to this court he wrote do not lose their First Amendment rights at the edge of the sidewalksHe died in 1993 long before the court fully established the double standard requiring grieving parents and distraught women to experience the gale force of the First Amendment while shielding the justices from its slightest breeze But Justice Marshall seemed to sense where things were headingIt would be ironic indeed he said if an exception to the Constitution were to be recognized for the very institution that has the chief responsibility for protecting constitutional rights,20141014,abortion

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/13/us/politics/gop-right-still-has-doubt-about-christie-.html,At a confidential meeting over the summer Gov Chris Christie of New Jersey boasted to influential evangelical leaders that he was the states first prolife governor since Roe vs Wade reminded them that he had vetoed legislation allowing gays to wed and in a knowing reference to the Gospel of Matthew spoke of his moral obligation to help the least of usBut even as Mr Christie sought to persuade them of his conservative credentials his own deepseated discomfort with ideological purity kept creeping in He suggested that if the Republican Party wanted to win back the White House it needed to look to a candidate with broad appeal like himself or Jeb Bush said one attendee Leith Anderson president of the National Association of Evangelicals If it instead demanded orthodoxy Mr Christies message was they can pick somebody else and lose Mr Anderson recalledWith the contretemps over lane closings on the George Washington Bridge on the back burner for now and Mr Christie laying groundwork for a Republican presidential run the persistent skepticism unease and in some cases distrust that he faces from social and religious conservatives may be the biggest and least understood obstacle in his pathYet Mr Christie who prides himself on his defiance of political convention refuses to communicate the kind of emphatic crowdpleasing message that would leave him unassailable with that crucial constituency and he has shown little enthusiasm for befriending its selfappointed leadership elements of which are turning on him with speed and vigorIn a sustained and highprofile attack more than two years before the election advocates of conservative judicial philosophy have begun to pummel Mr Christie as failing to nominate sufficiently rightleaning judges to New Jerseys highest court They are also bankrolling derisive billboards in states where he is campaigning for Republicans this fall and flying a banner over the Jersey Shore declaring Christie cant be trustedThe assault an early taste of what conservative skeptics say Mr Christie would encounter in 2016 reflects what may be an even broader problem for him and his party Despite the supposed reckoning by Republicans with the lessons of the last presidential election when infighting tarnished the partys brand and its nominee there is still a segment determined to disqualify candidates it deems inadequately conservative long before the candidates have even announced their campaignsWhen Christian conservatives flocked to Washington a few weeks ago for the annual Values Voters Summit they were regaled by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania all 2016 hopefuls But not Mr Christie Organizers did not invite himHes not one that this community is clamoring for said Tony Perkins president of the Family Research Council a conservative public policy group that sponsored the meeting Christie does not connect with themAl Cardenas the chairman of the American Conservative Union when it locked Mr Christie out of its annual convention last year partly as punishment for praising President Obamas response to Hurricane Sandy on the eve of his reelection said conservatives used to give passes to Republicans who were elected in areas like the NortheastNow he said passes are no longer issued with as much frequencyThe resistance is a test of how deeply the unconventional approaches to conservatism adopted by party leaders like Mr Christie Mr Bush and Representative Paul D Ryan of Wisconsin can endear them to a voting bloc that is still animated by a handful of decadesold social issues like abortion and traditional marriage All three emphasize redemption through education drug treatment and alternatives to prisonDuring his meeting with evangelical leaders held at the governors mansion in July Mr Christie spoke again and again about the poor He said he would talk about issues of the poor in a positive away and not make the poor the scapegoat of every ill in the country said the Rev Raymond Rivera president of the Latino Pastoral Action Center He was trying to say I am a Republican more in the spirit of moderation Russell D Moore a leader of the Southern Baptist Convention who attended the meeting said religious conservatives could be drawn to that message but only if they first trusted Mr Christie to deliver on their biggest prioritiesThe idea that those issues have been transcended by caring for kids in failing schools and prison reform  thats a misreading he saidAides to Mr Christie who fueled his political ascent through YouTubepackaged bursts of combativeness and candor are prepared to bypass what they see as spitballing from conservative leaders who have ignored his victories in a state dominated by Democrats A case in point his vetoing of state funds for Planned Parenthood year after year And they recognize that a measure of conservative displeasure can work to their advantage It reinforces Mr Christies reputation for telling voters what they may not want to hearAsked about the depth of his conservatism this spring Mr Christie replied I just act like myself and people take it or leave it and Im completely content with thatIn nearly two dozen interviews with prominent social conservatives rightwing Christian leaders and the heads of family values groups a stark consensus emerged Although they are drawn to Mr Christies bumptious style and believe that his opposition to abortion their chief priority is deepseated they feel he has crossed them on pivotal issues and at key momentsThey were dismayed when over their pointed objections he became the first Republican governor to sign a law barring licensed therapists from trying to reduce or eliminate samesex attraction in children a move they see as a liberaldriven encroachment on freedom of speech and parental rights They were troubled by his early embrace of Common Core education standards a totem of big government overreach to many conservatives And they were frustrated by his refusal to appeal the New Jersey Supreme Court ruling legalizing samesex marriage last yearA tremendous mistake said Brian S Brown president of the National Organization for MarriageThey reserve their deepest disapproval however for his judicial appointments an issue that has taken on greater urgency now that the role of courts has rapidly expanded in determining issues as broad as state education funding to samesex marriageMr Christies first appointment to the State Supreme Court was Anne M Patterson a Republican who he promised would never use legal precedent to set social and tax policies Two years later she broke with Mr Christie and voted to allow samesex marriage in New Jersey This year in a deal with Democratic lawmakers Mr Christie agreed to renominate Chief Justice Stuart Rabner a Democrat with a liberal judicial recordHe has appointed some really terrible judges to the State Supreme Court said Maggie Gallagher a prominent social conservative writer and senior fellow at American Principles Project a rightleaning think tankOfficials at the Judicial Crisis Network which has sponsored the billboards and banners assailing Mr Christie argue that he could no longer be trusted to nominate conservativeminded judges to the United States Supreme CourtHed be the same kind of disaster as president that he was as governor said Carrie Severino the groups chief counsel and a former clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas of the Supreme CourtMr Christie who insists he has moved the court to the right has called his judicial appointments the product of compromise adding tartly Organizations like the Judicial Crisis Network who run out of Washington DC have absolutely no concept of what the word compromise meansUnprompted and perhaps unfairly several conservative leaders likened Mr Christie to Rudolph W Giuliani the former mayor of New York whose cultural and political disconnect from the religious right contributed to the collapse of his bid for president in 2008 Their notsosubtle message He is not one of usFor now Mr Christie appears unmoved by that sentiment passing up even painless opportunities to appeal to social conservativesAfter the Supreme Court ruled on June 30 that it violated a federal law protecting religious freedom to compel familyowned corporations to pay for contraception under the Affordable Care Act a decision widely celebrated by religious conservatives Mr Christies likely rivals in 2016 rushed out detailed statements of support Mr Christie was silent and the next day seemed unfamiliar or uninterested in the caseWho knows Is the Supreme Court right he

is the premier source of suspense for Nov 4 And Mr Cuomos involvement in competitive Senate races  or lack of involvement  is the largest wild card as the election approachesThe Senate is controlled by Republicans and a group of breakaway Democrats More than four months ago Mr Cuomo promised to push for Democrats to control the chamber as part of a deal to win the endorsement of the Working Families Party but since then the governor has not been particularly vocal on the subject especially compared with Mayor Bill de BlasioSome liberals suspect Mr Cuomo does not truly want a Democratic Senate preferring to use Republicans as a bulwark against leftleaning legislation As the election nears another pragmatic motivation could come into play Mr Cuomo tends to avoid plunging into battles he does not anticipate winning and polls have shown Republican candidates leading in several critical Senate races On Saturday aboard his Womens Equality Express campaign bus on the way here from another rally in Manhattan Mr Cuomo insisted he was committed to electing a Democratic Senate pointing to efforts by the state Democratic Party which he controls to coordinate direct mail advertising phone calls and other getoutthevote efforts His campaign said about 1 million had already been spent to help Senate candidatesThe Republicans have made it clear that they will do nothing in terms of social progress Mr Cuomo said explaining why he no longer saw Republican control as tenable He singled out their opposition to two agenda items  writing abortion protections into state law and providing public financing for political campaignsBy way of contrast he pointed to their willingness to allow the passage of samesex marriage in 2011 and strict gun laws in 2013 those measures angered the states Conservative Party and he said the Republicans fearing challenges from their right were no longer willing to allow votes on any legislation that would upset conservativesIf you could have a Republican Senate that was as professional and functional and voted for marriage equality and gun control that is one Senate Mr Cuomo said Thats not this current SenateRepublicans are less sure their time partnering with Mr Cuomo has ended Their campaigns have largely avoided criticizing him preferring to focus their warnings to voters on how they believe Mr de Blasio and the Working Families Party would use a Democraticcontrolled Senate to drive Albany to the leftIf there was a quiet moment and you had a glass of wine with Governor Cuomo and he opened up Ill bet 10 to 1 hed really be much more comfortable being able to stay in the middle on some of these issues with a Republican or a coalition government State Senator John A DeFrancisco a Republican from Syracuse said in a public radio interviewAfter the rally here  in which he advocated his proposal for a package of womens rights legislation including the abortion proposal  Mr Cuomo was asked why he talked so little about Ms Esposito He said that raising awareness of the womens rights legislation and the Republican opposition to abortion rights would motivate voters to elect Democrats like Ms EspositoI believe the strongest argument for her is shes a supporter of the womens equality agenda the governor saidMs Esposito the executive director of an environmental advocacy group said she was honored to have received the governors endorsement She faces Tom Croci the Islip town supervisor and a Republican they are vying for the seat now held by Senator Lee M Zeldin a Republican who is running for CongressA spokeswoman for Mr Croci Christine Geed responded to the Mr Cuomos endorsement of Ms Esposito by offering an argument favored by many Republicans Having both parties share power in Albany she maintained is a good thing for votersThe governor and the Republican majority have worked very well together in the past Ms Geed said We know that its a relationship that would certainly work in the future,20141013,abortion

NYT,http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/the-good-wife-recap-lies-and-more-lies-plus-alicias-big-decision/,Season 6 Episode 4 Oppo ResearchIt took a month in television time but Alicia Florrick finally decided to run for states attorney in Sunday nights episode of The Good Wife titled Oppo Research It was still a quicker decision than its likely reallife analogue Hillary Rodham Clintons longawaited choice regarding a presidential campaign Of course she kept everyone including us on a string until nearly the end of the episode And the person to whom she finally said Im running wasnt Eli Gold or her husband the governor or one of her law partners or her onetime best friend Kalinda It was her truest confidante her son Zach and she told him only because she was furious with himThe ironies were thick on the ground in Oppo Research an episode devoted largely to the art of lying The title referred to the opposition research that Eli commissioned in anticipation of Alicias decision preemptively identifying both her and her opponents dirtiest laundry Alicia was angry at Zach because she had found out  through Eli and the campaign manager he had picked for her Johnny Elfman Steven Pasquale of Do No Harm and Rescue Me  that Zach had gotten his girlfriend Nisa Dalmar pregnant the year before and Nisa Rachel Hilson had an abortion Throughout the episode Alicia flashed on memories of Zachs smiling face as he lied to her telling her he was taking a trip to Boston College when he was actually at the hospital with Nisa and particularly galling her parentsAlicia got a lot of bad news in the course of her session with Eli and Johnny Her brother Owen Dallas Roberts was dating a married man who had unprotected sex in porn films Her mother Veronica Stockard Channing was caught on tape spanking someone elses 5yearold in a department store But it was Zachs deception that inspired nuclear rage Were cutting him off without a cent you know that she said to her husband Peter He can buy his own friggin way through college Or get Nisas parents to do it It was startling but you could follow the dots Shed already been betrayed by the most important man in her life Peter Shed transferred a lot of her trust to Zach and here she was again Of course as soon as she was done excoriating her son for lying Alicia ordered him to lie Im running for states attorney she said  finally  which meant that if he was asked about the abortion he was to say that he had discussed it with her and shed advised him against it Upset and confused just as he was at the time of the abortion Zach asked why she was running to which she snorted said Have fun in college and hung up Which did not seem to me to be the way Alicia Florrick would treat her son Maybe it was the red wine Did you buy her reaction over all Comment pleaseYou could make a flowchart of the lies that were told and exposed in the episode but Im not a graphic artist so Ill just mention a few Elis lying to both Alicia and Johnny about the terms of their meeting Zachs duplicity Peters telling Alicia that he didnt know about the abortion though it appeared when he talked to Eli that he did Alicias continuing to deny any relationship with either Will Gardner or Finn Polmar though that can be justified on the grounds of privacy And unless Ive missed it the show hasnt absolutely affirmed that Alicia and Finn had sex though their flirty conversation in Sundays episode was about 99 percent confirmation Alicias lying to the drug lord Lemond Bishop about why she could no longer represent him Elis denying that it was Alicia who told him about Kalindas sleeping with Peter Veronicas fake apology to the 5yearolds mother Peters masterful manipulation of the intern Lauren as a way of getting closer to her sexy mom Connie Nielsen Bishops secretly setting up a political action committee for Alicias campaign not a lie but in the same ballparkIt was the rare Good Wife episode that had no courtroom action and virtually no lawfirm presence except for a few moments of Alicia Diane and Cary discussing a subpoena issued to Bishop Within the show the subpoena was explained as a ploy to harass Cary in the states attorneys prosecution of him Has any seemingly important story line in a primetime drama ever felt less urgent In dramatic terms the subpoena was a way to create some contention between Bishop and Alicia and  in the closing scene when he revealed that he was behind the PAC and had thoroughly outplayed her  to plant the idea that he sees her campaign as an opportunity and wants her under his thumb Other conflicts were set up Owen stormed out of the apartment when Alicia warned him about his boyfriends risky behavior Ramona Lyttons throaty laugh from behind Peters closed office door seemed to promise headaches for Eli and Alicia Zach is angry Kalinda is worried about her onenight stand with Peter becoming public knowledge There also seemed to be a conscious focus on Alicias redwine consumption  the episode began with her opening a bottle of Margaux which she poured and drank throughout the strategy meeting and later she had a glass with Finn that led to her being pulled over for a DUI check That was likely a bit of entrapment engineered by her opponent States Attorney Castro Could they possibly be setting up Alicia for a drinking problem under the pressure of the campaign I hope not  it would be a really bad really boring ideaBut the definite question is what her campaign however it plays out will mean for the show Its hard for me to imagine her actually winning I dont want to see her as a prosecutor and I dont want to watch her going up against Diane and Cary every week as superficially entertaining as it might sound Are you looking forward to what will presumably be weeks of political intrigue and character assassination with correspondingly less focus on the courtroom Not only was there no case this week there was also hardly any Diane Cary or Kalinda and there was no Robyn David Lee or Dean the sadly neglected new lawyer Taye Diggs is back in the credits for next weeks episodeA few other observations on Oppo ResearchThe idea of having Graces Christian choir practicing in her room during the meeting was cute the first time a hymn interrupted the bareknuckles political talk not so cute the second and third timesIt was clearly supposed to be a meaningful moment when Alicia told Johnny I like clarity I like rules that tell me whats right and wrong But does she She does when it applies to Zach and Grace not so much when it applies to herself or Lemond Bishop You can argue thats the point its authentic it makes her character more complex and believable But Id enjoy the show more if she got back to applying the rules a little more consistentlyThe guestcast star power was down from last week when Linda Lavin and Robert Sean Leonard appeared But it was nice to see Joe Weisberg creator of one of the best shows on television The Americans appear as himself on the showwithinashow that played in the background on Alicias TV  I havent been able to figure out the greater significance of Darkness at Noon the fake detective drama Alicias been watching all season beyond being a goof on pretentious cable dramas like True DetectiveTwo more questions to add to the long list of puzzling things involving Lemond Bishop Would Alicia really have agreed so readily to drop one of her firms top clients even if it did make life easier for everyone Maybe we were supposed to assume that she was happy to have her campaign as an excuse Which leads to the second question Can a client really refuse to be dropped by his lawyer as Bishop essentially did Lets hear from the lawyers in the audience,20141012,abortion

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-why-america-is-moving-slowly-on-assisted-suicide.html,ON Nov 1 barring the medically unexpected or a change of heart a young woman named Brittany Maynard will ingest a lethal prescription and die by suicideMaynard is 29 recently married and is suffering from terminal brain cancer After deciding against hospice care  fearing she wrote in a CNN oped a combination of pain personality changes and the loss of basic mental and physical functions  she and her husband moved from California to Oregon one of five states that permit physicianassisted suicide In the time remaining to her she has become a public advocate for that practices expansion recording testimonials on behalf of the right of the terminally ill to make their quietusThe tragedy here is almost deep enough to drown the political debate But that debates continued existence is still a striking fact Why in a society where individualism seems to be carrying the day is the right that Maynard intends to exercise still confined to just a handful of states Why has assisted suicides advance been slow when on other social issues the landscape has shifted dramatically in a libertarian directionTwenty years ago a much more rapid advance seemed likely Some sort of right to suicide seemed like a potential extension of the right to define ones own concept of existence that the Supreme Court had invoked while upholding a womans constitutional right to abortion Polls in the 1990s consistently showed more support  majority support depending on the framing  for physicianassisted suicide than for what then seemed like the eccentric cause of samesex marriageYet the latter cause has triumphed sweepingly while voluntary euthanasia has advanced only haltingly Part of the explanation lies with the Supreme Court which in 1997 ruled 9 to 0 that the Constitution does not include a right to suicide But the court would not have ruled as it did absent a deeper reality Many liberals seem considerably more uncomfortable with the idea of physicianassisted suicide than with other causes from abortion to homosexuality where claims about personal autonomy and liberty are at stakeConservatives oppose assisted suicide more fiercely but its a persistent leftofcenter discomfort even among the most secular liberals thats really held the idea at bay Indeed on this issue you can find many liberal writers who sound like well social conservatives  who warn of the danger of a livesnotworthliving mentality acknowledge the ease with which ethical and legal slopes can slip recognize the limits of consent alone as a standard for moral judgmentAt the same time though there are tensions within the liberal mind on this issue particularly when the discussion moves from the general why assisted suicide is unwise as public policy to the particular why life is still worth living after all hope is lost and why a given person facing death shouldnt avail themselves of suicideYou can see that tension illustrated in a fascinating way in the work of Ezekiel Emanuel the health care expert and bioethicist and brother of Chicagos mayor Emanuels 1997 Atlantic essay on physicianassisted suicide remains the best liberal critique of the idea and he reiterated his antisuicide position this fall again in the Atlantic in an essay discussing his perspective on aging medicine and deathBut the new essay  which ran under the headline Why I Hope to Die at 75  was also shot through with precisely the fear of diminishment and incapacity the anxiety at being any kind of burden the desire to somehow exit at ones sharpest and fittest and best that drives the impulse toward medicalized suicide It was partially a powerful case against unnecessary medical treatment  but partially a window into a worldview ill equipped to make sense of suffering thats bound to lead to death or that does not have a mountainclimbing opedwriting recovery at the end of itThe same deficit is apparent in responses to Brittany Maynards plight Liberal policy writers are comfortable using her case to discuss the inadequacies of endoflife care as the health care expert Harold Pollack did eloquently in a piece for The New Republic But when it comes time to make an affirmative case for what she actually has to live for they often demur To find that case you often have to turn to explicitly religious writers  like Kara Tippetts a mother of four currently dying of her own cancer who wrote Maynard a passionate open letter urging her to embrace the possibility that their shared trial could actually have a purpose that beauty will meet us in that last breathThe future of the assisted suicide debate may depend in part on whether Tippettss case for the worth of what can seem like pointless suffering can be made either without her theological perspective or by a liberalism more open to metaphysical arguments than the left is todayIf it can then laws like Oregons will remain unusual and the politics of assisted suicide the exception to the evermorelibertarian trendIf it cant then many more tragic stories will have the ending Brittany Maynard has chosen to embrace,20141012,abortion
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/books/review/caitlin-morans-how-to-build-a-girl.html,The thing I want to be hasnt been invented laments 14yearold Johanna Morrigan the narrator of Caitlin Morans new novel How to Build a Girl She does know a few of the details Her future self lives in London is super hot and has an Oscar Wildelike ability to light up a room with her wit and charm She has tacked magazine photos of her celebrity crushes and quotations from her literary idols to her walls but they seem only to remind her of how far she has to go Shes a chubby teenager whose large family lives on government assistance in a workingclass city in middle England Her most fulfilling sexual relationship has been with the handle of her hairbrush She isnt even sure where to beginIt would be too easy to label How to Build a Girl a comingofage novel While Moran does chronicle the emotional firsts and dramatic assertions of independence most of us associate with our teenage years she also understands that especially if you are a girl of limited financial and cultural means you dont come of age gliding toward a true adult version of yourself Identity isnt something you age into You have to construct your adult self with the resources at your disposal pausing occasionally to assess your progress and sometimes tearing it down to start againThe broad contours of Johannas story and more than a few of the specifics will be familiar to anyone who read Morans 2012 memoirmanifesto How to Be a Woman Both young Caitlin Moran and her fictional protagonist grow up in the 1980s and early 90s in Wolverhampton with large families in small houses with no mirrors to speak of Both have borderlinealcoholic fathers who are former rock n rollers Both sleep in a bed they inherited after their grandmother died in it Both are regulars at the local library and display that telltale sign of a life lived primarily through books Their vocabulary far exceeds their pronunciation skills Both become the only teenage staff writer for a popular music magazine in London which becomes the proving ground for their burgeoning womanhoodJohanna concocts an outlandish persona for herself named Dolly Wilde after Oscars outrageous lesbian niece Moran who was born Catherine not Caitlin rechristened herself as a young teenager too Under her pseudonym Johanna writes music reviews that get her noticed by the editors of Disc  Music Echo On her first visit to the magazines offices she looks the part of Dolly Wilde in heavy eyeliner and 18thcentury hairdo but draws awkward looks from the allmale staff when she quotes Annie rather than Morrissey She takes notes on how to adapt Everyone drinks Everyone smokes    You fake it till you make it You discuss sex like its a game You have adventures You dont quote musicals On her next visit shes in full Dolly Wilde mode smoking and making crass jokes and swigging from a bottle of Mad Dog 2020After she drops out of school and starts spending more and more time in London she increasingly blurs the line between Johanna and Dolly Johanna wears Dollys Lady Sex Adventurer attitude like a protective cape Dolly climbs over bars and makes out with musicians and snorts speed in bathrooms and regales her musicwriter colleagues with tales of the genitalia shes seen On the train home to Wolverhampton she turns back into Johanna a girl who collects snails in the backyard with her little brother and dances to Annie Lennox in the dark You actually dont exist while youre in your bedroom she says aloud to the family dog Teenage girls in bedrooms arent realHow to Build a Girl seems at times like a fictional memoir rather than a realtime account of adolescence Johannas ruminations on the process of becoming the person she thinks she wants to be have the knowing sheen of adulthood She is also aware as few of us are at the time that these years are a series of experiments in testing the limits of what society values about women Teenagers know that its not good to be seen as too younggirly at work but the natural response to mimic the behavior of aggressive older men is exhausting  and usually comes with a backlash Teenage girls also grasp implicitly that women are desirable when theyre sexual but pay a social price if they experiment with sex or are too open about what they want Dolly Wilde racks up an impressive list of sexual conquests going from first kiss to first kinky sex in record timeMoran is careful never to punish Johanna for her exploits though She revels in each new sexual milestone without ever facing serious consequences in the form of assault or abortion She leaves most experiences feeling both satisfied and unfulfilled which is the essence of sexual experimentation for teenage girls and all too many adult women Johanna  or more accurately Dolly  is still navigating her desires with a map drawn by men She knows her partners are deriving more pleasure than she is but it will be years before she knows how to change thisIn How to Be a Woman Moran openly discussed the sorts of things women are usually discouraged from saying aloud the joy of masturbating the slippery nature of office sexism the searing pain of a bikini wax But it was more manifesto than memoir peppered with phrases that shout at readers in all capital letters rather than slowly unspooling a story The pace of How to Build a Girl is easier and kinder though no less feminist Morans novel shows what her manifesto tells Rallying cries will always have a place in a yetunfinished movement like feminism but sometimes storytelling is more effective The fictional Johanna Morrigan never drops the Fword but readers can see shes asking all the right questions Moran leaves no doubt about where her young heroine is headedAlthough Im a few years younger than Moran I also found How to Build a Girl deliciously nostalgic As part of the last predigital generation of girls to use their bedroom walls as a mood board for their personas I related to the descriptions of Johanna BluTacking pictures and ordering CDs from the library and being the only girl in Wolverhamptons record store details that now feel downright quaint Johanna would envy modern girls who have Tumblr where their inspiration is not limited by wall space and Spotify where they can listen to anything and no one can make them feel they dont belongBut theres no question These teenagers will still get Johanna Because the 90s are now retrocool they wear the same Doc Martens and scream along with the same Courtney Love songs as they try to figure out who they want to be in the future  and express how dissatisfied they are in the present Though some of the methods have changed the cultural work of identitybuilding is the

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/books/review/katha-pollitt-pro-reclaiming-abortion-rights-review.html,I never had an abortion but my mother did She didnt tell me about it but from what I pieced together after her death from a line in her FBI file which my father the old radical had requested along with his own it was in 1960 so like almost all abortions back then it was illegalThus begins Pro the abortion rights manifesto by the Nation columnist poet and red diaper baby Katha Pollitt While parents with FBI files may be exotic her departure point is that abortion was and is not Like six out of 10 women who get abortions today Pollitts mom was already a mother when she chose to abort Why didnt she carry this pregnancy to term How far along was she Why didnt she tell her husband Was her practitioner good Did a friend go with her Pollitt doesnt knowLike her we are left to project And when it comes to abortion we project a lot Having internalized the messages of both abortions defenders and opponents we imagine the women seeking one as some combination of young scared alone poor and victimized Those women obviously do exist though given that nearly one in three women will have had at least one abortion by the age of 45 the stereotype doesnt always square with reality Abortion is safe it is  still  legal but at more than a million procedures a year it isnt all that rare As Pro lays out in enraging detail this is partly due to the religious rights efforts to restrict access to contraception recently by branding certain methods as abortifacients contra science but now with the imprimatur of the Supreme Court Yet abortion was never that rare and  absent universal child care Scandinavian levels of parental leave and support comprehensive sex education and free access to birth control  it wontbe Half of all pregnancies are accidental and some of those are going to be unwelcome unsupportable or unviable as well as unplannedAbortion therefore needs to come out of the closet and be claimed as a positive social good Pollitt argues It is an essential option for women  not just ones in dramatic terrible bodyandsouldestroying situations but all women  and thus benefits society as a wholePollitt says shes aimed her argument at the muddled middle those who dont want to ban abortion outright but dont want it widely available either those who boggle pollsters with their deeply conflicted opinions about the circumstances under which an abortion  after enough guilt is heaped on enough hoops jumped through  should be tolerated The Bible Pollitt notes does not ban abortion nor did the founding fathers Indeed until after the Civil War most of the Roman Catholic clergy advised that the unborn were only ensouled in todays parlance had achieved personhood at quickening and abortifacients with names like Uterine Regulator and Samaritans Gift for Females were widely and often legally available It wasnt until 1869 that the Catholic Church took the position that life begins at conception Abortion opponents have since combined that edict with medical advances like ultrasounds and the publics squishy belief in DNA determinism to elide the difference between a fivedayold blastocyst an eightweekold embryo and a fivemonthold fetusThe policy results are confounding Between 2011 and 2013 205 new restrictions were enacted more than in the previous 10 years combined Parental notification forced sonograms mandatory waiting periods and a dearth of clinics can all push the procedure past the first trimester  which is when most Americans support the right to an abortion and when nearly 90 percent of them are performed Even so 58 percent of women who have had an abortion wish theyd had it sooner The main impediment is not handwringing but accessIf we hewed to the notion that an embryo achieves personhood when sperm meets egg Pollitt argues wed have to investigate all miscarriages as potential homicides perhaps punishable by death as one Georgia bill proposed And why dont more diehard abortion opponents fret over embryos discarded during the course of IVF The reason is that destroying an embryo in pursuit of a baby is part of a noble struggle whereas destroying an embryo to finish high school or law school or even to put enough food on the table for other kids is considered selfish at best The difference between a petri dish and a womb isnt in the embryos Pollitt writes its in the womans perceived intention Indeed Pollitt argues that many abortion opponents are less concerned with the plight of any one embryo  and the fate of that embryo if carried to term  than they are with curtailing womens sexual and economic freedomThis isnt exactly a novel concept to students of feminist theory But Pollitts exploration of the hypocrisy of abortion opponents  including the inverse relationship between support for abortion restrictions and support for programs that help lowincome pregnant women babies and children  is so witheringly encyclopedic it will be an eye opener for those who have never darkened the door of a womens studies classroom Then again theres a great deal of cognitive science indicating that the more evidence you bring to an argument the more entrenched your opponents will become So Pro may succeed best at galvanizing complacent prochoicers who are newly alarmed at transvaginal ultrasounds legitimate rape and the slutshaming of contraception proponents Pollitt might benefit from timing in much the same way that Susan Faludi did 23 years ago Faludis Backlash The Undeclared War Against American Women which arrived on the heels of the Anita Hill hearings became so thoroughly absorbed by the culture that two years later Nora Ephron could toss a line into Sleepless in Seattle about the its easier for a woman over 40 to be killed by a terrorist than marry canard and a romcom audience could be relied on to nod indignantly with the rebuttal Theres practically a whole book about how that statistic is not trueIn the intervening decades Pollitt says the prochoice community has become too apologetic and defensive Forget talk of compromise Roe which balanced the rights of the mother with the rights of a fetus nearing viability was the compromise Demand sexual and economic freedom and the notion that motherhood should be entered into with the same forethought the same liberty that we value in all other pursuits And enough of the shame wear your scarlet A with pride You dont even have to have had the abortion yourself Maybe you helped scrape the money together Or sat in the waiting room Maybe you got somebody pregnant and are you sure you haventSo Ive never had an abortion But when I was a teenager I helped some friends get theirs We were fortunate rounding up the money wasnt that hard we had cars had our parents found out the consequences wouldnt have been dire As the years passed the reasons for my friends abortions shifted from teenage haplessness to failed IUDs to dire fetal anomalies to chemotherapy to yes rape Not to mention This is not the right time for my family Or This is not the right time for meIn two generations contraception and abortion have allowed women to widen their worlds dramatically If youre a woman I dont need to detail all the barriers we still face If youre a mother I dont need to tell you all the ways in which the workplace is set up as if you didnt have kids and schools camps and childhood extracurriculars as if you didnt have a job There are still those who would reduce women to potting soil or in the immortal words of Todd Akin a source of food and climate control who enter into a contract to raise a child every time we have sex Motherhood is hard enough if you go into it willingly And Pollitt is correct to insist that the right to an abortion is merely societys down payment on all the rights we are yet due,20141012,abortion

discovering Hemingway when I was in college I had been assigned some of the Nick Adams stories for the Princeton syllabus and I must admit I didnt understand the wow factor at first It wasnt until I read the short story Hills Like White Elephants that I was appropriately blown away Heres a piece about abortion that never actually mentions the phrase and in fact the omission and its reason for never being uttered is the most critical element in the story Its one thing to craft a reputation as a novelist for the words one uses  its a whole new playing level to be revered for what you dont say but manage to convey anyway My favorite contemporary novelist is Alice Hoffman Her work lies in the dreamy world where love collides with magical realism reminding me of Gabriel Garca Mrquez With every book she has startling beautiful turns of phrase that take my breath awayWhats your favorite movie based on a bookAs someone whos written a book that was badly translated to film I am very sensitive to this topic and always on the lookout for movies that are faithful adaptations of stories Ive loved I still dont really understand why Hollywood continues to fix things that are not broken My gold standard for booktofilm translation is Out of Africa In that memoir Isak Dinesen  whose Gothic fairy tales are lush and elaborately written  dramatically alters her style to describe her life The more personal the story she tells the more she strips down the language  and the barest bones are used to tell of her relationship with Denys Finch Hatton We now know from other memoirs and original source material that the writers relationship with Finch Hatton was one of the seminal moments of her life its almost as if her deliberate parity of description was meant to keep the private private to suggest that ordinary words simply could not convey the depth and parameters of this relationship thus the writer was not even going to make the attempt to do so The filmmakers took all the ellipses in Dinesens memoir and filled them in visually revealing Dinesens complex relationship with Finch Hatton through images the way she could not in proseAnd which book do you think should be made into a movieIve recently finished Deborah Harknesss Book of Life The whole series is like Harry Potter for adults  its very visually rich and I would love to see a filmmaker do it justice Imagine

come home with a stack of books and all I wanted was to be like her I started reading at age 3 and I was so excited when for my birthday I got a reading lamp that sat next to my bed so that I could read before I went to sleep at night I was a voracious reader and I remember several childrens books that were special Where the Wild Things Are Umbrella Little Blue and Little Yellow As I got older I started inhaling the AllofaKind Family chapter books and the Little House on the Prairie series I remember wanting to be as kind and calm and beautiful as Mary but realizing deep down that I was probably a lot more like Laura headstrong messy and too smart for my own goodIf you had to name one book that made you who you are today what would it beWhen I was 13 I read Gone With the Wind I memorized entire passages and could act out scenes between Rhett and Scarlett playing both roles  which also explains why I didnt have a boyfriend until I was 15 It was the first book that made me realize an author could create an entire world out of words and it was the first time I thought Maybe I could do that Ive revisited the book numerous times and Im always intrigued by how manipulative and shrewd and needy Scarlett is  but how shes also impossibly strongAnd of the books youve written which is your favorite and whyMy favorite is Second Glance Its about the things that come back to haunt us ghosts and history It illuminates a period in the 1920s30s that very few people know about when various states were in the business of racial hygiene getting rid of people who were considered an economic and social drain on the communityThe other reason I love Second Glance is because the research was the most remarkable Ive ever done  I went ghost hunting with the Atlantic Paranormal Society TAPS They explained to me that dying is like getting on a bus Youre supposed to go to the end of the line and get off But sometimes the bus stops at a rest stop and you get off to use the restroom  and when you come back the bus is gone Thats a ghost They then took me to a home in Massachusetts whose owners had contacted them after hearing moans and groans in the attic I was given the key to the padlocked attic door and the ghost hunters set up a video camera on a tripod to record paranormal energy I was the last one out of the attic I closed and locked the door The couple had two kids ages 6 months and 22 months asleep in their separate rooms Downstairs the homeowners described coming home to find all the faucets running all the cereal spilled into a pile on the kitchen floor One night at 2 am they heard calliope music and found a childs toy piano playing  without batteries  on the steps of the attic I went to check on the kids and on the floor outlining the edge of each crib I found six pennies per room that had not been present 10 minutes earlier all dated between 1968 and 1973 I unlocked the attic door went to the video camera tripod and found another 15 pennies underneath all dated between 1968 and 1973 that had not been there when I left Was I scared No Did it make sense No and Id seen it with my own eyes Also pennies with those dates were scarce Eventually the ghost hunters went back and determined that there was something paranormal in the house and did research  two people died there One in 1968 and one in 1973 Ive done a ton of research for my writing but that remains the coolestIf you could require the president to read one book what would it be I would be honored if the president read Nineteen Minutes the book I wrote about a school shooting OK In truth I wouldnt just be honored Id probably faint It addresses what happens when bullying is ignored by schools and what it means to be a kid who feels marginalized and why the media is fostering future school shootings by focusing their 247 coverage not on the victims but on the shooter This is obviously done for ratings but may in fact be what makes another kid on the fringe think Hmm No one notices me but maybe this is how to get my 15 minutes of fame Most importantly the book illustrates the staggering emotional cost of a school shooting  something that is routinely left out of proSecond Amendment arguments against gun control Come to think of it maybe the president isnt the one who needs to read this book Maybe I could require the head of the NRA to read it insteadYoure hosting a literary dinner party Which three writers are invitedAlice Hoffman because I idolize her writing and because shes just the loveliest kindest lady Toni Morrison because shes Toni Morrison The only regret I have from my education at Princeton was that after hearing her read from Beloved while it was a work in progress seriously you could have heard a pin drop in the room as she commanded it with her voice and her prose she went on to teach there  after I graduated And Mary Morris who was my mentor and is an impossibly gifted writer of fiction and memoir and who really did teach me everything I know I would bake a very delicious chocolate dessert to thank each of them for the gifts theyve given me Alice Hoffman made me a hungry reader again after I was burned out from being an English major Toni Morrison showed me a pinnacle to which I aspire as a writer and Mary Morris gave me the tools of my craftDisappointing overrated just not good What book did you feel you were supposed to like and didnt Do you remember the last book you put down without finishingThe one genre I absolutely cannot stand is Russian literature You need genealogy charts to just figure out the characters every novel is a thousand pages and pretty much everyone dies One year my son went on a Russian lit kick and tried to get me to read some Tolstoy but I just couldnt Lifes too short Which come to think of it is coincidentally the theme of most Russian literature tooWhats the one book you wish someone else would writeOne that explores why our country is so contentiously divided along the fault line of religion  a construct meant to unite but that more often creates schisms All the hotbutton political issues in this country  abortion reproductive rights gay rights the death penalty  all have ideological roots in religious beliefs that are often archaic or that have been cherrypicked to support specific points of view I hope that same book can explain why our country which was founded on religious freedom so often finds itself tangled up in the screen that should separate church and state Also I would like Jon Stewart to write it because he has a way of swiftly illuminating the truth when you think youre just there to be entertainedWhom would you want to write your life storyNathaniel Philbrick First off compared with the Revolutionary War or the wreck of the Essex my life would be a cakewalk to research In addition Nats the consummate historian a detailed investigator and his writing is captivating  something that is not a given for nonfiction But most of all hes

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/books/review/jonathan-eig-the-birth-of-the-pill-review.html,For much of the first half of the 20th century women approached Margaret Sanger with a plea Do tell me the secret They wrote letters too Doctors are men and have not had a baby so they have no pitty sic for a poor sick mother But she had no secret to not getting pregnant when you didnt want to By Sangers time modern medicine had improved upon the crocodile dung ancient Egyptians used as vaginal plugs and the lemon half Casanova recommended as a cervical cap  but not by much Diaphragms were faulty and illused And condoms depended on mens will at a time when a doctor could advise a woman to sleep on her roof to avoid her husbands advancesAs Jonathan Eig writes in The Birth of the Pill all of Sangers talk of spacing pregnancies and womens independence was for naught without effective contraception It was as if shed been teaching starving people about nutrition without giving them anything healthy to eatBy the time Eigs book opens in 1950 Sanger had fixed her obsession on a contraceptive pill to feed the masses Along with what Eig sets up as a group of brave rebellious misfits Sanger helped find the secret by harnessing something simple something womens bodies already did when pregnant not ovulate Then as now the biological problem was largely solved all that remained was politics That was a lot It still isEigs timing is fortunate Americans are currently fighting new variations on the same battle one that has never quite receded but for political and legal reasons is under a brighter spotlight than ever It was one thing to invent the pill and get it approved It has been quite another for women to have actual access to the contraception thats right for them what with this countrys byzantine system of health care delivery and our even more contorted sexual politicsThe creation story of oral contraception along with the social upheavals attributed to it is not new territory The life of Sanger who founded the precursor to Planned Parenthood is well documented too including in a 2013 graphic novel by Peter Bagge Woman Rebel and a 1992 biography by Ellen Chesler Woman of Valor Eig a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal brings a lively jocular approach to the story casting an unlikely fourpart ensemble comedy starring Sanger the iconoclastic lead scientist Gregory Goodwin Pincus the Roman Catholic physician John Rock and the supplier of cash behind it all Katharine McCormickThough The Birth of the Pill is more popular history than feminist tract Eigs decision to focus on those four has its revisionist political implications When Pincus died in 1967 the first line of his obituary in The New York Times noted that he was one of the three fathers of the birthcontrol pill along with M C Chang and Rock Eig reminds us there were at least two mothers Poor Chang is relegated to a handful of mentionsStill at least in the book this is not a party of equals McCormick is represented mostly by firmly worded letters and the tale of a sad if financially propitious marriage to a schizophrenic scion Rock whose involvement in the clinical trials ran afoul of his Catholic faith and who was disappointed that the church never came around to his product arrives late and generally stays in the shadows of the narrative Eig suggests Sanger was by the time of the events in the book cranky and embarrassing She does get the benefit of Eigs excellent first line She was an old woman who loved sex and she had spent 40 years seeking a way to make it better Regrettably he also describes her as having been a sexy slip of a woman a redheaded fireball of lust and curiosityAbove all Eig is plainly most compelled by Pincus whom he paints as a cowboy among buttonedup scientists His Pincus is wildhaired and stubborn given to reckless bluffs possessing the IQ of an Einstein and the nerves of a card shark Booted from Harvard for his indecorous ways Pincus funds his initial research by going door to door to the WearWell Trouser and Worcester Baking Companies and moves his family into an insane asylum to maximize research efficiencyIn other words he was just the one Sanger needed He eagerly took up her challenge to find an effective and convenient way to prevent pregnancy McCormick and Sangers desire was to free women from biology as destiny to create a world where as Eig puts it womanhood would no longer mean the same thing as motherhood Its not clear Pincus was motivated by that so much as by his zest for an unorthodox challenge But he had a decidedly modern view of sexuality As an undergraduate at Cornell he wrote in a letter to his mother The sexual impulse is to me neither a low degrading thing nor something extremely sacrosanct and holy I regard it rather as a fundamentally normal clean lifeful instinctAlong the way as Eig shows with due detail Pincus was perfectly happy to cut corners presiding over the dubious ethical conditions under which the pill was tested At one point female medical students at the University of Puerto Rico were told they had to enroll in the clinical trials and submit to urine tests and Pap smears on penalty of having their grades docked More than half dropped out of the trials anyway Eig also doesnt let Sanger off the hook for her willingness to ally with eugenicists and to allow their Malthusian horror at overpopulation in the developed world to supersede her politics of liberationThe book is nimbly paced and conversational but its breezy style can trip on the rails of those politics particularly when it comes to what the pill and all the forms of effective hormonal contraception that followed it meant to womens lives Shifting social mores are reduced to postage stamps and though the analysis is infrequent it jarsWhen it comes to delineating contraceptions downsides Eig doesnt seem to think he has to prove the offhand and highly arguable claim that in the years that followed birth control would also contribute to the spread of divorce infidelity single parenthood abortion and pornography He also blithely dismisses as futile Sangers hope that the pill might lift women out of poverty and stop the worlds rapid population growth In fact the pill has been far more popular and had greater impact among the affluent than the poor and has been far more widely used in developed countries than developing ones Contraception hasnt been a panacea for broader inequality and it will never be even if IUDs were available free on demand on every street corner But no serious accounting of womens progress over the past decades however incomplete can leave out the transformative role controlling their fertility has already had in allowing women to chart their own destinies That radical transformation also helps account for the enduring fierceness of contraceptions opponentsIt is an old argument to blame social ills on too much freedom for women or on the tools of it Eig notes that when Sanger gave an interview to Mike Wallace she was asked Could it be that women in the United States have become too independent  that they followed the lead of women like Margaret Sanger by neglecting family life for a career The year was 1957,20141012,abortion

reporter in the campaign video interviewing New Yorkers in the parking lot of a suburban supermarket After he asks them to say why the entrenched incumbent must be ousted the slogan Its time for a change appears accompanied by Lee Greenwoods God Bless the USAThe clip is not from Mr Astorinos campaign to unseat Gov Andrew M Cuomo or even his successful 2009 bid for Westchester County executive It dates to a 1985 Council race in his hometown Mount Pleasant He was an 18yearold volunteerIt was the paytoplay it was the overdevelopment Mr Astorino a Republican recalled in an interview at his campaign headquarters here And the arrogance  thats what got us involved Much like the guy Im running against nowThe narrative of many a political candidate is often filled with epiphanies or turning points helping to explain how the candidate has changed over time on key issuesMr Astorino not so muchAsk anyone who has crossed paths with him at virtually any stage of his career first in radio and now in politics to sum him up and the same words spill out principled and moralistic to admirers rigid and parochial to detractors But evolving NeverNow 47 Mr Astorino is basically the same steadfast conservative and Catholic that he was at 18 when he struck people as an unusually mature activist  and invited comparisons to Alex P Keaton the teenage Republican played by Michael J Fox on Family TiesHis life has in fact been more complicated than that There was a failed marriage his father a police officer was imprisoned for corruption and he had to distance himself from relatives including one suspected of being a Mafia leaderYet those who have known Mr Astorino the longest say they can discern few if any signs that his politics have ever changed or his ambitions ever waveredRobbie has the same principles and the same fire in the belly that he had when he was younger said Sue Swanson a former Westchester legislator and Conservative Party stalwart who mentored Mr Astorino who was a neighbor and a friend of her sons during his early campaignsNow though Mr Astorino faces his biggest challenge yet in Mr Cuomo a centrist Democrat with a 23to1 financial advantage who has already tarred Mr Astorino as an outofstep rightwingerFar from tailoring his message to a heavily Democratic electorate Mr Astorino campaigned recently with Gov Rick Perry of Texas an outspoken social conservativeBut Mr Astorino has given more emphasis to his fiscalconservative credentials in the governors raceCampaigning for him at the Womens National Republican Club in Manhattan recently Carly Fiorina the former HewlettPackard chief and Senate candidate articulated Mr Astorinos talking points Thanks to Mr Cuomo New York has the worst economic outlook of any state The highest taxes in the nation The highest levels of corruption pointed up by a federal investigation into Mr Cuomos own disbanded Moreland CommissionThanks to Mr Astorino she said  mistakenly calling him the former county executive  Westchester has 51000 new jobs The lowest unemployment rate in the state The highest credit rating in the stateNever mind that some of those statements deserve footnotes or are highly debatable two agencies for instance have lowered the countys ratings in the last year citing structural imbalancesStill Mr Astorino and Ms Fiorina also criticized Mr Cuomo by diving into a topic  abortion  that some allies would rather he shy away from In particular they blasted a component of the proposed Womens Equality Act that would ensure that women can get an abortion after six months as is the case under federal law if the womans health is in dangerHes a true believer said Michael R Edelman a longtime Republican commentator on Westchester politics He just chooses a path thats more conservative normally and he wont alter his position based on whether someone says to him Rob you shouldnt do that in a blue stateMr Astorino was a littleknown freshman county legislator when he first challenged Andrew J Spano a twoterm incumbent in 2005 He lost But he won in 2009 after capitalizing on frustration with high property taxes and Spano fatigueHe cruised to reelection last year evidently having won over many Democrats motivated by pocketbook issues And while he has not cut spending or property taxes nearly as much as he pledged he now oversees a work force that is 15 percent leanerIf elected Mr Astorino said he would explore merging agencies much as he did when he consolidated the public works and transportation departments in Westchester He would also target social servicesYou cant tell me in a 55 billion Medicaid program  where we spend more than Texas Pennsylvania and Florida combined  that theres not massive waste and fraud there he saidPerhaps Mr Astorinos most controversial battle has involved zoning Under a 2009 federal Department of Housing and Urban Development desegregation settlement Westchester County is required to ensure that Hispanics and blacks are not discriminated against But Mr Astorino has balked On his campaign website he argues that the county is being subjected to historic federal overreach as part of a radical social engineering schemeAs a result Washington has withheld more than 20 million to local governments and nonprofits from Westchester since 2011 Meanwhile the county Board of Legislators  a perennial Astorino foe  has tried to work with a courtappointed monitor to resolve the impasseI believe he wears conservative blinders said Mark Oxman executive director of the Westchester County Democratic Party Everything he does in governance is dictated by this philosophy Theres no compromise Its my way or the highway Hes entirely rigidMr Astorino is hypocritical critics say for characterizing Mr Cuomo as a symbol of paytoplay even though donors who have given Mr Astorino 900000 since 2009 have received 709 million worth of county work The Astorino campaign scoffed at any causality noting that contracts must be competitively bid and approved by legislatorsMr Astorino has also been criticized for being too blindly loyal to friends particularly from his base in northern Westchester The most recent example paying a family friend 93000 to oversee his own securityMr Astorino makes no apologies for favoring allies from every phase of his life going back to his childhood his years at Fordham University when he won a seat on the Mount Pleasant school board and up through his first jobs in sports radio when he was elected a town councilman in his mid20sEven when he helped to set up the Catholic Channel on Sirius XM Satellite Radio at the suggestion of the Archdiocese of New York Mr Astorino demonstrated a zeal for both the church and politics recalled Jay Clark a former Sirius programming executiveI remember that desire  he talked about local politics more Westchester than anything Mr Clark said He had a youthful maturity and I liked his work ethicOne casualty of Mr Astorinos political career though was his first marriage to a classmate from Westlake High School The marriage was annulled after three yearsI was going to be in politics or broadcasting both were going to be public lives and she figured that she didnt want that said Mr Astorino whose exwife is now a fitness instructor We both probably knew that we made a mistakeDuring the campaign Mr Astorino has defended his father a retired Mount Vernon police lieutenant who served time for corruption But he has distanced himself from other relatives including his stepbrother Salvatore Arena suspected of being a leader years ago in the Genovese crime familyMr Astorino long since remarried now has three children who are going to the same church and same schools as he did His oldest Sean 11 starred in a recent campaign video in which he criticized Mr Cuomo for Photoshopping a family picture featuring Mr Astorino a lifelong New Yorker wearing a polo shirt with the logo of his beloved Miami DolphinsOn the trail Mr Astorino radiates nextdoorneighbor charm His enthusiasm was contagious when he read a book mixing in his excellent Spanish to toddlers at a Poughkeepsie community center that serves atrisk minority childrenYeah weve got a good shot he told one supporter during a recent stop at the Vassar College bookstore Everything is starting to come into focus nowIf his clarity about his chances seems questionable Mr Astorino who was called Robbie Rebound by his childhood friends for having a knack for basketball despite his short stature can at least nourish his optimism with the memories of having pulled off more than one upsetIn the 1985 video a postvictory highlight reel that he helped to produce there is a telling scene from election night As the results are being read aloud the insurgent slate in the lead Mr Astorino  the youngest volunteer by two decades  can be seen milling aboutThen the video cuts by way of comeuppance to a panel of local political pundits

Hospital took even greater leave of his senses in The Golden Lotus Fridays episode of The Knick   So did the show for long stretches Its swing away from medical and social history which it does very well and toward addiction and romantic melodrama which it doesnt  was just about completeIt began with Thackery Clive Owen committing a clumsy latenight breakin at a Greenwich Village pharmacy where he was arrested partly because he stopped to shoot up before leaving the scene of the crime Captain Robertson Grainger Hines always good dispensed some bribes to keep him out of jail telling Thackery So I think this makes us even Someday well find out what happened between them in Nicaragua Maybe in Season 2 So far so notsobad though the idea of one of the citys top surgeons doing a smashandgrab felt a little over the top even in an age when medicine wasnt the most respectable profession and at a time when war in the Philippines had supposedly crimped the cocaine supply That was just the start of the addiction clichs though Next we had Thackery feeling phantom bed bugs under his skin yelling at poor Nurse Lucy Eve Hewson and  of course  catching himself when he saw her shocked expression Though it was kind of a kick when she asked what she could do and he said very intently You can find me  an ocean of cocaineThe drug plot did have the benefit of bringing back Danny Hoch as the irrepressible pimp and loan shark Bunky Collier after a threeepisode absence Barrow went to Collier and pointed out that in order to keep repaying his own debt he needed Thackery  the burnie blower in Bunkys words  to be functional at the hospital Bunky parted with a couple of vials which Barrow passed along to Lucy A note on names In the show the characters are nearly always referred to as Thackery and Lucy so thats how Im referring to them here for the sake of comprehensibilityLucy sang I dont want to play in your yardif you wont be good to me half a century before Peggy Lee recorded it as Thackery injected Bunkys goods which turned out to be saltwater And heres where things really took a turn for the worse Lucy went to the Mott Street opium den and brothel and the show fully indulged its dopey Orientalist proclivities Perry Yung stuck in the shows Fu Manchu role You will always have a friend in Wu explained the episodes title  a dainty womans foot he said was known as a golden lotus  and then got to recite this deathless bit of dialogue During the act of passion the mans pleasure may be enhanced immeasurably by having his concubine place her foot in his mouth Do this for me and I shall trade you 10 grains of opium and 100 Yankee dollarsAnd you know what  Lucy did it  We didnt see it happen of course only the Asian women get fully naked and the show teased us for a while When Lucy delivered the cocaine to Thackery and told him where it had come  from he said As long as you didnt have to put your golden lotus in his mouth to pay for it She said she had traded in her bicycle but then we saw her with the bike and the 100 leaving no doubt The Mysterious East had claimed another victimBut the cocaineopium madness didnt stop there Lucys golden lotus had only been worth a few grains after all So when she heard that the local German hospital had obtained a supply she went there brazened her way in raided the apothecary was caught and ran for it jumping the shark as she went The episode closed with Thackery telling her Youre the most resourceful most wonderful most beautiful girl I have ever known which was somewhat authentically sad and then since they now had a surplus giving her a dose of her own leading you to wonder whether her fervor was based entirely on her infatuation with the good doctorOther things happened in the few minutes of the episode not devoted to Thackerys cold sweats Ive left out the scenes in which he lowered himself by offering to endorse a patent medicine and in which he dug old bottles out of the trash to try to cook up a fix himself One plot development was significant Cornelia Juliet Rylance told Algernon Andr Holland that she was pregnant with his baby He wanted her to keep it  understandably if a bit impractically but she insisted on an abortion pointing out that there would be no way to hide the babys mixed racial heritage He took her to his old basementclinic digs but couldnt go through with aborting his own child Another plot development was wholly melodramatic Eleanor Gallinger showed up at the Knick pushing a stroller holding the dead frozen body of the foundling baby her husband had adopted and brought home We last saw Everett Gallinger preparing to chloroform his wife so that she could be taken away presumably to a mental institutionThere wasnt any real medical action in the episode though we were shown that Algernon and Bertie Chickering had been left to run the hospital by themselves while Thackery and Gallinger dealt with their respective crises Just to make the point a white patient told Algernon that he didnt mind being treated by a black doctorLet us know what you thought of The Golden Lotus in the comments With just one week to go what surprises do you think

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/10/us/politics/ap-us-gay-marriage-kansas.html,OVERLAND PARK Kan   The first marriage of a gay couple in Kansas created a new twist Friday in two of the most intensely fought races of the midterm elections though it remains to be seen whether the Republican incumbents will get a boost from their continued opposition to samesex weddingsUS Sen Pat Roberts and Gov Sam Brownback both locked in surprisingly tight reelection bids each reaffirmed their support for a state constitutional ban on gay marriage as a court in Kansas largest most urban county granted a marriage license to two womenIn this mostly Republican and rural state any talk of gay marriage has typically worked in the favor of GOP candidates who are staunchly against it But its unclear whether that will hold true this year as Roberts and Brownback are fighting for votes from moderates and independents for whom the issue of gay marriage may be overshadowed by the economyUntil now neither the Republican incumbents nor their challengers  independent US Senate candidate Greg Orman and state Rep Paul Davis the Democratic gubernatorial candidate  have emphasized their positions on gay marriageThat may not change muchIts not an issue that either campaign wants to talk about  pro or against  and not necessarily just because its a hotbutton issue but because its probably not going to move the needle where it needs to move among moderate voters said Travis Smith a campaign consultant at Axiom Strategies which worked for Roberts in this years Republican primaryOrman a suburban Kansas City businessman has said he doesnt think the government ought to prohibit gay marriage But he has focused his campaign on the economyDuring an hourlong debate earlier this week in Overland Park neither Orman nor Roberts mentioned gay marriageDavis who represents a reliably Democratic state House district voted three times against a proposed constitutional ban on gay marriage before it was referred to the Kansas ballot in 2005 But he hasnt specifically supported gay marriage during his gubernatorial campaignKansas constitutional provision approved with nearly 70 percent support not only prohibits gay marriage but also denies samesex couples any rights and incidents associated with marriageJohnson County District Judge Kevin Moriarty ordered clerks and other judges to nonetheless approve gay marriage applications after the US Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear appeals from several states where gaymarriage bans were overturned The high court action set off a flurry of developments across the country On Friday legal obstacles to gay marriage fell in Idaho and North Carolina with the Supreme Court saying unions could proceed in Idaho and a federal judge in North Carolina striking down that states banIn Kansas at least one marriage license was issued to a gay couple before the states Supreme Court blocked them and set a hearing for Nov 6  two days after the election Meanwhile the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit challenging Kansas ban on behalf of two couples who were denied licenses this weekJohnson County newlyweds Kelli and Angela asked to be identified only by their first names to help protect their privacy but did agree to allow a photograph of them after their wedding ceremony to be used In a statement released through the gayrights group Equality Kansas they said they wanted to celebrate privatelyBrownback spoke out for the ban saying in written statement Activist judges should not overrule the people of KansasRoberts issued a similar statement vowing to continue to oppose liberal activist judges who defiantly ignore the will of the peopleParticularly for Roberts the emergence of gay marriage as a campaign issue could help him appeal to a conservative base that split in the Republican primary which included a teaparty challenger To win in November the Republican incumbents will need to shore up that base and potentially expand it said Bob Beatty a political science professor at Washburn University in TopekaIt looks as if theres going to be a fair percentage of moderate Republicans who are going to vote against Roberts and Brownback Beatty said They may want to in a way almost concede those moderates and replace them with conservativesRoberts 78 has been struggling to fend off criticism that he has fallen out touch with Kansas during his four decades in Washington Brownback has experienced a backlash over a tax cut initiative that led to a downgrading of the states credit rating after tax revenues fell short of projectionsBut Beatty said its no longer a guarantee  even in Kansas  that a campaign built around social issues such as gay marriage and abortion can carry a candidate to victoryIn an election like this in a way that issue almost is going to seem passe to many Beatty said Its going to seem settled and other issues like jobs and the economy and education

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/nyregion/republican-john-p-cahill-trying-to-gain-traction-in-race-for-state-attorney-general.html,ALBANY   It was an odd stop in what has been an odd campaignLast week John P Cahill the Republican candidate for state attorney general took nearly two hours out of his schedule to attend a breakfast at the New York Athletic Club celebrating a prosecutor he respects but does not know personally Preet Bharara the United States attorney for the Southern District of New YorkSitting in the front Mr Cahill nodded as Mr Bharara spoke about the dangers of corruption in Albany Afterward Mr Cahill was the first person to jump up and greet Mr Bharara Asked his opinion by a reporter Mr Cahill extolled Mr Bhararas great vision of independent law enforcementThats what we need in the attorney generals office of the State of New York Mr Cahill saidHis contention was clear The offices current occupant Eric T Schneiderman a Democrat who is seeking a second term was not living up to that standard Mr Cahill a lawyer who has spent much of his career in the inner circle of former Gov George E Pataki has pinned almost his entire campaign on raising voters doubts about Mr Schneidermans efficacy ethics and courageBut time is running short for Mr Cahill While Mr Schneidermans lead narrowed in some polls after Mr Cahill began running commercials describing himself as tough he still holds a doubledigit advantage Mr Schneiderman has also reserved a barrage of television commercials for the contests homestretch and has an impressive edge in campaign funds And what was once expected to be New Yorks most heated hardfought statewide contest this year is instead shaping up more like a sidewalk scene in which one man is shouting at another who has his hands over his ears  and the bystanders have little idea what is going onIn recent weeks Mr Schneiderman has issued a steady stream of announcements keeping him in the news On Monday one celebrated a health care hotline that it said had investigated and resolved approximately 13000 consumer complaints since 2011 On Thursday it was an announcement of a deal to return 16 million to overcharged customers of CitigroupMr Cahill has sought attention at clergy breakfasts Republican womens brunches and a variety of regional events promoting produce like the Onion Festival in Elba NY and an Applefest in Islip on Long IslandI love the retail politicsing he saidTo be sure retail politicking is something of a novelty for Mr Cahill 56 whose long years in public life were generally spent as a member of a candidates coterie not as a candidate himselfThe son of Irish immigrants Mr Cahill was a freshly minted Pace Law School graduate in 1985 when he was assigned to work on a case with Mr Pataki at the Plunkett  Jaffe firm After Mr Pataki was elected governor he appointed Mr Cahill general counsel at the State Department of Environmental Conservation and then its commissioner in 1996 he oversaw the implementation of a state environmental bond actKnown for an usuallyapproachablemanagement style with flashes of combativeness Mr Cahill became the governors chief of staff after the Sept 11 attacks and was later put in charge of the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site after years of sputtering attempts to get the project started The two mens ties survived their return to the private sector They formed the PatakiCahill Group a consulting firm with a client list including energy and development companiesIn entering the race this year Mr Cahill said he sensed an opportunity in part because Mr Schneiderman had not exploited the jobs political potential the way that former New York attorneys general Andrew M Cuomo and Eliot Spitzer had I do believe that his name recognition for someone who has been an incumbent for three and a half years is remarkably low Mr Cahill saidRecently Mr Cahills strategy has largely been built around a single subject the Moreland Commission the anticorruption panel Governor Cuomo dismantled in March triggering an investigation by Mr Bhararas officeMr Schneiderman had helped form the commission deputizing its members with enhanced prosecutorial powers In Mr Cahills view Mr Schneidermans allowing the commission to be disbanded last spring was disgraceful  worse even than Mr Cuomos meddlingWhat does that say about an attorney general who stands up with great fanfare  Were going to change the culture of Albany were going to deputize these members as assistant attorneys general his staff is basically going to be assigned to this  and he doesnt know whats going on Mr Cahill said in an interview at Chadbourne  Parke the whiteshoe Manhattan corporate law firm where he is of counsel Hes that detachedMr Schneiderman has repeatedly said he could not comment on Mr Bhararas continuing investigationInstead his campaign is quick to point to those who have attacked Mr Cahill his positions and his record Among them are womens groups critical of Mr Cahills opposition to abortion rights and environmental advocates and government watchdog organizations who have called on him to release any information about clients tied to the oil and gas industriesChristine C Quinn the former New York City Council speaker who recently joined the board of Naral ProChoice New York said that while New Yorkers had no problem with bipartisanship they preferred Republicans who are viable in a progressive and valuesbased senseAnd you dont see that in John Cahill she saidFor his part Mr Cahill who is a practicing Catholic said he would uphold the laws of the state regardless of his opposition to abortionDefending his own record Mr Schneiderman pointed to accomplishments like a 613 million settlement with JPMorgan Chase and the arrests of politicians including Assemblyman William Scarborough a Democrat accused last week of using campaign money for personal expenses and of stealing from the state by seeking reimbursement for nonexistent travel expensesWeve demonstrated that we will go after anyone no matter what their relationships are whatever party they are in Mr Schneiderman said And it certainly cannot be argued credibly that I am not independent of the governorHe and Mr Cahill will not meet for a debate until Oct 30 but there have been minor personal swipes along the way Mr Schneidermans campaign poked at Mr Cahills fondness for exercise  he has competed in Ironman competitions and has run marathons  by posting an online video of the candidate jogging with the caption Watch John Stumble And Mr Cahills campaign spokesman noted last week that Mr Cahill had been joined on the campaign trail by his wife Kim  a seemingly thinly veiled shot at the private life of Mr Schneiderman who is divorcedMr Cahill has campaigned on a variety of issues including a somewhat cartbeforethehorse pledge not to run for governor if elected attorney general But absent a more potent line of attack Mr Cahill is appealing to New Yorkers to install at least one Republican in statewide office Democrats now hold all fourPeople understand that there needs to be some sort of balance in Albany Mr Cahill said There is no countervailing forceMore than anything though he is banking on the federal investigation into the Moreland Commissions shutdownSo it was that Mr Cahill went last week to hear Mr Bharara whose independence he would like to emulate If voters let himI would have done exactly what Preet did Mr Cahill said A lot earlier,20141010,abortion

Mayor Bill de Blasio had returned to full campaign mode gesticulating in a church basement sleeves rolled up slightly imploring about 1000 people to turn out in NovemberWe are so close to victory I can taste it Mr de Blasio said of the bid to return a Democratic majority to the State Senate rousing an audience from the Working Families Party which hosted the event on Wednesday night I can taste itBut the man perhaps best positioned to effect that change Gov Andrew M Cuomo was not in the room In fact through a lineup of speakers including politicians union leaders a poet and a McDonalds worker Mr Cuomos name was barely mentionedIt has been more than four months since the fragile marriage between the governor and the Working Families Party was consummated The group endorsed Mr Cuomo over many of its members objections after he agreed to pursue a long list of liberal goals as part of a deal that Mr de Blasio helped brokerThe top priority was an effort to tilt the balance of power in the State Senate where Republicans currently share leadership with a group of breakaway DemocratsLess than a month before Election Day with polls showing some key Senate races leaning in Republicans favor the arrangement with the governor appears increasingly fraught Despite his pledge to push for Democratic control of the Senate Mr Cuomo has at times seemed not to have a strong opinion about the outcome of the November electionsYou cant say Well I can work well if they elect this party  he told reporters last month They elect a legislature Democratic Republican whatever they elect I think the job of the governor is to figure out how to make it workSome of the governors grudging supporters say he has already faltered on his promise Mr Cuomo has not ruled out endorsing a Republican incumbent from Buffalo Mark J Grisanti calling the decision personally difficult Mr Grisanti who lost the Republican primary to a rightleaning challenger but is staying in the race as the candidate of the Independence Party backed the governors push to legalize samesex marriageThe race in Buffalo is of particular interest to womens groups because Mr Grisanti opposes a proposal from the governor regarding abortion rights His Democratic opponent Marc C Panepinto supports itClearly this race isnt complicated for us or for the women of New York said Andrea Miller the president of Naral ProChoice New York We would hope that it would not be complicated for the governorDemocrats hoped that with the support of Mr de Blasio and Mr Cuomo they would be able to win enough seats this year to take control of the Senate But those efforts are not going so well A promising candidate running on Long Island ended his candidacy in September after his former law firm accused him of fraud and a series of polls conducted last week offered a bleak outlook in several other contestsThe polls by Siena College found three incumbent Democrats trailing Republican challengers by doubledigit margins And in two Republicancontrolled districts on Long Island that Democrats had hoped to capture the polls showed the Republican candidates holding wide leadsCity officials have framed the fate of the State Senate as crucial to their agenda A shift in the balance of power they say could help advance legislation related to the minimum wage campaignfinance reform and immigration among other issuesMr de Blasio has dispatched a top political aide Emma Wolfe to help the Democrats And the mayors wife Chirlane McCray is headlining a fundraiser for two Senate candidates next weekMr Cuomos role has been less evident He has done little publicly beyond promising to campaign for some Senate candidates as the Nov 4 election approachesMatt Wing a spokesman for the governors reelection campaign said the state Democratic Party  which Mr Cuomo controls  had spent about 1 million helping Democratic Senate candidatesMembers of the Working Families Party a fusion of liberal activism and union muscle have long been suspicious of Mr Cuomo who is promoting an alternate ballot line the Womens Equality Party that seems likely to compete for votesBut leaders of the Working Families Party who recruited but then declined to endorse Mr Cuomos eventual challenger in the Democratic primary Zephyr Teachout have cast their endorsement of the governor as a farsighted pragmatic choiceThe WFP gets stuff done the groups state director Bill Lipton said from the stage during the event on Wednesday at St Vartan Armenian Cathedral in Manhattan We make it realOther politicians at the event which included Senator Charles E Schumer and Melissa MarkViverito the City Council speaker trumpeted their progressive credentials while exhorting voters to cast ballots on the partys lineAnd Mr de Blasio reminded the audience that he was their poster child As he left the stage New Yorks public advocate Letitia James who served as the MC for much of the night urged the crowd to cheer louderA round of applause for Mayor Bill de Blasio she said Come on you can do better than that Promises made promises keptAmid the roars for the mayor some in the crowd said that Mr Cuomo still had much to proveAs Mr de Blasio

family names will save them from the regions rightward trend in this years Senate races But Republicans say only one name matters in these rapidly realigning states Barack ObamaIn Louisiana and Arkansas Republican Senate candidates appear increasingly confident that they can focus almost exclusively on their opponents ties to the president who lost both states badly They say its time for the two states to bring Senate elections in line with the heavy GOP tilt of recent presidential resultsIt no longer matters Republicans say that Sens Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas hail from famous Democratic families and have seniority in WashingtonWere running against Sen Landrieu and Barack Obama says Rep Bill Cassidy a Republican seeking to end Landrieus career at 18 years Asked about the legacies of Landrieus father Moon and brother Mitch  the former and current mayors of New Orleans  Cassidy shruggedIf you go to our focus groups I dont know if her name matters as much he said He said voters instead note that she voted for health care and she says shed vote for it again He was referring to the presidents health care overhaul also known as ObamacareIn Arkansas Pryor emphasizes his homestate ties and often mentions his father David who was a popular governor and senator When my dad was governor Pryor told retirees in Pine Bluff on Wednesday he had a big senior initiative called Area Agency on AgingHis Republican opponent Rep Tom Cotton focuses on more recent history He says Pryor votes 93 percent of the time with Barack Obama and that should disqualify him

of the SenateIve lived here my whole life Landrieu told a Baton Rouge gathering on a warm afternoon She said her brother the New Orleans mayor is working with her to end homelessness among military veterans And after three Senate terms she said she finally chairs the Senate Energy Committee important to the states oil and gas industryIts crucial to maintain the seniority and the clout that we have in Washington Landrieu said Its your clout its not mine Its Louisianas cloutGOP leaders say seniority is a poor excuse for electing Democrats in a state that overwhelmingly rejected Obama and put Republicans in control of the state government Landrieu uses her clout for Barack Obama Cassidy saysMoon Landrieu and David Pryor prospered in a time when Democrats dominated their states and residents put higher values on pork barrel projects committee chairmanships and other fruits of seniority These Democratic family legacies southern politicians say are increasingly imperiled by

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/us/opponents-of-same-sex-marriage-geared-to-continue-battle-in-courts.html,Leading opponents of samesex marriage vowed on Wednesday to push ahead with their legal fight noting that several federal appeals courts had not yet ruled on the issue and that the Supreme Court could still decide to leave it up to the statesEven as the list of states authorizing samesex marriage swells the opponents noted Justice Anthony M Kennedys order on Wednesday to temporarily block a federal appeals court ruling striking down the marriage restrictions in Idaho The temporary order came as a surprise to many advocates on both sides of the issue since the Supreme Court on Monday had allowed similar decisions from three other appeals courts to take effectThe marriage battle will continue said Jim Campbell a senior legal counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom a Christian legal group that has defended marriage restrictions in several statesMr Campbell said that while it was unclear whether the temporary stay imposed by Justice Kennedy would be prolonged  gay rights advocates predicted that it would be lifted within days perhaps after Justice Kennedy consulted the rest of the court  his hesitation suggests that the marriage question will continue to be litigated and that the Supreme Court hasnt decided this issue one way or anotherThe opponents disputed the assessments of many legal experts who have said it appears all but inevitable that the remaining state bans on samesex marriage will be struck down Rather the opponents argued that Mondays Supreme Court action which had the effect of permitting samesex marriage in five states and may soon overturn bans in six more was not necessarily a sign that the court would establish such marriages as a nationwide rightInstead they see a good chance that when the Supreme Court directly considers the issues it will rule in favor of the peoples right to define marriage as it has always been defined as the National Organization for Marriage put itThe cases now making their way through appeals courts legal experts agree may well yield one or more decisions in favor of state marriage restrictions and all but force the Supreme Court to take a case for a fuller ruling on the issueAdvocates for gay rights as well as many independent legal scholars say the opponents are engaged in wishful thinking They say that the Supreme Court with Mondays decision not to intervene in appealscourt findings in favor of samesex marriage knowingly unleashed a current that will be unstoppableThe shift toward marriage equality is overwhelming in popular opinion among elected officials and in the courts said Suzanne B Goldberg the director of the Center for Gender and Sexuality Law at Columbia Law School Its extremely hard to imagine that marriage equality wont be the ultimate national resolutionThe opponents pin their legal hopes in part on the mixed messages in the Supreme Courts 5to4 decision last year in United States v Windsor that struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act The majority opinion as well as the dissenting views asserted that the states have primary control over marriage policiesBut the majority also emphasized that state laws were subject to constitutional protections and went on to find that excluding gay and lesbian couples from marriage caused unjustified injury and stigma to them and their childrenSince that ruling in June 2013 dozens of federal and state judges as well as four United States Courts of Appeals so far have cited those findings about illegal discrimination as they struck down state marriage restrictionsOnly one federal judge in Louisiana has ruled in favor of a states ban on samesex marriage The total number of states permitting samesex marriages is now 25Bans appear nearly certain to be overturned soon as well in nine more states within the four federal circuits that have ruled so farOne of them Colorado has already started issuing marriage licenses to samesex couples But officials in Kansas South Carolina and Wyoming said they would fight in court to preserve their bansWhile admitting that Mondays Supreme Court action was a serious setback opponents of samesex marriage found a silver lining in the courts decision not to hear arguments on the underlying issuesIf the liberals on the court had the votes to declare samesex marriage a constitutional right why didnt they take any of the cases on offer Monday asked Brian Brown the president of the National Organization for MarriageThat gives hope that the Supreme Court will not launch another Roe v Wade Mr Brown said referring to the 1973 decision legalizing abortion nationwideMr Brown also rejected the argument that once samesex marriages had been allowed in many states the law could not be rolled back if the voters wanted to do soIn California he noted marriages were allowed by court order and then halted for a period by Proposition 8But most legal experts drew the opposite conclusion from Mondays actionWe know from the courts willingness Monday to allow all these marriages to go forward that opponents of samesex marriage are virtually guaranteed to lose before the current Supreme Court said Michael C Dorf a constitutional expert at Cornell Law SchoolWhether or not they view Mondays decision as a turning point lawyers for both sides are digging in for more court battles at every level Dozens of challenges to state marriage restrictions are still pending in courts across the countryAdvocates had assumed that most of these cases might be put on hold as the Supreme Court considered one of the cases it rejected on Monday Now with the nearterm involvement of the Supreme Court uncertain each one of these cases could be the decider for that state or that circuit noted James D Esseks director of gay rights issues for the American Civil Liberties UnionFrom the litigators perspective he said Mondays decision means more work not less workOpponents of samesex marriage like Mr Campbell and Mr Brown say their goal at this point is not to return to the days when it was illegal everywhere but to allow individual states to decide whether through legislation or plebisciteMr Brown said that his group would also press for a constitutional amendment declaring the right of states to define marriage and that in the coming elections it would target Republicans who strayed from the traditional line on marriageAt the same time Mr Campbell and others say they will step up the fight for what they call religious liberty protections  the right of individuals and businesses to refuse to participate in samesex marriages which is already a subject of growing litigationSome conservative religious leaders have resigned themselves to the seemingly unstoppable spread of samesex marriage but call on their followers to prepare for the long haul They suggest responding not with hatred or a siege mentality but with what Russell Moore chief of the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention called cultural persuasionLets articulate a Christian vision of what marriage should be and lets embody that vision in our churches Mr Moore said in a blog post this week Lets love our gay and lesbian neighbors,20141009,abortion

debate between Democratic Sen Kay Hagan and Republican challenger Thom Tillis in North Carolina centered on whether voters should think more about Obama or the conservative direction taken by the

President Obama you vote for Kay Hagan If you think its time to change the direction of this country and make it great again I hope youll vote for Thom Tillis the Republican saidTillis repeated 10 times that Hagans record shows she backs positions favored by Obama 96 percent of the time The figure comes from recorded rollcall votes on measures on which the president took a public positionHagan focused repeatedly on the sharply conservative direction of the state Legislature which Tillis has helped lead after Republicans won vetoproof majorities two years ago She said GOP lawmakers have rejected a federally funded Medicaid expansion that would provide more people with health coverage made cuts to education funding and reduced state taxes in ways that disproportionately benefit wealthier familiesHe has campaigned on an agenda to take that destructive agenda to Washington Hagan said Speaker Tillis feels that those who have the most they should get the most help___COLORADO A

thats on the Colorado ballot this year saying he does not want to limit contraception But he is still the cosponsor of a similar law in the House He said he has remained a sponsor as simply a statement that I support life He said he wasnt sure if he would sponsor a similar measure were he elected to the SenateHe also laughed off Udalls repeated jabs on womens rights recalling that when his

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/opinion/the-state-by-state-revival-of-the-right.html,While politics in Washington remain gridlocked the conservative revolution has been thriving outside the Capitol beltwayRepublicans in states across the Midwest and the South are determined to eviscerate liberal policies and to entrench the political power of the rightTwentythree state governments are now under the complete control  governor house and state senate  of the Republican Party more than at any time since Dwight D Eisenhower won the presidency in 1952 Democrats control 14 states The rest are dividedNot only are Republicans today in charge of more states they are exercising their power to gain partisan advantage far more aggressively than their Democratic counterpartsThe statebased revival of the right has the strong backing of conservative groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council Americans for Tax Reform Karl Roves American CrossroadsCrossroads GPS and the network of taxexempt organizations tied to the Koch brothersThere are some common themes to the current Republican statebased agendaThe most visible effort is the drive to gut public sector unions a key source of votes and financial support for Democrats Wisconsin under Republican Governor Scott Walker has led the charge on this front With support from the Koch brothers the state has severely restricted collective bargaining rights for public employees ended mandatory union dues and limited wage hikes to the rate of inflationBoth supporters and opponents of Walkers initiative realized that this was a key battleground  pathbreaking in fact  hence the rallies the recall and so onMany Republicancontrolled states have weakened or eliminated laws and regulations protecting the environment In North Carolina the state legislature cut the budgets of regulators and prohibited local governments from enacting strict proenvironmental rules The state chapter of the League of Conservation Voters has rated members of the legislature every year since 1999 Between 1999 and 2012 the group issued North Carolina a total of 48 scores of zero In 2013 alone 82 North Carolina Republicans got zerosThe antiabortion movement has held sway in many of the 23 Republicanled states successfully winning passage of legislation designed to force the closing of abortion clinics and to make access to related services as onerous as possible The Guttmacher Institute publishes a description of statelevel abortion laws The measures adopted in conservative states generally include some or all of these restrictions a woman must wait 24 hours and accept counseling designed to discourage abortion a minor must obtain parental consent public funding is restricted to abortions in cases of life endangerment rape or incest the woman must undergo ultrasound and the provider must show and describe the image to the womanPerhaps the most controversial action taken by Republicans in states where they have power has been the approval of legislation designed to restrict minority and student voting through photo ID laws and limitations on early voting In 2013 the North Carolina legislature enacted a major revision of state voting laws that Dan T Carter a prominent historian of the South describes as the nations most extensive effort at voter suppression Carter writesState level Republicans have taken a cue from tax bills passed at a national level during the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George W Bush to push through tax cuts with the lions share of benefits going to the top of the income distribution Last year for example Mike Pence the Republican governor of Indiana signed legislation that slashed rates across the board and eliminated the state estate taxIn an analysis of how the Indiana cuts are distributed by income groups the liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic policy found that the bottom 20 percent are getting an average cut of 10 those in the middle are getting 56 while the top 1 percent get 1181In many respects the agenda promoted by Republicans at the state level gives the lie to the arguments presented last year by the Growth and Opportunity Project The project an initiative of the Republican National Committee called for a more welcoming approach to Hispanics and AfricanAmericans and for increased tolerance and less ideological rigidity across the board The Goproject report warned that voters increasingly see the Republican Party as scary narrowminded and out of touch and a party of stuffy old men The election on Nov 4 offers Democrats an opportunity to end Republican Party domination in as many as five states by defeating incumbent governors in Pennsylvania Florida Wisconsin Michigan and GeorgiaBut even if they win Democrats will not have the power to reverse conservative legislation Wherever possible Republicans in these 23 states redrew legislative district lines after the 2010 census with the express purpose of preventing any Democratic bid to dislodge conservative majorities for the rest of this decadeIn the battle for control of state legislatures Democrats are likely to suffer further setbacks this year according to most preelection analysesThe Democrats have more chambers at risk this cycle  and fewer options for flipping chambers held by the GOP the magazine Governing reported Republicans currently hold 58 state legislative chambers to the Democrats 40 Nebraska is unicameral and nonpartisan thus taking two legislative branches House and State Senate out of the partisan count Just four years ago before the 2010 election Democrats had a 6236 advantageThe current Republican strategy has all the characteristics of a holding action  a fingerinthedike approach to the demographic growth of proDemocratic minorities and the relative decline of proRepublican whites The Republican tactics may prove successful in the short term serving their interests as quickly as they can before the new demographics take hold and perhaps giving the party time to adjust before whites lose their majority statusIn the future the Republican Party will confront two issues does it have the flexibility to change direction when its current tactics no longer work and will Hispanics and other constituencies treat such a change in direction as credibleWhen I asked Whit Ayres a Republican pollster about the balance of power between the two parties he responded by emailAlong similar lines Gary Jacobson a political scientist at the University of California San Diego wrote me in an emailRight now Jacobson argues Republicans are in better shape overall than at any time since before the New Deal Jacobson contends that in the long term Republicans know that trends are unfavorable and that they cannot easily appeal to blacks Latinos socially liberal younger voters etc without alienating their core conservative base older white married religious etcJacobsons conclusionPublic discontent with the current state of affairs is high According to Gallup the percentage of Americans describing themselves as very or somewhat dissatisfied with our system of government and how well it works has nearly tripled from 23 percent in 2002 to 65 percent in 2014None of the prospective presidential candidates who have emerged so far has demonstrated the capacity to capitalize on contemporary levels of public disgruntlementPolarization has made both the Democratic and Republican parties hostile to candidates challenging respective partisan orthodoxies The paradox is that if dissatisfaction with government continues to deepen the status quo will become increasingly unsustainableIn the meantime one thing is clear Republicans operating at the state level are the only group achieving substantial political change in domestic policyThe evidence of Republican success is strongest in the case of labor unionsWisconsins public employees are leaving their unions in droves the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in July 2013 Membership in the Wisconsin State Employees Union had fallen by 60 percent by February 2014 and union revenues had collapsed to 2 million from 6 millionThe antiunion effort has been joined by Republicans in Tennessee Idaho Michigan and IndianaAt the state level Democrats have been complacent as dangerous and foolish as that might be They have failed to combat effectively the determination of business interests and of ideological conservatives to secure power This determination on the right drove the Republican Party to successfully focus on crippling the left in state races in 2010 and 2012 turning the contests of 1980 1994 and 2010 into Republican wave electionsDemocrats today convey only minimal awareness of what they are up against an adversary that views politics as a struggle to the death The Republican Party has demonstrated a willingness to sacrifice principle including its historical commitments to civil rights and conservation to bend campaign finance law to the breaking point to abandon the interests of workers on the factory floor and to undermine progressive tax policy  in a scorchedearth strategy to postpone the day of

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/us/denying-review-justices-clear-way-for-gay-marriage-in-5-states.html,WASHINGTON   The Supreme Court on Monday let stand appeals court rulings allowing samesex marriage in five states a major surprise that could signal the inevitability of the right of samesex marriage nationwideThe development cleared the way for samesex marriages in Indiana Oklahoma Utah Virginia and Wisconsin Gay and lesbian couples started getting married in those states within hoursThe decision to let the appeals court rulings stand which came without explanation in a series of brief orders will have an enormous practical effect and may indicate a point of no return for the Supreme CourtMost immediately the Supreme Courts move increased the number of states allowing samesex marriage to 24 along with the District of Columbia up from 19 Within weeks legal ripples from the decision could expand samesex marriage to 30 statesThat means nearly twothirds of samesex couples in the United States will soon live in states where they can marry according to the Williams Institute at the University of California Los Angeles School of LawShould the court then take up a samesex marriage case next year or in another term the justices may be reluctant to overturn what has become law in the majority of American states said Walter E Dellinger III who was an acting United States solicitor general in the Clinton administrationThe more liberal justices have been reluctant to press this issue to an upordown vote until more of the country experiences gay marriage Mr Dellinger said Once a substantial part of the country has experienced gay marriage then the court will be more willing to finish the jobThere is precedent for such an approach The court waited to strike down bans on interracial marriage until 1967 when the number of states allowing such unions had grown to 34 even though interracial marriage was still opposed by a significant majority of Americans But popular opinion has moved much faster than the courts on samesex marriage with many Americans and large majorities of young people supporting itOpponents of samesex marriage expressed frustration with the development John C Eastman a law professor at Chapman University said it was beyond preposterous for federal courts rather than the democratic process to define the meaning of marriage Supporters of traditional marriage vowed to continue their fight noting that several federal appeals courts are yet to be heard fromThe courts decision not to take up this issue now means that the marriage battle will continue said Byron Babione a lawyer with Alliance Defending Freedom The people should decide this issue not the courtsMondays orders specifically let stand decisions from three federal appeals courts striking down bans on samesex marriage in Indiana Oklahoma Utah Virginia and Wisconsin Those three courts which together have jurisdiction over six additional states that ban samesex marriage  Colorado Kansas North Carolina South Carolina West Virginia and Wyoming  will almost certainly follow their own precedents to strike down those other bans as well That would bring the number of states with samesex marriage to 30Other appeals courts are likely to rule soon on yet other marriage bans including the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco which has jurisdiction over nine states five of which still have samesex marriage bans If that court rules in favor of samesex marriage as expected it will be allowed in 35 statesThe justices had earlier acted to stop samesex marriages in Utah and Virginia issuing stays to block appeals court rulings allowing them Other appeals court decisions had been stayed by the appeals courts themselvesThe nearly universal consensus from Supreme Court observers had been that the stays issued by the justices indicated that they wanted the last word before federal courts transformed the landscape for samesex marriage But in recent remarks Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said there was no urgency for the court to act until a split emerged in the federal appeals courts which recently have all ruled in favor of samesex marriageJustice Ginsburg has often counseled moving slowly a lesson she said she had learned from the backlash that followed Roe v Wade the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion Its not that the judgment was wrong she has said but it moved too far too fastProponents of samesex marriage were confident they would have prevailed in the Supreme Court had it agreed to hear one of Mondays cases They took the unusual step of urging the justices to step in though they had won in the lower courts Even as they welcomed Mondays developments some expressed frustration that the court had not acted more forcefullyThe courts delay in affirming the freedom to marry nationwide prolongs the patchwork of statetostate discrimination and the harms and indignity that the denial of marriage still inflicts on too many couples in too many places said Evan Wolfson the president of Freedom to MarryThe justices last agreed to hear a constitutional challenge to a samesex marriage ban Californias Proposition 8 in December 2012 But a majority of the justices said in June 2013 that the case was not properly before the court That move indicated that the Supreme Court wanted to stay out of the fray until more states allowed samesex marriageIf the court took pains to avoid a resolution of whether there was a constitutional right to samesex marriage in the California case Hollingsworth v Perry it set the groundwork for a definitive answer in a second decision issued the same day That ruling United States v Windsor struck down the part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that barred federal benefits for samesex couples married in states that allowed such unionsThe decision was based on a muddle of rationales In his dissent Justice Antonin Scalia challenged readers of Justice Anthony M Kennedys majority opinion to follow its disappearing trail of legalistic arglebargleBut lower courts seemed to have no trouble understanding what the Windsor decision had to say about a constitutional right to samesex marriage In a remarkable and essentially unbroken line of about 40 decisions state and federal courts have relied on Windsor to rule in favor of samesex marriageIn his own dissent in the Windsor case Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr cautioned that the decision was a limited one buttressing his assertion with a quotation from the majority opinionThe court does not have before it and the logic of its opinion does not decide the distinct question whether the states in the exercise of their historic and essential authority to define the marital relation may continue to utilize the traditional definition of marriage he wroteWe may in the future have to resolve challenges to state marriage definitions affecting samesex couples he added That issue however is not before us in this caseBut lowercourt judges seemed inclined to agree with Justice Scalias assessment of where things were headingBy formally declaring anyone opposed to samesex marriage an enemy of human decency Justice Scalia wrote the majority arms well every challenger to a state law restricting marriage to its traditional definition,20141007,abortion

a prison policy that prevents him from growing a short beard in accordance with his Muslim religious beliefs Prison officials say the policy prevents inmates from concealing contraband or quickly

about her impartiality and possibly could result in a new trialBorn in Jerusalem The case of an American born in Jerusalem who wants his passport to list his birthplace as Israel underlies a major dispute between Congress and the president with Middle Eastern politics as the backdrop The United States has never recognized any nations sovereignty over Jerusalem believing the citys status should be resolved in peace negotiations The administration says a 2002 law passed by Congress allowing Israel to be listed as the birthplace of Jerusalemborn Americans would in essence be seen as a US endorsement of Israeli control of the cityAlabama redistricting Democrats and black lawmakers contend that Republican leaders in Alabama drew a new legislative map that illegally packed black voters into too few voting districts to limit minority political power Republicans say they complied with the law by keeping the same number of districts in which black voters could elect candidates of their

interview that she wears the hijab for religious reasons___Cases the justices could decide to hear before the term ends in late JuneGay marriage  Both sides want the justices to settle the question of whether samesex couples have the same right to marry as heterosexuals under the Constitution A court ruling in favor of samesex marriage would grant marriage rights to samesex couples in all 50 states up from 19 states and the District of Columbia A decision in favor of state marriage bans would allow states to continue setting the rules on whether to allow samesex couples to wedAbortion Several states have passed laws in recent years aimed at limiting abortion by imposing hospital admitting privilege requirements on doctors who perform abortions forcing abortion clinic facilities to meet tougher standards and preventing doctors from prescribing pills for medical abortions later in a pregnancy and at a lower dose The court could take one or more cases that are winding through the courtsVoting disputes Identification requirements and limits on early voting are among state voting laws that could make their way to the Supreme Court this term The court already has jumped preliminarily into a case over early voting in Ohio and seems likely to want a fullblown review But a decision on hearing that case could come late enough in the term to push back the argument and decision to the following term that begins a year from nowContraception The next fight over the new health care laws requirement that contraception be offered to women among a range of preventive services at no extra cost concerns the responsibilities of religious notforprofit universities hospitals and other institutions The Obama administration already allows those organizations to shift

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/05/us/politics/ap-us-supreme-court.html,WASHINGTON   A Supreme Court term that is starting with a lack of headlinegrabbing cases may end with a blockbuster that helps define the legacy of the court under Chief Justice John RobertsWhile samesex marriage is not yet on their agenda the justices appear likely to take on the issue and decide once and for all whether gay and lesbian couples have a constitutional right to marryWhen the justices formally open their new term Monday Roberts will be beginning his 10th year at the head of the court and the fifth with the same lineup of justices He has been part of a fivejustice conservative majority that has rolled back campaign finance limits upheld abortion restrictions and generally been skeptical of the consideration of race in public lifeBut his court has taken a different path in cases involving gay and lesbian Americans despite his opposition most of the timeThe courts record on gay rights is comparable to its embrace of civil rights for AfricanAmericans in the 1950s and 1960s under Chief Justice Earl Warren said University of Chicago law professor David Strauss The court will go down in history as one that was on the frontiers of establishing rights for gays and lesbians Strauss saidThe justices passed up their first opportunity last week to add gay marriage cases to their calendar But they will have several more chances in the coming weeks to accept appeals from officials in Indiana Oklahoma Utah Virginia and Wisconsin who are trying to preserve their state bans on samesex marriageThose prohibitions fell one after the other following the high courts June 2013 decision that struck down part of a federal law that defined marriage as between a man and a womanOn the courts plate in the new term are cases involvingreligious employment and housing discriminationthe drawing of political districts in Alabama and Arizonaa dispute between Congress and the president over passports that is heavy with Middle East politicsa faulty traffic stop over a cars broken brake light in North Carolinathe use of a law to prevent document shredding against a fisherman accused of throwing undersized red grouper overboardthe prosecution of a selfstyled rapper whose Facebook postings threatened his estranged wife an FBI agent and area schoolsMondays argument involves the North Carolina traffic stop that led to the discovery of cocaine in Nicholas Heiens Ford Escort A police officer pulled the car over when he saw the right brake light wasnt working although the left one was Typically evidence found in a car pulled over for a valid reason can be used against a defendant But North Carolinas quirky traffic laws mandate that only one brake light on a car be workingThe case tests whether the officers mistaken understanding of the law makes the traffic stop unreasonable and the ensuing search a violation of Heiens constitutional rights Among Heiens arguments is that citizens cant plead ignorance of the law when they are charged with a crime so there shouldnt be a double standard for the police A divided state Supreme Court said the mistake was reasonable enough to justify the routine traffic stopOn Tuesday the justices will take up the case of Arkansas prison inmate Gregory Holt who says his Muslim beliefs require him to grow a halfinch beard Arkansas prison officials permit no beards with the exception of inmates with certain skin conditions who can have beards a quarterinch longPrison officials say their rule is a matter of security because beards can be used to hide prohibited items and 18 states are backing the states argument But groups across the political spectrum and the Obama administration say Holt has a right to grow a beard under a federal law aimed at protecting prisoners religious rights More than 40 states already allow beards with little evidence that inmates have tried to hide prohibited items in themLast term the court bitterly divided over the religious rights of familyowned corporations that objected to paying for womens contraceptives under President Barack Obamas health care law This case appears likely to unite the court said University of Notre Dame law professor Richard Garnett I think theres every reason to expect agreement among the justices that Arkansas hasnt even come close to satisfying the burden Garnett saidThe courts calendar this fall also includes a foray into the online world Anthony Elonis of Bethlehem Pennsylvania is challenging his conviction for using Facebook to post threats of violence The issue in Elonis case is whether he had to intend to make the threats The government argues that the proper measure is whether a reasonable person would feel threatenedElonis said his online postings should be considered speech that is protected by the First Amendment and that he used the forum to vent his frustration over a series of events that included the loss of his job and the breakup of his marriageBeyond individual cases on the docket court observers across the political spectrum are using the milestone 10th year to offer assessments of Roberts and the court he leadsThe liberal Constitutional Accountability Center has embarked on a yearlong study of the chief justice noting that he said at his confirmation hearings he would pursue restraint and unanimity on the benchSome conservatives are dismayed by what they see as Roberts unwillingness to take big steps on key issues and they have yet to forgive his vote to uphold Obamas health care law in 2012With the court closely divided on key issues a change on the bench can mean the difference between victory and defeat That was indeed the case with the replacement of Justice Sandra Day OConnor with

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/us/supreme-courts-robust-new-session-could-define-legacy-of-chief-justice.html,WASHINGTON   The Supreme Court on Monday returns to work to face a rich and varied docket including cases on First Amendment rights in the digital age religious freedom behind bars and the status of JerusalemThose cases are colorful and consequential but there are much bigger ones on the horizonIm more excited about the next 12 months at the Supreme Court than about any Supreme Court term in its modern history said Thomas C Goldstein who argues frequently before the court and is the publisher of ScotusblogIn the coming weeks the justices will most likely agree to decide whether there is a constitutional right to samesex marriage a question they ducked in 2013 They will also soon consider whether to hear a fresh and potent challenge to the Affordable Care Act which barely survived its last encounter with the court in 2012The terms that concluded with those rulings riveted the nation Now the two issues may return to the court  togetherThis term could become the dj vu all over again term of the century said Pratik A Shah a Supreme Court specialist with Akin Gump Strauss Hauer  FeldChief Justice John G Roberts Jr is entering his 10th term and it is one that could define the legacy of the court he leads Should the court establish a right to samesex marriage it would draw comparisons to the famously liberal court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren said David A Strauss a law professor at the University of ChicagoIt is only a slight overstatement to say that the Roberts court will be to the rights of gays and lesbians what the Warren court was to the rights of African Americans Professor Strauss saidPetitions seeking review of decisions in the marriage and health care cases have already been filed They may be joined in short order by ones on abortion and affirmative actionThe prospect that every major social issue will collide before the justices may be historic Mr Goldstein saidFor now the court has agreed to hear some 50 cases enough to fill out its argument calendar into February Like the cases on the horizon some of the most significant ones are sequels to earlier decisionsIn Zivotofsky v Kerry No 13628 a major separationofpowers case the court will return to the question of whether Congress may require the State Department to treat Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in American passportsA notation in a travel document may seem like a small thing but presidents from both political parties have said allowing Congress to decide the status of Jerusalem in even that setting would interfere with the constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairsThe court might be inclined to duck the issue since any ruling from it could be seen as taking sides on the underlying question of American policy regarding Jerusalem But the justices tied their own hands in 2012 ruling that the case did not involve a political question beyond the federal courts power to decideWilliam P Marshall a law professor at the University of North Carolina said the case had great potential for legal and political mischief Its a big fight over nothing that can cause a lot of problems down the way he saidThe justices will also take another look at race and voting in Alabama Last year in Shelby County v Holder they effectively struck down Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act which had required permission from the federal authorities before some states and localities could change their voting procedures In a supporting brief Alabama had urged the court to rule that wayIn a consolidated pair of new cases Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v Alabama No 13895 and Alabama Democratic Conference v Alabama No 131138 the court will consider challenges from Democratic lawmakers who say the Alabama Legislature packed minority voters into a few districts diluting their voting powerState officials responded that Section 5 partly justified the legislative maps which were drawn using data from the 2010 census when that provision still stoodA divided threejudge Federal District Court panel ruled last year that the redistricting plan was lawful In dissent Judge Myron H Thompson said that there is a cruel irony to these cases in light of the Supreme Courts 2013 decision in the Shelby County caseMany of the other cases on the courts docket have unusual facts that mask the significant legal issues they presentIn Yates v United States No 137451 for instance the court will decide whether the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002 a federal law aimed primarily at whitecollar crime also applies to fish The law makes it a crime to destroy any record document or tangible object in order to obstruct an investigation and a fisherman John L Yates was convicted of violating it by throwing three undersized red grouper back into the Gulf of MexicoThe Supreme Court has been wary of stretching federal laws to fit minor crimes ruling in June for instance that a chemical weapons treaty could not be used as the basis for a prosecution of a domestic dispute In the fish case Solicitor General Donald B Verrilli Jr told the justices that the 2002 law was not limited to financial crimes and was intended by Congress to address all sorts of obstructions of justiceAnother case Elonis v United States No 13983 will require the justices to make sense of rap lyrics a task that will almost certainly be a new experience for most of them My colleagues are all enamored of opera Justice Sonia Sotomayor said at the University of Tulsa last month adding that opera was not my favorite form of cultural entertainmentThe case concerns Anthony Elonis who adopted the rap persona Tone Dougie and posted tirades laced with violent imagery on Facebook in the form of rap lyrics after his wife left him He was convicted under a federal law making it a crime to issue any threat to injure the person of another and he was sentenced to 44 months in prisonThe question in the case is whether Mr Eloniss intent mattered and the courts answer will affect many prosecutions for threats made using social media including Facebook Twitter and YouTubeOn Tuesday in Holt v Hobbs No 136827 the court will consider whether a Muslim prison inmate in Arkansas may grow a halfinch beard Corrections officials there say such beards can pose a threat to security as a place to hide contraband and as a way for escaped inmates to quickly change their appearanceTo decide the case the court will apply a version of the legal test it used in June in the Hobby Lobby case in which it ruled that some corporations could refuse to provide contraception coverage to their female workers on religious groundsThe test set out in federal laws including one specifically directed at protecting prisoners rights requires judges to consider whether the challenged government regulation places a substantial burden on religious practices If it does the government must show that it had a compelling reason for the regulation and no better way to achieve itIn its last term the court achieved a remarkable degree of consensus with the justices deciding twothirds of its cases unanimously That is unlikely to be repeatedIndeed the court will probably also be divided on the threshold question of whether review is warranted on the two biggest issues awaiting its attention samesex marriage and the new challenges to the health care lawThe most important factor in whether the Supreme Court agrees to resolve an issue is usually whether there is a split among the federal appeals courts But such disagreements are lacking in both sets of casesIn the samesex marriage cases all of the recent federal appeals court decisions have struck down state bans on such unions In recent remarks Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested that this might be a reason for the Supreme Court to move slowlyIn the new health care challenges there was initially a vivid split between the federal appeals courts in Washington and in Richmond Va which in July issued conflicting decisions within hours of each otherThe appeals court here ruled that the federal government could not provide insurance subsidies to people in states that had chosen not to establish the marketplaces known as exchangesThe court in Virginia took the opposite view It said the contested phrase in the law limiting subsidies to an exchange established by the state was ambiguous and subject to multiple interpretations That means the court said that the Internal Revenue Services interpretation allowing subsidies without regard to whether the exchange is run by a state or by the federal government is entitled to deferenceThe split between the two courts was wiped out last month when the full United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the July ruling and set the case for argument in DecemberThe Supreme Court is not required to wait A petition seeking review of the Virginia decision has already been filed and it takes only four votes to grant review Four members of the court  Justices Antonin Scalia Anthony M Kennedy Clarence Thomas and Samuel A Alito Jr  made their hostility to the

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/us/politics/democrats-lean-heavily-on-pacs.html,WASHINGTON   With the battle for the Senate tilting toward Republicans and President Obamas approval ratings hovering near his alltime low Democrats are more reliant than they have ever been on the very kind of bigmoney groups they have spent years trying to outlawThey are countering the Republican Partys expansive and formidable outside spending network this fall with a smaller but more tightly knit alliance of groups that share donors closely coordinate their advertising and hit harder than their conservative counterpartsTo hold the Senate the Democratic outside spending network is working hand in hand with  and is funded by  the partys traditional ideological allies including abortion rights organizations environmentalists and labor unions They have overlapping board memberships use the same voter data and even share advertising content Most of their onair money is being spent through a small cluster of super PACs which can explicitly advocate the election or defeat of specific candidatesAnd they have rapidly narrowed the traditional financial gap with Republican groups alarming Republican strategists in what has otherwise been a dismal year for DemocratsThe Democrats  their coalition has been around a while and its tried and true and they all know how to tango together And the Republicans are all kind of doing their own individual dances said John Feehery a Republican strategistCoordination on the right has been hampered by competition for donors and lingering distrust between the partyallied groups like the Crossroads organizations founded by Karl Rove and those seeking to challenge the party establishment such as Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Partners the lead players in the political network overseen by the billionaire brothers Charles G and David H Koch The two sides have jockeyed for cash and influence while also grappling with a wave of ideologically tinged primary battles this spring and summer that sucked up time money and good willTo keep donors secret most of the proRepublican money is coursing not through super PACs but through political nonprofits These groups do not have to disclose much about their finances but are more restricted than super PACs in the types of advertising they can air In part to address the problem the Koch network has pumped more cash into its sole super PAC Freedom Partners Action FundWhile Republicans have spent more over all on advertising during the midterm campaign their cash has been spread among a larger array of groups Many of them are newer organizations established or expanded by the Koch network this cycle Others sprang up to cater to donors angry at the poor performance of Crossroads and other consultantrun groups in 2012I think the problem for the Republicans is that all their bigmoney supporters are doing their own thing and not really giving as much money to the party committees Mr Feehery said Theres really very little coordinationThe result has been stark a message of discipline and unity on the left and a profusion of messages and ideas on the right that in some races borders on cacophony In Michigan for example 79 percent of issues mentioned in ads by Democraticleaning outside groups have been about the environment or energy according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Wesleyan Media Project Ads from Republican outside groups have mentioned a far wider variety of issues  the economy foreign policy energy health care abortion and moreSimilarly in Colorado during the last 10 days of September Democraticsponsored ads attacked Representative Cory Gardner the Republican nominee for the Senate on just two fronts his votes on Medicare and his positions on birth control In a third set of ads NextGen Climate Action has sought to link the birth control attacks to Mr Gardners environmental stance Hed like to make your most private choices for you and some of your notsoprivate ones too a womans voice intones like the environment you live inIn some races different Democratic groups have simply run the same ad  a perfectly legal practice because outside groups can coordinate with one another but one that is rareIn June Emilys List which supports Democratic female candidates who advocate abortion rights announced a 3 million campaign to support Senator Kay Hagan who is running for reelection in North Carolina The campaigns second ad an equalpaythemed spot titled Groceries was developed to appeal to female voters and began running in August in Asheville Charlotte and Greensboro During the same period the lead Democratic outside spender Senate Majority PAC spent 500000 to run the same ad in the Raleigh marketThe advantage on the Democratic side is with a more topdown approach said Ken Goldstein a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco who specializes in political advertising Not only does it mean you dont waste resources in terms of targeting but your message can be consistentSome Republicans argue that their messaging is more diverse because their opponents are playing defense on a wider range of issues And to some extent the fragmentation on the right is a natural condition for parties when they are out of powerIts always going to be easier to coordinate when youve got the White House and youve got this command and control structure where theres final authority said Will Feltus the senior vice president for research and planning at National Media Inc a Republican mediabuying companyThe coordination of Democratic groups extends even to their office space Susan McCue a founder of Senate Majority PAC shares a flatscreentelevisionlined Washington office suite with American Bridge the oppositionresearch hub that provides Democratic groups with the raw material of their campaign attacks She also sits on the board of American BridgeSenate Majoritys campaigns director Ty Matsdorf hangs his hat at the Messina Group the consulting firm founded by Jim Messina the former campaign manager for President Obama Mr Messina also oversees Organizing for Action Mr Obamas issue advocacy organization and Priorities USA Action a super PAC that has turned its energies to support a Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential bid in 2016 In the meantime Priorities has kicked in 500000 to help Senate Majority PAC keep Democrats in the Senate  and agreed to hold off major fundraising until the midterm election is overMore than half of all the outside advertising supporting Democratic Senate candidates this cycle has poured through Senate Majority PAC or a set of affiliated super PACs and nonprofit groups according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group at Kantar Media Much of the rest has come from environmental organizations like NextGen Climate Action and womens rights groups that donate money to Senate Majority PAC closely coordinate their advertising with it or do bothWhen Senate Majority PAC started in 2011 it just seemed like the best and most efficient way to run everything was through one organization Mr Matsdorf said A lot of the success were seeing this cycle in fundraising and from our political donors is because they realize their money was effectively used by usOfficials from Democratic super PACs have attended meetings of the Democracy Alliance a clearinghouse for liberal donors who fund an array of research advocacy and political organizations Contributions to the super PACs count toward the quota each alliance member must donate each yearBy contrast the twiceyearly donor conferences run by the Kochs Freedom Partners network are typically limited to groups within the network like Americans for Prosperity Generation Opportunity and Concerned Veterans for America Crossroads runs its own gatherings for donors  and competes aggressively with the Koch network for moneyVirtually all of the liberal outside spending groups sit on weekly conference calls and tables that coordinate spending in each state The system allows Democratic allies to not only coordinate advertising but link it with intensive getoutthevote efforts organized by unions and other interest groups Dennis Rivera a senior official of the Service Employees International Union one of the countrys most politically active unions also sits on the board of Senate MajorityThe more collaborative Democratic approach several party strategists said has helped shrink the traditional advantage that conservative outside groups have enjoyed in advertising spending Democratic and liberal outside groups have spent 77 million on political advertising during the 2014 cycle according to one Democratic media buyer Republican outside groups focused on the general election have spent about 113 million a figure that includes some money spent by establishment organizations to beat back conservative primary challengers In some weeks this fall total advertising by Democratic candidates and groups has exceeded Republican advertisingOf course the tightly run Democratic network hardly guarantees Democrats a victory in November While the Republican outside network is more fragmented it also had enough money to begin attacking Democrats as early as late last year keeping Senate Democrats on the defensive and forcing many Democratic candidates to dig into their own pockets earlier than expected Mr Feltus described the Republican approach as a free market of messaging and organization in which the best and most effective groups would ultimately winIn the marketplace of political ideas the Republicans should have the advantage because we have more players who can try different things Mr Feltus said,20141005,abortion
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/nyregion/at-cuomo-campaign-rallies-a-focus-on-womens-issues.html,ROCHESTER   Embarking on the first tour of his reelection campaign Gov Andrew M Cuomo boarded a motor coach called the Womens Equality Express on Saturday as he tried to put issues like abortion rights at the center of the election this year in New YorkMr Cuomo a Democrat seeking a second term organized three upstate rallies to press for passage of a 10point proposal called the Womens Equality Act which has languished in the Legislature since he proposed it last yearBut the tour also doubled as an opportunity to excoriate Mr Cuomos Republican challenger Rob Astorino who opposes abortion rights The governor holds a wide lead over Mr Astorino and in an attempt to bury him further Democrats are trying to highlight Mr Astorinos stances on social issues as often as possibleMr Cuomo began the tour by addressing a crowded union hall in Albany Given the occasion pink balloons were added to the traditional red white and blue balloons and affixed to the walls were signs that said Choice and Full EqualityIn Albany and at later stops in Syracuse and Rochester Mr Cuomo listed the planks of his proposal which includes measures related to pay equity sexual harassment human trafficking and domestic violenceThe 10th point is the contentious It would enshrine the Supreme Courts ruling in Roe v Wade into state law Mr Cuomo argued that it was essential to make that change because he said depending on the courts future composition it could someday roll back abortion rights and writing the decision into law would preserve those rightsThe governors comments on the subject were unusually personal as he invoked his three daughters by name and placed them at the forefront of his pitchI am not going to leave this earth Mr Cuomo said in Syracuse until this state makes the statement that my three daughters are equal to any three boys anywhereThose accompanying the governor on the campaign tour appeared to be sticking to a script with female surrogates repeatedly criticizing Mr Astorino the Westchester County executiveAndrea Miller the president of Naral ProChoice New York described him as an ultraconservative backwardlooking extremist Christine C Quinn the former New York City Council speaker invoked the closing of most abortion clinics in Texas whose governor Rick Perry campaigned with Mr Astorino a few days ago As the day continued Mr Perry emerged as the bus tours goto villain in Rochester the crowd booed at the very mention of his nameThis year Mr Cuomo established a new ballot line designed to focus attention on womens issues called the Womens Equality Party and the tour was meant to sharpen that focusA bus was customized for the occasion wrapped in blue white and pink in a design that vaguely resembled the Aquafresh toothpaste logo Mr Cuomo took his place in the seat behind the driver He was joined by his choice to be the states next lieutenant governor former Representative Kathy Hochul who at one point walked down the aisle offering cookies to those on boardThe governor said its part of the official LG duties Ms Hochul saidReporters were permitted on the bus only for the first of the trips two legs from Albany to Syracuse and Mr Cuomo and Ms Hochul went to the back of the bus to speak with reporters during the journey Gripping the overhead luggage rack and leaning against the lavatory door Mr Cuomo talked at some length as the bus barreled down the highway though his spokesman insisted that the conversation be kept off the recordMr Cuomo has a sore history when it comes to speaking with reporters on campaign buses comments he made in 2002 about Gov George E Patakis leadership after the Sept 11 attacks helped doom his first run for governorLater on Saturday after prodding from reporters Mr Cuomo returned for a shorter ontherecord conversation He explained the rationale for the bus tour which he said would continue as the Nov 4 election nearedIts about communication he said If women understand that their right to choice  right to choose  is actually a topic of debate you will see a female response like youve never seen at the pollsThe Astorino campaign shadowed the bus with a pickup truck towing a sign with an arrow ostensibly pointed at the Cuomo campaign vehicle and the declaration Ask Andrew Cuomo why he let Sheldon Silver off the hook in Albany sex assault scandalsThe sign referred to the speaker of the State Assembly a Democrat from Manhattan Mr Silver has been criticized in the past for his handling of sexual harassment complaints in the Assembly and Mr Astorino has faulted the governor for not seeking the speakers resignationIts ironic that Andrew Cuomo is going around the state on a bus tour when he should have been leading Sheldon Silver to prosecutors for covering up sex crimes in the Assembly Mr Astorino said in an interview on Friday When Sheldon Silver needed a lifeline the one person that threw it to him was Andrew CuomoMr Astorino accused Mr Cuomo of focusing attention on abortion rights in an effort to distract voters from other issues This is a prochoice state Mr Astorino said I understand that Abortion is not going anywhere in New York State,20141005,abortion
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/fashion/in-colorado-a-rebranding-of-pot-inc-marijuana.html,Step into a Colorado pot dispensary at random and youll long for the luxuries of the DMVMetal bars cover windows Vinyl signs are tacked to walls Guys in hoodie sweatshirts greet you from behind the counter Even the act of ordering the product itself is borderline absurd What grown adult can respectfully walk into a store and ask for an eighth of Green Krack and a nub of Big Buddha Cheese pleaseBut that experience is changing thanks to a new breed of entrepreneur in Colorado  young ambitious and often female  that is trying to reach a more sophisticated clientele in everything from language to packaging to social eventsWere weeding out the stoners said Olivia Mannix the 25yearold cofounder of a startup called Cannabrand an advertising agency devoted exclusively to marketing marijuana We want to show the world that normal professional successful people consume cannabisColorado became the first of two states to legalize recreational marijuana sales this year paving the way for millions in tax revenue and a new kind of consumer That is why on a recent weekend Ms Mannix and her cofounder Jennifer DeFalco were camped out in Aspen for a potthemed and potinduced brainstorming sessionThe gathering was billed as a writers retreat but mostly it involved talking They discussed edible marijuana and flavor pairings over a meal prepared by Melissa Parks a chef trained at Le Cordon Bleu THCinfused truffles optional They contemplated strain hybrids and herbal remedies with commentary from a selfdescribed cannabis sommelier as well as the gangapreneurs who have flocked to Colorado since pot was made legal not wanting to miss out on the socalled green rushAnd of course they talked about branding How can the pot industry shed its stoner stigmaPot has practically gone mainstream A majority of Americans now supports legalization efforts There are coming ballot measures in Alaska Oregon and the District of Columbia Yet when it comes to pot culture the industry remains comically rudimentaryDispensaries still look like underground abortion clinics Ms Mannix said Advertisements are full of women with whipped cream straddling bongs Ms DeFalco said And the old stoner stereotype endures lazy mostly men rolling joints in their parents basement covered in Doritos crumbsThe average person when you say the word marijuana they have a visceral reaction said Paul Armentano the deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws one of the oldest of such groups Theres a reason the alcohol industry spends tens of millions of dollars to advertise and market their products Successful branding pays offSo where do branding specialists begin For starters they would like to stop calling it pot thank you very much Better to call it cannabis the plants scientific name Less aggressive Rather than smoke one consumes the product Subtler For those in the business  or cannabusiness as its known  9to5 chic is crucial said the Cannabrand owners no sweats no tiedye no Bob Marley TshirtsWhile smoking or rather consuming on the job seems to be par for the course its not without a certain decorum a daintylooking joint or perhaps a vaporizer pen like an ecigarette for weed that slides neatly in a purse or pocketCultural crossover is already well underway in the state The Colorado Symphony made headlines this summer when it began a series of shows called Classically Cannabis in which freespirited music lovers were invited to BYOPThroughout Denver there are monthly cocktail and cannabis events put on by a local party planner as well as a weekly painting course called Puff Pass and Paint hosted in a charming Victorian studio  an effort to as Heidi Keyes the cheerful 28yearold instructor put it blend Mary Jane and MonetCannabrand recently rolled out a yoga class called Vape and Vinyasa The company is working on an app that will allow users to place their pot order online and skip the line as they describe it like an OpenTable for weedThe thing is said Ms DeFalco who is the duos creative director baby boomers are smoking stayathome moms are smoking business executives are smoking But for so long theyve done it behind closed doors We want to bring them out of the shadowsAnd they want to keep them out there Meg Sanders the chief executive of a network of dispensaries called Mindful recently hired Cannabrand to do an overhaul of her company formerly called GaiaThe new name was chosen to reflect the brand philosophy she said but also to modernize its look  in everything from logo to the uniforms worn by employees to the dispensaries shabby insides Many of the marketing materials do not even mention the word cannabis or any other word for potIve heard time and time again I walk into a dispensary and I feel like Im walking into a stoners basement said Ms Sanders during a tour through the expansive factory where her plants are harvested It also acts as the companys headquarters So we really had to think How do we package our product in a way that wherever we go  whether its the most liberal or the most conservative clientele  people look at us and think I get it Im not offended by this Its not Joeys weed shop you knowMs Mannix and Ms DeFalco studied together at the University of Colorado at Boulder though neither has a business background Ms Mannix studied communications Ms DeFalco advertising They are young working overtime trying to project a business savvy but theyve also filled a hole in the industry that the mainstream business sector has yet to touchFor example the women were among the sponsors of a recent career fair called CannaSearch to recruit for some of the 500 open pot jobs in the state The jobs included dispensary workers yes but also horticulturalists social media managers and marketing executives The applicants showed up  among them Csuite level executives said Ms Sanders  but not a single mainstream brand had even a sponsorship presenceThere is a huge untapped market here said Ashley Picillo a 26yearold former teacher who runs a cannabis events agency and was the fairs coorganizer Its about reaching nonconsumers Women Young people Business professionals Grandmothers and soccer moms People like meIn

eight legal abortion clinics now in operationWhole Womans Health was one of 13 clinics across the state forced to stop performing abortions on Friday because they did not meet the building and staffing standards of a hospitalstyle surgery center as now mandated by lawFor the staff as well as the patients some of whom waited as long as four hours as they tried to arrange appointments elsewhere it was an upsetting day of counseling and reassessmentElvia Yamell Hamdan 44 and her husband left their home in Rio Bravo Tex at 6 am and arrived at the clinic at 9 The mother of four and grandmother of three said she did not want another pregnancy She was surprised and puzzled by what she discoveredWhen I got here I found out the law had changed yesterday she said I thought How is that possibleThe overwhelmed clinic staff could not see her until the afternoon and the first appointment they could find for her at the San Antonio clinic was three weeks away Ms Hamdan who said she is six weeks pregnant said she did not want to wait any longer for an abortion but felt she had no choice but to wait and to spend the extra gas money Meanwhile she had blood drawn and had a sonogram

Thursdays decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans while abortion rights advocates called it an incursion on womens rights They vowed to fight on to the Supreme Court for a showdown of the sort we havent seen in two decades in the words of Nancy Northup president of the Center for Reproductive RightsThe appeals panel overturned a lower courts determination that the Texas law imposing hospitalstyle surgery center standards on all abortion clinics and requiring clinic doctors to have admitting privileges at local hospitals was unjustified medically and an unconstitutional burden on abortion rightsAbortion foes say such measures are needed to ensure safety Others including major medical associations say they will bring no medical benefits and are really designed to limit womens access to abortionUnder Roe v Wade and later Supreme Court decisions women have a right to an abortion up to the point that the fetus is viable outside the womb often at about 24 weeks of pregnancy States may regulate the procedure as long as they do not impose an undue burden on womens access to abortionsMs Northup of the Center for Reproductive Rights a legal group that argued against the Texas law in court said that the Supreme Court would have to clarify what constitutes an undue burden The issue has come up not only in the Texas ruling but also with contradictory findings in recent decisions around the country concerning laws limiting medication abortions and laws requiring doctors to have local hospital admitting privilegesBut the impact in Texas Ms Northrup said where nearly one million women of reproductive age will now live more than 150 miles from an abortion facility imposes burdens of an unprecedented scale without medical justificationThe Supreme Court must decide she said whether the promise of Roe v Wade is to have meaning for the women of the United StatesDenise Burke vice president for legal affairs of Americans United for Life said the appeals court decision on the Texas law was a legal endorsement of a major recent push by antiabortion groups arguing that abortion harms women and states may regulate in the interest of womens healthShe said she was confident that the Supreme Court would agree that rules to protect health would not be considered as illegal burdensAbortion clinic officials say to the contrary that such curbs on access to abortions could endanger women forcing some to wait until later in pregnancy for the procedure and leading some to try illegal remediesKristeena Banda

judges allowed full implementation of a law that has closed more than 80 percent of Texas abortion clinicsAs of Friday abortion services for many Texas women required a round trip of more than 200 miles  or a bordercrossing into Mexico or New MexicoOperators of some of the affected clinics and their lawyers from the Center for Reproductive Rights vowed to appeal Thursdays decision by the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans that allows Texas to fully enforce a sweeping abortion law approved by the Republicancontrolled legislature last year They depicted the law  and similar measures proposed in other states  as an unacceptable infringement of the Supreme Courts 1973 Roe v Wade ruling establishing a nationwide right to abortionThis case is ultimately going to end up with the Supreme Court said the reproductive rights centers president Nancy Northup It is going to be a showdown  on whether the promise of Roe will have meaning in the United StatesTwo years ago Texas had more than 40 abortion facilities For now no more than eight will be open due to portions of the law that require abortion providers to obtain hospital admitting privileges and impose hospitallevel operating standards on the clinicsAmong the clinics affected by Thursdays ruling were a facility in the south Texas city of McAllen that served women in the Rio Grande Valley and the last remaining abortion clinic in the western city of El Paso whose future was in limbo The only other remaining clinics in the nations second mostpopulous state are in San Antonio Austin Houston and DallasFort WorthOfficials of Whole Womens Health which operates the McAllen clinic said the facility would remain open as a safe house while dozens of women who had scheduled abortions there were counseled on alternatives including making the nearly 300mile trip north to San AntonioGloria Martinez administrative nurse in Hilltop Womens Reproductive Clinic in El Paso said clients seeking abortions there Friday were being referred to a clinic in Santa Teresa New Mexico However Hilltops owners were holding out hope that they might be able to reopen Saturday because they are exempt for now from the new requirement to undergo costly construction upgradesBackers of the Texas law said its main motive was to better protect womens health but Martinez was not persuadedLets be honest if they care so much about womens health its safer to do it here in El Paso with hospitals as near as two minutes away she saidIts a drive of about 20 or 30 minutes from the clinic in Santa Teresa to the nearest hospital

the Santa Teresa clinic a new abortion clinic is being opened in Las Cruces New Mexico by Whole Womens Health the Texas company that operates the clinic in McAllenOn the legal front the Center for Reproductive Rights said it would move ahead as soon as feasible with an appeal of Thursdays ruling though its precise litigation strategy is still being developedNorthup depicted the Texas law as a cornerstone of a concerted effort across the nation to undermine the protections of Roe v Wade She cited a range of other abortion restrictions approved by GOPcontrolled legislatures in Louisiana Mississippi Alabama Oklahoma Wisconsin North Dakota and elsewhere that have been challenged by lawsuits in federal courtMany of the restrictions were enacted with the support of Americans United for Life a national antiabortion advocacy groupIts vice president of government affairs Dan McConchie said there was a good chance that several types of restrictions might end up before the Supreme Court including Texasstyle laws dealing with hospital admitting privileges and abortion clinic standards He said the high court might also be interested in resolving the status of laws that seek to restrict the use of abortioninducing drugs and that ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancyMcConchie said he was hopeful that the Supreme Court would uphold these laws based on his expectation that Justice Anthony Kennedy  a possible swing vote  would view them as standards designed to protect womenFrom the other flank Cecile Richards president of the Planned Parenthood Federation America expressed hope that the three women on the Supreme Court would help produce rulings striking down the tough restrictionsTexas is an incredible cautionary tale of what these kind of restrictions lead

off as a figure at the center of one of the greatest storms swirling in Catholicism in decadesRelaxed on a black leather sofa the German theologian says he fully expected the knives would come out when at Pope Francis request he made a suggestion that challenged a deep church taboo and has dominated debate ahead of a landmark meeting on Catholic family life that opens this weekend The issue is not abortion contraception or gay marriage It is the fate of Catholics who divorce  and the outcome will be a key test of how far Francis reform agenda will goDelivering a speech to a closed meeting of cardinals last February Kasper suggested that Catholics who remarry without an annulment a church declaration that the first marriage was invalid and thus never existed might receive Communion after a period of penance Church teaching holds that without an annulment these Catholics are living in sin and thus ineligible to receive the sacramentsBased on the mudslinging the remarks caused between church liberals and conservatives outside observers might have thought that Kasper had proposed that women be ordained priestsFive prominent cardinals  including the Vaticans doctrine czar and its supreme court chief justice  published an entire book to refute him Francis top economic adviser did the same in a preface to another book Conservative commentators canon lawyers and theologians have been furiously blogging to argue that Kaspers suggestion is impossible for the simple reason that it runs contrary to Jesus teaching on the indissolubility of marriageThe church is not going to change its teaching on the indissolubility of marriage because she cannot American Cardinal Raymond Burke one of Kaspers fiercest critics told reporters this weekBut as he faces the firestorm Kasper has a powerful ally the pope himselfDuring his first Sunday blessing as pontiff Francis praised Kasper by name as a great theologian and gave an unprecedented papal thumbs up to his book Mercy which provides the theological basis for mercy being at the heart of the Christian messageShowing the churchs merciful face rather than its moralitydriven side has come to define Francis pontificate and informs the way he has long treated complicated pastoral issues like divorceI believe that this is the season of mercy Francis told reporters last year when asked about a possible opening for divorced and remarried CatholicsKasper an 81yearold veteran Vatican official is calm amid the tempest and certain that a solution can be found while staying true to doctrineI think we can have common criteria a common doctrine on marriage and family Kasper said And then I think the bishops conferences should decide concrete ways to do itOn divorce Kasper argues that if the church can forgive a murderer surely it can forgive someone whose first marriage failed and wants to try again while still participating in the sacramental life of the church He is not looking for an acrosstheboard decision but rather an opening for pastoral discernment on a casebycase basisMercy is that God gives us a new chance in every situation if we want it Kasper says That is a very important message We can always start anewWhile the divorce issue has dominated the premeeting debate the twoweek synod of bishops will cover a host of hotbutton issues related to Catholic family life including premarital sex contraception and gay unions Vatican officials say no issue is offlimits and that Francis wants a frank and open discussion that will continue into next year when final proposals are madeThat desire for frank and spontaneous discussion appears to have informed the Vaticans decision to limit detailed information about the closeddoor proceedings The Vatican said Friday it would provide generalized summaries of the topics discussed each day but without identifying who said what In the past the Vatican published written summaries of each bishops prepared intervention fully attributedIn some ways Francis took some of the steam out of divorce issue by creating a special commission of canon lawyers to study technical ways to streamline the annulment processCatholics have long complained that it can take years to get an annulment if they can get one at all Many dioceses in the developing world dont even have annulment tribunals The United States has so many that it accounts for nearly half of all the annulments granted worldwide 18895 in 2012 compared to the 42686 globallyCritics of the annulment process say the wealthy and wellconnected get preferential treatment Supporters say it is a way to provide justice and arrive at the truth of why a marriage failedSome canon lawyers and theologians speculate that one change the Vatican might approve is to remove the automatic appeal for all annulments which would certainly streamline the processFor Irene Calvo Crespo a 46yearold communications consultant from Spain no amount of streamlining would remove the trauma she says she endured going through the annulment that her exhusband sought so he could remarry in the church They had been married for 10 years and had two children when they separated in 2007In an interview over coffee in Rome she said she testified for more than two hours before five strangers  the ecclesial tribunal  about the most intimate details of her sex life She said she endured groundless accusations by her exhusbands family and friends made solely to conform to the churchs requirements that there was some inherent defect in the marriage to render it nullAccording to court documentation she provided to The Associated Press the church granted the annulment on the grounds that her exhusband lacked internal freedom on his wedding day that caused a defect in discretion of judgmentHe claimed he never really wanted to marry her but was compelled to go through with it by his strict conservative upbringing she saidYou can take all the testimony of the world you can do all the psychological exams but the truth is that we were in love and were well aware when we married and no tribunal in the world can change this truth she wrote in a letter to the tribunal If this tribunal wants to join a farce for reasons unknown to me go ahead but you should know this is all theater___,20141003,abortion
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/03/us/politics/ap-us-midterm-elections-abortion.html,DENVER   When US Sen Mark Udall aired the first television ad of his reelection campaign in April the spot did not list his accomplishments or otherwise argue why voters should send him back to Washington for a second term Instead it went after his challenger Republican Rep Cory Gardner on his opposition to abortion rightsSix months later Udall and his allies are still filling the airwaves with ads hammering Gardner on abortion hoping to use the issue  once thought by Democrats to be a wash politically  to win this swing state for the third consecutive election cycleIts the most prominent example of how from Alaska to Florida reproductive rights have taken center stage in Democratic campaigns a stark shift from the days when abortion issues were often used to rally the partys base but rarely discussed in front of those who might end up voting for either candidateThe shift comes after the Republican wave of 2010 put the GOP in the majority in the US House and inspired 39 states last year to pass laws restricting access to abortion It also comes amid the rise of personhood proposals in some states that would grant legal rights to a fertilized egg which could outlaw almost all abortions and even more explosively some forms of birth controlMany abortion opponents say they do not intend to target birth control But the very mention of contraception in the abortion debate has become volatile said Laura Chapin a Democratic strategist in ColoradoIf Republicans had stuck to abortion the argument would not have changed Chapin said but when they got taken over by the religious right and went after something we use on a daily basis the dynamics changedDemocrats in Iowa Michigan and North Carolina also are attacking their Republican opponents for supporting personhood proposals In Alaska supporters of Democratic Sen Mark Begich are running an ad knocking his Republican challenger for opposing abortion rightsEven RepublicanturnedDemocrat Charlie Crist in Florida who once opposed abortion rights has aired an ad hitting Gov Rick Scott on his opposition to abortionPolls are mixed on political support for abortion rights and have shown that men and women have similar views But Jennifer Lawless director of the Women  Policy Institute at American University said unmarried women who overwhelmingly vote Democratic are more likely to be concerned about reproductive rights Plus she noted that Democrats are linking abortion to broader gender issues such as pay equity that helped President Barack Obama win the womens vote nationally by 18 percentage points in 2012Its a safer strategy this time around because weve seen the language and tenor work in previous election cycles Lawless saidIn no state has the issue of reproductive rights dominated the debate as in Colorado Democrats pioneered the strategy in 2010 when Sen Michael Bennet eked out a narrow victory after attacking his Republican challenger as antiwomen and antiabortion rights Obamas reelection campaign emphasized reproductive rights in Colorado in 2012 He won the state handilyIn some deeply religious states like Louisiana and Arkansas Democratic Senate candidates rarely discuss reproductive rights But Colorado was the first state to decriminalize abortion in the preRoe v Wade days and about 100000 proabortion rights women who live in the Denver suburbs routinely decide elections in the stateIn Colorado Gardner is trying to confront the Democrats pushMark Udall has failed on energy on the economy Hes failed on health care so of course he wants to talk about something else Gardner said in a brief interview last weekGardner kicked off his campaign by disavowing a state personhood measure that he previously backed saying he did not want to ban birth control  though Democrats note he remains a cosponsor of a similar federal measure in Congress He proposed allowing birth control pills to be sold over the counter  and Democrats hit back noting that would raise the cost to most consumers GOP operative Karl Roves group Crossroads GPS recently ran an ad featuring four frustratedsounding middleaged women saying We arent singleissue voters before slamming Udall for supporting Obama In a new ad his campaign released this week Gardner said Udall wont talk about anything elseIlyse Hogue president of NARAL suggested in an interview that Republicans are foolish to dismiss reproductive rights as a single issueThis isnt about abortion at all Hogue said Its about a worldview on womens rights that people think is superseded by a fertilized eggKaty Atkinson a GOP consultant in Denver who has pushed for her party to broaden its appeal to female voters said she thinks Udall has erred by relentlessly emphasizing the issue The race has remained largely deadlocked in public polling since the senators attacks began in April It doesnt resonate with the public the way it once did Atkinson saidThats certainly true for Stephanie Greenberg 30 an independent voter in the swing suburb of Centennial who supports abortion rights but is tired of hearing arguments about birth controlTheyre harping on birth control and womens rights too much she said___Follow Nicholas Riccardi on Twitter at httpstwittercomNickRiccardi ,20141003,abortion

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/appeals-court-ruling-closes-13-abortion-clinics-in-texas.html,DALLAS   Thirteen abortion clinics in Texas were forced to close immediately after a federal appellate court on Thursday sided with Texas in its yearlong legal battle over its sweeping abortion law and allowed the state to enforce one of the laws toughest provisions while the case was being appealedThe decision by a threejudge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans will have a farreaching effect on abortion services in Texas lawyers for abortion providers said The ruling gave Texas permission to require all abortion clinics in the state to meet the same building equipment and staffing standards as hospitalstyle surgical centers standards that abortion providers said were unnecessary and costly but that the state argued improved patient safetyThirteen clinics whose facilities do not meet the new standards were to be closed overnight leaving Texas  a state with 54 million women of reproductive age ranking second in the country  with eight abortion providers all in Houston Austin and two other metropolitan regions No abortion facilities will be open west or south of San AntonioThe ruling has gutted Texas womens constitutional rights and access to critical reproductive health care and stands to make safe legal abortion essentially disappear overnight said Nancy Northup the president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights whose lawyers were part of the legal team representing the clinics that sued the stateBut Lauren Bean a spokeswoman for Greg Abbott the Texas attorney general whose lawyers represented the state and who is the frontrunner as the Republican nominee in the Texas governors race praised the ruling This decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the Texas Legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women Ms Bean saidThe threejudge panel agreed with the states lawyers that there was insufficient evidence that a large fraction of women seeking abortions would face an unconstitutional burden because of the surgicalcenter requirements and clinic closings They wrote that the data provided by one of the plaintiffs experts Dr Daniel Grossman suggested that about one out of six Texas women seeking an abortion would live more than 150 miles from the nearest clinic if the surgicalcenter rules went into effectThis is nowhere near a large fraction the panel wroteTwo of the three judges were appointed by Republican presidents and one Judge Stephen A Higginson was appointed by President Obama Judge Higginson concurred in part and dissented in part from the majority opinionThe panels decision was only temporary and left open the possibility that the clinics could reopen as the case proceeds Nevertheless abortion providers and their lawyers said they were considering all of their legal options including appealing to the Supreme Court or to the full Fifth Circuit Meanwhile Texas Republicans and antiabortion groups who backed the law praised the decision and said it countered a series of court rulings that struck down other abortion restrictions across the SouthJoe Pojman executive director of the antiabortion group Texas Alliance for Life commended Mr Abbotts legal team for their effective defense of Texas law from challenges from the abortion industryIn July 2013 the Republicandominated Texas Legislature passed some of the toughest abortion restrictions in the United States after a marathon filibuster that turned a Democratic state senator Wendy Davis into a national political star and set the stage for her campaign for governor Some parts of the law were already being enforced but the surgicalcenter requirement had yet to take effectThis August Judge Lee Yeakel of United States District Court in Austin ruled that the surgicalcenter rule put an unconstitutional burden on women seeking abortions and that the effect of clinic closings and the reduced geographic distribution of clinics operated just as drastically as a complete ban on abortion In the months before the law was enacted last summer Texas had 41 facilities providing abortions In recent weeks that number had decreased to 21Judge Yeakel also blocked a requirement that doctors performing abortions obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of a clinicIn an unusual move the judge granted the abortion providers who sued the state broader relief than they had requested Lawyers for abortion facilities had asked him to strike down the requirement as it applied to two clinics in El Paso and McAllen But Judge Yeakel ruled the admittingprivileges requirement and the surgicalcenter standards operating together put undue burdens on women statewide and created a brutally effective system of abortion regulation that reduces access to abortion clinicsLawyers for Mr Abbott appealed Judge Yeakels ruling to the Fifth Circuit asking the court to temporarily block the decision while the appeal proceededThe Fifth Circuit regarded by many as one of the most conservative federal appellate courts had given Texas favorable rulings in past abortion cases and was expected to do the same this time In March a different Fifth Circuit panel sided with Texas in the first lawsuit over the new abortion restrictions overturning a decision by Judge Yeakel and upholding the admittingprivileges rule as constitutionalIn court documents and at a hearing in New Orleans lawyers for Texas had attacked Judge Yeakels decision on several fronts and some of their arguments influenced the circuit panels ruling Jonathan F Mitchell the states solicitor general said Judge Yeakel was legally barred from ruling on the statewide impact and constitutionality of the admittingprivileges requirement because the Fifth Circuit had already upheld it in MarchJudge Yeakels actions border on defiance of this court Mr Mitchell wrote in court documentsThe panel in its ruling on Thursday appeared to agree with Mr Mitchell Judge Yeakels decision to invalidate the admittingprivileges requirement throughout Texas was inappropriate because plaintiffs did not request that relief and was directly contrary to this circuits precedent the judges wroteLawyers for Texas argued that the abortion patients who will face burdensome driving distances because of the law did not amount to a large fraction and that an abortion regulation cannot be invalidated unless it imposes an undue burden on what the Supreme Court called a large fraction of relevant casesThe lawyers representing abortion clinics said Judge Yeakel did not have to apply the large fraction test and that even if he did the affected population was indeed large The clinics lawyers said in one analysis that about 17 out of 100 Texas women of reproductive age would face a substantial obstacle to abortion services,20141003,abortion

the first time since the Great Recession the economy wouldnt be the top issue The latest Associated PressGfK poll suggests thats not going to happenNine in 10 likely voters in the survey said the economy was an important issue outpacing rising concerns about terrorism ongoing concerns about health care and the social issues that have led to sharp clashes on the campaign trailWhere voters stand on the top issues in the midterm electionsECONOMYThe nations economic blues remain at the top of voters list of important issues Asked to name the nations biggest problem 19 percent cite the economy significantly higher than the 12 percent who name the next highest issue on the list terrorism and national security Among all adults 4 in 10 approve of President Barack Obamas handling of the issue a figure thats held steady since late last yearLikely voters give Republicans a narrow edge as the party more trusted to handle the economy 36 percent to 31 percent who favor the Democrats approach But six years after impressions of the economy took a negative turn from which public opinion has never recovered a sizable 22 percent say they trust neither party on the issue Overall 62 percent of likely voters describe the economy as poor about the same as at this point in 2012 but better than 2010 when 79 percent of likely voters said it was in bad shapeHEALTH CAREMany expected Obamas signature domestic policy initiative to become a central topic in this years campaigns but the voters are less interested Though 8 in 10 call health care an important issue for them personally when asked to name the top issue facing the country just 5 percent of likely voters named health carePublic opinion on the law has been stagnant since the rollout of the state insurance exchanges a year ago Overall 25 percent of adults say they support the health care program 40 percent oppose it and 34 percent are neutral About 6 in 10 say the law itself has been more of a failure than a success Among likely voters theres more support for the health care overhaul 30 percent but also more opposition 47 percentThose likely voters who call health care an extremely important issue are more closely divided than others on how the laws been working though they still fall mainly on the negative side of the line 45 percent say its been a success while 54 percent call it a failureIMMIGRATIONAbout twothirds of likely voters call illegal immigration a serious problem for the United States today and 8 percent name immigration or border security as the top issue facing the nation Only 35 percent say they approve of Obamas handling of the issueVoters are generally in favor of providing a legal way for illegal immigrants already in the United States to become citizens 53

percent favor it along with 37 percent of independent likely votersTHREAT OF TERRORISMAbout 8 in 10 likely voters say terrorism is a key issue for them with Republicans more apt than Democrats to consider it important Overall 83 percent of Republicans say the issue is important compared with 72 percent of Democrats Similarly 87 percent of Republicans consider the threat posed by the Islamic State group an important issue compared with 75 percent of Democrats Although some have raised the possibility of securityfocused women as a key to the election there is no difference by gender on the importance of the issueRepublicans have a 16point advantage among likely voters as the party more trusted to protect the country 39 percent vs 23 percent and its one issue where the parties havent lost quite as much faith among the public Just 16 percent say they trust neither party to keep the nation safe the lowest share on any issue tested in the pollSOCIAL ISSUESDemocrats hold their strongest advantages in the poll on issues such as abortion or samesex marriage yet these same issues land near the bottom of voters priority lists Asked in an openended question to name the most important issue currently facing the US neither issue scored even 1 percent of responses When asked how important each issue was personally 43 percent of likely voters ranked abortion an important one while 32 percent said that about samesex marriageFemale likely voters are more likely to call both issues important On abortion 47 percent of women consider it important compared with 38 percent of

Anchored up at night hands hardly able to close around a can of beer we nodded at the usual stories the tourist couple who lost their pug when it tried to make friends with a brown bear the local man who disappeared his skiff found abandoned in the rocks of Auke Bay the black bear that fell through a skylight onto a table of cupcakes at a kids birthday in JuneauNow the boats are tied down against fall storms and the streets of the island town where I live smell of soy sauce and brown sugar as people brine sockeye preparing it for the smoker Talk is that its going to be a rough rainy winter  to say nothing of the gust of media attention that has been blowing up from the Lower 48 swirling around our United States Senate election in November bringing with it more outside money than has ever been spent on a political campaign in the stateThe last time the klieg lights pivoted our way was when shewhomustnotbenamed became an overnight sensation during the 2008 presidential election We all know how that turned out Now six years later the networks are back with Alaska seen as a closely contested key state that could affect the crucial balance of Democrats and Republicans in the SenateWell if you want to gauge the political mood around here sit down at the Backdoor Cafe with a cup of coffee and a salmonberry scone pick up The Daily Sitka Sentinel have a chat with folks and youll learn that not much is predictable in the 49th stateFrom all appearances the Republican candidate Dan Sullivan a goodlooking amicable Marine officer and former commissioner of the states Department of Natural Resources should have little problem beating the Democratic incumbent Mark Begich Mr Begich a firstterm senator slid into his seat in 2008 by just under 4000 votes ousting the GOP candidate Ted Stevens who had been convicted of felony corruption charges though the indictment was later dismissed The governor Sean Parnell is a Republican Republicans control the state legislature and have the states only seat in the House of Representatives along with the other Senate seat President Obama is unpopular he lost the state by a large margin in 2008 and again by a smaller margin in 2012But its a mistake to check Alaska off as bright red Large numbers of voters here register as nonpartisan We abolished the death penalty in 1957 two years before we were even a state In 1959 we were the first state to adopt a minimum wage higher than the federal level and we maintained the highest minimum wage in the country for more than 30 years We were one of four states to legalize abortion prior to the decision in Roe v Wade in 1973Outsiders point to shewhomustnotbenamed as proof of Tea Party tendencies not understanding that we gave her high marks because she aggressively taxed oil companies and fought hard to fund state programs Even Governor Parnell is thought to be at risk in Novembers elections threatened by an independent ticket endorsed by the Alaska Democratic PartyIn the Senate race Mr Begich the Democrat appears to have the upper hand in field operations Hes built a reputation for stopping by bingo halls to call numbers and has opened a number of rural offices He even set up a campaign office in the laundromat in Dillingham on the logic that all fishermen need to do laundry logic that I would ahem questionAt the same time super PACs have backed a torrent of antiBegich political ads It seems you cant open a YouTube video without encountering a spot connecting Mr Obama to the incumbent Mr Begich protests to all who will listen that hes been a thorn in Obamas sideFor his part Mr Begich knocked it out of the park with an ad showing him crossing the tundra on a snow machine touting his prooil stance yes hes the Democrat but this is Alaska and no its not a snowmobile we call them snow machines up here Mr Sullivan however accused Mr Begich of pretending to operate the vehicle Mr Begich responded that hed traveled with a crew armed with an AR15 rifle for protection against polar bears and pointed to his helmet hair as proof hed made the ride He also said he had a frostbit ear He then argued that he represents true Alaska and labeled Mr Sullivan Ohio Dan because thats where Mr Sullivan comes fromAnd so it goes A voter would not be faulted for confusing the race with yet another overheated episode from one of the many reality TV shows currently filming in the stateI suppose all this serves as a reminder that were part of the United States revolving around the political sun of Washington Fair enough But here in town as voices lower the days grow shorter wood stoves are lit and the adrenaline rush from a hardworking summer thins out of the bloodstream theres a feeling that weve slipped our ellipse and are floating around some gentler more mysterious star hidden somewhere up in those ice fieldsSo when these outside lights do turn north and were called upon to make a decision were repeatedly told is crucial

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/opinion/the-next-nine-years.html,Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr begins his 10th Supreme Court term next Monday Thats a fact all but guaranteed to startle those of us who remember as if it were yesterday the weird and intense Supreme Court summer of 2005 bracketed by Justice Sandra Day OConnors unexpected retirement announcement and two months later Chief Justice William H Rehnquists death at 80 from thyroid cancer Those events propelled John Roberts originally President George W Bushs choice for the OConnor vacancy to the center chair to which the president quickly switched the nomination At 50 he was the youngest chief justice since John Marshall Of todays justices only Elena Kagan at 54 is his juniorIt has been an eventful nine terms for the court and its chief Samuel A Alito Jr Justice OConnors eventual replacement is well to her right and has provided Chief Justice Roberts with a reliable if narrow majority for the courts steady regression on race and its deregulatory hijacking of the First Amendment Along with everexpanding accommodation of religious interests these are the areas in which the Roberts court has made its increasingly predictable markAnniversaries are a typical time for this kind of stocktaking but whats most interesting about this anniversary is not the past but the future the next nine years What kind of Supreme Court will John Roberts find himself presiding over and how will he respond to what is highly likely to be a change in one direction or the other from the knife edge on which his current majority restsNine years from now Chief Justice Roberts will be 68 which happens to be the average age of the current justices Nine years from now there will have been two presidential elections with a third election year just months away I hope this puts into perspective the tedious debate over whether Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg should take a bullet for the left and hang up her robe I dont intend to contribute to that debate except to advise the hyperactive 81yearold justice who is giving interviews these days at a rate faster than I can keep up with the transcripts that she shouldnt stay a day longer than she chooses to In case anyone has quite understandably come away from all the chatter with an image of Justice Ginsburg as an aging grandmother among a bevy of spry youths Ill just point out that both Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M Kennedy are 78 and Justice Stephen G Breyer is 76What all this means is that while the Roberts court will keep its name it will inevitably change its stripes  but in which direction Will Chief Justice Roberts preside over a robust conservative majority or will he be a beleaguered dissenter left to watch from the sidelines as others build a jurisprudential legacy and deprive him of the chance to build a lasting one of his own These are not of course necessarily the only choices that may confront him Assuming neither passivity nor helplessness in the face of political adversity its also possible that he could change his stripes along with the court That is to say that if the courts center of gravity moves to the left so too could the chief justice migrate toward the center of the new spectrum thus staying in the game and retaining the ability to shape outcomesThis is a less cynical thought than it might first appear For one thing almost any major Supreme Court case presents a range of options narrow to broad for reaching a desired result For another Chief Justice Roberts has already shown himself highly skilled at both approaches In contrast to Justice Scalias my way or the highway and Justice Clarence Thomass fullsteambacktothe18thcentury Chief Justice Roberts is adept at modulating both his tone and his ambitions to fit the situation at hand The courts most recent term offers ample evidenceThe chief justice is certainly capable of writing broad opinions and of joining the broad opinions he assigns to others He wrote for the court in McCutcheon v Federal Election Commission invoking the First Amendment to invalidate aggregate limits on an individuals campaign contributions Justice Thomas providing a fifth vote would have gone further to take down the entire structure of federal campaign finance regulation so perhaps the chief justices opinion looked narrow by contrast but it was plenty broad enough to do the jobHe assigned the Hobby Lobby case to Justice Alito and joined in full the opinion holding that the government couldnt require a forprofit corporation with religiously observant owners to abide by the mandate to provide contraception coverage as part of the employees health insurance plan He assigned Town of Greece v Galloway to Justice Kennedy and joined in full the opinion upholding sectarian prayer at local government meetings Here too Justice Thomas would have gone further to hold that the First Amendments prohibition on the establishment of religion doesnt apply to the states a preposterous position for a member of the Supreme Court to take in 2014On the other hand Chief Justice Roberts also wrote some important opinions that were sufficiently narrow to win the support of justices to his left while driving Justices Scalia Alito and Thomas to refuse to sign his opinion they concurred only in the result while offering a much more sweeping analysis Many endofterm analyses this year that celebrated the high proportion of purportedly unanimous decisions missed the internal dynamic of some of the most significant 90 bottom linesFor example in McCullen v Coakley a 90 decision that struck down a protective buffer zone around Massachusetts abortion clinics Chief Justice Robertss opinion was joined by Justices Ginsburg Kagan Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor but not by Justices Scalia Thomas Alito or Kennedy What drove those four away was the chief justices conclusion that the Massachusetts law was appropriately content and viewpointneutral  that is it did not single out antiabortion speech for special disfavor but rather served the states legitimate interest in protecting safety and order around the clinics The 35foot buffer zone was simply bigger than necessary the chief justice wrote The decision left open the states ability to enact a smaller zone which the Massachusetts Legislature promptly didIn his separate opinion Justice Scalia fumed that the court had given abortionrights advocates a pass when it comes to suppressing the freespeech rights of their opponents and had preserved the ability of jurisdictions across the country to restrict antiabortion speech without fear of rigorous constitutional reviewJustice Ginsburg in an interview over the summer with Mark Sherman of The Associated Press praised the chief justices opinion and explained her vote It was she said a good decision to say Yes you can regulate but it is speech so you have to be careful not to go too far Another of the last terms cases Bond v United States was closely watched on the political right for the longdesired opportunity it presented to cut back on Congresss power to define the scope of treaties The case challenged the validity of a federal prosecution for violating a statute Congress passed in 1998 to implement a chemical weapons treaty The vote to overturn the conviction was 90 Chief Justice Robertss opinion joined by Justices Kennedy Ginsburg Breyer Sotomayor and Kagan sidestepped the politically freighted issue of the congressional treaty power and held only that Congress had not intended to criminalize the particular conduct at issue in the case putting a toxic chemical on a romantic rivals mailbox and doorknob This behavior was a matter for state not federal prosecution the chief justice concluded leaving Congresss treaty power intact to fight another dayDescribing the majority opinion as resultdriven antitextualism that reads like a really good lawyers brief for the wrong side Justices Scalia Thomas and Alito accused the chief justice of having performed gruesome surgery on the statute in order to avoid the deeper constitutional issue in the case The opinion claimed an entirely made up relevance for the precedents it invoked they complained in refusing to sign itThe same three justices likewise refused to sign another Roberts opinion this one on a fundamental question of securities law In Halliburton v Erica P John Fund the court ruled 90 against the plaintiffs in a securities classaction lawsuit The chief justice joined by Justices Kennedy Ginsburg Breyer Sotomayor and Kagan found no need to overrule a foundational 26yearold precedent under which investors are presumed to have relied on the market price in deciding whether to buy a stock The precedent should be overruled the other three justices saidThe question remains whether the chief justices position in these and in similar cases in previous terms was the result of choice or necessity Was he following his own best instincts or was he simply trying to hold a court in the face of the untamed activism on his right flank I dont presume to know  any more than I have managed to unpack the enduring mystery of his vote two years ago to save the Affordable Care Act Will Chief Justice Roberts evolve as have other Republicanappointed justices in recent memory think of Sandra Day OConnor John Paul Stevens David H Souter Harry A BlackmunScholarship on this question would suggest the answer is a firm no among the justices who became more liberal during their Supreme Court tenures were none who had worked inside the Beltway or paid their dues as Republicanappointed officials in the executive branch John Roberts its worth noting has never left Washington after arriving in 1980 for a Supreme Court clerkship He subsequently worked in the Reagan Justice Department and White House and before a twoyear tenure on the federal appeals court there made a career in private practice arguing before the Supreme CourtChief Justice Rehnquist in his final years on the bench seemed to have moved a bit to the middle in a few notable cases and I was once in his presence when someone asked him whether he was in fact in the process of moderating his rigorously conservative views Raising an eyebrow the chief justice looked at his questioner and replied deadpan Do you mean have I shown a capacity for growthOne mans growth is perhaps anothers survival Happy anniversary,20141002,abortion
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/science/teenage-pregnancy-and-abortion-rates-plummet-with-long-acting-female-contraception-study-says.html,Marlice House was determined to take a different path from her mother who had gotten pregnant with her at 17I do not want that to be me she saidSo when Ms House heard about a study offering sexually active teenagers in St Louis free birth control she signed upThree in 10 girls and women in the United States become pregnant before 20 a rate significantly higher than that in many other rich countries The 14 to 19yearold participants in the study Ms House joined nearly half of whom had already had an unintended pregnancy were offered free birth control and counseled on the benefits of longacting contraceptives like intrauterine devices and implants methods used by fewer than 5 percent of teenagersOverwhelmingly Ms House and other teenagers  72 percent of the 1404 participants  chose longacting birth control And it had an enormous effectPregnancy and abortion rates plunged to less than a quarter the rates of sexually experienced teenagers nationally the group most comparable to those in the study Rates were also significantly lower than those among all teenagersWhen they said it would stay in five years I was like yes that is what I need said Ms House who chose an IUD which she had not heard of before Now 25 a college graduate and a social worker she said it worked so well she has continued with the method Set it and forget it she addedThe study results published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine come days after the American Academy of Pediatrics the primary professional organization for pediatricians issued new guidelines urging doctors to recommend longaction reversible contraception over less effective methods to sexually active teenagersThe Affordable Care Act which generally guarantees coverage for all forms of contraception with no copay makes providing teenagers with free longacting contraceptives more achievable social policy experts saidBut there are practical obstacles Many pediatricians are not trained to insert implants or IUDs Isabel Sawhill a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution noted that insurance provided low rates for counseling which could affect some doctors willingness to spend time doing itAnd the idea that doctors should recommend longacting contraception to teenagers is almost certain to inflame the political and cultural debate over whether any teenagers should be encouraged to use contraception rather than simply being urged to abstain from sexIf it were universally adopted that would be a great thing because we would have far fewer people at risk for unintended pregnancy said Dr Irwin Redlener the president of the Childrens Health Fund and a pediatrics professor at Columbia University who was not involved with the research or the guidelines The problem is we immediately confront ideological and personal opinions whether or not even promotion of these efforts would be encouraging sexual behavior I think youre going to see a lot of pushback hereDr Den Trumbull the president of the American College of Pediatricians which takes an abstinenceonly position criticized the academys new guidelines as another effort to promote the myth of safe sex while ignoring the dire consequences that early sexual activity can have among the young people involvedPrivacy could also be an issue for a broader population of teenagers In the study 14 to 17yearolds were asked to provide parental consent meaning most of their parents were supportiveMs House who was 18 when she joined the study said her mother was kind of weirded out about it but agreed when she said Mom do you want me to carry a baby for nine months and raise it or do you want me to have birth controlMost states do not require parental consent and the new academy guidelines recommend confidentiality beginning in early adolescence something abstinenceonly groups like Dr Trumbulls object toDr Eileen Costello a Boston pediatrician works at a clinic where midwives can readily put in longacting methods But she said most of our kids coming in dont want their parents to know That can make them less willing to choose longacting methods which can cause bleeding for several months something mothers might notice she saidYounger teenagers who we know are at highest risk often resist longeracting methods because IUD insertion can be painful and theyre freaked out by the idea of an implanted device in their body Dr Costello saidThe new study conducted at Washington University in St Louis involved teenagers at high risk for unintended pregnancy because they were sexually active or were planning to be within six months About 18 percent had had an abortion and 60 percent were using no birth control or using withdrawal or condoms  all methods with failure rates of more than 15 percent said an author of the study Dr Jeffrey Peipert an obstetrics and gynecology professorDr Peipert said that because longacting contraceptives have failure rates of less than 1 percent they were discussed with teenagers before enrolling and as the first options listed As further encouragement the clinic could usually put in the implants or IUDs right awayThe yearly pregnancy rate in the study was 34 per 1000 teenagers and the abortion rate was 97 per 1000 Pregnancy and abortion rates for sexually experienced teenagers nationally were far higher  1585 and 415 in 2008 For all teenagers the pregnancy and abortion rates were 574 and 147 in 2010Teenagers using longacting methods also stuck with them longer most of them for at least two yearsLike most contraceptive methods longacting ones do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases In previously published research involving 7700 females who were 14 to 45 researchers found little evidence that those who used them became more sexually active and found no indication of increased sexually transmitted diseasesAlthough teenage pregnancy rates have declined they continue to worry experts especially because teenage pregnancy often impedes women from rising out of povertyDr Mary Ott an author of the new guidelines for pediatricians said they reflected broad agreementPediatricians are a practical lot she said They know that many adolescents will chose to be sexually active know that teen pregnancy is a serious threat to health and wellbeing and are generally willing to support newer approaches as long as there are safety and effectiveness dataHannah a participant in the St Louis study who did not want her last name used said she chose an IUD because she was in a monogamous relationship was in college and wanted to break the cycle of poverty in my familyShes 26 and married now Having an IUD it might sound really corny she said but I think its empowering,20141002,abortion

think on the top issues of the election cycleTHE ECONOMYThe nations economic blues remain at the top of voters list of important issues Asked to name the nations biggest problem 19 percent cite the economy significantly higher than the 12 percent who name the next highest issue on the list terrorism and national security Among all adults 4 in 10 approve of President Barack Obamas handling of the issue a figure thats held steady since late last yearLikely voters give Republicans a narrow edge as the party more trusted to handle the economy 36 percent to 31 percent who favor the Democrats approach But six years after impressions of the economy took a negative turn from which public opinion has never recovered a sizable 22 percent say they trust neither party on the issue Overall 62 percent of likely voters describe the economy as poor about the same as at this point in 2012 but better than 2010 when 79 percent of likely voters said it was in bad shapeHEALTH CAREMany expected Obamas signature domestic policy initiative to become a central topic in this years campaigns but the voters are less interested Though 8 in 10 call health care an important issue for them personally when asked to name the top issue facing the country just 5 percent of likely voters named health carePublic opinion on the law has been stagnant since the rollout of the state insurance exchanges a year ago Overall 25 percent of adults say they support the health care program 40 percent oppose it and 34 percent are neutral About 6 in 10 say the law itself has been more of a failure than a success  Among likely voters theres more support for the health care overhaul 30 percent but also more opposition 47 percentThose likely voters who call health care an extremely important issue are more closely divided than others on how the laws been working though still fall mainly on the negative side of the line 45 percent say its been a success while 54 percent call it a failureIMMIGRATIONAbout twothirds of likely voters call illegal immigration a serious problem for the United States today and 8 percent name immigration or border security as the top issue facing the nation Only 35 percent say they approve of Obamas handling of the issueVoters are generally in favor of providing a legal way for illegal immigrants already in the United States to become citizens 53

percent favor it along with 37 percent of independent likely votersTHE THREAT OF TERRORISMAbout 8 in 10 likely voters say terrorism is a key issue for them with Republicans more apt than Democrats to consider it important Overall 83 percent of Republicans say the issue is important compared with 72 percent of Democrats Similarly 87 percent of Republicans consider the threat posed by the Islamic State group an important issue compared with 75 percent of Democrats And although some have raised the possibility of securityfocused women as a key to the election there is no difference by gender on the importance of the issueRepublicans have a 16point advantage among likely voters as the party more trusted to protect the country 39 percent vs 23 percent and its one issue where the parties havent lost quite as much faith among the public Just 16 percent say they trust neither party to keep the nation safe the lowest share on any issue tested in the pollSOCIAL ISSUESDemocrats hold their strongest advantages in the poll on issues such as abortion or samesex marriage yet these same issues land near the bottom of voters priority lists Asked in an openended question to name the most important issue currently facing the US neither issue scored even 1 percent of responses When asked how important each issue was personally 43 percent of likely voters ranked abortion an important one 32 percent said that about samesex marriageFemale likely voters are more likely to call both issues important On abortion 47 percent of women consider it important compared with 38 percent of men and

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/01/us/ap-us-governor-wisconsin.html,MADISON Wis   The airwaves and campaign appearances in the closely contested governors race here are bristling with charges over whether the incumbent did enough to create jobs in the state and whether the challenger is an outoftouch liberal and other arguments designed to sway opinions before Election DayTheres just one complication For nearly everyone in Wisconsin the only issue is Scott Walker And almost every voter already knows whether they love him or hate himWhile there are 36 governors races on the ballot across the country this fall Wisconsins is the rare one where the campaign seems almost moot with weeks to go the undecided are almost nonexistent and the ground to be won hard to findThe odd condition testifies to the traumatic way the conservative reform movement played out in Wisconsin after Republicans won power across the Midwest in 2010 The years since have not assuaged bitter feelings left from massive protests a recall election and the smashing defeat of new governor Walkers opponentsA Marquette University Law School poll released Wednesday showed Walker with a slight 58point lead over Democratic challenger Mary Burke just beyond the polls 41point margin of error It marked the first time since March that either candidate had an edge larger than the margin of error Only 5 percent were undecided or said they would vote for someone other than Walker or BurkeIn a typical race about 10 percent of voters are undecided said Bill Christopherson a Democratic strategist with nearly 30 years experienceIve never seen one where no one was undecided Christopherson said Apparently theyre not persuadable unless something happens to change the dynamicThe Marquette poll showed an equal number of registered voters  47 percent  had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Walker Only 6 percent had no opinionThe politician who stirs such emotions is relatively mild mannered  not brash like New Jersey Gov Chris Christie or effusive like former Wisconsin Republican Gov Tommy Thompson Even in private emails released in recent court proceedings Walker doesnt deviate from the Grated language of the Eagle Scout and small town preachers son he isHe is Wisconsin nice said Republican strategist Mark Graul Hes like a lot of people you know who are your neighbors and friendsBut Walkers Boy Scout manner only seems to rankle his detractors moreIt doesnt really matter what his demeanor is Hes not trustworthy said Madison artist Diana Lakes who is among those who see Walker as a rightwing ideologue and tool of the Koch BrothersI cant stand Scott Walker said Democratic voter Ilana Pestcoe 55 an occupational therapist from the small village of Gays Mills near the Iowa border Pestcoe said she doesnt love Mary Burke but that the alternative is horrorOther conservatives who won office in 2010 also promoted probusiness policies cut budgets and challenged organized labor But Walkers decision to ram his plan through in a matter of weeks before his opponents and others got used to the idea has helped make this election a oneman referendumWhat Walkers detractors hate about him is what his admirers like the most his sheer confidenceI think theres a lot of politicians that say theyre going to do something but when he says it he does it said Marian Krumberger a retired social worker of Green BayHes very genuine Hes not artificial she said I dont think it creates a divide its more of a unifying factorIn his first term Walker addressed a 36 billion state budget shortfall in part by ending public employee bargaining rights He also pushed through a long list of GOP priorities including concealed carry expanded school vouchers tighter abortion restrictions and less stringent environmental regulations for a mining projectWalker said he thinks any persuadable voters would be interested in his secondterm plans to cut income and property taxes freeze college tuition and require drug testing for welfare and unemployment applicantsThey want action They dont want the gridlock you see in Washington Walker said in an interviewBurke and Walker have spent much of the summer arguing over his inability to create the 250000 private sector jobs he promised Both national parties and major independent groups are spending heavily on the race In one week alone in September the Republican Governors Association and the NRA ran 525000 in ads for Walker First Lady Michelle Obama and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie were stumping in the state on MondayBurke a former executive for Trek Bicycles a company founded by her father argues that she has better training for managing the states economy which is still hampered by lost manufacturing jobsWisconsin has everything it takes to be a thriving top ten economy but under Governor Walker were lagging behind Burke said in a statementThe race likely will come down to which side can turn out

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/01/world/americas/ap-lt-brazil-election-religion.html,RIO DE JANEIRO   Brazils rapid religious transformation is reverberating through the countrys tight presidential race where abortion and gay marriage have emerged as hotbutton issues and Pentecostal televangelists are political power brokersThe socially conservative Pentecostal population now includes more than onefifth of the electorate just three decades after barely registering any presence at all That change has the secularminded incumbent quoting Psalms while her Biblereading rival has repeatedly stressed her belief in a secular state to avoid alienating liberal voters ahead of Sundays firstround voteDuring a recent service at his 6000seat Assemblies of God church in a gritty Rio de Janeiro neighborhood Brazils most influential Pentecostal pastor spent half of the service talking about the election nudging voters to support top opposition candidate Marina Silva who is also a member of the Assemblies of God by far Brazils largest Pentecostal denominationIf Silva makes it to the second round and defeats incumbent Dilma Rousseff in an expected Oct 26 runoff she would become the first Pentecostal leader of a country with more Catholics than any otherA pastor isnt the owner of anybodys ballot I dont have a band of angels who can peek over your shoulder in the voting booth said Silas Malafaia his face looming on two jumbo TV screens bookending the enormous stage where he paced But youve got to vote your conscience Dont just give your vote away Vote against the corrupt and those who want to destroy the familyMalafaia alone has 800000 followers on Twitter books that have sold in the millions and sermons beamed around the globe He is part of a rapidly swelling movement that is strongly rooted among poorer Brazilians a group that otherwise heavily favors Rousseffs Workers Party which has lifted millions from poverty with expansive social welfare programs and the creation of millions of new jobsIn a survey released Friday the Datafolha polling group found that 54 percent of Pentecostal voters would support Silva in an expected secondround vote while Rousseff was favored by 38 percent Among the population as a whole the two were in a statistical tie Datafolha polled 11474 people across Brazil on Sept 2526 and the margin of error was 2 percentage pointsBut in a Datafolha poll released Tuesday night Rousseff had pulled ahead of Silva in a secondround vote leading 49to41 A breakdown of a secondround vote by religion was not yet availableRousseff a former Marxist guerrilla who was imprisoned and tortured during Brazils military dictatorship rarely spoke of religion before this campaign but she has been making the rounds of Pentecostal churches and invoking Gods name of lateIn August she spoke to hundreds of Pentecostals in Sao Paulo at an Assemblies of God church by far the biggest Protestant denomination in the countryIm opening my remarks by saying that the Brazilian state is secular Rousseff said to a silent crowdBut citing the Psalm of David Id like to say that Joyful is the nation whose God is the Lord she immediately added to loud applauseBy contrast the deeply religious Silva has made no campaign stops in churches and has kept Pentecostal leaders at arms length in public hoping to combat suspicions among nonreligious voters that conservative pastors could shape the stance a Silva government would have on social issuesThose worries intensified when her official platform reversed support for gay marriage less than 24 hours after its release last month following blistering attacks on the proposal from Malafaia and other Pentecostal leaders Silva supports Brazils current law allowing samesex civil unions which gives gay partners the same rights as heterosexual couples but stops short of supporting religious weddings for gaysAs an impoverished daughter of a rubber tapper deep in the Amazon Silva wanted to become a nun and as a teenager moved into a convent where she first learned to read and write at age 16 There she came into contact with priests adhering to liberation theology a Latin Americaninspired movement that advocates for the poorBut in 1997 facing extreme health problems after five bouts with malaria as a girl and hepatitis as a teenager Silva converted to the Pentecostal faith upon being told by a doctor that only a miracle could help her The doctor himself phoned his pastor to speak with the thensenatorFor some Silvas mixed religious background could be a political assetMarina is in a really nice position where she got Malafaia the rock star pastor of the Assemblies of God to back her so she probably feels like a lot of her evangelical support is solidified said Andrew Chesnut a professor and expert on Latin American religions at Virginia Commonwealth University who has focused on Brazils Pentecostals And the fact she was involved with liberationist Catholicism  means more progressive Catholics will sympathize with herBut when it comes time to cast their ballot Brazilian Pentecostals who are overwhelmingly poor will face a dilemma in choosing between Silva a woman who shares their faith and their gratitude to Rousseffs Workers Party for the countrys socioeconomic advances in the last 12 yearsMichelle Jeronimo a 22yearold heading into Malafaias service last week said Silva would get the backing of Pentecostals because she would maintain Gods posture in the face of widely perceived government dishonestyPentecostals are so disappointed with the corruption with the broken promises so theyre looking to this Pentecostal side of her Jeronimo said adding that Silva will fulfill what she said what she promised what she said she intends to doBut Silre Noguiera handing out campaign fliers for Pentecostal congressional candidates outside Malafaias church looked over her shoulders before whispering where her political allegiance layThe Workers Party governments are the only ones that ever did anything for the poor Dilma has my vote she said Im not convinced most Pentecostals will vote based on religion At the end of the day they want a president wholl give them a better life___,20141001,abortion
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/upshot/democrats-are-spending-more-on-the-ground-in-key-senate-races.html,With a strong possibility that Democrats could lose control of the Senate in the midterm elections they are investing heavily in voter turnout effortsIn states too close to call like Alaska Colorado Iowa and North Carolina Democrats are making much greater investments in the ground game than RepublicansNot all spending is captured in Federal Election Commission data but the spending trends are clear The Democrats spending advantage is greatest in states where theyve had time to organize and plan for competitive races and they are using that edge to register new voters publicize absentee and early voting options and of course make sure supporters actually go to the polls on Election Day The efforts extend to states where the Republicans more recently made Senate contests more competitive like MichiganDemocrats have invested several million dollars in both North Carolina and Colorado for this ground game Republican spending in those states so far has tended to focus on broadcast advertisements and direct mailThat edge extends to Alaska where the Democratic incumbent Mark Begich faces Dan Sullivan Combined Democratic independent groups party committees and Mr Begichs campaign have already spent nearly 10 times more than Republicans on wages and expenses for local staffers getoutthevote efforts and other field operationsThe state Democratic Party alone has spent at least 763687 on voter turnout and staffing this year which amounts to 145 for every citizen over 18 in the state By comparison the more than 1 million the Wake County Democratic Party has spent on voter turnout and staffing in North Carolina this year works out to 15 cents for every potential voterIn Iowa the state Democratic Party has spent more than 872000 in ground operations part of a substantial advantage that Democrats have over Republicans in that state The party has paid the salaries of at least 148 people in the current election cycle according to data through the end of August The Republican Party of Iowa had 11 people on its federal campaign payroll in AugustThe Republican candidate Joni Ernst had spent less than 40000 on paid staff through June Ms Ernst faces Representative Bruce Braley in the race to succeed Tom Harkin a Democrat who is retiring Iowa remains a tossup race according to Leo The Upshots Senate forecasting model with Ms Ernst taking the lead in the latest pollsMichigan is a rare exception There the two state parties have spent roughly similar amounts on staff through the end of August Democratic outside spending on field operations has been less than in other key states while Republicans have invested in field spendingThe Upshot determined ground game totals by adding up itemized expenditures on nonWashington staffers and spending specifically described as being for inperson voter contact and canvassing purposes This includes mileage and per diem expenses for field staff and a few other smaller items like materials for doortodoor campaigning The largest amounts went to campaign staffThis isnt a perfect measure because some descriptions of spending are vague or include different categories and not every staffer is engaged in voter contact In addition candidate spending is through June 30 while party spending covers this year through the end of August and independent expenditure data includes general election spending through late September Taken as a whole however the Democratic lead in this area is clearOutside groups working on behalf of Democratic candidates have extended the advantage Super PACs environmental organizations and abortion rights groups have spent more than 48 million on ground activity in Senate races in Alaska Colorado Iowa Michigan and North Carolina Republicanleaning groups have kicked in only 369000The amount spent to help GOP candidates doesnt include field work by Americans for Prosperity and other political nonprofits that do not have to report their spending Americans for Prosperity does report some of its broadcast advertisements but Federal Election Commission rules do not require disclosure of ground operations or direct mail Although much of its spending represents broadcast ads it also has more than doubled its field staff compared with the 2010 elections Even if it decided to spend several million dollars in a race it could not coordinate its work with a party or campaign the same rule applies to super PACs A spokesman for Americans for Prosperity did not respond to a request for commentThe Democrats advantage in field work investment doesnt guarantee victory in any of the closest races and the continued focus on television and radio spending by Republicans and their backers may be enough to carry them to a Senate majority in an electoral climate favorable to themIn Alaska Colorado Iowa and North Carolina the number of network television spots is split roughly evenly between the two sides according to data compiled by Echelon Insights a Republican digital consulting firm In Michigan the number of ads favors the Democratic candidate Representative Gary Peters by a 7030 margin over his opponent Terri Lynn Land the former Michigan secretary of stateSpending on field operations is still a fraction of the amount that goes to television and other forms of advertising and campaigns are reluctant to take money away from trying to reach mass audiences even if its unclear in many cases how many persuadable voters broadcast advertisements reachDuring the past week at least two Republican super PACs reported spending more than 13 million on television ads opposing Mr Peters The Conservation Voters of Michigan meanwhile reported more than 245000 in payments for canvassers supporting Mr Peters through doortodoor contact,20140930,abortion
