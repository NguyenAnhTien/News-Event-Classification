He is also expected to make a stop in New York.","VATICAN CITY   Pope Francis confirmed Monday that he will make his first papal visit to the United States in September to attend an international meeting in Philadelphia on the theme of family, as part of an American journey that is also expected to include a stop in New York.Francis has already traveled to the Middle East, Albania, South Korea, Brazil and elsewhere in his 20-month papacy, and his visit to the United States will come at a pivotal moment for the Roman Catholic Church. Weeks later, bishops are scheduled to hold a critical meeting at the Vatican that could make final changes in the churchs stance on issues like homosexuality and divorcees receiving communion.I wish to confirm, according to the wishes of the Lord, that in September of 2015, I will go to Philadelphia for the World Meeting of Families, Francis said Monday as he opened a conference at the Vatican on the theme of marriage.The trip may include a stop in New York. Archbishop Bernardito Auza, the head of the Holy Sees permanent observer mission to the United Nations, told The Associated Press last week, If he comes to Philadelphia, he will come to New York.But the Vaticans spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said that only the stop in Philadelphia had been confirmed.Philadelphia is the only public engagement of the trip to the United States as of now, Father Lombardi said. The pope intentionally didnt mention any other possible stops.Francis visit to Philadelphia is expected to draw as many as a million people to a Mass on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in the heart of the city.I am overjoyed by Pope Francis announcement that he will join with us for the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia next year, Archbishop Charles J. Chaput of Philadelphia said. A hallmark of his papacy has been a keen focus on the many challenges that families face today globally. His charisma, presence and voice will electrify the gathering.Pope Francis said in August that he hoped to visit the United States in 2015 for the meeting in Philadelphia, the Catholic News Agency reported. At the time, he said he had also received invitations from President Obama, the United States Congress and Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations, the agency said.Francis is a popular figure among Catholics in the United States, where his humble style of leadership has won him wide admiration.In March, the pope met with President Obama at the Vatican, where the two avoided controversial social issues and instead talked about the plight of the worlds poor, the protracted conflict in Syria and the search for global peace. Mr. Obama has come under criticism from Catholic bishops over abortion and the requirement under the Affordable Care Act that some religion-based groups provide access to contraception for employees.",2014-11-18,abortion

Video games have toyed with that idea for many years, and a new interactive historical epic called Assassins Creed Rogue tries it once again.In this game, you theoretically turn full-on bad guy. The man you control, an 18th-century Irishman named Shay Patrick Cormac, switches allegiance from the freedom-loving Assassins, the good guys of this popular series, to the Templars, their nemeses. Well be the enemy this time. Well hunt Assassins.Most big-budget video games present more heroic fantasies. Be the righteous American soldier. Be the treasure hunter. Be the heavyweight champion. Be Batman. Succeed.To play as a bona fide bad guy in a game is rare, not that this is quite what is happening in Rogue or its sister game, Assassins Creed Unity, which was released on the same day last week by Ubisoft. Both games still allow players to feel like the good guy.In Unity, youre Arno Dorian, an Assassin who at times crosses his flawed order. He does it for the woman he loves, a Templar. Its a fitting plot for a game set in Paris at the time of the French Revolution, itself a drama of faltering ideals. The vividly rendered city brings the strife home, with its thousands of computer-controlled protesters packing the squares, its to-scale landmarks and its walk-on appearances by Robespierre and Napoleon.In Rogue, were overt rebels. Cormac sneers at his orders double standards. The Assassins help free slaves from the French in Haiti while they help the French crown in the North Atlantic. Later, he deems his brotherhood guilty of an atrocity that kills hundreds of innocent people. Soon, under the players control, he is attacking the very characters weve sided with in so many Assassins Creed games before.In both Unity and Rogue, we are at least shaken from the moral certitude gamers can usually assume justifies their efforts. Few games, especially the blockbusters, ask players to consider that theyre wrong or to feel good about what theyre doing while identifying with an unsavory group. But they could. Think of games as potential engines of empathy, transporting players into the shoes of those with whom theyd usually disagree.Eight years ago, the game designer and critic Ian Bogost imagined an abortion video game that might do something like that. It would be made up of mini-games, each about an aspect of the abortion debate. One might be about being a teenage mother, another about testing how a city would run if all birth control were illegal. Each game would be weighted to favor one side of the issue. The overarching abortion game would detect how the player felt about the issues and serve up a mini-game that would most challenge the position and then another to challenge that one. This isnt a game that changes your opinion, he had said at the time, but tells you why people have the opinion they do.Mr. Bogost never made his game, but in the years since, weve seen the occasional interactive experiment in experiencing a different perspective. The most notorious and disturbing might be the No Russian level in the 2009 blockbuster Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. The game let players control an undercover American agent who was embedded with a terrorist group as it massacred civilians in an airport. That mission was skippable, and some players reported playing it nauseously, their virtual rifles pointed to the ground. More nobly, the 2012 Assassins Creed III let players experience the American Revolution through the eyes and behind the tomahawk of a half-Mohawk Assassin. Our playable hero buddied up with Sam Adams and mostly killed redcoats but also raged at the callous treatment of his people by that most unconventional of big-budget video game antagonists, George Washington.A problem that designers face, however, is that even if you are going against your own values and beliefs, the games need to feel, to some extent, good. Its not an aspirational thing. Its tactile. The actions that players take  the percussion of fingers on controller buttons, the responsiveness of what then happens on the screen  need to be satisfying, like the plucking of a guitar string to sound a note or the smashing of a hammer against a nail to strengthen a frame. A well-programmed game makes the landing of a plane, the construction of a castle, the firing of a machine gun or even the slashing of a sword through an orcs neck in some way pleasing to the virtual touch.Rogues solution to this problem is novel. It takes what used to feel good for Assassins Creed players and puts it in the computer-controlled hands of our newfound Assassin enemies. They can perform the signature moves we ourselves used in earlier Assassins Creed games. Now it is you, as Cormac, who must worry about Assassins jumping down from the rooftops to stab you or leaping out of a cart of hay to suffocate you.The creators of Assassins Creed Rogue send a clear signal to players: You did that kind of thing before to someone like the character youre controlling now and felt good about it. You feel righteous now. Maybe you werent the good guys before, after all.",2014-11-17,abortion
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/opinion/sunday/delusions-of-the-democrats.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/16/sunday-review/16BAKER/16BAKER-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg,Delusions of the Democrats,Demographics will not save them. A vision might.,"DEMOGRAPHICS is not enough.For years now, its been an article of faith among Democrats that the future belongs to them, thanks to the countrys changing demographic mix. The rising percentage of voters who are women, Americans of color and especially Latinos were always about to turn the country deep blue.I never believed this  largely because I have been hearing it since 1971. That was the year the 26th Amendment passed, lowering the voting age to 18. Democrats had already been the dominant political party since the 1930s, and now with young people getting the vote, a permanent Democratic majority was guaranteed, right?The future failed to arrive on time again this fall. Democrats lost all over America, and they lost big, by much wider margins than predicted. They lost statewide races in the Midwest where Democrats have won repeatedly in presidential elections for more than 20 years. They lost in races against radical right-wing Republicans they might have been expected to defeat, like Sam Brownback in Kansas and Paul R. LePage in Maine.Nor was this months election an anomaly. It was the third disastrous midterm for Democrats in the past 20 years. The party suffered similar or even worse losses at all levels of government in 1994 and 2010, along with a lesser catastrophe in 2002. It now holds fewer elected offices at both the federal and state level than it has at any time since the 1920s.Democratic tacticians maintain that things will be different in 2016, when their base will go to the polls in greater numbers, and when demographics  again  will render the country less white, more Latin and more female. They blame this latest meltdown on terrible candidates, administration flubs and foreign crises. They argue that voters favored Democratic positions in state referendums, from a higher minimum wage to abortion rights and legal marijuana.In other words: Problem, what problem? We Democrats are in great shape, if only we could turn out our base, find good candidates, deal with crises efficiently or get people to vote our way even when they agree with us.The accepted wisdom is that the Democrats hamstrung themselves many years ago, when they passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and thereby lost the Solid South forever. Its a nice story, one that allows everyone to feel good: liberal Democrats, who would like to believe their party was martyred in as noble a cause as there could be, and Clinton-Obama Democrats, who have long cited it as proof that the party needs to move to the right and start appealing to conservative Southern whites again.The only trouble is, its not true.Yes, the South was never solid for Democrats again after 1964, and the party lost five of six presidential elections from 1968 to 1988. But at every other level of government, Democrats remained highly competitive, even dominant, in the South for years to come.Going into the 1994 elections, Democrats still held 16 of the 30 United States Senate seats from the 15 Southern states (which I define as the 11 states of the Confederacy, plus Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri and West Virginia), and nearly two-thirds of the Southern seats in the House. On a state level, the figures were even more one-sided. Democrats held 12 of the 15 Southern governorships, and 29 of the 30 state legislative chambers.Its only in the last two decades that these numbers flipped. In the next Congress, fewer than a third of the Souths representatives will be Democrats; if Mary Landrieu loses her seat in Louisiana, there will be seven Democratic senators in the region. Democrats there will hold four governorships and both chambers in just one legislature.Democrats did lose the South, but they didnt lose it because of the Civil Rights Act. Instead of waiting for all those mean old Southern white men to die, Democrats might be better off asking themselves why so many of them were still voting Democratic just 22 years ago.Nor have Democratic losses in the South been much worse than they were all over the country. To give just one egregious example, Democrats lost the Massachusetts statehouse this year  for the fifth time in their last seven tries.This is a historic shift. From 1931 to 1995, Democrats held majorities in the House of Representatives for all but four years and in the Senate for all but 12. On the state level, they held their own with (or outnumbered) Republicans in governorships and state legislatures for the vast majority of those 64 years.Its been a completely different story since 1994, however, and by next January, Democrats will not only be in the minority in both houses of Congress. They will likely hold 18 statehouses and both chambers in only 11 state legislatures.Suffering a series of historic defeats is not a sign that youre winning. The Democrats no longer please anyone much, neither their depressed base nor the less committed. Meanwhile, Republicans still manage to portray them as wild-eyed socialists. The party does take the White House more often now, but at the state level, and in the midterms, when a third of the senators and all representatives are up for election, the party has been hollowed out.THE trouble was that the Clinton-Obama strategy got things upside down from the start. Why try to cast yourselves as economic moderates and cultural progressives when the disparate elements of your coalition have little in common culturally, but are all struggling with the same wretched economy?The Democratic Party that shot to some 50 years of overwhelming electoral success beginning in the 1930s was helped in part by changing demographics. But many of those who built what George Packer calls the Roosevelt Republic started out as Republicans. Or Bull Moose Progressives, or Populists, or Socialists, or Communists, or simply the politically alienated and disengaged.The people who built that party rallied around big things  and usually big things they had come up with themselves. The reforms that Democrats embraced were almost all culled from grass-roots movements, and they were big enough to erase the lines between cultural and economic issues.Electrifying large swaths of the South and West changed how people lived and worked every day, how their cities grew and their farms survived. The G.I. Bill, to take another of a thousand examples, was intended to reward veterans and stave off a postwar depression, but it also opened up new possibilities of learning and travel (and therefore work) for millions of young men. This blurring of the cultural and the economic includes the civil rights legislation of the 1960s, which threw the weight of the federal government behind the struggle of African-Americans to go about their daily lives with hope and dignity and which did not alienate every white person in the South.Todays Democratic Party, with its finely calibrated, top-down fixes, does not offer anything so transformative. It seems scared of its own shadow, which is probably why it keeps reassuring itself that its triumph is inevitable. It needs instead to fully acknowledge just how devastating the recession was for working people everywhere in America, and what a generation of largely flat wages did to their aspirations even before that. It needs to take on hard fights, even against powerful forces, like pharmaceutical and insurance companies that presume to tell us the limits of what our health care can be or energy companies that would tell us what the worlds climate can endure. It means carving out a place of respect for working men and women in our globalized, finance-driven world.Invite us to dream a little. You dont build an enduring coalition out of who Americans are. You do it out of what we can be.",2014-11-16,abortion

Can Court the Working Class,"A new Republican economic approach could still revolve around cutting taxes, but the cuts would no longer be focused on the affluent.","A defining feature of Republican economic policy for decades has been its benefits for the well off. The stated goals of that policy have been to shrink government and lift economic growth, but the main method has been cutting taxes much more for high-income families than others. At the same time, the party has opposed an expansion of health insurance for low- and middle-income families, increases in the minimum wage and college financial aid and extensions of jobless benefits.The countrys voting patterns largely reflect these stances, despite all the talk about the conservative white working class or affluent liberal elites. Democrats handily won voters with family incomes below $50,000 in this years midterm elections, and Republicans handily won those with incomes above $100,000. The same has been true in nearly every national election for the last two decades.One of the most intriguing questions heading into the 2016 presidential campaign is how serious Republicans are about trying to change this situation.They certainly seem to have an opportunity. The American economy isnt working very well for most families, with median income still well below its 2000 peak. The great 21st-century wage slowdown may not be President Obamas fault, but he hasnt solved it either, and voters often punish the presidents party during tough economic times.Its also clear that some Republican voices favor a shift. The group of policy analysts and writers known as reform conservatives talks about something called libertarian populism. Some elected officials have also nodded in this direction. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida recently spoke, in decidedly un-Republican language, about the rising struggles of our working-class families.A new Republican economic approach could still revolve around cutting taxes, but the cuts would no longer be focused on the affluent. I would expect to see a marriage of sorts between shrinking government and helping the middle class, said Michael R. Strain of the American Enterprise Institute. Specifically, several conservatives, including Conn Carroll of Townhall.com and Timothy P. Carney of The Washington Examiner, have called for a cut in the payroll tax, which helps pay for Medicare and Social Security. Though it receives less attention, 63 percent of taxpayers pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes.Policies aside, there is no question that the Republican candidates in 2016 will claim to be allies of the middle class. Mark Hemingway, of The Weekly Standard, wrote last week on Twitter that he worried about nominating Jeb Bush or Mitt Romney, because neither would easily be able to run *hard* against Hillary the elitist. Republicans with more of a middle-class image include Mr. Rubio and three Midwestern governors: John Kasich of Ohio, Mike Pence of Indiana and Scott Walker of Wisconsin.Stylistic appeals are nothing new, of course. The new Republican Party I am speaking about, Ronald Reagan said, in 1977, is going to have room for the man and the woman in the factories, for the farmer, for the cop on the beat. George W. Bush, in his 2000 convention speech, promised tax credits for low-income Americans.On cultural issues, like guns and abortion, the modern Republican Party has indeed pursued policies favored by large numbers of middle-income families. On economic issues, though, the partys policies still summon the country club-big business image that Mr. Reagan decried in 1977. Under the Reagan administration, the average total federal tax rate for the richest one-10,000th of taxpayers fell to 35 percent, from 60 percent. Mr. Bushs administration did cut taxes for middle- and low-income families, but by vastly less than for the top 1 percent.The theory behind such tax cuts was always that they would help everyone, by lifting economic growth. Its not a crazy theory, either. It just doesnt seem to hold. The Reagan tax cuts may well have spurred growth, because they reduced rates from levels that today are unthinkably high. But the economy grew more slowly under Mr. Bush than under Bill Clinton or even Mr. Obama, both of whom raised taxes on the affluent. And perhaps more relevant than history, most Americans favor higher taxes on the well off, polls show.The question for Republicans in 2016 is whether to leave their economic approach largely unchanged and hope they can win anyway  or to try something new. A payroll-tax cut would be one option. Another would be an income-tax cut focused on something other than the top marginal rate. Beyond taxes, the party could propose market-friendly ways to make college more affordable, such as changing accreditation rules, as Mr. Rubio favors.The party that wins the next election, said Stuart Stevens, the longtime Republican consultant who was Mr. Romneys chief strategist, will be the one that speaks best to how to help people economically.For now, the evidence of a new Republican approach is modest, but not absent. In 2012, Mr. Romney did not propose a tax cut for the affluent. More recently, two different tax-overhaul plans  one from Mr. Rubio and Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican; another from Representative Dave Camp, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee  have paid considerable attention to middle-income families. Both plans would still benefit millionaires most, according to the Tax Policy Center. But they also contain ideas that dont depend on high-end tax cuts.No matter what, Democrats are sure to paint Republicans as the party of the rich. For one thing, Democrats will be able to point out that the middle class and poor depend on government programs, like Medicare and Social Security, funded by tax dollars.But it would be a mistake to dismiss the intra-Republican debate as mere theater. Yes, government programs tend to help middle- and low-income families more than the rich. On the other hand, many government programs dont work as well as they were meant to. There is certainly a coherent argument for letting the middle class and poor keep more of their income, rather than paying for inefficient government programs.It would be downright refreshing if some portion of the 2016 campaign revolved around that argument and the counterargument. After 15 years of slow-growing incomes, the country would have itself a presidential campaign reflecting economic realities.",2014-11-16,abortion

But outside public view, changes in policies and tactics over the last decade have resulted in undercover teams run by agencies in virtually every corner of the federal government, according to officials, former agents and documents.Some agency officials say such operations give them a powerful new tool to gather evidence in ways that standard law enforcement methods do not offer, leading to more prosecutions. But the broadened scope of undercover work, which can target specific individuals or categories of possible suspects, also raises concerns about civil liberties abuses and entrapment of unwitting targets. It has also resulted in hidden problems, with money gone missing, investigations compromised and agents sometimes left largely on their own for months.Done right, undercover work can be a very effective law enforcement method, but it carries serious risks and should only be undertaken with proper training, supervision and oversight, said Michael German, a former F.B.I. undercover agent who is a fellow at New York Universitys law school. Ultimately it is government deceitfulness and participation in criminal activity, which is only justifiable when it is used to resolve the most serious crimes.Some of the expanded undercover operations have resulted from heightened concern about domestic terrorism since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.But many operations are not linked to terrorism. Instead, they reflect a more aggressive approach to growing criminal activities like identity theft, online solicitation and human trafficking, or a push from Congress to crack down on more traditional crimes.At convenience stores, for example, undercover agents, sometimes using actual minors as decoys, look for illegal alcohol and cigarette sales, records show. At the Education Department, undercover agents of the Office of Inspector General infiltrate federally funded education programs looking for financial fraud. Medicare investigators sometimes pose as patients to gather evidence against health care providers. Officers at the Small Business Administration, NASA and the Smithsonian do undercover work as well, records show.Part of the appeal of undercover operations, some officials say, is that they can be an efficient way to make a case.Were getting the information directly from the bad guys  what more could you want? said Thomas Hunker, a former police chief in Bal Harbour, Fla., whose department worked with federal customs and drug agents on hundreds of undercover money-laundering investigations in recent years.Mr. Hunker said sending federal and local agents undercover to meet with suspected money launderers is a more direct approach than getting a tip and going out and doing all the legwork and going into a court mode.We dont have to go back and interview witnesses and do search warrants and surveillance and all that, he added.But the undercover work also led federal auditors to criticize his department for loose record-keeping and financial lapses, and Mr. Hunker was fired last year amid concerns about the operations.A Critical ToolMost undercover investigations never become public, but when they do, they can prove controversial. This month, James B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I., was forced to defend the bureaus tactics after it was disclosed that an agent had posed as an Associated Press reporter in 2007 in trying to identify the source of bomb threats at a Lacey, Wash., high school. Responding to criticism from news media advocates, Mr. Comey wrote in a letter to The New York Times that every undercover operation involves deception, which has long been a critical tool in fighting crime.Just weeks before, the Drug Enforcement Administration stoked controversy after disclosures that an undercover agent had created a fake Facebook page from the photos of a young woman in Watertown, N.Y.  without her knowledge  to lure drug suspects.And in what became a major political scandal for the Obama administration, agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowed guns to slip into Mexico in 2011 in an operation known as Fast and Furious that involved undercover operations.In response to that episode, the Justice Department issued new guidelines to prosecutors last year designed to tighten oversight of undercover operations and other sensitive investigative techniques, officials said. Before prosecutors approve such tactics, the previously undisclosed guidelines require that they consider whether an operation identifies a clearly defined objective, whether it is truly necessary, whether it targets significant criminal actors or entities, and other factors, the officials said.Peter Carr, a department spokesman, said that undercover operations are necessary in investigating crime but that agents and prosecutors must follow safeguards. We encourage these operations even though they may involve some degree of risk, he said.Those guidelines apply only to the law enforcement agencies overseen by the Justice Department. Within the Treasury Department, undercover agents at the I.R.S., for example, appear to have far more latitude than do those at many other agencies. I.R.S. rules say that, with prior approval, an undercover employee or cooperating private individual may pose as an attorney, physician, clergyman or member of the news media.An I.R.S. spokesman acknowledged that undercover investigators are allowed to pose in such roles with approval from senior officials. But the agency said in a statement that senior officials are not aware of any investigations where special agents have ever posed as attorneys, physicians, members of the clergy or members of the press specifically to gain information from a privileged relationship.The agency declined to say whether I.R.S. undercover agents have posed in these roles in an effort to get information that was not considered privileged, meaning the type of confidential information someone shares with a lawyer or doctor.Jos Marrero, a former I.R.S. supervisor in Miami, said he knew of situations in which tax investigators needed to assume the identity of doctors to gain the trust of a medical professional and develop evidence that is tightly held.Its very rare that you do that, but it does happen, Mr. Marrero, who has a consulting firm in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and continues to work with federal agents on undercover investigations, said in an interview. These are very sensitive jobs, and theyre scrutinized more closely than others.Oversight, though, can be minimal. A special committee meant to oversee undercover investigations at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, for instance, did not meet in nearly seven years, according to the Justice Departments inspector general. That inquiry found that more than $127 million worth of cigarettes purchased by the bureau disappeared in a series of undercover investigations that were aimed at tracing the black-market smuggling of cigarettes.In one investigation, the bureau paid an undercover informant from the tobacco industry nearly $5 million in business expenses for his help in the case. (The agency gained new authority in 2004 allowing it to take money seized in undercover investigations and churn it back into future operations, a source of millions in revenue.)Financial oversight was found lacking in the I.R.S.s undercover operations as well. Detailed reviews of the money spent in some of its undercover operations took as long as four and a half years to complete, according to a 2012 review by the Treasury Departments inspector general.Wires CrossedAcross the federal government, undercover work has become common enough that undercover agents sometimes find themselves investigating a supposed criminal who turns out to be someone from a different agency, law enforcement officials said. In a few situations, agents have even drawn their weapons on each other before realizing that both worked for the federal government.There are all sorts of stories about undercover operations gone bad, Jeff Silk, a longtime undercover agent and supervisor at the Drug Enforcement Administration, said in an interview. People are always tripping and falling over each others cases.Mr. Silk, who retired this year, cited a case that he supervised in which the D.E.A. was wiretapping suspects in a drug ring in Atlanta, only to discover that undercover agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement were trying to infiltrate the same ring. The F.B.I. and the New York Police Department were involved in the case as well.To avoid such problems, officials said, they have tightened deconfliction policies, which are designed to alert agencies about one anothers undercover operations. But problems have persisted, the officials said.It is impossible to tell how effective the governments operations are or evaluate whether the benefits outweigh the costs, since little information about them is publicly disclosed. Most federal agencies declined to discuss the number of undercover agents they employed or the types of investigations they handled. The numbers are considered confidential and are not listed in public budget documents, and even Justice Department officials say they are uncertain how many agents work undercover.But current and former law enforcement officials said the number of federal agents doing such work appeared to total well into the thousands, with many agencies beefing up their ranks in recent years, or starting new undercover units. An intelligence official at the Department of Homeland Security, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss classified matters, said the agency alone spent $100 million annually on its undercover operations. With large numbers of undercover agents at the F.B.I. and elsewhere, the costs could reach hundreds of millions of dollars a year.In a sampling of such workers, an analysis of publicly available rsums showed that since 2001 more than 1,100 current or former federal employees across 40 agencies listed undercover work inside the United States as part of their duties. More than half of all the work they described is in pursuit of the illicit drug trade. Money laundering, gangs and organized crime investigations make up the second-largest group of operations.Significant growth in undercover work involves online activity, with agents taking to the Internet, posing as teenage girls to catch predators or intercepting emails and other messages, the documents noted. The F.B.I., Department of Homeland Security and Pentagon all have training programs for online undercover operations.Defendants who are prosecuted in undercover investigations often raise a defense of entrapment, asserting that agents essentially lured them into a criminal act, whether it is buying drugs from an undercover agent or providing fraudulent government services.But the entrapment defense rarely succeeds in court.In terrorism cases  the area in which the F.B.I. has used undercover stings most aggressively  prosecutors have a perfect record in defeating claims of entrapment. I challenge you to find one of those cases in which the defendant has been acquitted asserting that defense, Robert S. Mueller III, a former F.B.I. director, said at an appearance this year.The Times analysis showed that the military and its investigative agencies have almost as many undercover agents working inside the United States as does the F.B.I. While most of them are involved in internal policing of service members and defense contractors, a growing number are focused, in part, on the general public as part of joint federal task forces that combine military, intelligence and law enforcement specialists.At the Supreme Court, all of the courts more than 150 police officers are trained in undercover tactics, according to a federal law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity because it involved internal security measures. At large protests over issues like abortion, small teams of undercover officers mill about  usually behind the crowd  to look for potential disturbances.The agents, often youthful looking, will typically dress down and wear backpacks to blend inconspicuously into the crowd, the official said.At one recent protest, an undercover agent  rather than a uniformed officer  went into the center of a crowd of protesters to check out a report of a suspicious bag before determining there was no threat, the official said. The use of undercover officers is seen as a more effective way of monitoring large crowds.A Supreme Court spokesman, citing a policy of not discussing security practices, declined to talk about the use of undercover officers. Mr. German, the former F.B.I. undercover agent, said he was troubled to learn that the Supreme Court routinely used undercover officers to pose as demonstrators and monitor large protests.There is a danger to democracy, he said, in having police infiltrate protests when there isnt a reasonable basis to suspect criminality.",2014-11-16,abortion

The French government has declared books an essential good. This week, Daniel Mendelsohn and Mohsin Hamid debate whether the United States should do the same.By Daniel MendelsohnAs even big chains have faltered here, every block in central Paris seems to sprout at least two small, intelligently stocked bookshops.I hope this letter doesnt give you the impression that Ive quite lost my mind with delirium over Paris and France, wrote Joseph Roth, the Austrian journalist and novelist, in a letter to his editor soon after being assigned to Paris in 1925. Some hope. Paris, he gushed about the city that would become his home, is the capital of the world.It still feels that way if youre a writer. Youre going to feel like youve died and gone to heaven, a novelist friend of mine, unconsciously echoing Roth, knowingly murmured in 2007, when one of my books came out in a French translation. I soon saw what he meant. In the United States, there is one nationally broadcast radio program that has significant coverage of books  NPRs Fresh Air, which book publicists fight over like pi-dogs over a picked bone. In Paris, I soon lost count of how many in-depth radio and TV shows, some as long as an hour, I taped or broadcast live at the circular, weirdly sci-fi-looking Maison de la Radio. I happened to be in France in September, during the rentre littraire  the opening of the literary season, when publishers release their big books  and the frenzy was palpable. And not just among the soi-disant elite, either. Lost in a strange neighborhood late one night, I approached a group of club kids for directions, only to overhear them arguing heatedly about which of the new crop of books would be that years The Kindly Ones, the Holocaust blockbuster that had come out the year before.The fact is that a unique glamour, a cachet for which no other country has an equivalent, has attached to intellectual activity in France for nearly a millennium  from the 12th century, when the citys newly founded university began attracting fervently opinionated scholars, into the 20th, when the City of Light drew its famous literary expatriates: Gertrude Stein and James Joyce, Ernest Hemingway and Samuel Beckett. This may be because, whereas Anglo-Saxons prefer to segregate the life of the mind from that of other organs, French intellectual passion has often overflowed into, and become indistinguishable from, other kinds of passion. Theres an unbroken line from the medieval theologian and philosopher Ablard and his brainy ladylove, Hlose  their illicit love affair, chronicled in (what else?) an extensive series of beautifully wrought letters, resulted in premarital pregnancy, castration and a son called Astrolabe  to Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, who, in the middle of the last century, would sit at the Caf de Flore from 9 a.m. to well into the night, conducting their intellectual, social and romantic business in public.Whatever the cultural reasons, books in France are indeed an essential good  the designation coined by the French government that served to justify the very concrete steps it has taken over the years to protect its precious literary culture. The most prominent of these are laws outlawing the advantages (deep discounting combined with free shipping) that big chains and Amazon enjoy over independent booksellers in the United States and other countries. These help explain a phenomenon that inevitably strikes American visitors to France today: As even big chains such as Borders and Barnes & Noble have faltered here, every block in central Paris seems to sprout at least two small, intelligently stocked bookshops.As well they should. On average, a Frenchman reads 25 percent more books per year than an American does. (The shocked outcry over the French culture ministers admission that she hasnt read a book in two years only proves how anomalous she is.) Other statistics are equally striking. In 2008, for instance, 14 percent of books published in France were translations from other languages: a key indicator of a nations intellectual curiosity and awareness. In the United States, the figure scrapes along at 3 percent.Such realities reflect deep cultural values that cant be Band-Aided over. Should we declare books an essential good? Sure, declare away. But saying so wont make it so.Daniel Mendelsohn is the author of seven books, including the international best seller The Lost: A Search for Six of Six Million; two collections of essays on books, film, theater and television; and a translation of the poetry of Cavafy. His essays and reviews have appeared frequently in The New Yorker, The New York Review of Books and The New York Times Book Review. Mendelsohn has won the National Book Critics Circle Award for memoir and the NBCCs Nona Balakian Citation for Excellence in Book Reviewing; the National Jewish Book Award; and the George Jean Nathan Prize for Drama Criticism. His most recent book, Waiting for the Barbarians: Essays From the Classics to Pop Culture, was a finalist for the NBCC award in criticism and the PEN Art of the Essay prize. He teaches at Bard College.  By Mohsin HamidIn the balance between our rights as consumers and as producers  as laborers  the pendulum has swung too far one way.In France, books are treated as an essential good like food and utilities, subject to low taxes. At the same time, price discounts on books are limited to 5 percent and cant be offered in conjunction with free shipping. As a result, it costs pretty much the same to buy a book everywhere in France, including online, and independent bookshops are holding their own against larger competitors.Its hard to imagine similar laws being enacted in the United States. Books have no privileged position in the American system of law and commerce. We, the workers of the book business  writers, agents, editors, designers, publicists, booksellers and others  often bemoan this fact. Books, it seems to us, are different. We forgo higher wages doing other things because we love what we do, because we believe in what we do. Surely our industry deserves special treatment.Perhaps it does. But maybe we are missing something by focusing on how special we are as book people. We seem to be ignoring the bigger picture: namely that we are workers, and that our experience is converging with that of many other workers in America.Lets say you resided in the fictional small town of Lahore, Oklahoma. You lived there your whole life. Your kids were in school there. Your partner was a homemaker. Every weekend you went fishing with your old buddies from high school. And you had a job with the only big employer in town, the local balsa-wood model airplane manufacturer.One day your employer goes out of business. Maybe somebody in China is making model airplanes out of carbon-fiber-reinforced bamboo. Maybe a much bigger balsa-wood model airplane manufacturer in Illinois is taking advantage of Cayman shell companies, gargantuan offshore cash piles, Double Irish tax laws, and some sketchy environmental and labor practices. Who knows? Either way, youre out of a job.So what do you do? You dont want to move hundreds of miles away for half the pay. Youve lived in Lahore since you were born. Your friends and family are there. You have a Water Buffalo helmet on your mantelpiece from your days on the high school football team. Youre willing to bust your back working as hard as you can.Tough luck, pal. You need to find yourself a new life. Prices for model airplanes have gone down, and Americans are consumers, so Americans are better off. Thank you for your service.The problem is, Americans are producers too. (Want to stay where you are? Get ready to have your house foreclosed. Or see if you can find an adjunct gig at the local community college teaching Balsa Sculpture 101.) To quote the guy who currently occupies the White House, Americans are labor. Actually, he didnt say that. But he should have. Because its true.In the balance between our rights as consumers and as producers  as, go on, say it: laborers  the pendulum has swung too far one way. (I say our rights even though I live in Pakistan and dont have an American passport; my qualifications are a merit badge as a cub scout in California and 17 years of residing in the United States.)The America that boomed in the mid-20th century was a place where the state demanded that male citizens surrender years of their lives to national service, where the top income tax rate hovered between 70 and 94 percent, and where commercial banks were prohibited from investment banking. It was a veritable socialist paradise compared to the America of today.Maybe we can learn something from that America. No, not to go fight in Vietnam or celebrate Jim Crow or enforce sodomy laws or criminalize abortion. But to value producing as much as we do consuming. To do that, well need to think of ourselves as workers again. And (sotto voce) unite. At least a little. And not just with other writers.Mohsin Hamid is the author of three novels: Moth Smoke, a finalist for the PENHemingway Award; The Reluctant Fundamentalist, a New York Times best seller that was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize and adapted for film; and, most recently, How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia.",2014-11-16,abortion

But it will soon grow louder, shaping the actions of congressional Democrats in President Obamas final two years and, more notably, defining the partys presidential primaries in 2016.The debate will ultimately play out in a battle for the soul of the Clinton campaign, said Matt Bennett, a senior official at Third Way, the centrist political group.Hillary Rodham Clinton, should she run, will face tension between the business-friendly wing of the party, which was ascendant in the economic boom during her husbands administration, and the populism of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, which has gained currency of late.I want her to run on a raising-wages agenda and not cater to Wall Street, but to everyday people, Richard L. Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said of his expectations for Mrs. Clinton.Straddling the two blocs could prove difficult. Progressives have been emboldened to criticize party leaders since the Republican rout, particularly given the lack of a coherent Democratic message to address the problem of stagnant wages.Sifting through returns showing that lower-income voters either supported Republicans or did not vote, liberals argue that without a more robust message about economic fairness, the party will continue to suffer among working-class voters, particularly in the South and Midwest.Mr. Obamas wide popularity among activists and his attempt to transcend the traditional moderate-versus-liberal divide have largely papered over Democratic divisions on economic policy for the last six years. The party was also brought together by the passage of the health care law. But with Mr. Obamas popularity flagging and the economic recovery largely benefiting the affluent, Democrats are clashing anew.Unlike in the 1980s, when heavy losses prompted moderates to plead with the party to move away from liberal interest groups and toward the middle, it is now progressives who are the most outspoken.Too many Democrats are too close to Wall Street, said Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Too many Democrats support trade agreements that outsource jobs, and too many Democrats are too willing to cut Social Security  and thats why we lose elections.Mr. Brown said he had talked to over 60 Ohio Democratic leaders and activists since they were trounced in every statewide election. The message I heard from all of them was: The Democratic Party should fight for the little guy, he said.To help provide a bridge to liberals, Senate Democrats on Thursday named Ms. Warren as part of their leadership.While in sync on the substance of cultural issues, some of the populists believe that Democrats placed too much emphasis on such matters and not enough on economic fairness, depressing voter turnout.Gay marriage, abortion and birth control are important, said Terry OSullivan, president of the Laborers International Union of North America. But people join our organization for their livelihood, and thats what our people vote on: their economic self-interest.Labor is having its own struggles, with Republican-controlled states moving to limit union power. Democrats lost crucial races in part because of their candidates struggles in traditional union enclaves like eastern Iowa, suburban Detroit and parts of Wisconsin.For example, in losing to the Republican they perhaps most wanted to beat, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, unions saw their members turnout slip. After making up 32 percent of all voters in the 2012 recall attempt against Mr. Walker, union households made up just 21 percent of the Wisconsin electorate last week.Part of that drop was a result of Mr. Walkers pushing through changes to collective bargaining laws that reduced the states union membership. But some labor leaders were upset that Mary Burke, the Democratic challenger, would not commit to undoing those changes.Steve Rosenthal, a longtime Democratic strategist with ties to labor, said progressive organizations and unions should become more engaged in primaries and push candidates to stand for their agenda, as the right does with Republican candidates.I think its critical for folks on the left to do more of the same, Mr. Rosenthal said.Progressives pointed to three Democrats who ran as populists as models for success: Senator Al Franken of Minnesota, Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Senator-elect Gary Peters of Michigan.Mr. Merkley, who focused on the loss of well-paying jobs, the cost of college tuition and opposition to trade deals that he said sent jobs overseas, won by 19 percentage points. While Democrats nationally lost whites without a college degree by 30 percentage points, Mr. Merkley narrowly carried that bloc.We didnt lose them here in Oregon because we talked about what they care about, Mr. Merkley said.But some center-left Democrats said that those races were exceptions, and that the party should give up on winning a majority of such voters.Slowly and steadily since 1968, culture has trumped economics with voting and the white working class, said Kenneth S. Baer, a former Obama administration official who has written a book on modern liberalism. Its become the great white whale for a ship full of Democratic strategists. Obama proved that while we cannot get wiped out with that demographic, the future of the coalition is among growing parts of the electorate which are neither white nor working class.But not all agree  centrists say the party did not win enough moderate and middle-class voters  and that captures the partys broader debate about its agenda.We talk about policies helping the middle class, but the ones we promote the most are ones that dont speak to the middle class, like raising the minimum wage, said Al From, who founded the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in the 1980s to counter the partys move to the left.Many liberals believe that the disconnect between the politics of the partys grass roots and the message coming from Democratic administrations has left blue-collar voters unenthused. We do not have to struggle for an agenda that connects with working-class voters, said Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut. We have an agenda that does that, but it does not get vocalized at the top.Yet many say that simply pushing for an increase in the minimum wage is inadequate. Liberals want tougher restrictions on banks, more generous federal student loan aid, enhanced collective bargaining rights and a reassessment of the countrys trade policy.Mr. Obama has made it clear that he intends to work with congressional Republicans to push for fewer restrictions on trade. Some union leaders said they planned to fight those efforts and would be looking for an ally in Mrs. Clinton.The next six months, were going to be relentless on trade, vowed Larry Cohen, president of the Communications Workers of America. I hope she comes to our side on this fight. The president is not starting out there.",2014-11-15,abortion

Brown, and his own strong grass-roots base gave Mr. Hogan a decisive four-point victory, even as other Democrats in the state prevailed.On Thursday, as part of what is planned as a monthlong bus tour through the state, Mr. Hogan popped into the Boulevard Diner in this inner-ring suburb of Baltimore. I voted for Larry because hes going to work on some of these taxes and tolls that are killing us, said Carl Hobson, a Democrat who enthusiastically greeted the governor-elect.He was mobbed by well-wishers as he walked into a side room of the diner. Im keeping my eye on you, said one middle-aged woman as she moved in for a snuggle.Baltimore County is the one that made it happen, Mr. Hogan said, moving through the throngs.Asked about his partisan disadvantage, Mr. Hogan said, Im going to put together a bipartisan administration, saying that he had spent his entire life working with Democrats and that he had already met with the presiding officers of the state legislature. Everybody realizes that the state is a fiscal disaster right now. He would not offer specifics on how he would cut taxes and spending at a time of multimillion-dollar structural deficits. Were pulling together the best minds of the state no matter their party affiliation to attack it, he said.Mr. Hogan, 58, no doubt, took lessons from the tenure of Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., the last Republican governor of Maryland, for whom Mr. Hogan served. Mr. Ehrlich, who was elected in 2002 on a campaign that focused on moderation, was sent packing in 2006 after a term marked by acrimony with state Democrats.His administration is either going to be a national model of bipartisanship, said Timothy F. Maloney, a lifelong friend of Mr. Hogans and former Democratic member of the Maryland House of Delegates. Or we will go back to the gratuitous partisanship of Ehrlich and gridlock.Pressure from both Republicans and Democrats to obstruct the other will no doubt impede him. One of Mr. Hogans first moves was to appoint a former Democratic official to oversee budget and tax policy.Many of Mr. Hogans policy views remain largely a mystery. Since election night, he has been steadfast in refusing to articulate positions until he takes office on other major state issues  like plans for the states troubled infrastructure or the expansion of Medicaid.During the campaign, in spite of Democrats efforts to suggest he would undo Marylands new gun control laws or challenge abortion rights, Mr. Hogan steered clear of social issues, saying he would respect Marylands current laws.Instead, Mr. Hogan focused almost singularly on the states tax rates, making somewhat elastic claims that taxes had gone up 40 times in the last eight years, which his opponent, Mr. Brown, did little to counter. He also zeroed in on the states poor recent record in economic development, promising repeatedly to cut state spending and, later, taxes.Further, he attacked Mr. Brown, who was in charge of the disastrous and costly rollout of the state health care exchange. Marylands site crashed at the start of open enrollment, delaying the ability of many residents to sign up and costing the state tens of millions of lost dollars.Mr. Hogan also used his watchdog group, Change Maryland, which he began in 2011 to essentially hector Gov. Martin OMalley, to build an activist base on social media. The move vexed critics, and a complaint was brought to the State Board of Elections charging that Change Maryland was actually an exploratory committee; the board ruled that there is no real state law regarding such committees, and thus had no authority to act on the concern.The number of voters who pulled the lever for Democrats for Congress yet voted for Mr. Hogan for governor was greater than 20 percent, said John T. Willis a professor of government and public policy at the University of Baltimore. He wisely did not talk about any of the divisive social issues.Mr. Hogan enjoys saying that he is not a politician, but the reality is somewhat more nuanced. He ran against Representative Steny H. Hoyer in 1992, the only tough re-election battle Mr. Hoyer ever had. Further, his father, Larry Hogan Sr., was a member of the House from 1969 to 1975, and served as Prince Georges County executive from 1978 to 1982; Mr. Hogan worked for his father in his latter role.We worked together on things, said Mr. Maloney, who was a lawmaker at the time, noting that the two helped restructure the county government while both were in their early 20s.Born in Washington, Mr. Hogan attended Catholic high schools and Florida State University. He is married to an artist, Yumi Hogan, and one of her daughters starred in a campaign ad.He is known for throwing giant parties, snacking on ribs and wings and sporting a cheerful manner. He is not the kind of guy who when you are in long meetings makes you look at your watch, said Ashley OConnor, one of Mr. Hogans campaign consultants. He cracks jokes to keep things light.He could likely find common ground with Democrats on things like improving the relationship between the states universities and employers, its transportation problems and other matters, said Mr. Maloney, who told Mr. Hogan last year that he would be supporting Mr. Brown.If he wants to build a bipartisan coalition, he knows how to do that, he said. He proved that when we were 24 years old.",2014-11-14,abortion

She was 85.Her death was confirmed by a spokeswoman for the Christian Health Care Center in Wyckoff, where she lived in recent years. Her official House biography said she had Alzheimers disease.A former schoolteacher, Mrs. Roukema (pronounced ROW-kih-mah, the first syllable rhyming with how) was first elected to the House in 1980, four years after her son Todd died from leukemia at age 17. That wrenching experience, she said, motivated her to become active in politics and inspired her nearly decade-long effort to pass legislation allowing people to leave work for extended periods to care for newborn babies and deal with family medical issues without fear of losing their jobs.These are not abstract problems, Mrs. Roukema wrote in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times in 1990. I know. Ive been there. When my son was stricken with leukemia and needed home care, I was able to be at home to give him the loving care he needed. But what of the millions of mothers who work for the thousands of companies that do not have family leave policies?Democrats had supported the idea of a family and medical leave law since at least the mid-1980s, but few Republicans or business groups did. Mrs. Roukema became an essential supporter, brokering a compromise that exempted companies with fewer than 50 employees from having to provide the bills principal benefits: up to three months of unpaid leave at the time of a childs birth or adoption, or when an immediate family member falls ill.The exemption meant that about half of all American workers would not be affected by the law, but it made the idea more palatable to Mrs. Roukemas party. Congress passed the bill in June 1990.As society has changed, we have always adjusted our labor protection standards to meet the new circumstances, Mrs. Roukema wrote in her Op-Ed article, which urged President George Bush not to follow through on his promise to veto the bill. Clearly my Republican Party does not want to be perceived as the driving force behind a reduction of the capital gains tax for the rich while it turns its back on Americas working families.Mr. Bush did veto the bill, on June 29. Three years later, President Bill Clinton, who supported it during his 1992 presidential campaign, signed the Family and Medical Leave Act shortly after taking office.Mrs. Roukema was born Margaret Scafati on Sept. 19, 1929, in Newark. Her father was an auto mechanic, and his parents had immigrated from Italy. She received a bachelors degree in history and political science from Montclair State College in 1951 and did graduate work there. She taught high school history and government in Ridgewood, N.J., and from 1970 to 1973 served on the towns Board of Education.In the mid-1970s, she did graduate work at Rutgers before stopping to care for her son. She was able to do so in part because her husband, Richard W. Roukema, worked as a psychiatrist.The Roukemas had two other children, Greg and Meg, and several grandchildren. Dr. Roukema died in 2011. Information about her survivors was not immediately available.Mrs. Roukema said she entered politics as an outlet after her sons death. She volunteered in the failed 1977 campaign for governor of Thomas H. Kean, a Republican, then ran herself for Congress in 1978. She lost to the Democratic incumbent, Andrew Maguire, but defeated him in 1980 in the Republican tide that elected Ronald Reagan president.Mrs. Roukema was popular among voters but not always among fellow Republicans. She backed gun control, campaign finance reform and abortion rights, positions that brought her tough primary challenges by conservatives in her last two races. She easily won the general elections. She retired in 2003.In 1998, a few years after Mr. Clinton signed the family leave act into law, Mrs. Roukema called for his resignation in the Monica Lewinsky scandal and joined Republicans in voting to impeach him  a vote based on principle, she said, not a desire to strengthen her position with House Republican leaders.Three years later, when she was in line to lead the House Financial Services Committee, Republican leaders passed her over. She again made clear her frustration with her partys direction, saying in a 2002 interview, There has to be a recognition that without the moderates, we cannot be a majority party.",2014-11-13,abortion

This is also a tale of national irresponsibility and political irresponsibility  of us as a country failing our kids by refusing to invest in comprehensive sex education and birth control because we, too, dont plan ahead.I kind of understand how a teenage couple stuffed with hormones and enveloped in each others arms could get carried away. But Im just bewildered that American politicians, stuffed with sanctimony and enveloped in self-righteousness, dont adequately invest at home or abroad in birth-control programs that would save the government money, chip away at poverty, reduce abortions and empower young people.Neither Democrats nor Republicans seem particularly interested in these investments. The inflation-adjusted sum spent on Title X family planning in the United States has fallen by two-thirds since 1980.A few depressing facts: American teenagers become pregnant at a rate of about one a minute. Some 82 percent of births to teenagers in the U.S. are unplanned. American and European teenagers seem to be sexually active at roughly similar rates, although Americans may start a bit earlier. But the American teenage birthrate is three times Spains rate, five times Frances, and 15 times Switzerlands. Young Americans show a lack of understanding of where babies come from. Among teenagers who unintentionally became pregnant, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the most cited reason for not using contraception was I didnt think I could become pregnant. And 18 percent of young men somehow believed that having sex standing up helps prevent pregnancy, according to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.Hello?A teenager who has a baby often derails her own education and puts the child on a troubled trajectory as well. In Oklahoma last year, I met one family where the matriarch had a baby at 13, her daughter had a baby at 15, and that child, in turn, gave birth at 13. Thats how poverty replicates.Medicaid spends an average of $12,770 for a birth. Yet we spend only $8 per teenage girl on programs to avoid pregnancy. In financial terms, thats nuts. In human terms, its a tragedy.Internationally, we and other donor countries also underinvest in family planning in poor countries. Globally, 220 million women dont want to become pregnant but lack access to contraception.Isabel Sawhill of the Brookings Institution has written an important new book, Generation Unbound: Drifting Into Sex and Parenthood Without Marriage. She notes that most young single moms in America dont intend to become pregnant but drift into it fatalistically, partly because they rely solely on condoms or other less reliable forms of birth control.Condoms are 82 percent effective in preventing pregnancy in any one year, according to the C.D.C. But that means that after four years of relying only on condoms, most women will have become pregnant at least once.So Sawhill advocates a move to what she calls childbearing by design, not by default. That means providing long-acting reversible contraceptives, or LARCs, to at-risk girls and young women who want them. LARCs are IUDs, or implants that can remain in place for years, and the failure rate is negligible.Teenage birthrates in America have already dropped by more than half since 1991. But Sawhill calculates that if LARCs became much more widespread, the proportion of children born outside marriage could drop by a quarter, and the proportion of children who are poor would drop sharply as well.By turning drifters into planners, we would not only help those women achieve their own goals but also create much stronger starts for their children, Sawhill writes.The American Academy of Pediatrics recently urged doctors to recommend LARCs for sexually active teenagers. One obstacle is the initial cost  $500 to $1,000  so that many young people cant afford them.A study in St. Louis offered free birth control, including LARCs, to sexually active teenagers and found that pregnancy rates for them plunged by more than three-quarters. Abortions fell by a similar rate. Thats what we need nationwide.The Affordable Care Act provides free access to all forms of contraception, which helps. But many pediatricians arent trained in inserting LARCs.So we need more womens health clinics, yet, instead, some are being closed as casualties of abortion wars. Moreover, states and schools should embrace comprehensive sex education, teaching contraception, the benefits of delaying sex and, also, the responsibility of boys.A starting point for the United States should be to rebuild Title X spending on family planning. Surely we can afford to spend as much in this area as we did back in 1980.So, of course, lets ask teenagers to show responsibility toward sex. But lets demand the same of our politicians.",2014-11-13,abortion

Why does this keep happening?","It has not escaped the notice of political analysts that 72 percent of whites without college degrees  a rough proxy for what we used to call the white working class  believe that the U.S. economic system generally favors the wealthy. Or that on Nov. 4, these same men and women voted for Republican House candidates 64-34.Similarly, the overwhelmingly white electorates of Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota voted decisively in referendums to raise the minimum wage while simultaneously voting for Republicans, whose party has adamantly rejected legislation to raise the minimum wage.There is an ongoing debate among politicians, political scientists and partisans of both parties over the dismal support of Democratic candidates among whites. Does it result from ideological differences, racial animosity or a perception among many whites that they are excluded from a coalition of minorities, the poor, single women of all races, gays and other previously marginalized constituencies?Arguably, the poor Democratic showing among whites does not represent naked race prejudice, as Obamas election and re-election attest. But it can be seen as a reflection of substantial material interests that affect the very voters who carry greater weight in low turnout midterm Congressional elections.Whites as a whole, who made up 75 percent of this years electorate, voted for Republican House candidates by a 24-point margin, 62-38, the exact same margin by which they supported Republican candidates in the 2010 midterms. In 2006, when opposition to President George W. Bush was intense, Republicans won white voters by eight points, 52-44.The opposition of whites to the Democratic Party is visible not only in voting behavior, but in general opposition to key Democratic policy initiatives, most tellingly in hostility toward the Affordable Care Act. A November 2013 National Journal poll found, for example, that 58 percent of whites said Obamacare would make things worse for people like you and your family, more than double the 25 percent that said that Obamacare would make things better.Asked whether the Affordable Care Act would make things better or worse for the country at large, 60 percent of whites said worse and 35 percent of whites said better.Obamacare shifts health care benefits and tax burdens from upper-income Americans to lower-income Americans, and from largely white constituencies to beneficiaries disproportionately made up of racial and ethnic minorities. The program increases levies on the overwhelmingly white affluent by raising taxes on households making more than $250,000.To achieve its goals, Obamacare reduces spending on Medicare by $500 billion over 10 years, according to the Medicare board of trustees, which oversees the finances of the program. Medicare serves a population that is 77 percent white. Even as reductions in Medicare spending fall disproportionately on white voters, the savings are being used to finance Obamacare, which includes a substantial expansion of Medicaid. Medicaid recipients are overwhelmingly poor and, in 2013, were 41 percent white and 59 percent minority.In addition to expanding Medicaid, the overall goal of Obamacare is to provide health coverage for the uninsured, a population that, in 2010 when the program was enacted, was 47 percent white, and 53 percent black, Hispanic, Asian-American and other minorities.Its not hard to see, then, why a majority of white midterm voters withheld support from Democrats and cast their votes for Republicans.Republicans are not satisfied with winning 62 percent of the white vote. To counter the demographic growth of Democratic constituencies whose votes threaten Republican success in high-turnout presidential elections, Republicans have begun a concerted effort to rupture the partisan loyalty of the remaining white Democratic voters. Their main target is socially liberal, fiscally conservative suburbanites, the weakest reeds in the Democratic coalition. These middle-income white voters do not share the acute economic needs of so-called downscale Democratic voters and they are less reliant on government services.The Republican strategy to win over these more culturally tolerant, but still financially pressed, white voters is to continue to focus on material concerns  on anxiety about rising tax burdens, for example  while downplaying the preoccupation of many of the most visible Republicans with social, moral and cultural repression.The current effectiveness of the anti-tax strategy was demonstrated in the unexpected victory of Larry Hogan, the Republican gubernatorial candidate in deep blue Maryland, who defeated Anthony Brown, the highly favored Democratic lieutenant governor.The average Marylander sees a governor and legislature willing to impose record tax increases on the rest of us that we dont need, dont want and cant afford, Hogan declared at the start of his campaign and repeated relentlessly until Election Day.Hogan won by decisively carrying all the majority white suburbs surrounding Baltimore city, including Howard County, a former bastion of suburban Democratic strength.In Colorado, Cory Gardner, the Republican Senate nominee, joined the Republican assault on Obamacare and taxes:Significantly, Gardner also stiff-armed the Christian right on issues of contraception and abortion in his successful two-point win over Mark Udall, the Democratic incumbent. Gardner highlighted a more culturally tolerant approach when he endorsed over the counter access to the morning after pill  a form of contraception many in the right to life movement consider a form of abortion  and when he renounced past sponsorship of a personhood constitutional amendment titled The Life Begins at Conception Act.In a mea culpa comment rarely heard in campaigns, Gardner told The Denver Post:Despite this, not only did the Christian right stick with Gardner, but white evangelicals provided his margin of victory. These religious voters, who made up 25 percent of the Colorado midterm electorate, voted for Gardner over Udall by a resounding 70 points, 83 to 13. This margin was enough to compensate for Udalls 20-point victory, 57 percent to 37 percent, among the remaining 75 percent of the Colorado electorate.The clear implication of these results for Republican candidates running in 2016 and beyond is that you can break with conservative orthodoxy on some issues to better appeal to a general election electorate without paying the price of losing white Christian support.If Republicans are successful in toning down their candidates, it will take from Democrats a weapon that has proved highly successful in state and federal elections: demonizing Republican Party candidates as a collection of knuckle-dragging Neanderthals.The Democrats portrayal of Republicans has served to motivate both Democratic voters and donors, especially suburban white Democrats, by tapping into their anger and fear of a morally intrusive Republican Party.Anger in politics can play a particularly vital role, motivating some people to participate in ways they might ordinarily not, according to Nicholas Valentino, a professor of communication studies and political science at the University of Michigan, and the lead author of Election Nights Alright for Fighting: The Role of Emotions in Political Participation, a 2011 study of voter motivation.A Democratic tactic designed to focus on mobilizing white voters  the sustained effort led by Senator Harry Reid to demonize the Koch brothers  has not yet, by most accounts, paid off.As they have after past Election Day defeats, Democrats can hope for Republican infighting between the establishment and Tea Party wings. Such internecine conflict, in fact, has already begun.Democrats can also count on greater voter participation by their loyalists in a presidential year, and on advantageous demographic trends: The share of the electorate held by older and working-class whites, the core of the Republican Party, diminishes every year, while Democratic constituencies continue to grow.In the aftermath of the 2012 election, the obligation to change fell upon the Republican Party. With the support of Karl Rove, the Republican National Committee, under its chairman, Reince Priebus, pulled the party to the center, with Priebus producing the famous autopsy report calling for political moderation. To the surprise of many, the partys candidates this year took key suggestions to heart.Insofar as the Republican Party successfully sandpapers its sharp edges, the necessity for change will now shift to the Democrats. Most recently, this kind of metamorphosis was accomplished by Bill Clintons 1992 Southern governors strategy presidential campaign when he defied liberal orthodoxy on such issues as welfare and the death penalty.One question presents itself: how transformative a political leader is Hillary Clinton? Can she avoid entrapment by divisive issues of key importance to competing wings of the center-left coalition: L.G.B.T. rights; marijuana legalization; climate change; gun control; racial profiling; fracking; pension rights for public employee unions; citizenship for undocumented immigrants; and the ever pressing social welfare needs of the countrys poor?In May 2008, with Obama taking the lead, Hillary Clinton committed to continue the race for the nurse on her second shift, for the worker on the line, for the waitress on her feet, for the small-business owner, the farmer, the teacher, the coal miner, the trucker, the soldier, the veteran.As James Oliphant, the National Journals White House correspondent wrote:The white vote in the years since 1992 has become consistently more committed to Republican candidates. Mitt Romney carried whites by a 20-point margin, 59-39, larger than either John McCain, 12 points, or George W. Bush, 17 points.Clinton has her work cut out for her, especially if the Republican nominee heeds the advice of party leaders and makes a concerted effort to further erode  by whatever means necessary  white Democratic support.",2014-11-12,abortion

More than 200 bishops rose to their feet Monday and gave a protracted standing ovation to Cardinal Francis George, a former president of the bishops conference, who will step down next week as the archbishop of Chicago.Among those applauding in the conference room was the man who will soon be installed in the powerful Chicago seat, Bishop Blase J. Cupich. Pope Francis has never met him, but plucked him from the obscure diocese of Spokane, Wash., passing over archbishops considered rising stars under the two previous popes.Change is rattling the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, as the American bishops hold their annual fall meeting here this week. The vast majority of them were appointed by Francis two more conservative predecessors, and some say they do not yet understand what kind of change Pope Francis envisions and whether it is anything more than a change in tone.The change is reflected not only in the bellwether Chicago appointment, but also in Francis call for the church to open discussion on sticky matters long considered settled, such as communion for the divorced and remarried, same-sex relationships, couples who live together without being married and even polygamists in Africa.Some prelates, like Bishop Cupich, are exhilarated at the pontiffs fresh message and the prospect of change, while others, like Cardinal George, are warier. A few have been downright resistant, including Cardinal Raymond Burke, an American in Rome who has publicly challenged Francis and was removed on Saturday from his position as head of the Vaticans highest court.The pope is saying some very challenging things for people, Bishop Cupich said in an interview Tuesday. Hes not saying, this is the law and you follow it and you get to heaven. Hes saying we have to do something about our world today thats suffering, people are being excluded, neglected. We have a responsibility, and hes calling people to task.Bishop Cupich is seen as an able administrator with a pastoral approach, who has written and spoken on social justice for the poor and disenfranchised in tones that echo Francis. He said he had no idea how he was selected, saying, Maybe someday over a nice glass of Chianti Ill ask him.The bishops are gathered in Baltimore only weeks after a contentious Vatican meeting on marriage and the family ended in Rome. That meeting  the first of two synods being held one year apart  has reawakened a split in the church between theological conservatives and liberals that had remained relatively dormant during the 20-month honeymoon with Francis. But now Francis pontificate has entered a more delicate phase, with some bishops asking whether he has a coherent vision of where he wants to take the church and a plan for how to get there.He says wonderful things, Cardinal George said about Francis in an interview on Sunday, but he doesnt put them together all the time, so youre left at times puzzling over what his intention is. What he says is clear enough, but what does he want us to do?Cardinal George, who is 77 and being treated for cancer, remains a voting cardinal until age 80 and says he would like to travel to Rome to see Francis: Id like to sit down with him and say, Holy Father, first of all, thank you for letting me retire. And could I ask you a few questions about your intentions?Catholics worldwide are supposed to spend the next year leading to the next synod meeting in Rome in October 2015 discussing issues related to marriage and the family, and bishops are awaiting instructions from the Vatican about how to conduct the dialogue.Their public meetings here have largely been taken up with the priorities they have had for years: opposing abortion and same-sex marriage, and the concern that government is infringing on the churchs religious freedom through provisions like the birth control mandate in President Obamas health care law.On Tuesday afternoon, after some Catholic commentators took the bishops to task for saying nothing during the conference about the hot-button issue of immigration, the floor was briefly turned over to Bishop Eusebio L. Elizondo, an auxiliary bishop of Seattle. He called attention to a letter that the bishops conference sent in September urging Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, to take executive action to protect some illegal immigrants from deportation.In their regional meetings, the bishops were asked to identify which seven priorities the bishops conference should take up, in light of Francis pontificate, for the years 2017 to 2020, Bishop John C. Wester of Salt Lake City said in an interview.He said that among the priorities he suggested were the plight of illegal immigrants, and the poor. These are concerns that Francis has sounded repeatedly.However, Bishop Wester said, I dont think the old priorities are going to stop, particularly if theyre still relevant.Four prelates who just returned from the synod in Rome addressed the bishops and played down the wall-to-wall news reports of division. They pointed out that in the synods final document, there was consensus on all but three of 62 passages  those on gay relationships and divorce and remarriage.Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York gave a sarcasm-laden report to his fellow bishops, saying, Too bad we missed that real synod, brothers, because the one we were at was hardly as spicy.On Wednesday, behind closed doors, the bishops will elect four among them to attend the synod in 2015, in addition to Cardinal Dolan and Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington, who automatically attend as appointees to the Vaticans office on synods. The choice of delegates will be a telling indication of whether the American bishops support significant change, or the status quo.The Rev. Thomas Reese, a Jesuit priest and senior analyst for National Catholic Reporter, a liberal, independent news outlet, said in an interview between the sessions that this group of bishops was shaped by the popes who appointed them, John Paul II and Benedict XVI.There is no bishop who is standing up and being the real leader of a Francis faction, Father Reese said. They grew up in conservative families, went to conservative seminaries and have been told not to talk to theologians who are creative because theyve been labeled heretical. Now Francis is saying lets go in a different direction and lets have a discussion. The last two pontificates, there was no room for discussion, and this makes them nervous and confused.",2014-11-12,abortion

References to three staff or many staff, or to training staff, are jargon.

Faces Tougher Job Finding Democrats to Repeal Health Law,"Of the 10 House Democrats who have joined the G.O.P. most often in attempts to change or repeal the health care law, two will remain in the new Congress.","The Democrats Against Obamacare caucus in the House of Representatives has been decimated through retirements and election defeats. But Republicans seeking a bipartisan veneer for their efforts to dismantle the health care law could ally with a few lawmakers.Of the 10 House Democrats who have joined Republicans most often in attempts to defund, repeal or change the Affordable Care Act, just two will stay on in the 114th Congress forming in January. Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Dan Lipinski of Illinois have voted with the G.O.P. 23 and 16 times. Mr. Peterson, one of the few remaining members of the so-called Blue Dog caucus of moderate and conservative Democrats, survived a tight re-election challenge last week. Mr. Lipinski is a Roman Catholic Democrat who opposes abortion; Republicans have argued that the law uses public money to subsidize abortion coverage.There are still a few House races from Tuesday to be decided, and two involve Democratic incumbents  Ron Barber of Arizona and Jim Costa of California  who have voted 10 times each for changes to the law, though not for full repeal.The last vote in the House to fully repeal the Affordable Care Act, in May 2013, attracted just two Democratic votes. Those lawmakers, Jim Matheson of Utah and Mike McIntyre of North Carolina, are retiring at the end of this session. Both survived tight challenges in 2012 but were considered likely to lose this year, and the two were replaced by Republicans who are opposed to the law.Should Mr. Barber of Arizona win his very close re-election bid, he would be among the Republicans top targets if only because his next election could be as competitive as this one. Gwen Graham, who defeated a Republican incumbent in a North Florida swing district, has said she would vote to fix the problems in the law but not repeal it.Other potential targets include Tim Walz of Minnesota, Henry Cuellar of Texas and Kurt Schrader of Oregon. They have sided with Republicans on anti-Obamacare votes at least a dozen times each, but they, like nearly all House Democrats, would be all but certain to oppose full repeal, knowing that even if such legislation advanced, President Obama would veto it.When they assume control of both chambers of Congress next year, Republicans are likely to hold a vote on full repeal of the law, as they did in 2011, 2012 and 2013. But more likely to get the Democrats cooperation are bills that would alter or eliminate parts of the law. Some of the possibilities include changing the definition of full-time employees from those who work 30 hours a week to 40 hours; repealing a federal tax on medical devices; and eliminating an independent board on Medicare spending.",2014-11-11,abortion

It is likely to be many years before they have a chance of getting it back.The Republican wave on Tuesday was a huge setback at the state level, giving the party control of 11 legislative chambers that had been controlled by Democrats, along with a net gain of three governorships. Republicans picked up more than 300 legislative seats and now have 55 percent of all the seats in the country, their highest number since 1920. As a result, Republicans now fully control the legislatures in 30 states, compared to 11 for Democrats. (Eight are split.) In 23 states, Republicans control both the governorship and the legislature, compared to seven with full control for Democrats.These arent just abstract victories. Republican control is the reason why only 28 states have expanded their Medicaid program, and 27 states have refused to set up insurance exchanges. Its why some states have been able to restrict abortion rights, let industries damage the environment, make it much harder to unionize, and  with the goal of keeping Republicans in power  discourage people from voting through voter ID laws and other restrictions.For years, state control has been the not-so-secret weapon of conservatives, who have taken advantage of the lack of popular interest in state politics to enact their policies with impunity. The death of local news organizations has made it possible for many of these policies to be enacted with little coverage, leaving citizens in the dark about the activities of their elected representatives.Their vehicle for doing so has been the American Legislative Exchange Council, which distributes right-wing bills that favor business at the expense of consumers and the poor, and then encourages its members to pass them in capitals around the country.One of its most destructive creations is the Stand Your Ground law, now on the books in 30 states, which allows citizens to use lethal force to defend themselves whenever they say they feel threatened.ALEC has been around since 1973, but only now have Democrats decided to create something similar. As Politico reported today, liberal activists are trying to raise millions to establish their own version of ALEC, to be known as the State Innovation Exchange. The group will write model legislation to raise the minimum wage, improve environmental protection, and expand voting rights, backing up these bills with the data and arguments that legislators will need to make their case.Its the biggest missing piece in the progressive infrastructure, the groups leader, Nick Rathod, told Politico. Mr. Rathod was President Obamas liaison to the states and also worked for Mayor Michael Bloomberg in New York.Its a great idea, but its so long overdue that it may be too late. If things continue at this rate  thanks largely to Democratic voters who dont bother to participate in state elections  there may not be enough liberal legislators left to influence.",2014-11-10,abortion

Anti-abortion measures pose a risk to all pregnant women, including those who want to be pregnant.Such laws are increasingly being used as the basis for arresting women who have no intention of ending a pregnancy and for preventing women from making their own decisions about how they will give birth.How does this play out? Based on the belief that he had an obligation to give a fetus a chance for life, a judge in Washington, D.C., ordered a critically ill 27-year-old woman who was 26 weeks pregnant to undergo a cesarean section, which he understood might kill her. Neither the woman nor her baby survived.In Iowa, a pregnant woman who fell down a flight of stairs was reported to the police after seeking help at a hospital. She was arrested for attempted fetal homicide.In Utah, a woman gave birth to twins; one was stillborn. Health care providers believed that the stillbirth was the result of the womans decision to delay having a cesarean. She was arrested on charges of fetal homicide.In Louisiana, a woman who went to the hospital for unexplained vaginal bleeding was locked up for over a year on charges of second-degree murder before medical records revealed she had suffered a miscarriage at 11 to 15 weeks of pregnancy.Florida has had a number of such cases. In one, a woman was held prisoner at a hospital to prevent her from going home while she appeared to be experiencing a miscarriage. She was forced to undergo a cesarean. Neither the detention nor the surgery prevented the pregnancy loss, but they did keep this mother from caring for her two small children at home. While a state court later found the detention unlawful, the opinion suggested that if the hospital had taken her prisoner later in her pregnancy, its actions might have been permissible.In another case, a woman who had been in labor at home was picked up by a sheriff, strapped down in the back of an ambulance, taken to a hospital, and forced to have a cesarean she did not want. When this mother later protested what had happened, a court concluded that the womans personal constitutional rights clearly did not outweigh the interests of the State of Florida in preserving the life of the unborn child.Anti-abortion reasoning has also provided the justification for arresting pregnant women who experience depression and have attempted suicide. A 22-year-old in South Carolina who was eight months pregnant attempted suicide by jumping out a window. She survived despite suffering severe injuries. Because she lost the pregnancy, she was arrested and jailed for the crime of homicide by child abuse.These are not isolated or rare cases. Last year, we published a peer-reviewed study documenting 413 arrests or equivalent actions depriving pregnant women of their physical liberty during the 32 years between 1973, when Roe v. Wade was decided, and 2005. In a majority of these cases, women who had no intention of ending a pregnancy went to term and gave birth to a healthy baby. This includes the many cases where the pregnant woman was alleged to have used some amount of alcohol or a criminalized drug.Since 2005, we have identified an additional 380 cases, with more arrests occurring every week. This significant increase coincides with what the Guttmacher Institute describes as a seismic shift in the number of states with laws hostile to abortion rights.The principle at the heart of contemporary efforts to end legal abortion is that fertilized eggs, embryos and fetuses are persons or at least have separate rights that must be protected by the state. In each of the cases we identified, this same rationale provided the justification for the deprivation of pregnant womens physical liberty, as well as of the right to medical decision making, medical privacy, bodily integrity and, in one case, the womans right to life.Many of the pregnant women subjected to this mistreatment are themselves profoundly opposed to abortion. Yet it was precisely the legal arguments for recriminalizing abortion that were used to strip them of their rights to dignity and liberty in the context of labor and delivery. These cases, individually and collectively, highlight what is so often missed when the focus is on attacking or defending abortion, namely that all pregnant women are at risk of losing a wide range of fundamental rights that are at the core of constitutional personhood in the United States.If we want to end these unjust and inhumane arrests and forced interventions on pregnant women, we need to stop focusing only on the abortion issue and start working to protect the personhood of pregnant women.We should be able to work across the spectrum of opinion about abortion to unite in the defense of one basic principle: that at no point in her pregnancy should a woman lose her civil and human rights.",2014-11-08,abortion

This month, Mars Hill announced that it was dissolving its network of 13 satellite churches.In the aftermath of his fall, Mr. Driscoll, who was known for his autocratic management style, his quashing of dissent and his unusually frank talk about how Christian wives can please their husbands in bed, had himself to blame. In resigning, Mr. Driscoll admitted his failings, citing his past pride, anger and a domineering spirit.But Mr. Driscoll cannot take all the credit for his own downfall. For one thing, any faithful Christian would give Satan his due, for leading Mr. Driscoll astray. Then there is the role played by World, an evangelical Christian newsmagazine that broke one of the most damaging stories about Mr. Driscoll. In March, World reported that $210,000 in Mars Hill church funds had gone to a marketing firm that promised to get Real Marriage, a book written by Mr. Driscoll and his wife, on best-seller lists.World was not the only outlet to take on Mr. Driscoll. The blogger Warren Throckmorton, in particular, persistently chronicled concerns about Mars Hill for the website Patheos. But the story about best-seller lists was also not the first scoop for World, and Mr. Driscoll was not the first conservative Christian leader that the magazine had taken on.In October 2012, a World reporter, Warren Cole Smith, revealed that Dinesh DSouza, the conservative author, filmmaker and activist, had attended a Christian conference with a woman not his wife  a woman he was introducing as his fiance. Soon after, Mr. DSouza resigned as president of Kings College in New York City.Founded in 1986 and based in Asheville, N.C., the biweekly World is edited by Marvin Olasky, the Bush adviser who helped popularize the term compassionate conservatism. Under Mr. Olasky, who became editor in 1994, the religious magazine has become one of the few that do investigative reporting.The Jewish newspaper The Forward gleefully reports on the foibles of communal leaders, and Commonweal, run by lay Catholics, publishes work critical of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. But evangelical Protestant journalism is generally more public relations than reporting; World stands out as an exception.Were a Christian publication but not a movement organ, Mr. Olasky said. So we can publicly criticize Christian leaders from other organizations. Other publications tend to be more within the camp  published by a particular denomination, for example  and they dont want to engage in criticism.Mr. Olasky said the founder of World, Joel Belz, regretted that it had been the secular press  led by The Charlotte Observer  that helped bring down the evangelists Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, who were accused of misusing ministry funds in the late 1980s.Joel said, Gee, I wish we had done that, Mr. Olasky recalled. We dont want to leave it to the secular press to expose wrongdoing within the church.Mr. Olasky said that there is no contradiction between Christian faith and reporting on the dark side of Christianity. We dont have to cover up, because we do have faith that God forgives and saves the sinner.Mr. Belz is no longer editor, but he still writes a column for World. He said that he got the idea for a Christian newsmagazine from readers of a childrens publication that he had founded. After moving to Asheville to edit a small, failing magazine called Presbyterian Journal, he conceived the idea for a new venture, a Christian version of the old Weekly Reader that he had loved as a child in Iowa.I thought if we could do something like Weekly Reader for the growing Christian private-school market, there might be a real market for that, Mr. Belz said. The childrens magazine he founded in 1981, then called Its Gods World, was a hit, and is still published in several editions. Then the parents got back to us and said, We like this, we read it with our kids, and when will you do something like this for adults? So it was the child of the childrens magazine.When asked whether other evangelicals have criticized World for its investigative reporting, Mindy Belz, Mr. Belzs sister-in-law and a top editor, recalled the response to a series about sexual abuse at a missionary school in Senegal run by New Tribes Mission.We were accused of hurting New Tribes, the teachers, and the people who had already dealt with the past, Ms. Belz said  in other words, it was over and done with, or so some believed, so why make news of it? People will say its not right for Christians to talk this way about other Christians, she said. We just think theres a real truth-telling component to any journalistic enterprise.The members of the small staff at World are mostly evangelical Protestants, of varying denominations. But there is no statement of faith to sign, and at least one Roman Catholic writes for the magazine (hes a music critic). Lynn Vincent, the evangelical ghostwriter behind the monster hit Heaven Is for Real and Sarah Palins autobiography, Going Rogue, wrote for World for over a decade, until 2009. One of her favorite World pieces was an article she wrote about sexual abuse of women by Protestant pastors  a story, she said, directed by truths found in Scripture.This is no different than other major publications today, whose reporters are guided by generally settled orthodoxies, Ms. Vincent said in an email. For example, she said, most journalists treat abortion as a morally neutral medical procedure that ends an unwanted pregnancy. By contrast, she said, her reporting on abortion is based on the scriptural admonition to defend the weak, and the teaching that children are a heritage from the Lord. (That is Psalm 127.)Marvin believes that sometimes you have to tear the scab off for healing to happen, Terry Mattingly, the founder of the blog GetReligion.org, which tracks representations of religion in the secular media, said of Mr. Olasky. He is running Rolling Stone for cultural conservative evangelicals. Its just that Rolling Stone isnt going to tell you what their Bible is  maybe its the Kinsey Report? he said. Marvin will hand you one of his.",2014-11-08,abortion

Missing this year, many Democrats say, was a broad economic message to enthuse supporters and convert some independents.While the Democrats loss of their Senate majority owed much to the fact that they were defending so many seats in the Republican-friendly South and West, that dynamic only underscored the lost promise of Barack Obamas famed 2004 declaration that there is no red and blue America, only a United States of America  a belief he reiterated, for all the cynics who say otherwise, on Wednesday.However nave his pronouncement  both then and now  as a candidate in 2008 Mr. Obama built up organizations and hopes among Democrats even in conservative places like Alaska, North Dakota and Idaho. In February 2008, more than 14,000 people jammed a Boise State University hall to hear him speak. They told me there werent any Democrats in Idaho, Mr. Obama exclaimed. But I didnt believe them.Yet during his presidency, the national party has set aside that build-it-and-they-will-come approach and allowed the 50-state strategy that Howard Dean, the former chairman, oversaw to wane, focusing instead on Democratic strongholds and battlegrounds. And rarely has Mr. Obama visited states that are not Democratic blue or swing-vote purple.Weve suffered from the neglect of the campaign committees out here, said Larry LaRocco, a former Idaho congressman. He and other state Democrats had sought help from the national party for local Democrats, given hopes kindled by Idaho Republicans infighting and flawed candidates. Despite Tuesdays Republican wave, Idaho Democrats did gain a state legislative seat and came close in other contests. With some resources in here we could have a field day, Mr. LaRocco insisted.But even he does not argue that conservative Idaho should be a party priority, only that to forfeit states and regions ensures Democrats cannot compete.More broadly, Democrats across the country are increasingly debating how or even whether they should be doing more to win voters largely lost since the 1960s civil rights era  men, and especially working-class white men.Some Democrats are resigned, if not content, to all but give up since white men are a shrinking share of the electorate, while the expanding ranks of single women and Latino, African-American and young voters strongly favor Democrats.But while that gives Democrats the edge in picking presidents, it hurts them in midterm elections because so many of their supporters skip voting in nonpresidential years, leaving a whiter, older and less female electorate that favors Republicans.The midterm drop-off of Democrats core supporters has reached historic levels, Ruy Teixeira and John Halpin, analysts at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, wrote after the election.When combined with white mens overwhelming support for Republicans, the outcome, as on Tuesday, is Democrats defeat. In North Carolina, Colorado and Iowa  states where Democrats lost Senate seats after campaigns that emphasized abortion rights, birth control coverage and pay equity for women  support from female voters was disappointing, and swamped by mens margins for the Republicans.In North Carolina, where more than a third of voters were white men, Senator Kay Hagan lost their votes by 42 points, 27 percent to 69 percent, exit polls showed. Senator Mary L. Landrieu got support from just 15 percent of white men who voted in Louisianas multicandidate contest, a result that helps explain why she is considered likely to lose a Dec. 6 runoff election against the Republican Bill Cassidy.But in Michigan, the Democrats Senate candidate, Representative Gary Peters, prevailed after a long campaign in which he aggressively appealed to white men, especially blue-collar voters and small-business managers. He won 50 percent of all male voters, and 44 percent of white men to 52 percent for the vanquished Republican Terri Lynn Land, an eight-point gap that nonetheless was much reduced from Mr. Peters 21-point disadvantage among white men last February in a statewide poll by the nonpartisan firm EPIC-MRA.Even before Tuesdays results were in, some Democrats were complaining that the party had failed to develop a national economic message and policy agenda that would appeal both to white men and to women and minorities, as well as counter the Republicans own lack of an affirmative policy platform. Many blamed Mr. Obama, yet the president was all but banned from the campaign trail given his unpopularity.Absent any clear or far-reaching national agenda and message to address peoples real economic concerns about jobs, wages and opportunity, Mr. Teixeira and Mr. Halpin wrote late Thursday, the Democrats essentially ceded control of the national campaign, opting to try their luck with a series of localized and targeted campaigns.Another analysis released Friday, from Democracy Corps and the Voter Participation Center, which works to increase turnout among unmarried women  a quarter of the voting-age population  concluded that single womens support fell short because they did not hear issues important to them: an economic agenda for working women and men.Democratic-leaning voters heard random policies that you have to figure out that they add up to a big economic narrative, the pollster Stan Greenberg of Democracy Corps said in an interview, citing the minimum wage and pay equity proposals as examples. There were bits and pieces, but it was up to the voter to decide that it all added up to a big economic narrative.To me, the biggest mistake was not talking about health care, he said. By failing to talk about the law and its successes  newly insuring millions of people, giving all insured Americans preventive-care benefits and consumer protections, and contributing to lower health care spending overall  Democrats allowed Republicans to define the presidents signature domestic accomplishment as a failure, virtually unchallenged.Democrats were in a defensive crouch, much like they were at times in the Reagan era, when Newt Gingrich led Republicans to take control of the House of Representatives in the mid-1990s and in the early years of George W. Bushs presidency. Conservatives, by contrast, like Govs. Scott Walker in Wisconsin and Sam Brownback in Kansas, campaigned with conviction even at risk of defeat.It seems like were always walking on eggshells, Mr. LaRocco said, raising the question What do we stand for?The answer to that now becomes the defining challenge for anyone who seeks the Democrats 2016 nomination to succeed Mr. Obama.",2014-11-08,abortion

As campaigns increase the volume of in-person visits and phone calls made by volunteers, they risk that those interactions could turn away voters from the candidates they are promoting.In a forthcoming paper in the American Political Science Review, Ryan D. Enos, an assistant government professor at Harvard, and Eitan D. Hersh, an assistant professor of political science at Yale, describe how they surveyed more than 3,000 Obama campaign volunteers in the midst of the 2012 election. They found that individuals who were interacting with swing voters on the campaigns behalf were demographically unrepresentative, ideologically extreme, cared about atypical issues, and misunderstood the voters priorities.Obama campaign volunteers in 2012 were often more liberal, better-educated, whiter and richer than the voters they were attempting to persuade or mobilize through phone calls and knocking on doors. This kind of mismatch isnt a new problem: Supporters of Eugene McCarthy in 1968 urged some antiwar activists to Get Clean for Gene  to cut their hair and beards if they served as volunteers  in order to win over the middle-class voter.When campaigns were mostly focused on television advertising, they could present a single message to voters on air, one that was typically less extreme than that espoused by its most fervent supporters. But the increased emphasis during the last two elections on directly contacting voters makes it more important for campaigns to send not just the right message but one delivered by the right messenger.Who performs these fundamental campaign tasks matters, the authors say. Campaigns can tightly control messages in broadcast advertisements and speeches. But they have much less control over the activities of their volunteers. In the past, campaigns would skip entire neighborhoods considered to be unfriendly, but the ability to target smaller groups of voters from information in voter files and other sources of information means that in many races volunteers are talking to more individuals than they ever have.In general, neighbor-to-neighbor contacts are considered more valuable and productive than phone calls from someone out of state. But previous research has shown that voters pay attention to the messenger, and can be less receptive to those who dont share similar characteristics like age, gender or accent.Thats important for campaigns because it could have consequences for the effectiveness of such work; canvassing was a major focus for both Democratic and Republican campaigns, as well as outside groups, in the 2014 elections. Although the study does not assign a cost to mismatching volunteers with voters, it suggests that campaigns could better utilize their volunteers to reduce the risk that they inadvertently turn voters away.The most liberal people  young, from out of state  are the ones who are spending their time out knocking on doors, Mr. Enos said in a telephone interview. He described seeing many of his own government students from Harvard volunteer for field work in the Obama campaign in blue-collar or inner-city areas in other states. The Obama campaign at times encouraged volunteers to veer from the scripts it provided for such interactions, which may have resulted in volunteers own interests superseding those of the campaign.He said campaigns might not be thinking about the full range of volunteers available. Older volunteers are at the office entering data when some of them might be better matched with voters more like them, he said.Although the paper looked only at Obama campaign volunteers, there are implications for other campaigns and parties. The authors conclude that parties and campaigns tend to attract highly ideological volunteers who are driven mainly by a single issue like health insurance or abortion rather than broader issues like the economy or education. Midterm elections, which dont have the broad appeal of a presidential election, might even exacerbate this condition because they tend to attract partisan loyalists.The authors got permission from the Obama campaign to have their survey of ideology randomly appear as part of the software that volunteers used when contacting voters. The survey was taken by 3,095 volunteers, some more than once, and showed that Obamas 2012 campaign workers were extremely liberal, even relative to strong Democrats who match the observable demographic profile of the workers.Mr. Enos said the imbalance most likely extended to Republican campaigns as well.",2014-11-08,abortion

Here is Bloombergs Dave Weigel on some of the Texas-specific elements of that failure; here is my colleague Jonathan Martin on the broader pattern:While Republicans celebrated their showing in fast-growing swing states like Colorado, Democrats were deflated that their candidates did not perform better in Georgia and Texas, where they believed that demographic shifts, especially the growing ranks of Hispanic voters, were making the terrain more competitive.Jason Carter and Michelle Nunn  the highly touted Georgia Democrats with famous last names who ran for governor and the Senate  both lost by eight percentage points, far worse than had been expected. The results were even more grim for Democrats in Texas, where the party poured tens of millions of dollars into an effort to make Wendy Daviss bid for governor competitive and lay the groundwork for future advancement.Now: It should be said, and many people are saying it, that Davis and her team ran a poorer-than-expectedcampaign overall, and that the allegedly-brilliant team running the Democrats new Texas ground game were not in fact so brilliant. But the more important issue, surely, is that the Democrats decided that it made sense to run, well, Wendy Davis as their change-the-map candidate in Texas. Nunn and Carter in Georgia were nominations that fit reasonably well with the facts on the ground, and while they obviously disappointed Nunn did at least outperform the last two Democratic Senate nominees in her state. Davis, on the other hand, actually underperformed the Democratic nominees totals in the last two head-to-head races against Rick Perry  which is, again, pretty much exactly what youd expect when you nominate a figure who owed her prominence to a filibuster on late-term abortion to contest a statewide rate in Texas.Yes, the social conservatism of Hispanics, while real enough, is sometimes overstated; yes, polling on abortion is always fluid and complicated, in red states as well as blue. But it still should be obvious that if your long-term political vision requires consolidating and mobilizing a growing Hispanic bloc in a state thats much more religious and conservative than average, nominating a culture-war lightning rod is just about the strangest possible way to go about realizing that goal, no matter what kind of brilliant get out the vote strategy you think youve conjured up or how much national money you think shell raise. It would be a little bit like, I dont know, nominating a political-novice Tea Partier who owed her prior fame to a pro-abstinence campaign to contest a winnable race in a deep-blue, more-secular-than-average northeastern state. Not that the Republican Party would ever accidentally do anything like that, of course.But even that joke is part of the point: The Christine ODonnell thing really did happen more or less by accident, because she happened to be in the right place at the right time to catch an anti-establishment wave and win a primary in which she was supposed to be a protest candidate. Whereas the Davis experiment was intentionally designed: She was treated to fawning press coverage, lavished with funding, had the primary field mostly cleared for her, and was touted repeatedly as part of an actual party strategy for competing in a conservative-leaning state. Of course she had a much more impressive resume than ODonnell, with less witchcraft and realpolitical experience, and in that sense she made a more credible candidate overall. (Though, ahem, ODonnell actually outperformed Davis at the polls in the end ) But in terms of their signature issues and their public profiles, they were equally absurd fits for the tasks they were assigned; its just that in Daviss case nobody on the left of center wanted to acknowledge it.In that sense, the Wendy Davis experiment isnt just an example of how media bias on culture-war issues can hurt Democrats (by leading them into fond delusions) as well as help them. Its also a case study in the phenomenon I was talking about earlier this week, the way that political elites can effectively choose the kind of coalitional strategies that have given us our current weird midterm-presidential see-saw. A lot of smart liberals  including, in different ways,Jamelle Bouie and Will Saletan in pieces for Slate today are writing about that see-saw as though its just abrute fact, an inevitable reality on which all strategic thinking should be founded. But Daviss strange candidacy suggests that some of the ways in which the polarization we have exists because of leaders as well as followers, elites as well as ordinary voters.No blind historical or demographic process forced the Democrats to elevate Davis rather than a candidate better suited to her state. But she was the one they really wanted, which means that they chose the entirely-foreseeable result.",2014-11-07,abortion

Instead, voters ratified many of the ideas that animated the conservative wave in 2010.For clues about how the newly elected will govern when they take office in January, look to how they got there in the first place.Voters were clear about their wishes. As in 2010, they were concerned about the border and immigration. They remain wary of the federal government, particularly the Democrat in the White House. And they seem to think things are going just fine in Texas, which in politics means most incumbents are safe.They also rejected the notion that the state could use a little more blue in its political palette.This years mandates come as much from the Republican primaries of last spring as the general election. For most of the statewide winners, the March primaries were much more difficult, with more debates, forums and policy differences than the general election contests.Lt. Gov.-elect Dan Patrick only debated once with his Democratic opponent, Senator Leticia Van de Putte. The primary was different, pitting him against three statewide officials and featuring debates and arguments over issues like Senate rules, abortion laws, immigration and the states duties on the border. Mr. Patrick ran to the right during the primary, pushing the other candidates into a conversation about who was the most conservative  and winning the support of voters along the way.The significance of that: Mr. Patrick made few adjustments when it came time to debate Ms. Van de Putte. Instead of softening his positions to attract more moderate voters, Mr. Patrick stayed the course, talking up the same positions that he had taken in a Republican primary dominated by the states most conservative voters.He had it right, according to this weeks election results. Turnout was abysmal  even lower than in 2010  but voters choice was clear: Mr. Patrick won by nearly 20 percentage points. Republicans swept the statewide offices as they have done every year since 1996. The partys candidates won in the only Congressional and State Senate races deemed competitive, and added three seats in the State House, bringing them to within two of a supermajority.Greg Abbotts winning margin in the governors race was even larger than Mr. Patricks, surpassing Gov. Rick Perrys re-election numbers in 2010 as Wendy Davis, a Democrat, fell well short of the mark set by Bill White that year.Mr. Abbott said in one TV ad that a vote for Ms. Davis was essentially a vote for President Obama. It even featured a nameplate on an official-looking desk: Gov. Barack Obama. That was the current variation on 2010s catching melody of Texas vs. Washington, and it was popular. That theme gives the winners the opportunity to operate the state the way Republican primary voters would like to see it run, without worrying that general election voters might disagree.After all, voters handed them a lopsided endorsement. Mr. Abbott, announcing his transition plans the day after the election, laid out a wish list that included job creation, elevating our schools, and building the states transportation and water infrastructure. He maintained the distance he created during the campaign between his view of state business incentive funds and Gov. Perrys view, saying the programs need evaluation and some overhaul. And he picked up the federalism cudgel again.Americans want people in office to address their priorities, he said. It wasnt just in Texas. They want to see government officials at all levels doing all they can to secure the border. They want government to get out of their lives as much as possible, let the private sector create jobs.

She especially doesnt like to give up pieces from her collection made by artists who are her friends, which, it seems, just about every artist happens to be.But Ms. Gund said she felt she had to sell the two paintings and other works in recent years to be able to continue the charitable giving that has made her one of New York Citys most prominent philanthropists.I get income, but I dont have a big swath of money to invest in things, said Ms. Gund, whose father, George Gund II, made his fortune as an Ohio banker. Ms. Gund says she tends to give away more money than I really have. Ive had to sell a lot of art, which Ive hated to do because I really love the art I have, she said in a recent interview at her Midtown Manhattan office. Some of the things Ive sold, Ive had for 40 years.Ms. Gund could, of course, give less than the $6 million to $7 million a year she typically donates through the A G Foundation. But that would require resisting the pull of causes that move her, like arts education, or getting better at saying no to the many requests that come from cultural institutions and womens organizations  her two main areas of concentration.Moreover, at age 76, Ms. Gund is not likely to change her ways. So instead, she finds herself running around to museum parties, gallery openings and high-powered dinner parties that keep her out about five nights a week  often attending multiple events in one evening.On this particular night, for example, she planned to stop by the Marian Goodman Gallery to see the artist William Kentridge at the opening of his exhibition after attending the annual gala of the Studio Museum in Harlem.The week before, she introduced Ellsworth Kelly at the World Monuments Fund Hadrian Award Gala. Last week, she presented the Smithsonian Institutions Archives of American Art Medal to Claes Oldenburg. Im trying not to take on new things, Ms. Gund said. Ive got to keep a lid on the honoree thing. Sonia tries to keep me on course.Sonia Lopez has been Ms. Gunds philanthropic adviser since 2000. But given Ms. Gunds apparently indefatigable energy and undisciplined generosity, there is only so much reining in Ms. Lopez can do.We have a not anymore list, Ms. Gund said, referring to her often-unsuccessful effort to phase out some recipients of her largess.Her days are also packed. She is active on the boards of the Museum of Modern Art (where she is president emerita and chairwoman of the International Council); MoMA PS1 Contemporary Art Center (chairwoman); and Studio in a School (chairwoman), a nonprofit organization she founded in 1977 in response to budget cuts that virtually eliminated arts classes from New York City public schools.She just couldnt believe that a city that had such rich art could have a school system that did not prepare students to enjoy the art and participate, said Thomas Cahill, Studios president and chief executive. Shes taken this from something that started in a handful of schools to reaching 170 schools in all five boroughs.Ms. Gund has also been on the boards of the Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island City and the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, where she continues to serve on the philanthropy committee. In 1997, Ms. Gund received the National Medal of the Arts from President Clinton.In addition, she has been a member of the New York State Council on the Arts since 2012; and she was chairwoman of the Cultural Affairs Advisory Commission of New York City. She serves on the boards of Chess-in-the-Schools, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, and the Foundation for Art and Preservation in Embassies.Ms. Gund regularly traipses around to artists studios, and she has been close to some of contemporary arts brightest stars, both established and emerging. Among the more prominent friends whose names come up in casual conversation with Ms. Gund are Ellsworth (Kelly), Roy (Lichtenstein), Jasper (Johns) and Frank (Stella).Her personal collection of 2,000 artworks  distributed between her New York apartment and her Connecticut country house  includes works by many of these artists, along with Gorky, Rauschenberg, Richard Serra and Kara Walker. Ms. Gund says she collects works of female artists and black artists. And if artists paint, draw and sculpt, she likes to have examples of all three types of their work.Artists always feel so honored to be in her collection, said Thelma Golden, the director of the Studio Museum in Harlem.When discussing Ms. Gund, people in the art world tend to gush. She was the first person who helped us, said the sculptor Mark di Suvero, who founded Socrates Sculpture Park. She came in at a moment that allowed us to continue.Ms. Gund has a particularly long track record at MoMA  she joined its board in 1976 and served as its president from 1991 until 2002. She estimates that she has donated 250 works of art to the museum  maybe more.Shes given so much to the institution, said Jerry I. Speyer, the board chairman. She helped build the collection. Shes led the way in terms of contemporary art.Ms. Gund has also given art to other museums, like the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Cleveland Museum of Art  her childhood museum, where she used to go for drawing classes and lunch (my favorite part).But she also gets fired up about womens issues, like sex trafficking and abortion rights. This is a woman who has, in her core, supported women getting ahead in such a range of issues, whether as artists or as leaders in womens rights, said Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood.Ms. Gund shows no sign of slowing her pace or cutting back her commitments. At a time when she could just be enjoying her 12 grandchildren, (she has been divorced twice and has four children from her first marriage), Ms. Gund seems perpetually on the move  attending board meetings, holding fund-raisers at her home or looking at art.Shes always working, said Klaus Biesenbach, the director of MoMA PS 1.

Mandating a formal hospital affiliation is a popular tactic deployed by opponents of abortion rights to close abortion clinics. But as leading medical groups attest, it is unnecessary for insuring the proper emergency treatment of women who experience complications, which are exceedingly rare. Admitting privileges are regularly denied for reasons having nothing to do with a physicians professional competence, including local hostility to abortion rights or a hospitals religious sponsorship.The Center for Reproductive Rights is challenging Oklahomas admitting privileges rule on behalf of Dr. Larry Burns, who performs more than 40 percent of all abortions in Oklahoma and has been unable to obtain admitting privileges at a hospital near his clinic  one of just three remaining abortion facilities in the state.The other blocked provision would force women seeking an early medication abortion to use an outdated protocol approved by the Food and Drug Administration 14 years ago, which is less safe and more expensive than the method most doctors use today. Under current standard practice, abortion-inducting drugs are prescribed off label at different doses and for use up to two weeks later than the old regimen permits, allowing more women who have decided to end a pregnancy to avoid a surgical procedure.The state Supreme Court orders are silent on the validity of the two restrictions. But at least they will avoid hard-to-reverse clinic closures, as well as undue interference with womens lives and sound medical practice, at least until the constitutionality of the provisions is fully and finally litigated. These days, that counts as a victory.",2014-11-06,abortion

She was 81.The cause was lung cancer, her brother, Richard Murray, said. A resident of Manhattan, she had been in hospice care in the Bronx.As an assistant in the United States attorneys office in Manhattan, Mrs. Harris helped prosecute the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the leader of the Unification Church, on tax evasion charges, as well as Imelda Marcos, the widow of former President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, on corruption charges.As the first woman to head the Justice Departments criminal division, she supervised 400 lawyers, created a computer crime section and set up a task force to investigate violence against abortion clinics. She led the early part of the investigation into the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995.The House of Representatives impeached Mr. Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998, on the grounds that he had lied about and covered up his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a 22-year-old White House intern. The charges were perjury and obstruction of justice. In a trial that ended the following February, the Senate voted not to convict the president. But significant questions lingered about the government lawyers interview with Ms. Lewinsky at the outset of the investigation, in January 1998.Mrs. Harris entered the fray after Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who had directed the investigation that led to impeachment, resigned in 1999. In February 2000, his replacement, Robert W. Ray, appointed Mrs. Harris and a colleague, Mary Frances Harkenrider, to investigate the much-discussed episode as special counsels.They produced a 100-page report on their findings.The encounter with Ms. Lewinsky, they found, began around noon on Jan. 16, 1998, at a food court at the Pentagon City mall, where Ms. Lewinsky had expected to meet her friend Linda Tripp. She was seized by government lawyers and F.B.I agents and taken to a hotel room, where she was grilled for 12 12 hours.Ms. Lewinsky had earlier signed a sworn affidavit denying that she had an affair with the president; the affidavit was in connection with a sexual harassment suit against Mr. Clinton by Paula Jones, a former state employee in Arkansas, where Mr. Clinton had been governor. But in the hotel room, the lawyers challenged Ms. Lewinskys story, telling her that they knew of the affair, citing telephone calls with her that Ms. Tripp had secretly taped and shared with prosecutors. They told Ms. Lewinsky that she could go to jail for up to 27 years for perjury if she continued to deny the affair.Ms. Lewinsky repeatedly asked to speak to her lawyer, the special counsels report said, but was told that doing so would make her less valuable as a prosecution witness and therefore less likely to be treated leniently. The report described Ms. Lewinsky as crying, sobbing, regaining her composure, screaming.But if she had been able to call her lawyer, the lawyer might have called the judge in Arkansas who held the affidavit and asked that it not be opened, according to Ken Gormley, the dean of Duquesne Universitys law school, in an interview with NPR in 2010. He wrote a book on the impeachment, The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr.Without the affidavit, the government would have had less influence on Ms. Lewinsky. With it, and with Ms. Tripps evidence, it had enough to elicit from Ms. Lewinsky an admission of an affair in grand jury testimony in July. She also turned over a semen-stained blue dress, providing DNA evidence of Mr. Clintons involvement in the affair.The special counsels found no evidence of prosecutorial misconduct but said that the lead lawyer had exercised poor judgment and made mistakes in his analysis, planning and execution of the approach to Lewinsky.In an interview with Politico in 2009, Mrs. Harris was more caustic about the interrogation. I wouldnt have touched it with a 10-foot pole, she was quoted as saying. Referring to Ms. Lewinsky, she added: The minute she says, Can I call my lawyer? you stop. And when she says it for the sixth or seventh time, you really stop. There are limits.She was born Jo Ann Murray in Macomb, Ill., on May 18, 1933, and grew up in Galesburg, Ill. She earned a bachelors degree in journalism from the University of Iowa in 1955, then worked for Time and other magazines before deciding to study law at New York University, where she received a degree in 1972. She clerked for Lawrence W. Pierce, a federal judge in Manhattan.In 1974 she became an assistant United States attorney in the Southern District of New York and rose to deputy chief of the criminal division. In 1979, she became chief of the fraud section in the criminal division of the Justice Department in Washington, where she oversaw early prosecutions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.She returned to Manhattan in 1981 as executive assistant to United States Attorney John Martin. She had worked 10 years in the private sector when Mr. Clinton made her head of the Justice Departments criminal division in 1993. She later taught at Pace University School of Law.Her husband, Allen G. Harris, known as Greg  one of the first black television news correspondents in Vietnam  died in 2004. Besides her brother, she is survived by a stepson, a stepdaughter and four grandchildren.In a statement after Mrs. Harriss death, Ms. Lewinsky said she had recently tried to convey her gratitude to her.",2014-11-06,abortion

Andrew M. Cuomo in a powerful position, allowing him to play deal maker between Republicans and Democrats.","Liberal activists were left seething over his feeble efforts to help fellow Democrats. Republicans, even in defeat, could point to the many counties across upstate New York that he failed to win.But Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo emerged from his Election Day victory with something arguably more consequential: an unencumbered path, and perhaps a renewed validation, for the kind of centrism that has long been his political brand.By the traditional standards of party loyalty, it was a setback for Mr. Cuomo on Tuesday when Republicans captured the State Senate in convincing fashion, since the party stands in the way of a number of his liberal goals.But Republicans also have much in common with the governor, who has doggedly and unapologetically sought to curb spending and cut taxes. The continuation of a divided Legislature keeps Mr. Cuomo in a powerful position, allowing him to play deal maker between Republicans and Democrats for another two years.It gives him a chance to show people the type of leader he can be, whatever his aspirations may be ultimately, said Senator Joseph A. Griffo, a Republican from Rome.He added that if liberal-leaning Democrats had won control of the entire Legislature, it could have been less a blessing than a curse for the centrist-minded Mr. Cuomo.A Republican-controlled Senate, Mr. Griffo said, helps him to counterbalance within his own political sphere some of the issues that he may not espouse.Senate Republicans are a known quantity to Mr. Cuomo, who has taken pride in getting on-time budgets passed and restoring order in the Capitol. In fact, he worked so harmoniously with Republicans during the first two years of his term that he declined to help Democrats retake the chamber in 2012, frustrating some members of his party.This year, Mr. Cuomo entered into an arranged marriage with Senate Democrats: He agreed to help them reclaim the chamber in exchange for an endorsement from the Working Families Party, a group of unions and liberal activists. But after securing the partys ballot line, he ended up doing little to help Democratic Senate candidates.He got what he wanted, said Christina Greer, an assistant professor of political science at Fordham University. He got the line, he got the win, and hell govern from the center.Doing so, she added, would also provide Mr. Cuomo with an attractive message to voters, particularly if he pursues a bid for president.Thats a great narrative to say, I can still get things done in a bipartisan fashion, Dr. Greer said.Mr. Cuomos campaign released several television ads that showcased his success at getting Democrats and Republicans to work together. And while saying he wanted his party to win control of the Senate, he emphasized his ability to do business with anyone.You have wild liberals, you have ultraconservatives, he told reporters in September. My job is to figure how to work with them, and figure out how to get all of them to a place where theyre satisfied or they have a win.Working with the Republicans, Mr. Cuomo will face a more difficult road in passing some of the liberal agenda items he cited in the campaign, including measures to protect abortion rights, raise the minimum wage, grant tuition aid to undocumented students and provide public financing for political campaigns.Senate Democrats somewhat ruefully looked ahead to the next rematch. I think the Republican majority will be short-lived, said Senator Michael N. Gianaris of Queens, chairman of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. I hope they enjoy the next two years.But John McArdle, a former top aide to Senate Republicans, predicted Mr. Cuomo would find them a very good partner as long as he pursued an agenda focused more on economic policy.That will be the key: whether the governor focuses on the bread-and-butter issues, the issues that most people are concerned with, or whether he again tries to tack left, he said.In interviews, several Republican senators said Mr. Cuomos desire to create jobs and address burdensome property taxes lined up with their priorities.Senator Martin J. Golden, a Republican from Brooklyn, recalled increases in taxes and spending when Democrats ran the Senate in 2009 and 2010. Had Democrats won on Tuesday, Mr. Golden said, wed be on that runaway train again.Amid the ferment on the left, business leaders said they were hopeful about the prospect of the Republican-controlled Senate working with Mr. Cuomo.Hes been able to get the kind of results that have eluded the powers in Washington, said Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City. I think were in a good place for that to continue.",2014-11-06,abortion

Most were contests of political blame, driven by ideological hatred for President Obama. But when the ballot offered a choice on an actual policy, rather than between candidates with a D or R next to their names, voters made notably liberal decisions in both red and blue states.On at least six high-profile and often contentious issues  minimum wage, marijuana legalization, criminal justice reform, abortion rights, gun control and environmental protection  voters approved ballot measures, in some cases overwhelmingly, that were directly at odds with the positions of many of the Republican winners.MINIMUM WAGE Initiatives to raise the minimum wage appeared on the ballots in four deep-red states  Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota  and passed in all of them. The new hourly minimums range from $8.50 in Arkansas by 2017 to $9.75 in Alaska by 2016. Minimum-wage increases were also approved in San Francisco (to $15 an hour by 2018) and Oakland (to $12.25 an hour by 2015). In all, an estimated 609,000 low-wage workers will see raises from these approved increases.In addition, voters in Illinois and in several cities and counties in Wisconsin approved nonbinding measures calling for minimums of $10 or more. If legislators follow through on the voters will, 1.1 million workers in those states would see raises.The latest increases bring to 29 the number of states that exceed, or soon will exceed, the paltry federal minimum of $7.25 an hour, which has been in place since 2009. They underscore the broad support for higher minimums and suggest that Republicans who continue to oppose a higher federal minimum could pay a price in the 2016 elections, when lower-wage workers and those who support them could turn out in higher numbers.MARIJUANA  Oregon and Alaska became the third and fourth states to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes (Colorado and Washington were the first two), while the District of Columbia repealed all criminal and civil penalties for possession and allowed limited, private cultivation of the drug.Even where pro-legalization measures lost, advocates had reason to feel positive. A proposed constitutional amendment in Florida to legalize medical marijuana received 57 percent of the vote, but it still failed because amendments there require at least 60 percent approval.Before Tuesdays election, it was already clear that Americans had turned against prohibition because more than 30 states had liberalized their marijuana laws. Maybe elected officials, who have lagged behind the public on this issue, will finally have the courage to embrace change.CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM For the second time in three years, Californians voted to shorten the sentences of people serving time in prison. The state  which created the notorious three-strikes law  remains under federal court order to reduce prison overcrowding.In 2012, voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 36, which has led to the early release of more than 1,900 three-strikers serving life in prison. And there has not been an increase in crime. Proposition 47 on this weeks ballot converts low-level drug and property offenses  like shoplifting, writing bad checks or simple drug possession  from felonies to misdemeanors. It is expected to reduce the sentences of as many as 10,000 inmates.On Tuesday, the measure, which enjoyed broad bipartisan support, passed with more than 58 percent of the vote. Many politicians are still afraid of looking soft on crime, but Californias experience shows that voters can lead the way.ABORTION RIGHTS The overwhelming rejection of personhood measures in Colorado and North Dakota dealt another well-deserved blow to the effort by some opponents of reproductive rights to ban all abortions (and some common forms of contraception) by passing laws giving fertilized eggs legal rights and protections that apply to individuals.The defeat in Colorado was not unexpected. Voters there handily quashed earlier personhood initiatives in 2008 and 2010, and they were not deceived by this rounds revised wording. But few expected a similar proposal to be rejected by 64 percent of voters in North Dakota, a conservative state that  like Mississippi, which roundly defeated a personhood initiative three years ago  has just one abortion provider remaining.Unfortunately, opponents of abortion rights scored a victory in Tennessee, where nearly 53 percent of voters approved a state constitutional amendment that gives the Republican-led State Legislature leeway to curtail access to safe and legal abortion care. While nothing will change immediately, there will likely be a rush to enact new abortion restrictions beyond those already in place in the months ahead. But politicians in Tennessee would be wrong to read Tuesdays relatively close vote as a mandate to obliterate a womans fundamental right.GUN CONTROL In the aftermath of the school massacre in 2012 in Newtown, Conn., Congress  caving to the National Rifle Association  did nothing to protect the public from gun violence. In Washington State, a campaign started by outraged church and community leaders fared much better. Initiative 594, which will require criminal and mental-health checks on gun buyers, drew an impressive 60 percent voter support on Tuesday.Just as important, the gun lobbys measure  Initiative 591, which was on the same ballot  would have blocked background checks and was defeated by 55 percent of the vote. Other campaigns are underway at the statehouse level, supported by former New York City mayor Michael Bloombergs well-financed gun-safety movement and others. Opponents decried Mr. Bloombergs campaign as outside interference but got nowhere this time.CONSERVATION Environmentalists who may be singing the blues over the election results can take heart from approval of a record $13 billion in land conservation measures in states and cities across the country. Two were especially significant.In Florida, a constitutional amendment will dedicate $9 billion in real estate transfer taxes over the next 20 years to preserving open spaces, including major investments in the threatened Everglades.New Jersey voters dedicated $2.15 billion in corporate tax revenue to land conservation, also over the next 20 years, rescuing a popular program that was on the verge of extinction.

You just have to look for them.,"Our topic for today is: looking on the post-election bright side.The polling places hadnt even opened before the Senates right-wing firebrand, Ted Cruz, was demanding that the majority-leader in-waiting, Mitch McConnell, take a hard line against President Obama or risk losing his new job. Cruz is from Texas, and he wants to recreate the Alamo, if you can imagine Obamacare in disguise as the Mexican Army.Think of that as a plus. The one thing McConnell and his supporters dislike more than the Democratic agenda is Ted Cruz. It could be an important bonding opportunity. President Obama has never spent much time with the Republican leadership, but now you can sort of imagine them sitting around, sipping drinks and making fun of what Cruz said on Fox News.Another potential downer: Republicans have fewer veteran women in the Senate, so when they take over there will be fewer women running important committees. But, on the plus side, the overall number of women in Congress will rise, albeit at a rate that would get us to equal representation sometime around 2078. Once all the votes are counted, Debbie Walsh, the director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, says the percentage of women in the House and Senate, now 18.2 percent, will, at best, go up to maybe 19.3 percent.Were calling it Not a Landmark Year, Walsh said.This could be a useful exercise in living with lowered expectations. Washington might actually want to embrace Not a Landmark Year as a slogan. If Ted Cruz tries to get the House Republicans to run the country off a fiscal cliff, the moderates could start chanting: NALY! NALY!Lets try one more positive interpretation of what the election has wrought: Theres a school of thought that believes Tuesday was actually a great day for reproductive rights. Let me take you through it.The front lines of the anti-abortion movement belong to the personhood people, who strive to give constitutional rights and protections to the preborn from the moment of conception. When Americans are confronted with this idea, they quickly come to hate it. Personhood amendments have been defeated wherever they pop up, including Mississippi. This year, one was rejected in Colorado for the third time, by around 65 percent to 35 percent. A personhood amendment lost in North Dakota, 64 percent to 36 percent. In addition, the state senator who was its major sponsor lost her re-election bid, as did one of the measures more outspoken House supporters.We are only mentioning those last details because the number of state legislators who are defeated for re-election in this country is about as low as the number of state legislators who are endowed with the power of levitation.This year, not only were the personhood proposals rejected, candidates who had previously supported the movement started madly backing away. The most famous example was in Colorado, where Representative Cory Gardner, the Republican Senate candidate, suddenly realized a state personhood amendment was a bad idea. In a move that left debate questioners incredulous, Gardner insisted that a personhood bill he had co-sponsored in Congress would have no effect, but was simply a statement that I support life.Gardner also announced that he believed birth control pills should be available over the counter. He made a TV ad about it and sent out pink mailings.Gardners turnaround was so swift and strange that the incumbent senator, Mark Udall, made it the center of his campaign. A Denver Post editorial claimed it was Udalls obnoxious obsession. Now to me, obnoxious is a candidate who steals his opponents yard signs. Or who opposes abortions except for the one he pressured his mistress to get, like that guy in Tennessee. But whatever. Udall lost.Planned Parenthood sent out a press release describing Colorado as an absolute triumph: Voters have made clear that you cant win statewide elections in Colorado by openly opposing womens health and restricting access to safe and legal abortion.The theory here  and I am really going to go with it  is that the real story is not anti-choice Republicans weaseling around their political history, but voters of America forcing anti-choice candidates to change their positions.Cory Gardner ran aggressively as a supporter of womens issues. It was sort of a miraculous conversion. Well be happy to hold him to it, said Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in a phone interview.The question is what happens when people like Gardner get into office. McConnell promised that hed bring up a bill in the Senate banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Would the repentant personhood backers go along? At the very least, they would appear to be obliged to add language vastly expanding womens access to free birth control.O.K., its not an ideal compromise. But then its not a landmark year.",2014-11-06,abortion

The measure was intended to nullify a state court ruling that a right to privacy in the State Constitution prohibited some of the abortion restrictions adopted in neighboring states, like instructions about what doctors must tell patients.We are grateful to God and to the good people of Tennessee for this victory, said Brian Harris, president of Tennessee Right to Life and a coordinator of the ballot campaign.Ashley Coffield, the president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Greater Memphis, said the amendment puts Tennessee women in a very vulnerable place.Well fight any legislation the General Assembly brings up that we believe creates barriers and is not intended to protect womens health and safety, she said.Abortion rights supporters took solace in the defeat, in Colorado and North Dakota, of proposals to grant personhood rights to human embryos and fetuses. The amendments were seen as legally unwise even by some mainstream anti-abortion groups, who feared they could lead to a crushing court defeat. Similar proposals have now been rejected by voters in Colorado three times, and by voters in the conservative bastions of Mississippi and North Dakota.But the wider Republican gains in the states are likely to add to the rush of abortion restrictions, from two-day waiting periods to bans at 20 weeks after conception to costly building requirements, that have been adopted in the last several years.As in 2010, when Republicans made large gains, social issues like abortion were not a major factor in the campaigns. But once in office, the newly dominant Republican legislators passed scores of new abortion restrictions.Ilyse Hogue, president of Naral Pro-Choice America, said that some of the victorious Republican candidates for governor had moderated their statements about abortion during the campaign, hoping to attract more women and centrist voters.In the coming year, she pledged, these elected officials will be held to account more directly than in the past.Were going to be tracking state bills and asking loud questions of governors who said they were running to expand opportunities for everyone, but then spend taxpayer resources trying to shrink our choices, she said.The Republican takeover of the Senate, and the expected ascendancy of Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as majority leader, make it likely that bitterly divisive debates over abortion will flare anew in Washington.Last year, the House passed a bill that would ban abortions at 20 weeks after conception nationwide, based on a theory disputed by mainstream scientists that the fetus can feel pain at that point. The proposal, a top priority of the anti-abortion movement, was blocked by the Senate controlled by the Democrats.Variations of 20-week bans are in effect in 10 states, but were blocked by courts in three. Legal experts say they violate Supreme Court rulings (stemming from Roe v. Wade, a 1973 ruling) that women have a right to an abortion until the fetus is viable, which is usually around 22 weeks after conception.Senator McConnell has in the past promised to press for a nationwide 20-week ban. If he does make it a priority, Democrats are likely to try to stop it with a filibuster. As a last resort, President Obama would almost certainly veto it.Ms. Hogue, of Naral, said that rights advocates would hope to counter the proposal by focusing on legislators who had expressed mixed views on abortion. They will stress how unusual such late procedures are and how complicated and heart-rending the decisions tend to be, adding that it is the last thing that government should get involved with.The personal stories of women who have faced this incredible decision are very persuasive, she said.",2014-11-06,abortion

New England states have not voted for a Republican for president in years, even spurning one of their own, Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, in 2012.But in Tuesdays midterm elections, New England, long considered a bastion of liberalism, proved friendly territory for Republicans. The regions all-Democratic House delegations will have two Republican members, one from New Hampshire and one from Maine.In Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, the Republican nominee for governor, inched past Martha Coakley, the Democrat, who conceded on Wednesday.In Vermont, the Republican Scott Milne came out of nowhere and nearly toppled Gov. Peter Shumlin, who, because of a quirk of Vermont law, will have to be formally named governor by the Legislature because he did not get 50 percent of the vote.Two other Democrats, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy in Connecticut and Senator Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire, barely held their seats against Republican challengers. In Maine, the Republican governor, Paul LePage, won re-election despite deep unhappiness with him, and the State Senate flipped to Republican control.It is not that Republicans are unknown in New England. Massachusetts has a history of electing Republican governors like William F. Weld and Mr. Romney to serve as a check on the Democratic legislature. Susan Collins, the moderate Republican from Maine, was elected to the Senate in 1996, and Kelly Ayotte, of New Hampshire, in 2010.But taken together, Tuesdays results were a setback for Democrats in this six-state region, which has not gone for a Republican for president since 2000, when New Hampshire voted for George W. Bush.New England, analysts said, is not immune from the discontent that has swept much of the country, though the visceral dislike of President Obama that is evident elsewhere is not as potent here.Even though this is deep blue New England, were still a part of the United States, said Jeffrey Berry, a political scientist at Tufts University.Beyond that, analysts cited several reasons for the poor Democratic outcomes and near misses. One is that moderate Republicans like Mr. Baker, who supports abortion rights and gay rights, have blurred the lines with their opponents. And Mr. Baker knows that to be successful, he has to work with the Democratic legislature.Asked Wednesday at a news conference what message he took from his narrow victory, Mr. Baker said that voters want us to work collaboratively and across the aisle to get stuff done.But analysts cautioned that, Mr. Bakers election aside, the results did not signal a resurgence of the moderate New England Republican.Its extinct, declared former Representative Barney Frank, once a liberal member of the Massachusetts delegation. LePage is a strident right-winger, and so are the two House members who were just elected. He called Ms. Collins of Maine a survivor, an exception that proves the rule.Others said that the receptiveness to Republicans in New England was more of a comment on failed Democratic performance than on anything positive about the Republicans.This isnt welling up from a sudden appreciation for the Republican Party, said Maurice Cunningham, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. Its a sign of discontent with what is going on right now, he said. Government isnt solving peoples problems, and to many ears, government means Democrats.Mr. Berry put it this way: With Democrats in power, if you want to throw the rascals out, theres only one alternative.Voters across New England told pollsters that the economy was their biggest concern, particularly job shortages and income inequality. Yet few of the candidates emphasized these issues, even as much of the region faced the continued loss of manufacturing jobs, soaring energy costs and theagingof its populations.In Rhode Island, where high unemployment has bedeviled the state for years, both major candidates for governor did focus on the economy  and a Democrat, Gina Raimondo, won, the first to be elected in two decades.Another factor is that while outsiders think most voters are Democrats, many are registered as independents.Sizable segments of the electorate have moved toward becoming independents or unenrolled, and candidates are now rising to try to appeal to them, said Anthony Corrado, a professor of government at Colby College. That independent streak is very New England. When voters think things are heading in the wrong direction, theyre willing to move to the other side.Of course, not everyone thinks Tuesdays outcomes spelled anything of larger significance. Deval Patrick, the Democratic governor of Massachusetts, shrugged when asked what it said that voters had elected a Republican to succeed him, telling reporters, I think it said he got more votes.",2014-11-06,abortion

And a campaign that began with exuberant expectations ended with her failing to do even as well as the last Texas Democrat to lose a race for governor: Bill White, a former mayor of Houston, who won 42 percent of the vote in 2010, compared with Ms. Daviss 39 percent in her defeat on Tuesday.The result in a year in which Democrats invested tens of millions of dollars in an effort to make Texas a competitive electoral landscape was a humiliating defeat that left analysts asking a simple question. Was it the fault of Ms. Davis and her often rocky campaign, or was it a sign that Texas is far too Republican for a Democrat to have a prayer?Clearly, there was some combination of the two, but everyone agreed that the problems went beyond her campaign.If the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Illinois, Maryland and Massachusetts couldnt carry President Obama across the finish line, how in Gods name is Wendy Davis supposed to do it in Texas? said Garry Mauro, a Democrat and former Texas land commissioner who lost the 1998 governors race to George W. Bush. The demographics are there for Texas to change right now, but we havent found a leader or an issue to carry us over the threshold of being a red state. Wendy ran a great campaign and I love her, but she never caught the imagination of a broad spectrum of Texans.Ms. Davis, who became a national figure with her filibuster against a state abortion law, had more name recognition than Mr. White had in 2010. She raised more money than he did and had the benefit of Battleground Texas, a huge field operation intended to increase Democratic turnout. None of it made a difference. In 2010, 2.1 million Democrats voted for Mr. White. On Tuesday, 1.8 million cast ballots for Ms. Davis.Republican victories for governor, lieutenant governor and other top seats left the partys dominance intact. In a statement, the Republican Party of Texas called it arguably the finest night in its modern history, as the entire Republican ticket for statewide offices won by significant margins. Texas Democrats have not won a governors race since the November 1990 election of Ann W. Richards, and have not won any of the nearly 30 other statewide elected offices since 1994.Such history is important to understanding Ms. Daviss loss. She faced not only a well-funded, powerful and careful Republican opponent, but also an entire conservative political culture.Democratic leaders are trying to sound upbeat, but their collective heart, having been torn out and stomped on, is clearly not in it, said Calvin Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Democrats will not be competitive again in Texas until they grow their share of the Anglo vote from its recent 25 to 30 percent toward 40 percent. That will be hard work, but it is work that simply must be done for Democrats to be more than an afterthought in statewide elections.No single factor doomed Ms. Davis. She struggled to connect with Hispanic voters, but Mr. Abbott made his own inroads by appearing in television ads and on billboards with his Hispanic mother-in-law. Ms. Davis also had trouble honing a message that appealed to both her liberal base and moderate Republicans. Some Democrats believed that even if Ms. Davis had run the perfect campaign, President Obamas unpopularity set the stage for her defeat.When you add the national anti-Democratic mood to the equation, it means that a Texas campaign can do a lot of things right and still not be able to find a foothold, said Harold Cook, a former executive director of the Texas Democratic Party.Others said the fault was more with Ms. Davis than with Mr. Obama.She won a total of 19 counties out of 254, which means this was undeniably a blood bath in Texas, said Matt Mackowiak, a Republican consultant in Austin. Wendy was seen as a pro-abortion candidate in a pro-life state.Ms. Davis and her allies can claim some successes. She raised more money  $38 million  than any Democratic candidate for governor ever has in Texas. Her campaign and Battleground Texas had nearly 34,000 volunteers, a state record. The group Planned Parenthood Texas Votes knocked on more than 460,000 doors. Battleground Texas cited an exit poll that showed that Ms. Davis won 92 percent of African-American votes, up from 88 percent for Mr. White in 2010.But those strides only highlighted the Democrats problems. If Ms. Davis could not turn that money and get-out-the-vote effort into a victory, or even a close race, then who will? Someone, someday, will, Democrats maintained, though they did not have much evidence to back that up. Ms. Daviss concession speech in her hometown, Fort Worth, made several references to enduring and winning. U2s Beautiful Day rang out over the loudspeakers at the end.If we believe hard enough and work hard enough and push long enough, we will win this battle, Ms. Davis said. We will. Because as Scripture tells us, the battle does not go to the swift or to the strong, but to the one who endures until the end.",2014-11-06,abortion

Nobody voted Republican to start a revolution. They did so because they were fed up with a Democratic president overreaching on health care and a government seemingly incapable of doing even the smallest thing effectively. We all know what happened when Mr. Gingrich tried to turn his rhetoric into action.Sound familiar? No one is quite saying revolution this week, but Republicans across the country, in their glee over Tuesdays elections, are coming dangerously close to making the same mistake.True, there will now be more Americans under Republican representation than at any time in decades. And the re-elections of G.O.P. governors in blue states like Michigan and Wisconsin are certainly a validation of their policies. It was a tsunami; someone needs to get the Democrats a towel. But that anti-Democrat wave was not the same as a pro-Republican endorsement. In many races that went from blue to red, Republican success was hardly because of what the G.O.P. has achieved on Capitol Hill. In fact, if Americans could speak with one collective voice  all 310 million of them  this is what they said Tuesday night: Washington doesnt listen, Washington doesnt lead and Washington doesnt deliver. Purple states tossed out their Democratic senators for being too close to Washington and too far from the people who put them there.The current narrative, that this election was a rejection of President Obama, misses the mark. So does the idea that it was a mandate for an extreme conservative agenda. According to a survey my firm fielded on election night for the political-advocacy organization Each American Dream, it was more important that a candidate shake up and change the way Washington operates.I didnt need a poll to tell me that. This year I traveled the country listening to voters, from Miami to Anchorage, 30 states and counting. And from the reddest rural towns to the bluest big cities, the sentiment is the same. People say Washington is broken and on the decline, that government no longer works for them  only for the rich and powerful.They voted out those who promised to do more in favor of those who said they would do less, but do it better. Thats why the Democratic candidates for governor who condemned their opponents for spending too little on education, transportation and programs for the poor and unemployed still lost. The results were less about the size of government than about making government efficient, effective and accountable. Our election night survey showed that 42 percent chose their Senate candidate because they hated the opponent more. One pre-election poll had over 70 percent willing to throw everyone out and start fresh.Winning on Election Day is not the end. The objective cant be just to bide time for the next election; thats a losing strategy. The mission has to be a restoration of confidence in the future. The question is: What can Republicans at all levels do to make this happen, and avoid repeating the mistakes of the past?First, hold Washington accountable. From the cover-ups of veterans dying while being denied care to using the I.R.S. to target conservative groups, recent scandals highlight the chasm between hard-working taxpayers and Washington. But this also means holding your colleagues accountable. No turning a blind eye to broken promises. If youre truly different, act truly differently.Second, make the peoples priorities your priorities. In our survey, the top priorities were making the government more efficient and controlling spending. So tackle deficits and the national debt, and root out the waste and abuse of government programs. Reduce the crippling red tape and regulations that are strangling small businesses. As the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, said, show that a Republican Congress has both the wisdom to listen and the courage to lead.Third, stop blustering and fighting. Americans despair of the pointless posturing, empty promises and bad policies that result. Show that you are more concerned with people than politics. Dont be afraid to work with your opponents if it means achieving real results. Democrats and Republicans disagree on a lot, but there are also opportunities of real national importance, like national security and passing the trans-Atlantic trade deal.Aside from a small activist constituency, Americans are not looking for another fight over same-sex marriage or abortion. This isnt to say that voters want their leaders to co-opt their convictions. People are simply tired of identity politics that pit men against women, black against white, wealthy against poor. More than ever, they want leadership that brings us together.This isnt about pride of ownership regarding American progress; this is about progress, period. Americans dont care about Democratic solutions or Republican solutions. They just want common-sense solutions that make everyday life just a little bit easier. But they cant get their houses in order until Washington gets its own house in order.",2014-11-06,abortion

John W. Hickenloopers narrow victory over Bob Beauprez defied a wave of Republican victories in races for governor in usual Democratic strongholds like Maryland, Massachusetts and Illinois.","DENVER   It was getting late on election night, and Gov. John W. Hickenlooper was trailing. Colorados senior United States senator, Mark Udall, had already conceded defeat, and other Democratic politicians were falling here and across the country. Political allies reported encouraging signs  long lines at college-town polling sites, strong support in Colorados suburban counties  but it was never supposed to be this close for Mr. Hickenlooper, a governor who had cast himself as a moderate, pro-energy Democrat at the helm of a growing Western economy.I feel nervous at every moment, Mr. Hickenlooper, watching results roll in, said in a hotel room above Denvers newly refurbished Union Station, his tie loosening with each passing hour. I feel nervous at every moment.By Wednesday morning, thousands of late votes from the Democratic bastions of Denver and Boulder had reversed the gap, giving Mr. Hickenlooper a narrow win that defied a wave of Republican victories in races for governor in usual Democratic strongholds like Maryland, Massachusetts and Illinois.His victory over his Republican challenger, the former congressman Bob Beauprez, also staved off a rout of Democrats in Colorado, a state where Democrats have flourished in recent years. Representative Cory Gardner decisively beat Mr. Udall to become the first Colorado Republican elected to the Senate in more than a decade, and Representative Mike Coffman, a Republican, handily rebuffed a Democratic challenge in a district that had been redrawn to include many immigrants.That Mr. Beauprez, a banker and bison rancher who lost his last bid for governor by 17 points, had come so close to beating Mr. Hickenlooper offered a warning to Democrats about the precariousness of power in a swing state that has embraced legal marijuana but roundly rejected tax increases to fund schools.At a news conference tinged with celebration and giddy relief, Mr. Hickenlooper theatrically wiped his brow and sketched out a second-term agenda that would focus on job growth and an education overhaul. He said he wanted to help the long-term unemployed as well as the economies of cities like Pueblo and Colorado Springs, where growth has lagged.Its a moment, an opportunity, to seize the bit and move forward, Mr. Hickenlooper said, in a nod to the dissatisfaction in conservative rural corners of the state.He said he had talked on the phone with Mr. Gardner, the newly elected senator, who promised that the two leaders would be able to work well together, though he did not say on what.Mr. Beauprez conceded the race for governor on Wednesday afternoon.It was still unclear on Wednesday whether Mr. Hickenlooper would govern with a divided legislature or one that retained Democratic control. County officials in suburban Denver were still sifting through ballots in close races that could determine control of the State Senate, which had a one-vote Democratic majority entering the elections.Colorado Democrats did celebrate at least one comeback: They reclaimed two State Senate seats that had been lost to Republicans in recall elections in September 2013 amid a rash of populist anger over Colorados new laws requiring background checks on private gun sales and limiting the size of ammunition magazines.Mr. Hickenloopers re-election victory was much narrower than his first win, in 2010, when he vaulted into office over a divided, dysfunctional Republican field as a former brewpub owner and Denver mayor who had endeared himself to voters with quirky, positive campaign ads.Mr. Hickenloopers win, by about 26,000 votes as of Wednesday afternoon, and Mr. Udalls 77,000-vote loss suggested a split verdict on Democratic candidates. Voters ratified a governor who had led the state through floods, fires and a mass shooting inside a movie theater, but they ousted a senator who had alienated some voters by focusing relentlessly on his opponents positions on abortion and birth control.One voter who split the ticket, William Kaufman, 25, a law student at the University of Colorado, Boulder, said Mr. Hickenlooper had run on his record while Mr. Udall had run a fear-mongering campaign against Mr. Gardner. As a result, Mr. Kaufman said, he voted for both Mr. Gardner and Mr. Hickenlooper.At the end of the day, he said, I found myself appreciating Hickenloopers track record.",2014-11-06,abortion

No longer.Despite efforts to distance themselves from President Obama, none of the Democratic Senate candidates in the South outdid his 2012 results on Tuesday. Democrats lost Senate races, sometimes by wide margins, in Kentucky, Georgia, Louisiana, Arkansas and North Carolina, most of which were thought to be competitive for much of the year. They nearly lost in Virginia, where they were thought to be heavy favorites and where The New York Times has not yet projected a winner.The inability of Southern Democrats to run well ahead of a deeply unpopular Mr. Obama raises questions about how an increasingly urban and culturally liberal national Democratic Party can compete in the staunchly conservative South. It raises serious doubts about whether a future Democratic presidential candidate, like Hillary Clinton, can count on faring better among Southern white voters than President Obama, as many political analysts have assumed she might.The Democrats running in the South this election season were not weak candidates. They had distinguished surnames, the benefits of incumbency, the occasional conservative position and in some cases flawed opponents. They were often running in the states where Southern Democrats had the best records of outperforming the national party. Black turnout was not low, either, nearly reaching the same proportion of the electorate in North Carolina, Louisiana and Georgia as in 2012.Yet none of them  not Mary Landrieu, Alison Lundergan Grimes, Michelle Nunn, Kay Hagan, Mark Pryor or Mark Warner  was able to run Tuesday more than a few points ahead of President Obamas historically poor performance among Southern white voters in 2012, based on county-level results and exit polls. There were some predominantly white counties in every state where the Senate candidates ran behind Mr. Obama, even in the former Democratic strongholds of Kentucky and Arkansas.Perhaps most symbolic of the Democratic struggle was Ms. Nunn. She was the strongest Democratic Senate nominee of the cycle by some accounts: a prodigious fund-raiser and the daughter of a popular former senator. She had never run for office and thus had no record for which she could be easily attacked. And her opponent, David Perdue, was a corporate executive who once said that he was proud of his record of outsourcing.Yet Ms. Nunn was defeated by nearly eight percentage points in Georgia  the same margin by which Mr. Obama lost to Mitt Romney in the state two years ago. She may have fared somewhat better than Mr. Obama among white voters, but not by much. She ran no better than Mr. Obama  or even behind him  in many of the states whitest counties.The most surprising result was probably the close race in Virginia, where Mark Warner leads by just a half percentage point after having been favored by a wide margin. Some election watchers werent even paying attention to Virginia coming into Election Day.Mr. Warner had a long record of performing well among the states culturally Southern voters. His success in appealing to so-called Nascar voters appeared in nearly every media profile over the last decade. The lore was well founded in the results: Mr. Warner swept the southern half of the state when he won the governors mansion in 2001, and then he won nearly every county in his 2008 Senate race.But Mr. Warners standing in southern Virginia was reduced to that of just any other Democrat. He barely outperformed Mr. Obama in his traditional strongholds and underperformed Mr. Obama elsewhere.Ms. Grimes of Kentucky was a third Senate candidate who seemed well positioned to outperform Mr. Obama. She, too, was a political novice, free to devise a platform distinct from the national party. She was critical of the Obama administrations policies on coal, and refused to say whether she had voted for him. Her opponent, Mitch McConnell, may have been an incumbent, but he entered the campaign with approval ratings in the 30s.Yet Ms. Grimes only ran three points ahead of Mr. Obama, winning just 41 percent of the vote.Ms. Grimess inability to avoid Mr. Obamas baggage was perhaps most evident in the heavily unionized stretches of eastern Kentucky coal country, which were among the most reliably Democratic areas of the country in the 20th century. But the so-called war on coal has dealt a devastating blow to Democratic fortunes in the region, and by extension, to Democrats seeking office in states like Kentucky and West Virginia.Ms. Grimes did everything she could to distinguish herself from Mr. Obama on coal policy. But she was crushed even in the once reliably Democratic counties of eastern Kentucky. She lost Knott County by a 21-point margin. John Kerry, by contrast, won the county by 27 points in 2004.In Arkansas, Mark Pryor, a two-term Senate incumbent whose father was also a senator, won just 39.5 percent of the vote  less than three points better than Mr. Obama. Arkansas was perhaps the Southern state that held on to its Democratic tradition the longest after the 1960s, but it is hard to detect any tradition left today. The state also voted overwhelmingly for a Republican governor.There was no winner in Louisiana, where Senator Mary Landrieu and the Republican Bill Cassidy will go to a runoff. But Ms. Landrieu, who is widely expected to lose the runoff, ran less than two points ahead of Mr. Obama.In North Carolina, Ms. Hagans inability to outperform Mr. Obama in North Carolina was less surprising. She was a first-term incumbent, she was a liberal, and her approval ratings were poor. But she led in nearly all of the pre-election polls over the final few months of the race, and yet she too was defeated by a two-point margin  the same as Mr. Obama in the state in 2012.There were a few other bright spots for Democrats in the South. Gwen Graham defeated the Republican Steve Southerland in Floridas Second Congressional district, an area that votes strongly for Republicans in presidential elections with a large number of registered Democrats. But the newly re-elected Republican governor Rick Scott made some of his largest gains over his prior performance in the same area.It remains to be seen whether Democratic weakness in the South will outlive the Obama years. The national Democratic Party has fully embraced and even defined itself in terms of cultural liberalism  on gun control, gay rights, immigration, abortion, environmental policy and other issues. Generational and demographic change are likely to push the Democrats further in this direction, if anything, because younger and minority voters are strongly liberal on cultural issues.Those voters have helped the Democrats win the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections. But without a broader base of support that lets Democrats win more votes in the South, it will be very hard for them to win back the House, and it may even be hard for them to win back the Senate.",2014-11-06,abortion

The victories at the gubernatorial level are even more impressive. Scott Walkers win in Wisconsin was pretty significant. The biggest surprise to me was Larry Hogan getting himself elected governor of thoroughly blue Maryland. Plus Bruce Rauners win as governor of Illinois was unexpected and huge. This was a national verdict.Gail: Yeah, things were even worse than I expected. The most depressing result, for me, was Sam Brownback being re-elected governor in Kansas. If you can wreck the states economy and not get punished at all  I dont know what there is to say.David: It seems to me the Republican challenge is to understand what the party has done right without getting carried away by triumphalism. The Democratic challenge is to understand where the party went wrong without giving way to despair. Maybe we can talk about strengths and weaknesses?Gail: Well, I guess thats better than staying here under the bed, curled in a fetal position. You first.David: I guess the beginning of Republican wisdom is to understand that this was more a case of the Democrats losing this particular election than it was a case of the Republicans winning it. The Democrats have talked a lot about wage stagnation and income inequality but they have offered nothing compelling to address these problems. President Obama lost the House four years ago because he seemed too liberal for the country after the passage of Obamacare. He lost the Senate this year because he seemed too passive, not competent, not in control. The rollout of Obamacare was the crucial moment of his second term.Gail: I agree that the president has often seemed passive. And theres been a lot of misspeaking for somebody whos supposed to be a great communicator. But I dont buy the idea that the Democrats failed to address wage stagnation and income inequality. Raise the minimum wage, create good jobs improve the nations roads and bridges, expand quality pre-K programs to give the next generation a boost  thats pretty much all they talked about.David: The big Republican accomplishment is that they have detoxified their brand. Four years ago they seemed scary and extreme to a lot of people. They no longer seem that way. The wins in purple states like North Carolina, Iowa and Colorado are clear indications that the party can at least gain a hearing among swing voters. And if the G.O.P. presents a reasonable candidate (and this years crop was very good), then Republicans can win anywhere. I think weve left the Sarah Palin phase and entered the Tom Cotton phase.Gail: I wouldnt call this years crop very good, except in the sense that theyre definitely a less extreme group than we saw in the last few seasons. Although some  like Joni Ernst, who won the Senate seat in Iowa  are still downright scary.But the Republicans have gotten very good at teaching their candidates how to tamp down political screechiness.David: I was especially struck by Ed Gillespies amazing showing in Virginia. He ran one of the more policy-oriented campaigns in the country. At a time when consultants around the nation insulted voters intelligence with dumb campaigns, he honored their intelligence by talking about policy and was rewarded for it, win or lose. Maybe it takes a guy who has been a professional consultant to not listen to the consultants.Gail: Virginia shocked me. And Kay Hagans loss in North Carolina saddened me. The new Democratic South seems to exist mainly in theory.David: Scott Walkers victory in Wisconsin is also significant. The public is clearly unhappy with public sector unions, even in a traditionally progressive place like Wisconsin. Faced with a budget crisis, a mayor or governor can take on those unions and survive and even thrive. Hell become a compelling national figure in 2016.Gail: Yeah, when the only unions left standing are the ones composed of people who work for the taxpayers, the labor movement is in a pretty sad shape. The Republicans have done a very good job of making it almost impossible to organize in the private sector.David: I wouldnt give up on private sector unions. I suspect some institution will grow up to give workers more bargaining power against employers, even if it doesnt look like the 20th-century model.Republicans should be wary of over-interpreting their mandate. Scott Brown ran hard against immigration reform and he was a rare Republican loser last night.Gail: That seemed like a weird choice of themes for New Hampshire, but maybe Brown just forgot which state he was campaigning in. I will refrain from making any jokes about how his next move will be to buy a camper and head for California, where Barbara Boxer is up for re-election in 2016. There will always be a woman running for the Senate somewhere who he can challenge.David: I would love to see a Brown-Boxer race. Sort of a setup for a U.P.S. advertising campaign. The deeper problem for Republicans is their party still has no growth agenda. Figuring out a set of policies commensurate with the size of the structural economic issues is the next big task.Gail: See, thats the frustrating thing. For the last two years the Senate has had Democratic committee chairs who went out of their way to work with Republicans on economic issues. But they were stonewalled by the Republican leadership. And then the voters blamed the Democratic incumbents for gridlock.David: For Democrats, I guess one big lesson is: Stop talking to each other. Democratic politicians spent the early part of the year running against the Koch brothers. That argument may scare a lot of people in liberal bastions, but no one outside of these bastions knows about them or cares.Gail: Its totally true that politicians and the media care much more about campaign contributors than voters do I always secretly thought that if God wanted Americans to care about campaign finance reform he would have made it easier to explain. Although there was that one brief, shining moment in 2000  John McCain. Presidential primary. New Hampshire. Amazing to think back on how that one guy in a bus just went from town meeting to town meeting talking about how to get money out of politics.Gone but not quite forgotten.David: Then the Democrats came back with the 2012 playbook  all the talk about contraception and womens issues. That was tone deaf, given where the country is.Gail: I dont agree at all. Of course you cant give the impression that reproductive rights is the only thing youre running on. But the real problem for the Democrats was that the Republicans figured out how to defuse the issue.Ask me about abortion and Ill tell you that birth control pills should be sold over the counter.The Democrats arent going to have the luxury of running against the kind of Cro-Magnon candidates the Republicans were putting up a few years ago. Although I was tickled to see that the congressman in Florida who held the men-only gathering went down the drain. You know, the one who felt guys needed to be by themselves so they could feel free to drink, smoke and discuss serious topics.David: Democrats also need to ask themselves what it will take for them to be a congressional party once again. That means winning in places likes Arkansas, once solid Democratic states. Over the near term it means shelving theories about an emerging Democratic majority  hoping that a tide of Democratic voters will sweep the Democrats into permanent power. That still may happen over the long term, but Democrats are just terrible at appealing to white voters, especially less-educated white voters.Gail: No matter what the demographics of the future are going to look like, you obviously want candidates who can appeal to poor white and poor minority candidates at the same time. But its not easy to do. I dont think the Republicans are meeting uneducated white voters needs. Theyre just appealing to their fear of change.David: The core problem for Democrats, it seems to me, is that voters are just too skeptical of government  at least as it currently exists. Obamacare may not have been a huge issue, but Republicans ran lots of ads about it, and it remains deeply unpopular. Democrats somehow need to figure out how to offer government programs when people are innately suspicious of government as something alien and ineffective.Gail: The Republicans have done a terrific job of making their base hate government, even when they benefit greatly from government programs. And its ironic that President Obama, who ran as a great communicator, has been so awful at countering that message.David: The final point is that this election marks the end of the Obama presidencys power on the domestic front. In 2008, I would not have expected it to come to this. The verdict is still out on what Obamas legacy will be, but its certainly true that he did not succeed where F.D.R., Reagan and even Clinton did  in building a plausible majority for his party.Gail: I know that the rule of our pundit profession is that now we must turn our attention completely away from the current administration and do nothing but speculate about the presidential race in 2016. But I want to give Obama a little more time before I declare him a goner. If he leaves behind a national health care program and a significant start to the battle against climate change, hell have actually accomplished much more as president than Clinton did. But I guess the nation wont learn to appreciate him unless hes impeached.",2014-11-05,abortion

More than a third of people voting for a Republican House candidate said they were unhappy or even angry at the Republican leaders in Congress, according to exit polls, but they did so anyway, producing a House that is even more right-wing than the current one. On a day of Republican triumph, a majority of voters said they wanted to find a way to allow immigrants to stay in this country, even if they are here illegally. That position could not be more at odds with the one held by most of the new senators elected yesterday.Two-thirds of voters complained that the economy favors the wealthy. But they supported candidates who largely back further tax cuts for the wealthy, who oppose an increase in the minimum wage, who have blocked expanding Medicaid for poor people and who want to repeal a law that has provided health insurance to those who couldnt afford it.They did it in order to send a message of deep disappointment and frustration to President Obama, but the message didnt really contain much content beyond that. Im just tired of all the fighting and bickering, Jeffrey Kowalczuk, a Wisconsin voter, told The Times yesterday, explaining why he voted for Republicans.One of the Republicans who probably won his support was Scott Walker, the Wisconsin governor who was re-elected yesterday after causing more fighting and bickering than most through his assault on public employees. And that kind of contradiction happened all over.Half of the Colorado voters who think abortion should be legal in most cases helped elect Cory Gardner to the Senate, even though he supports a personhood bill that would have the effect of banning almost all abortions. A similar amendment on the Colorado ballot yesterday was defeated, but a third of those voting no still supported Mr. Gardner.Most Georgia voters said the economy was the biggest issue on their mind, but they elected as senator David Perdue, who as a corporate chief laid off thousands of people and expressed pride in how many jobs he outsourced to other countries.And of course the new Senate majority leader will be Mitch McConnell, elected by a state that is benefiting greatly from the new health insurance system that he has vowed to repeal.None of those little details matter, we are told, because when the people are angry, they simply lash out. But the results brought to mind a completely unrelated survey that also came out yesterday. Almost everyone who uses a cellphone for texting said they know the extreme dangers of doing so while driving. But three-quarters of them do it anyway. Destructive and inexplicable behavior is not limited to politics.",2014-11-05,abortion

I asked in my pre-election post, and now we have an answer: This counts. Control of the Senate with room to spare, easy victories in what were supposed to be tight purple-state races and even easier victories in red states, an unexpected nailbiter in Virginia and an upset win in North Carolina, Rick Scott and Scott Walker re-elected, gubernatorial wins all over the map in deep blue states, a historically-large House majority  its a wave, its a thumping, its whatever metaphor you favorto describe a major repudiation of the president and his party.There will be plenty of time to discuss what this means for the next two years, for policy and legislation, for 2016. For tonight, its enough to say that what weve just watched unfold does not fit easily into the models that many pundits have been using to analyze American politics these last few years models which allowed for a good Republican performance this year (it being an unrepresentative midterm and all) but did not allow for anything quite this good, this sweeping, this geographically-comprehensive. Seen in this light, these results are an implicitrebuke to an entire past is prologue school of political analysis and strategy, which looks at existing trends and assumes that they can only continue, watches winning strategies and assumes they can be perpetually repeated, projects demographic patterns forward and then passes judgment on todays politicians from the vantage point of a still-hypothetical 2035.In this particular case, what was overestimated and misjudged was the permanent effectiveness of the Democratic blueprint from 2012, whosemix of social-issue appeals and tech-savvy voter targetingwas supposedto work in tandem with demographic trends to cement a new socially-liberal, multicultural coalition, and render the G.O.P.s position entirely untenable absent a major ideological reboot. Thatblueprint really was effective in 12, and the underlying demographic trends are real, and one bad midterm election does not prove that the coalition cannot hold together, as Republicans may learn to their cost two years from now. But from a lot of the commentary after Obamas re-election, you would have thought that the combination of ethnic-interest appeals on immigration policy, war on women rhetoric on social issues, andbrilliant get-out-the-vote operations run by tech-savvy Millennials (who, we were told, were too liberal to ever build a website for a Republican) posed a kind of immediateand existential challenge tothe G.O.P., requiring immediate capitulation on a range of fronts, with no time for finesse or calculation and no room forresistance.Not so, as it turned out. Events have intervened, Republican politicians and their party have managed to adapt, and  as often happens  issue appeals that resonated in one political context have turned out to be less important than the fundamentals in another. The politics of immigration, for instance, turned out to look somewhat different once the issues were a sweeping executive amnesty and a child migration surge rather than the DREAM Act and the vague promise of something bipartisan and comprehensive. The politics of contraception turned out to be pretty easy to finesse by G.O.P. politicians with an ounce of savvy and no Akinesque tics, and the politics of abortion absolutism, as pursued by Wendy Davis and Mark Uterus Udall, turned out to be maybe notthe way to turn Texas blue or keep Colorado from turning red. The turnout surge among minority voters that was crucial to Democrats in 2012 wasnt easily replicated, notwithstanding efforts to use Ferguson and Trayvon Martin as rallying points. That amazing Democratic get-out-the-vote operation, staffed by geniusesand whiz kids, turned out to matter a lot less to who voted, and for whom, than more old-fashioned indicators like the presidents approval ratings. And nobody, but nobody, cared how many millions liberal billionaires spent trying to make climate change an issue.Again: Its one election, its a midterm (with the lower, whiter turnout that entails), the long-term structural forces still look good for Democrats, their presidential coalition can still be plausibly reassembled byHerself in 2016.But sufficient to the day the election thereof. And on this day, in this election, the Republican Party successfully told liberalisms arc of history to get bent.",2014-11-05,abortion

Mr. Brown, 76, was seeking his second consecutive term as governor; the states term limits bar him from serving a third. He also served as Californias governor in the 1970s.A deluge of outside money poured into three California U.S. House contests  in districts 7, 26 and 52  leaving voters begging for an end to the commercials and a seemingly limitless string of mailers. In all three races, Republicans were attempting to unseat freshman members of Congress, and each race came down to a few thousand votes.In District 52, several pundits called the race between Scott Peters, a Democrat and the incumbent, and Carl DeMaio, a Republican and former San Diego councilman, one of the most competitive races in the country. Mr. DeMaio has considerable name recognition, is openly gay and barely 40 years old, and has seized on Congresss unpopularity, calling himself a new generation leader. During aSeptember debate the men criticized each others records. Mr. DeMaio blamed his opponent for a San Diego pension crisis (Mr. Peters said the city suffered from a couple decades of bad financial practices before his election), while Mr. Peters suggested that his challenger had aligned himself with the Tea Party (something Mr. DeMaio has denied).He has also been accused of sexual harassment by two former staffers  and he has denied any improper action.In District 7, which is evenly split between the two major parties, the incumbent, Ami Bera, a Democrat and first-time congressman who is a doctor, highlighted his centrist views and distanced himself from his chambers lackluster record. He promoted his opposition to congressional pay raises and perks, as well as his membership in a bipartisan group called No Labels. This did not stop his challenger, Doug Ose, who served as a representative for three terms starting in 1998, from criticizing him. I think No Labels is a do-nothing group, he has said.""I think Congressman Bera has established a record as a do-nothing member. Mr. Ose supports a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and has highlighted his support of legislation that reduced taxes.In District 26, Assemblyman Jeff Gorell, a Republican, supports abortion rights and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. He was seen as a real threat to the incumbent, Julia Brownley, a first-time congresswoman representing a heavily Latino, traditionally Democratic district in Southern California. Ms. Brownley is a former state assemblywoman who recently claimed a critical role in the passage of a federal bill designed to address shortcomings in accessibility and accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs. This was once considered a sleeper race, but as of Oct. 24, Ms. Brownley had spent nearly $2.3 million on her bid for re-election, while Mr. Gorell had spent just under $1 million.",2014-11-05,abortion

Speaking to lawyers at a fund-raiser in Texas in July, he disparaged Senator Charles E. Grassley, one of the states most popular politicians, as just a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school, and he warned that Mr. Grassley could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee if Republicans won control of the Senate.Ms. Ernst attracted national attention last spring with a television commercial in which she declared: I grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm. So when I get to Washington, Ill know how to cut pork.She campaigned as a mother, soldier and independent leader who would cut federal spending. Mr. Braley described her as a tool of the wealthy, conservative Koch brothers and said her views on abortion and other issues were extreme.Tens of millions of dollars were spent trying to influence voters in this race. Polls of voters on Election Day, conducted by Edison Research, indicated that men favored Ms. Ernst by a substantial margin while women narrowly favored Mr. Braley.Gov. Terry E. Branstad, a Republican, easily won a sixth term, defeating his Democratic challenger, State Senator Jack Hatch. Mr. Branstad will soon be able to claim the undisputed title of longest-serving governor in American history.First elected in 1982, just before his 36th birthday, Mr. Branstad went on to serve four consecutive terms, stepped down in 1999, and was elected again in 2010, when he defeated Gov. Chet Culver, a Democrat. A mainstream conservative, Mr. Branstad has skirmished more than once with Tea Party leaders.In the First District, Rod Blum, a Republican businessman from Dubuque, won the seat being vacated by Mr. Braley. Mr. Blum defeated Pat Murphy, a Democrat and former speaker of the Iowa House. Mr. Blum boasts that he created jobs in the private sector as a software company executive and a real estate developer.In the Third District, which covers Des Moines and southwest Iowa, David Young, a former chief of staff to Mr. Grassley, won the seat held for two decades by Representative Tom Latham, who is retiring. Mr. Young defeated the Democratic candidate, former State Senator Staci Appel, who lost her seat in the state Legislature in the Tea Party wave of 2010.Iowa voters re-elected two House members, Representatives Dave Loebsack, a Democrat from Iowa City, and Steve King, a leader of Tea Party Republicans whose district covers northwest Iowa.",2014-11-05,abortion

Scott Walker, a hero to conservatives and a villain to liberals for his campaign against public employee unions, keeps alive speculation that he could be a Republican contender for national office.Mr. Walker survived one of the most closely watched races in the country, in a state President Obama has carried twice, against Mary Burke, a former executive of the Trek Bicycle Corporation and a former state commerce secretary. With Ms. Burkes absence of a political track record, and Mr. Walkers contentious term in office, the race was primarily a referendum on the governor, a Tea Party favorite.Mr. Walker won a close race in the Republican wave of 2010, and promptly pushed through budget-cutting legislation that included deep reductions in public employee benefits and stripped those unions of most of their collective bargaining power. That legislation caused weeks of raucous protests that drew national attention, with thousands of people crowding into and around the statehouse in Madison.The changes in law weakened the unions political power, which Mr. Walkers opponents charged was his intent all along. Labor groups supported an attempt to recall the governor in 2012, but it failed.Mr. Walker further cemented his conservative standing by favoring anti-abortion measures, rejecting the federally financed expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, proposing mandatory drug testing for people receiving government benefits, and signing a law requiring voters to present identification at the polls.For much of the year, the voter identification law loomed as a factor in the election, as analysts predicted that it would lower turnout among minority, poor and young voters, favoring Republicans. But on Oct. 9, the Supreme Court blocked implementation of the law.In the last weeks of the campaign, Mr. Walkers campaign accused Ms. Burke of copying parts of her economic recovery plan from other states, calling it plagiarism. Ms. Burke countered that it was natural to borrow good ideas, while criticizing the governors handling of state finances.Brad Schimel, a Republican, won a tight race for attorney general that determined who would be responsible for defending contentious state laws from legal challenges. But in the shadow of the governors race, the major candidates  two county district attorneys, Susan Happ, a Democrat, and Mr. Schimel  remained largely unknown.A few months ago, Democrats thought they had a long shots chance in two Republican-held districts, but they fell far short, hobbled by the national atmosphere and poor fund-raising. In the Seventh District, which Mitt Romney carried by 3 percentage points in the 2012 presidential election, Representative Sean P. Duffy, a two-term Republican incumbent, easily turned back a little-known challenger, Kelly Westlund. And in the Sixth Congressional District, Glenn Grothman, a Republican state senator and outspoken conservative, handily defeated Mark Harris, the Winnebago County executive.",2014-11-05,abortion

He defeated State Senator George Sinner, a Democrat whose father was the states governor from 1985 to 1992. They both described themselves as pragmatists, with Mr. Cramer, 53, criticizing his fellow Republicans for the government shutdown.Mr. Cramer served on the states Public Service Commission from 2003 to 2012 and was the states economic development director from 1997 to 2000. Mr. Sinner, 61, has worked as a banker and agribusiness executive.Mr. Sinner said he supported ending tax breaks that allow the foreign subsidiaries of American corporations to avoid taxes, while Mr. Cramer said his opponent wanted to punish companies that already face high taxes. Mr. Sinner backed a five-year extension of the wind tax credit to encourage alternative energies, while Mr. Cramer said the idea would distort electricity prices. Mr. Cramer opposed additional regulations on business, the Affordable Care Act and what he called overreach by federal agencies, especially the Environmental Protection Agency.Jack Seaman, the Libertarian candidate, said he would be an alternative who could help end gridlock in the two-party system. He favored abolishing what he called the criminal and corrupt Internal Revenue Service and replacing the federal income tax with a national sales tax.North Dakota voters rejected a proposed amendment to the state Constitution that would have made their state the first in the nation to define life as beginning at conception. The measure  called the Life Begins at Conception Amendment  said, The inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and protected. Supporters said their primary goal was to define fetal development as a stage of life. North Dakota Right to Life and other supporters of the amendment said it would protect existing antiabortion laws and enable state lawmakers to enact stronger measures against abortion. Planned Parenthood and other opponents asserted that the amendment was too broad and that it could ban in vitro fertilization and hurt couples who are storing frozen embryos. Opponents also maintained that the amendment could make it difficult for women with life-threatening ectopic pregnancies to seek treatment and could allow a ban on certain forms of birth control, causing more unintended pregnancies.North Dakotans voted down a measure that would have required 5 percent of the states oil extraction tax revenues to go toward improving water quality, aiding fish and wildlife, and improving and expanding parks. With the states oil and gas industry booming, the measure would have amounted to an estimated $150 million per year. Complaining that the oil and gas boom has damaged the environment, supporters of the constitutional amendment praised the idea of using the money to improve depleted grasslands and wetlands and to increase the population of fish, wildlife and even honey bees. Opponents argued that the amendment was financed primarily by out-of-state groups and would divert too much money each year for what they said could be undefined, wasteful and irresponsible spending.",2014-11-05,abortion

A proposal to allow medical marijuana failed in Florida.","onalVoters in four states on Tuesday supported measures to raise their minimum wages, bringing the number of states that have passed such laws to 29 and reflecting widespread dissatisfaction with Congresss failure to increase the federal minimum of $7.25.Residents of Washington, D.C., and Oregon voted to allow recreational use of marijuana, following the lead of Colorado and Washington State. But in Florida, a hotly contested measure to expand the use of marijuana for medical treatment, now permitted in 23 states, failed narrowly. Though a majority of voters approved the measure, the margin fell short of the 60 percent it needed to pass.Support for low-wage workers and marijuana legalization were just two issues among the many that voters considered in 146 state ballot measures in 41 states, covering such topics as genetically modified food, the right to bear arms and the right to bait bears.In Massachusetts, voters upheld by a wide margin a 2011 law to allow casino gambling, after heavy spending by gambling interests, and in another lift for workers rights, they required employers to give employees paid sick leave.Though it may seem as if voters had an overwhelming number of issues to decide, the numbers of ballot measures are actually trending down, according to the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California. The number of citizen-led initiatives and referendums was at its lowest in an even-numbered year since 1974, in part because some states have made it more difficult to put measures on the ballot.Just as notable, perhaps, is what was not subject to the popular vote. Amendments defining marriage as a heterosexual institution were missing, as were measures requiring voter identification  though several initiatives dealt with early voting and voter registration. States for the most part avoided the hotly disputed topic of immigration, except in Oregon, where voters rejected a measure that would have allowed illegal immigrants to get drivers licenses.Some ballot measures are used as a political tool to raise voter interest. Republican critics said some of the measures to increase the minimum wage had been placed on the ballot to bolster turnout for vulnerable Democrats, but support for raising the minimum wage has historically crossed party lines.I cant stress how popular of an issue it is among voters regardless of political affiliation, said Tsedeye Gebreselassie, a senior staff lawyer for the National Employment Law Project. And the federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009.Four states  Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota  passed measures to increase the minimum wage. Alaskas measure will increase the minimum wage to $9.75 in 2016, the Arkansas measure raises the minimum wage to $8.50 by 2017, Nebraskas will rise to $9 by 2016 and South Dakotas goes to $8.50. By a wide margin, Illinois voters also recommended an increase to the minimum wage, but the vote was nonbinding.Both advocates and opponents of marijuana legalization had expected voters to approve the Oregon and Washington, D.C., measures.The Washington initiative makes it legal for adults to possess and grow limited amounts of marijuana for personal use, while Oregons allows adults age 21 and over to have up to eight ounces of marijuana in their home, and up to four plants. The manufacture and sale of marijuana products would be licensed and regulated by the State Liquor Control Commission. Congress may attempt to block Washingtons vote on marijuana and Representative Andy Harris, a Republican from Maryland, has already promised to do so.But Mason Tvert, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, which supports legalization, said, The movement toward ending marijuana prohibition will not go backward; its simply a question of how quickly it moves forward,Voters in Alaska also moved to legalized marijuana.In Florida, where the marijuana issue figured in the governors race, the story was different. There, John Morgan, a prominent trial lawyer and a supporter of the Democratic challenger, Charlie Crist, spent $3.8 million supporting the medical marijuana measure, according to Ballotpedia, an online politics encyclopedia that tracks ballot initiatives. Sheldon Adelson, a casino magnate, spent even more, $5.5 million, opposing it, according to committee filings.Mr. Crist favored the measure and even said it might bring more younger voters to the polls, potentially bolstering his support, while the Republican incumbent, Rick Scott, and former Gov. Jeb Bush, also a Republican, opposed it. Support for the measure started strong but slipped in recent polls, and Mr. Crist lost to Mr. Scott.The vast majority of America has not legalized marijuana, so I dont think its a foregone conclusion that the nation will follow Colorado and Washington State, both of which legalized recreational use of marijuana in 2012, said Kevin Sabet, the head of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, which opposes legalizing the recreational use of the drug. As the negative effects show up, it could start to turn people off.Another perennial issue, gambling, has become more urgent as states wrestle with casino closings and bankruptcies. In Massachusetts, a 2011 law allowed for three casinos and one slot-machine parlor, none of which have been built. The initiative to repeal the law attracted deep-pocketed opposition from the gambling industry, which vastly outspent anti-casino groups and argued that gambling would create jobs and that the slot parlor, which was under construction, had already done so.No state has repealed a law expanding gambling since the era of the modern casino began in 1931, according to Clyde W. Barrow, a political scientist at the University of Texas-Pan American.California had perhaps the most expensive ballot measure fight in the country, pitting trial lawyers against doctors over a measure that would have required doctors to take drug and alcohol tests, and would also have raised the cap on pain and suffering awards in medical malpractice cases.The measure failed, as doctors and insurance companies spent heavily to defeat it; together, the two deep-pocketed sides raised more than $70 million.Californias governor, Jerry Brown, who won re-election Tuesday, also spent more on television ads supporting two ballot measures than he did on his own campaign. Both measures passed easily: One authorizes $7.1 billion in water infrastructure projects during a historic drought, and the other requires the state to save more in its rainy-day fund and to pay down more debt.California voters also approved a ballot measure intended to address prison overcrowding by reducing many nonviolent felonies to misdemeanors.Some hot-button issues like abortion and gun control were scarce on this years ballots, but in Colorado, the group Personhood USA backed an amendment to defined an unborn human as a person in Colorados criminal code and wrongful-death act. The group has twice failed to win passage of a broader amendment that would have granted personhood to an unborn human being in all areas of law, and its more limited measure was again rejected by voters on Tuesday.In North Dakota, voters rejected a similar amendment that said life begins at conception. But in Tennessee, voters approved an amendment allowing the legislature to regulate abortion, a power that was denied by a State Supreme Court decision in 2000.Also in Washington, voters approved a measure that would expand background checks on all gun sales as well as transfers, including private transactions. A second, rival measure that would have prevented the state from expanding checks beyond what federal requirements was trailing.",2014-11-05,abortion

Ad after ad by Republicans and outside conservative groups declared that Mr. Udall voted with the president 99 percent of the time.This guy just follows in lock step with the president, said Dustin Zvonek, of the Colorado chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a group funded by the conservative Koch brothers. Coloradans, it doesnt matter if youre a Republican or a Democrat. They want someone whos independent, whos there for them. Its really a Western thing.Few Republicans doubted Mr. Gardners conservative credentials, which allowed him to quickly pivot to the center to court the unaffiliated voters who make up a third of Colorados electorate. He announced his support for providing birth control pills without a prescription and promised that he would stand up to fellow Republicans when he disagreed with them.Democrats scoffed at the claims as hollow, election-year feints toward bipartisanship. But in the end, it was the Republican from the eastern farming town of Yuma, not the fence-post-slender Democrat who climbs mountains, that Colorado believed would provide a new, more independent voice.Early Wednesday morning, Gov. John W. Hickenlooper edged slightly ahead of his Republican challenger, Bob Beauprez, as the last several thousand votes from Democratic-friendly bastions like Denver and Boulder were counted. But the two men remained separated by less than a percentage point, and it was uncertain whether any winner could be declared or whether the race would head toward an automatic recount.The governors race has focused more on the states economy. A drilling boom, construction downtown and new waves of mountain-loving migrants have helped lower unemployment in Colorado to 4.7 percent.The race also hinged on whether Democratic-supported laws expanding background checks for firearms, limiting the size of ammunition magazines and expanding renewable-energy standards were turning away from Colorados older values, or simply extending them into a new era.At times, both parties treated the election as a battle for the soul of a Western bellwether.Urban growth and the rapidly swelling number of Hispanic residents have helped hand control of the governors mansion and state legislature to Democrats in recent years, and many liberals had hoped that victories this year could help give Colorado new stature as a reliably Democratic foothold in the Mountain West. After years of defeats in statewide races and self-inflicted wounds, Republicans here were desperate for a win demonstrating that  despite the states embrace of legal marijuana, civil unions for same-sex couples and new gun restrictions  Colorado was still a moderate place that would punish politicians who lurched too far leftward.Conservatives, in particular, cast the races for senator and governor as battles between the rural values of ranchers and farmers and the urban leanings of a growing number of constituents living in the suburbs. At a campaign stop earlier this summer, Mr. Beauprez told a group of civic officials from the northeastern corner of the state, Rural Colorado, I think, probably determines the outcome of this election.",2014-11-05,abortion

Rick Scotts narrow re-election in one of the nations most expensive races means that state government remains firmly in Republican hands. As the nation learned in 2000, that control can influence the outcome of a presidential election.In national contests, Florida is the purplest of states: It has been carried by the winner in five straight presidential races, and it was the most closely contested state in 2000 and 2012. But at the state level, Republicans have had the upper hand for years, and they won every statewide race this year and kept control of the Legislature.Mr. Scotts victory quashed what would have been a remarkable comeback for his opponent, former Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican-turned-Democrat. In exit polls, a strong majority of voters said Mr. Crists party switch was motivated more by political opportunism than real beliefs.Four years ago, Mr. Scott made his first run for public office as a fiscally conservative technocrat, with experience as a venture capitalist and an executive of a hospital chain, and in a boon year for Republicans, he eked out a narrow win.But then he steered farther to the right than many Floridians expected. In his first year, Mr. Scott carried out budget cuts, killed a high-speed rail project and signed a law  later struck down in court  requiring drug testing of welfare applicants. He had not campaigned on social issues, but he signed anti-abortion bills, including one requiring that a woman have an ultrasound before the procedure.An opponent of the Affordable Care Act, he at first rejected its offer of Medicaid expansion, turning down billions of dollars in federal aid, and then took steps making it harder to get low-cost insurance under the law. He reversed his position on Medicaid expansion but did not push it through the Legislature, where it died.His approval ratings fell below 30 percent at onetime, and Mr. Scott was being called the nations most unpopular governor. But with a shift to the center and the help of a strengthening economy, his standing improved. He pulled even with Mr. Crist in polls, with a barrage of ads calling him a flip-flopper on issues like abortion and same-sex marriage.Polls showed that in the final weeks, when the race was too close to call, many voters were unhappy with their choices and unsure of their allegiances.Each party knocked off one incumbent, further reinforcing Floridas status as an unpredictable swing state.A Republican, Carlos Curbelo, defeated Representative Joe Garcia, a Democrat, in the 26th District, at the southern tip of the state. In a district carried by Mitt Romney, Mr. Garcia was expected to have trouble defending a seat he first won two years ago against a damaged Republican incumbent.But in the Second District, in the panhandle, Gwen Graham, daughter of the former Florida governor and senator Bob Graham, unseated Representative Steve Southerland, a two-term Republican.In August, a state judge ruled that the congressional districts drawn by the Legislature were improperly gerrymandered to benefit Republicans, but that it was too late to change them for this years election.A large majority of voters supported a measure that would have made Florida the first Southern state to legalize marijuana for medical use. But it was not enough: The measure fell short of the 60 percent needed to amend the state Constitution.Voters easily approved another constitutional amendment to significantly increase the states purchase of land to preserve water resources and wildlife habitat.",2014-11-05,abortion

Republicans called her abortion Barbie and never let up their attacks. While Ms. Davis proved to be a potent fund-raiser, she turned out to be a less effective campaigner. When she did go on the offensive, she managed to offend. Her best-known ad lingered on an empty wheelchair and accused Mr. Abbott, who was paralyzed in an accident in 1984, of hypocrisy.Mr. Abbott had reached a $10 million settlement for his own injury but, the ad argued, he had worked to restrict recovery for other accident victims. The Abbott campaign called the ad desperate and despicable. Even without those stumbles, however, Ms. Davis faced a major challenge in a state that has not elected a Democrat to statewide office in 20 years.Two state senators faced off for the powerful position of lieutenant governor: Dan Patrick, a Republican, and Leticia Van de Putte, a Democrat. Mr. Patrick, a Houston talk-show host and favorite of the Tea Party, campaigned hard on an anti-abortion platform and warned of the threat of Islamic terrorists crossing over the Mexican border.Mr. Patrick defeated the incumbent Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, a more establishment conservative, in an aggressive primary and he had little trouble winning the general election over Ms. Van de Putte, a pharmacist who has long represented San Antonio.John Cornyn, the Republican incumbent, easily defeated Dr. David Alameel, a Democrat who had founded and sold a chain of dental clinics.Texas also elected George Bush, but not the ones who most readily come to mind. George P. Bush, 38, the son of former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and the nephew of former president George W. Bush  and, of course, the grandson of former President George H. W. Bush, won statewide office as land commissioner. Mr. Bush, a lawyer and energy consultant, easily defeated John Cook, the former mayor of El Paso.The land commissioner, one of the lesser known of Texas statewide offices, manages public lands and the mineral rights, which in turn help to fund public education. Mr. Bushs mother, Columba Bush, is Mexican-American, and he is a founder of Hispanic Republicans of Texas, a political action committee. Neither his father, his uncle or his grandfather won their first elections.",2014-11-05,abortion

But voters surveyed after casting their ballots, both at the polls on Tuesday and by phone for those who voted early, signaled deep dismay with both parties and were at least as negative about Republican congressional leaders as about President Obama.Mr. Obama was at the center of the campaign debate, if not on the ballot, as Republicans sought to exploit his unpopularity by tying Democratic candidates to him, especially in the fight for control of the Senate. A majority of voters said they disapproved of how the president was doing his job, and about eight in 10 of those who disapproved supported Republicans.As bleak as Democrats prospects were, the party succeeded to some degree in its strategy of focusing on female voters, especially minorities and single women, by attacking Republicans for their legislative actions to limit access to abortion and birth control.Democrats won a majority of women, a traditionally supportive group but one that sided with Republicans by a single percentage point in 2010, the previous midterm election year. That setback four years ago was a big factor in enabling Republicans to win control of the House and of many state legislatures and governorships.On Tuesday, single women supported Democrats over Republicans by more than 20 points. In Senate battlegrounds like Colorado, Georgia, Iowa and North Carolina, Democratic candidates also won a majority of women. But it was not enough to avert losses, given the overwhelming support male voters provided for the Republicans.Yet political independents  a group that six years ago helped propel Mr. Obama to the presidency  once again supported Republicans, though by a smaller margin than in 2010. Democrats also failed again in other ways to rebuild Mr. Obamas broad coalition of 2008, losing among middle-aged voters, suburbanites and Catholics, though not as badly as in 2010.Democrats did hold onto groups that form their base: union households, gays, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, younger voters, lower-income Americans, political moderates, Northeasterners, city dwellers, Jewish voters and both those without high school educations and those with graduate degrees.The surveys of voters showed that Republicans also won their core supporters: whites, men, older voters, Southerners, white Protestants, veterans, higher-income people, weekly churchgoers, white evangelical Christians and rural residents. Edison Research conducted the surveys for a consortium of news media organizations.As was true in polls throughout the year, the economy was the top issue on most voters minds. Nearly half selected this issue as their top concern  nearly double the number that picked health care, the next most pressing issue. Fewer than one in five voters named foreign policy or immigration as their primary concern.Despite a range of good economic news of late, including a declining unemployment rate, many voters are not believers.More than three-quarters said they were worried about where the economy is headed in the next year; a majority of those supported Republicans. Voters split evenly on whether the economy is getting better, worsening or staying the same; those who see it getting better backed Democrats by a three-to-one margin while those who foresee conditions getting worse similarly supported Republicans.But perhaps the most telling sign of Americans downbeat state of mind was the measure of their confidence  or lack of it  in the American dream: About half the voters said they expect that the next generation will not enjoy a better life than Americans today. That was a significant increase from 2010. The pessimistic voters backed Republicans two to one, while the half of Americans who believe the next generation will enjoy the same or better lives voted by a similar margin for Democrats.Over all, more than half of voters expressed negative feelings toward both the Democratic and Republican parties. In a cautionary note for Republicans about reading too much into their victories, one-quarter of the voters who supported the partys candidates did so despite harboring bad feelings about the party. Among voters who backed Democrats, a significantly smaller share was negative toward that party.Voters stances on a number of issues emphasized the stark differences between Democrats and Republicans, and suggested why it has been years since many Americans claimed they saw no difference between the parties.Voters closely split on whether same-sex marriage or marijuana should be legal, for example, with those in favor overwhelmingly supporting Democrats and those opposed supporting Republicans by similar margins.On several issues, majorities expressed views in sync with Democrats. A slim majority said abortion should remain legal; supporters favored Democrats and opponents Republicans. A larger majority agreed that climate change is a serious problem, and those who did overwhelmingly supported Democrats, while those who disagreed backed Republicans. And most voters favored allowing immigrants here illegally to have a chance to seek legal status  a position at odds with Republican opposition that hardened in the course of the years campaigns.Voters remain evenly divided over Mr. Obamas signature Affordable Care Act, which Republicans sought for a third election cycle to make an albatross around Democrats necks. On that issue, too, voters who support the law or say it should have gone farther overwhelmingly went for Democrats while opponents chose Republicans.",2014-11-05,abortion

Andrew M. Cuomo, who defeated Rob Astorino, enters his second term without the aura of invincibility that aided him among Albany lawmakers.","This was the election in which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo had every reason to think he would outdo his father.He had kept his promise to steady New Yorks teetering state government, restoring a sense of competent leadership in Albany after years of turmoil. He had cemented an image of himself as the Cuomo who got things done  not just gave memorable speeches  by recording high-profile victories legalizing same-sex marriage, capping property tax increases and tightening gun-control laws. He faced an unknown, underfinanced, socially conservative opponent.Instead, Mr. Cuomo, 56, who easily won re-election on Tuesday  but with what appeared to be a considerably smaller majority than the 65 percent that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo got during his bid for a second term, in 1986  enters the next four years with less political clout than when the campaign began. Gone is the aura of invincibility that made Albany lawmakers clear out of his path. The governors future is uncertain, with a presidential bid presumably blocked by Hillary Rodham Clinton.Mr. Cuomo has hinted occasionally at the makings of a broad, if workmanlike, agenda for the next four years: creating jobs, particularly upstate; rebuilding infrastructure, including upgrading New Yorks aging airports; demanding better performance from the states public schools. But his basic message to voters has been simpler: Keep this state moving forward, he urged. More of the same.We are just getting started, Mr. Cuomo said to a jubilant crowd celebrating his victory on Tuesday night in a Manhattan hotel ballroom.Yet more of the same is now a loaded phrase for Mr. Cuomo. A re-election year that was shaping up as a coronation  complete with the rollout of a memoir  proved unexpectedly trying. Liberal members of his own party rebelled against the unreliability of his liberalism, leading to a primary in which a little-known law professor claimed a third of the vote. His pledge to clean up Albany ricocheted against him, as federal prosecutors started an investigation into his shutdown of an ethics panel he had made a show of creating only nine months earlier.For all that, Mr. Cuomos victory over his Republican opponent, Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive, came during an arduous year for Democratic candidates across the country. And unlike incumbent governors in many states, his re-election never seemed in doubt.With 98 percent of precincts reporting Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo held 54 percent of the vote, compared with about 41 percent for Mr. Astorino. Howie Hawkins, who as the Green Party candidate emerged as an alternative to Mr. Cuomo for exasperated liberals, had 5 percent.Mr. Astorino, speaking after Mr. Cuomo to a subdued gathering of supporters in White Plains, said he hoped the governor had heard some of the cries of New Yorkers during the campaign.Better governing is what New York needs, Mr. Astorino said. The Empire State is failing, and thats not acceptable.In the race for state attorney general, which was slightly more suspenseful, the Democratic incumbent, Eric T. Schneiderman, fended off a challenge from John P. Cahill, a Republican who was a top aide to former Gov. George E. Pataki. The state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, a Democrat, also handily defeated his Republican challenger, Robert E. Antonacci, the Onondaga County comptroller.Mr. Cuomos victory came despite mixed feelings on the part of voters who, in interviews, frequently complained about the lack of an acceptable option. Hes somewhat progressive as far as womans issues, said Jeff Arberman, 58, an information technology programmer who voted in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. But he added that he mainly voted for Mr. Cuomo because he saw him as the lesser of two evils.In the end, Mr. Cuomo fell short of his own result in 2010, when he won over 62 percent of the vote against Carl P. Paladino, a Republican businessman from Buffalo.But Mr. Cuomo also is measured against an inherited set of benchmarks. His father, Mario Cuomo, after all, won a landslide victory in his first re-election, in 1986, against another Westchester County executive, Andrew P. ORourke  a campaign that Andrew Cuomo managed.Mr. Cuomo himself has ruminated lately on both the pride he takes in his fathers record as a three-term governor and the burden it imposed upon him. In his memoir, All Things Possible, he praises his fathers unshakable sense of right and wrong. And at his celebration Tuesday night, he saluted him as the father of the modern Democratic Party, a man who is all about principle and inspiration.But in an interview with Charlie Rose last month, Mr. Cuomo said that he had a different mission than his father, focused more on concrete results than on philosophical inspiration.My father convinced people of the concept of progressive government, especially in opposition to the Reagan era, Mr. Cuomo said. I see my mission as proving to them that it can actually work efficiently, effectively.He added, more pointedly: I heard the speeches. Ive heard them all. I want to see the results and the performance.Yet with Mr. Cuomos reputation for political mastery dented slightly, some longtime Cuomo observers suggested that the governor could benefit from laying out a bolder animating vision for the next four years.Norman Adler, a semiretired political consultant, recalled that Mr. Cuomo had called him soon after his election in 2010 and asked, What would you do?Mr. Adler, who had worked for Mario Cuomo, said he urged the new governor to become an agent of serious political reform  and that, if asked, he would give him the same advice today.Bobby Wagner went from being a Tammany Hall hack to a great reformer, Mr. Adler said, referring to a three-term New York City mayor. Andrew could redefine himself too.For Mr. Cuomo, the campaign for re-election seemed like a bother to be dispatched with, rather than a victory lap to be savored. Relying on his prodigious fund-raising, he blanketed the state with television advertising, painting Mr. Astorino as a dangerous ultraconservative whose views on issues like abortion were unacceptable.In contrast to the turnaround project of the past four years, in which he proudly enacted on-time budgets each March, Mr. Cuomo heads into his second term with more of a blank slate.And though he rattled off a list of liberal priorities as his own on Tuesday night, in the same speech, Mr. Cuomo made clear that a centrist path was where he felt most comfortable: He boasted of having resisted being pushed or pulled by the extreme forces on the left or the right.Some liberal leaders were already sounding enraged by the election results, in which Republicans claimed a majority in the State Senate. Mr. Cuomo had promised to help Democrats take over the Senate, but he was almost invisible as their candidates struggled in tight races, while he devoted considerable energy promoting a new ballot line he created called the Womens Equality Party.Governor Cuomo spent his time and money creating a fake party instead of fighting for the State Senate and congressional candidates of the party he is supposedly a member of, said Bill Lipton, the state director of the Working Families Party, a group of labor unions and liberal activists.With Republicans in control of the State Senate, Mr. Cuomo will have a smoother path to continuing his efforts to hold down spending and cut taxes. But it could also prevent the governor from achieving several of his leading campaign priorities, including legislation relating to immigration, abortion rights, the minimum wage and campaign finance reform.He has asked to be judged by the prose of governing rather than the poetry of politics, said Bruce N. Gyory, a Democratic political consultant. So the question becomes, Can he continue to produce works of prose that deliver?",2014-11-05,abortion

Bill Haslam, a Republican, did not face a serious challenge in his re-election bid, easily defeating his opponent, a retired construction worker named Charles V. Brown, listed on the ballot as Charlie, who barely campaigned.The Republican incumbent, Lamar Alexander, a former governor who was elected to the Senate in 2002, handily defeated his challenger, Gordon Ball. Though Mr. Alexanders website says that he had spent more adult years in the private sector than in public life at the time of his Senate election, he has also sought to frame his Washington experience as a virtue, despite nationwide discontent with Congress. He is the ranking member of his party overseeing education, labor, health and energy appropriations.Mr. Balls underdog campaign took a hit in early October when Buzzfeed reported that most of the policy positions on his campaign website were largely plagiarized from other politicians. While Mr. Ball did not deny the allegations, he did try to temper their effects on his candidacy, The Tennessean reported, saying, Im a country lawyer, and I doubt I can spell plagiarism.Representative Scott DesJarlais, the Republican incumbent in the states Fourth Congressional District, won his third term in Congress after surviving a primary challenge that many had expected him to lose. Dr. DesJarlais, who is anti-abortion, has faced withering criticism in recent years amid allegations that he had a relationship with a patient and pressured her to get an abortion. The Democratic nominee, Lenda Sherrell, seemed to allude to Dr. DesJarlaiss personal life in her first television ad, which aired in early October. Its title: Worthy of your trust.Tennesseans voted to approve an amendment to the state Constitution that will call for appointed judges to serve eight-year terms, and then allow them to be elected to another term, essentially codifying the current system.Despite language in the state Constitution that says Supreme Court justices should be elected to the bench, the state has used a merit-selection system for many years. The amendment has been the subject of statewide attention in recent months over the role of Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey in opposing the continued terms of three Supreme Court justices appointed by former Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat. (The justices were retained.) Mr. Bredesen and his successor, Mr. Haslam, support the amendment.Tennessee voters also approved a measure amending the states Constitution to add language allowing state lawmakers to enact, amend, or repeal statutes regarding abortion, potentially allowing restrictions of abortions even in the cases of rape and incest or when necessary to save the mothers life.The amendment won endorsements from many Republican leaders in the state, including Mr. Haslam. It has also been the subject of an intense opposition campaign from abortion rights groups that argued that the carefully worded measure masked a sweeping intrusion of government into private lives.",2014-11-05,abortion

Ms. Grimes tried to cast off that attachment, declining even to say if she had voted for Mr. Obama in the past two presidential elections. In an exit poll, almost two-thirds of the states voters said they disapproved of how Mr. Obama was handling his job. Of those, more than three-quarters voted for Mr. McConnell.Ms. Grimes ran a spirited campaign, and enjoyed support from high-profile stumpers, including President Bill Clinton. But it was not enough to defeat her opponent, who she tried to characterize throughout the campaign as the consummate Washington insider.However, dissatisfaction with Washington gridlock did not seem to be enough to stop voters from supporting Mr. McConnell. More than half said they were dissatisfied with Republican leaders in Congress, but about a quarter still voted for him.Andy Barr, a Republican congressman, has won re-election in his race for the sixth district against Elisabeth Jensen, a former executive with Disney Consumer Products and the president of an education nonprofit organization.Mr. Barr had a brief moment in the national spotlight in 2012, when he gave a speech at the Republican National Convention criticizing President Obamas coal policies. He has also spoken out against the Affordable Care Act, along with many other of the presidents policies.Ms. Jensen presented her candidacy as a chance for voters to make big changes to the states congressional delegation, saying that Kentucky had never had a Democratic woman in Congress.In one of the rare parts of Kentucky to favor Democrats, Representative John Yarmuth, a Democrat from Louisville, won a fifth term after a lopsided primary victory.His opponent, Michael Macfarlane, a surgeon, spoke out against the Affordable Care Act, which Mr. Yarmouth supported. He also acclaimed his credentials from the National Rifle Association, which gave him high marks and gave Mr. Yarmouth an F.Democrats managed to hold onto the State House of Representatives, thwarting Republican hopes to control both chambers of state government.

Mary Fallin, took effect Nov. 1.But in a unanimous decision released Tuesday, the State Supreme Court voted to prevent enforcement of the rules until lawsuits challenging their constitutionality are settled by a lower court.One of the laws requires clinics to have a physician with admitting privileges at a local hospital present during abortion procedures. The other measure prohibits the use of medication to induce abortions after 49 days of pregnancy.The law requiring a physician with admitting privileges was challenged by Dr. Larry A. Burns, who operates a clinic in Norman, Okla., called the Abortion Surgery Center, which opened in 1974.Dr. Burns, who performs more than 40 percent of all abortions in the state, said the law would likely lead to him having to shut his practice, one of three abortion clinics in Oklahoma. He has been unable to obtain admitting privileges at hospitals near his clinic. Supporters say the statute is necessary to protect women who might have complications, such as hemorrhaging, during an abortion procedure, enabling them to have immediate access to hospital care.But abortion rights groups said the law was an attempt to limit womens access to abortions in the state. Further, womens organizations said, the statute was unnecessary because medical problems were rare during abortion procedures, and hospital emergency room workers were qualified to handle them.The courts decision allows Dr. Burns to continue performing abortions until the constitutionality of the law is settled in Oklahoma County District Court in the next several months.Similar laws have been approved by legislatures in at least 10 other states during the past several years. A number of the statutes, including those in Alabama, Texas and Mississippi, have been successfully challenged, as state and federal courts have found that the measures illegally restricted access to abortion. In June, the United States Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Wisconsin to reinstate a similar law in that state.The second measure blocked by the Oklahoma Supreme Court on Tuesday sought to regulate drugs used in abortions.It had been challenged in a lawsuit by the Center for Reproductive Rights, a nonprofit advocacy group based in New York, on behalf of Nova Health Systems, an abortion clinic in Tulsa, and the Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice.The law would have restricted medication abortions, and banned such procedures entirely after seven weeks of pregnancy. Instead, women would have had to undergo surgical abortions.A similar law approved by the Oklahoma Legislature was struck down by a district court judge in 2012  a ruling that was subsequently upheld by the State Supreme Court.Among other measures approved by the State Legislature in recent years was a 2010 law that required doctors to perform an ultrasound and then provide a verbal description of the fetus before performing an abortion. The law was deemed unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court.",2014-11-05,abortion

But television advertising is being changed by access to new data about viewership, while spending on digital formats is on the rise.Super PACs are here to stay, but they also are different than they were four years ago. In some cases they operate as a part of the party structure, in others as hubs for a growing network of donors. Get-out-the-vote work, once the province of the parties and labor unions, has expanded to include other advocacy organizations that have formed their own turnout operations.So while this election, like every one before it in recent times, featured record amounts of spending, its worth paying attention to how that money was spent and the changes affecting the election system. Heres why: Those changes will allow groups to reach voters with more specific political messages, which can harden partisans views but also potentially bring together new and perhaps unlikely voting coalitions.In effect, the political parties, which have been a dominant organizing principle in American elections, have new competition for both existing voters and new audiences. The changes give other organizations not just the ability to deliver a barrage of television advertisements, but also, and far more important, the opportunity to develop their relationships with voters in a deeper way.In the 2012 congressional elections, the committees that made the most independent expenditures were national party committees. This year, it was the Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC offshoot of the Democratic Party. It spent at least $69.7 million directly on races. It and the House Majority PAC, as well as the Congressional Leadership Fund, which backed House Republicans, have become fixtures in campaigns. (Senate Republicans opted for a let a dozen super PACs bloom approach in their races this year, a change from 2010, when the American Crossroads PACs did the heavy lifting.)The same could be true of the Chamber of Commerce, which for the first time waded into direct advocacy. It has disclosed that it has spent more than $35 million.While Citizens United remains the law of the land, there is little chance that business and union groups that have formed super PACs will not opt to use them. The American Chemistry Council, a trade association, began making independent expenditures in the 2010 election and reported $1.9 million in spending in this one.Other super PACs have become like political banks for state organizations. NextGen Climate Action, the super PAC funded almost entirely by Thomas F. Steyer, a billionaire hedge fund manager and philanthropist, not only spent directly in races but also put millions into environmental organizations around the nation. NextGen Climate Action raised $76.1 million through Oct. 15. The Movers  While Mr. Steyers largess  he is the top overall donor to super PACs since they were created  has generated headlines, the fund-raising clout of other environmental organizations has also grown. The League of Conservation Voters 501(c)(4) arm and super PAC both spent more than $9 million this cycle in congressional races, more than three times what the group spent in 2012. The Sierra Club spent $1.5 million.Combined with NextGen Climate Action, the environmental movement had its biggest independent spending this cycle: $47 million. Should Republicans take the Senate majority, it would give environmental groups a focus for rallying supporters during the next two years.Although it waited until the campaigns final months to start collecting donations, Freedom Partners Action Fund, backed by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, spent more on campaigns this cycle than did American Crossroads, the veteran Republican super PAC. Freedom Partners topped $21 million in independent expenditures, as did the Ending Spending Action Fund, another alternative to the Republican establishment.Other groups expanded their voter turnout operations, including Americans for Prosperity, another Koch-backed nonprofit that claimed a network of more than 500 paid staff members across 32 states. (The group is not required to file spending reports outside of certain broadcast advertisements, so it is unknown exactly how much the group spent on its field work.)Planned Parenthood created an affiliate called Community Outreach Group that runs door-to-door canvassing operations and hires campaign staff for local Planned Parenthood organizations and its national political wings. Planned Parenthoods super PAC spent nearly $1.5 million for turnout work this cycle. The Digital Frontier  Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican, probably did not need to advertise on Pandora, the online streaming music service. But he did so anyway in May, paying $6,750 to promote his re-election to the House of Representatives.Spending on digital platforms like Facebook is now normal; nearly 500 federal candidates and committees reported direct payments to the social media company this cycle, and the national party committees paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for advertising on it.But other, smaller services  both social media platforms and tools used to oversee them  are attracting attention, and money, from political campaigns. Twitter, which has a smaller audience than Facebook but teems with political messages, is one option for advertising dollars. TrendPo, which specializes in posting replies on social media platforms for political organizations, and HootSuite, which provides social media management, are being used to help campaigns keep track of their online activity.Theres greater investment on both sides of the aisle, said Brian Donahue, a partner at Craft MediaDigital, a Republican firm that does both traditional advertising and online work for political campaigns and corporate clients. It used to be only young people were reachable via mobile and online, but older people are now on social media and using smartphones. Its become not just a choice but critical.A growing number of firms sell online services, including advertising, data management and social media consulting. Campaigns and committees can buy a voter file and have it enhanced with additional demographic and political information by a number of firms like Haystaq DNA, founded by former staff members of President Obamas 2008 campaign.Republican committees can make targeted advertising buys via i360, a Koch brothers-backed firm that assigns scores to individual voters based on the likelihood they oppose abortion or government spending. A relatively small number of campaigns use these services now; that number should grow during the next two years.",2014-11-05,abortion

Over the last few weeks it has become fashionable to ridicule this election as a jumble of debates that dont resonate with the average American. The Washington Post deemed these midterms kind of  with apologies to Seinfeld  an election about nothing, and many other journalists have echoed the comparison. The joke is an old one: as the reigning clich had it, 2002 was the Seinfeld election  an election about nothing, Frank Rich wrote in these pages 12 years ago.To say that an election is about nothing means that no coherent national narrative has emerged  other than the medias obsession with the tight race for control of the Senate. Pundits and pollsters have published reams of charts predicting the final tally, but this obsession with data has further fragmented the story rather than explained what a Republican takeover would mean. Journalists have said comparatively little about what the party might do if it wins.In my state of North Carolina, the neck-and-neck contest between the Democratic senator Kay Hagan and the Republican Thom Tillis, speaker of the state House, seems to turn on one question. Who has provoked more voter outrage: the federal government or the state legislature? But this notoriously ugly and expensive race may help explain what the 2014 midterm elections are really about. The answer is not nothing.Ms. Hagan (and the super PACs that aid her) have mainly aimed to mobilize women and minority voters, going so far as to accuse Mr. Tillis of leading the effort to pass the kind of Stand Your Ground laws that caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Mr. Tilliss supporters have done their share of fear-mongering among black voters too. Does Kay Hagan care that one out of three babies aborted in America are black? asks one radio spot. Mr. Tillis has mostly run against President Obama and the senator who goes right along with him, in the words of one TV ad.But for North Carolinians the Senate race also serves as a referendum on the recent ideological revolution in the state: libertarians and social conservatives who gained control of both houses of the legislature in 2010 and the governors mansion in 2012 have obstructed access to abortion, blocked the advance of gay rights, cut taxes (mainly for the wealthy) and shrunk government investment in social services.On the left, this election is about identity politics: convincing particular groups, mainly women, African-Americans, and Latinos, that they are getting a raw deal, and that they should be angry. Dont be fooled by the fact that so-called mainstream Republicans who want to stick tightly to the anti-Obama script have tried to sideline the most clamorous voices in the Tea Party and the Christian Right. On the right, this is a contest over ideology: will North Carolinians capitulate to secularism and socialist welfare spending, or will they stand strong on the principles of Christian family values and the free market?Here in North Carolina, the silences speak louder than the noisy vitriol. Ms. Hagan  like most of her Democratic colleagues nationwide  has avoided speaking in ideological terms. Her vague references to North Carolina values do not offer a clear vision of the role of government in balancing equality with liberty, or personal autonomy with communal responsibility. Meanwhile, Republican supporters of Mr. Tillis have painstakingly avoided the identity politics at work in his base, where the preponderance of middle-aged white men is no secret.This election has affirmed a persistent truth of American politics over the last half century: The left cant talk openly about ideology, while the right pretends to ignore its own identity politics. The countrys political conversation is boring and unsatisfying precisely because its unspoken rules forbid politicians from acknowledging what is really going on and encourage them to talk past one another.The right has so thoroughly captured the terms of economic debate that American liberals  uniquely in the Western world  champion cultural issues like same-sex marriage equality while avoiding serious confrontation with the structural sources of socio-economic inequality. Their ideological cowardice has left them turning sensible reform proposals like single-payer health insurance into the Frankensteins monster of government-subsidized private enterprise that is the Affordable Care Act. Its tough to cheerlead for a clumsy, compromised law that satisfies no one; no wonder they have failed to persuasively defend it in this election.On the right, the steady expansion of civil rights and the onward march of secularization have compelled conservatives to accept the political rules of multiculturalism (while occasionally reserving the right to protest in the name of religious liberty). But the fact that most Republican leaders  at least those deemed fit for prime time  have mastered politically correct language does not mean that the party admits that liberal identity politics reflect legitimate minority grievances. Nor does it mean that they have confronted the prejudice and self-interest in their own ranks.Americans like to think of themselves as down-to-earth problem-solvers who live in a post-ideological society  even, in their more Pollyannaish moments, an almost-post-racial one. They imagine they are immune to the noxious -isms that wracked 20th-century Europe. In 1960, the sociologist Daniel Bell proclaimed the end of ideology: a good thing, in his view. An ideology, he wrote, looks at the world with eyes wide shut, a closed system which prefabricates answers to any questions that might be asked. At their worst, ideologies are indeed smelly little orthodoxies, as George Orwell put it  and identity politics can close minds, too. But at their best, they force us to confront the assumptions that drive our kneejerk reactions, to acknowledge the logic of our own beliefs and to follow that logic to its political conclusion. They force honest debate about how to balance competition between worthy but conflicting goals and can yield imaginative solutions to the challenge of living together in free society.When I ask students in my history classes to read part of Bells book, they always tell me that now that theyve stopped to look, they see that he spoke too soon. We all have assumptions and allegiances that shape our priorities and our reactions to new information: Creeds and tribalisms abound. This election is not about nothing. It turns on the basic philosophical divides and racial tensions that have defined American politics since the countrys founding. Its just too bad hardly anyone is talking about it.",2014-11-05,abortion

Takes Senate","Republicans picked up seats in Arkansas, West Virginia, Montana, South Dakota, Colorado, North Carolina and Iowa, consolidating their power on Capitol Hill.","Resurgent Republicans took control of the Senate on Tuesday night, expanded their hold on the House, and defended some of the most closely contested governors races, in a repudiation of President Obama that will reorder the political map in his final years in office.Propelled by economic dissatisfaction and anger toward the president, Republicans grabbed Democratic Senate seats in North Carolina, Colorado, Iowa, West Virginia, Arkansas, Montana and South Dakota to gain their first Senate majority since 2006. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a shrewd Republican tactician, cruised to re-election and stood poised to achieve a goal he has pursued for years  Senate majority leader.An election that started as trench warfare, state by state and district by district, crested into a sweeping Republican victory. Contests that were expected to be close were not, and races expected to go Democratic broke narrowly for the Republicans. The uneven character of the economic recovery added to a sense of anxiety, leaving voters in a punishing mood, particularly for Democrats in Southern states and the Mountain West, where political polarization deepened.The biggest surprises of the night came in North Carolina, where the Republican, Thom Tillis, came from behind to beat Senator Kay Hagan, and in Virginia. There, Senator Mark Warner, a former Democratic governor of the state, was thought to be one of the safest incumbents in his party, and instead found himself clinging to the narrowest of leads against a former Republican Party chairman, Ed Gillespie.Those contests were measures of how difficult the terrain was for Democrats in an election where Republicans put together their strategy as a referendum on the competence of government, embodied by Mr. Obama.House seats where Democrats had fought off Republican encroachment for years were finally toppled. Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was easily re-elected in Wisconsin, a state that voted twice for Mr. Obama. In Florida, Gov. Rick Scott, once considered endangered, finished the night on top. And states that had seemingly been trending Democratic, like Colorado and Iowa, fell into Republican hands.With at least a nine-seat gain and most likely more, House Republicans will have close to 245 seats, the largest Republican majority since the Truman administration.Barack Obama has our country in a ditch, and many of his lieutenants running for the Senate were right there with him, said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee. The punishment is going to be broad, and its going to be pretty serious.The breadth of the Republican victories also reset the political landscape ahead of the 2016 presidential campaign. And it left Mr. Obama with a decision to make: Will he move toward Republicans in his final years in areas of common interest, such as tax reform and trade, or will he dig in and hope Republican overreach will give his party a lane for a comeback?Just because we have a two-party system doesnt mean we have to be in perpetual conflict, vowed Mr. McConnell, in a victory speech.White House officials accepted the overture and said Mr. Obama had invited the bipartisan leadership of Congress to the White House on Friday.For Republicans, the victories piled up, winning not only Senate Democratic seats they were expected to take  Montana, West Virginia, South Dakota and Arkansas  but also in states that were supposed to be close. Representative Cory Gardner, a Republican, crushed Senator Mark Udall in Colorado. In Georgia, the Democrat Michelle Nunn, daughter of former Senator Sam Nunn, was widely expected to force David Perdue, a Republican businessman, into a runoff for the Senate seat of Saxby Chambliss, a retiring Republican. Instead, Mr. Perdue won more than half the vote to take the race outright.Senator Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican, also fended off the independent challenger Greg Orman, who just weeks ago appeared headed to victory.And for Democrats, it could get worse. Votes were still being tallied in Alaska, where Senator Mark Begich, a Democrat, was trying to hold back the wave. Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana was able to force her strongest Republican foe, Representative Bill Cassidy, into a Dec. 6 runoff. But the combined vote of the top two Republicans in the race easily eclipsed hers.I think its a message from the American people about their concern about the direction of the country, and the competency of the current administration, said Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, vice chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Most people have voted to end the dysfunction and to get back to legislating on issues that will help them and their families, and I think thats something that both parties need to listen to.One bright spot for Democrats came in New Hampshire, where Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the Democratic incumbent, fended off Scott Brown, the former Republican senator from Massachusetts, according to projections by The Associated Press. In Pennsylvania, Tom Wolf, a Democrat and political novice, easily defeated the Republican governor, Tom Corbett.And in the panhandle of Florida, Gwen Graham, daughter of a former Democratic senator and governor, defeated Representative Steve Southerland, a Tea Party favorite.But those high notes were swamped by the lows for the presidents party. In Arkansas, Representative Tom Cotton, a freshman Republican and an Iraq War veteran, defeated Senator Mark Pryor, despite the efforts of former President Bill Clinton.In Colorado, Mr. Udall tried to replicate the storied ground game that helped propel his Democratic colleague, Senator Michael Bennet, to an unexpected victory in 2010. He was not even close, and drew further criticism for running a campaign that some felt was too focused on abortion rights and contraception.And in West Virginia, Representative Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, won the Senate seat long held by Jay Rockefeller, a Democrat, to become that states first female senator and the first Republican elected to the Senate from West Virginia since 1956. In Iowa, Joni Ernst also made history by becoming the first woman to be elected in that states congressional delegation.Two years after handing Democrats broad victories, voters again seemed to be reaching for a way to end Washington inertia. Yet the results on Tuesday may serve only to reinforce it. Voters appeared unsure of just what they wanted, according to surveys. Among those who voted for a Democrat, only one out of eight expressed an unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party. Republican voters were more conflicted; among those who voted Republican, one of four viewed the party unfavorably.Mr. Obama is left with the prospect of finding a new path to work with Republicans, something for which he has shown little inclination, and Republicans must find a way to demonstrate they are more than the party of no.Even though a record $4 billion poured into the election  from the campaigns, parties and outside groups for advertising and other candidate support  the money did little to stir enthusiasm as the campaign set a more dubious mark for its low levels of voter interest.For their part, Democrats were hindered by their inability to persuade members of the coalition that delivered the White House to Mr. Obama  young voters, women and minorities  to turn out at levels seen in presidential elections. Decisions like Mr. Obamas delay of executive action on behalf of illegal immigrants also angered crucial constituencies.Even the president conceded the steep climb his allies faced.This is possibly the worst possible group of states for Democrats since Dwight Eisenhower, Mr. Obama told a Connecticut public radio station on Tuesday. There are a lot of states that are being contested where they just tend to tilt Republican.Democratic midterm losses during the Obama presidency now rival those of both Richard M. Nixon in 1974 and Bill Clinton in 1994 as the most destructive to his partys political standing in Congress in the post-World War II era. It was a stunning reversal for the president, who was the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to twice win a majority of the national vote.The top issue is not jobs and the economy; its ending gridlock in Washington, said Mr. Portman. Second, there is a desire to hold the administration accountable for incompetence on issues like ISIS and Ebola. I dont think those goals are inconsistent.With the political climate and the electoral map playing to their decided advantage, Republicans were determined not to relive the elections of 2010 and 2012, when infighting between establishment Republicans and Tea Party insurgents damaged the partys brand and elevated candidates who could not win.From the beginning, party officials decided to take sides when fierce primary challenges emerged. The party establishment crushed challengers to Mr. McConnell in Kentucky, and to Senators Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and Lamar Alexander in Tennessee.The establishment also sent reinforcements to help Senator Thad Cochran eke out a runoff victory against a Tea Party firebrand in Mississippi; cleared the Republican field for Mr. Gardner in Colorado; and backed winning primary candidates in Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire and Alaska.Democrats tried to distance themselves from the presidents health care law and economic policies, despite signs that both may be working. In Colorado, Mr. Udall relied on the playbook that propelled his Colorado colleague and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chairman, Senator Michael Bennet, to victory in 2010, speaking almost exclusively about abortion rights and contraception. That cost him the endorsement of The Denver Post, which castigated him for an obnoxious, one-issue campaign.Lost was Mr. Udalls work in the Senate opposing Mr. Obamas policies on security surveillance and privacy.In Kentucky, Alison Lundergan Grimes, considered a strong challenger to Mr. McConnell, lost some support when she refused to say whether she voted for Mr. Obama, and ran a risk-averse campaign.But mainly, Democrats were working off a map heavily tilted toward Republicans in states like West Virginia, South Dakota, Montana, Arkansas and Alaska, in a year when disengaged, frustrated voters and Mr. Obamas low approval ratings were inevitably going to be a millstone.",2014-11-05,abortion

Have two traditionally Democratic states in the Midwest, Michigan and Wisconsin, become viable targets for Republicans in 2016?Third, after the investment of millions of dollars by the Republican National Committee and conservative organizations affiliated with the Koch brothers, has the Republican Party caught up with or surpassed Democrats in this years technology-intensive, data-driven voter turnout operations?Fourth, have Republican candidates found ways to lessen the liabilities of hard right views on abortion, same sex marriage, contraception and other sex and reproduction linked issues?A Pew poll on Oct. 23 found that voters believe Republicans could do a better job than Democrats of dealing with the threat of terrorism (plus 17 points), the budget deficit (plus 15), the economy (plus 6) and immigration (plus 5). On health care, traditionally an issue that favors Democrats by double digit margins, the Democrats had only a 6 point edge.The Republican advantage on national security and terrorism is of particular importance because of the growing political salience of the threat posed by the Islamic State militant organization, known as ISIS. An October Wall Street JournalNBC poll found that 29 percent of voters put the threat from the Islamic State at the top of all issue priorities; these voters support Republicans over Democrats by a two to one margin.Similarly, Gallup found that 24 percent of the public worries about the Ebola virus, and confidence in the ability of the federal government to deal with the threat declined from 61 percent to 52 percent in a matter of two weeks, from Oct. 5 to Oct. 19. The drop in confidence was much sharper among Republicans and voters who lean Republican than it was among Democratic voters.The current finding that voters prefer Republicans over Democrats on immigration differs from polls in 2013 and earlier, which showed a preference for Democrats on the issue. The shift suggests that the recent surge of immigrant children crossing the border illegally has moved a substantial proportion of voters toward the more hard-line policies advocated by Republicans.Equally if not more critical, loyalty to the Democratic Party among two key constituencies  Hispanics, according to the Pew Research Center, and young voters, according to Harvards Institute of Politics  has diminished. In addition, the level of support for the Democratic Party among whites, especially working class whites, continues to fall, according to an NBCWall Street Journal June 2014 poll.In 2010, Pew found that Hispanic support for Democrats over Republicans stood at 65-22. Going into the current election, support for Democrats over Republicans declined 14 points to 57-28.The Harvard Institute of Politics Millennial voter survey found that among 18- to 29-year-olds who definitely will vote, 51 percent said they would prefer a Republican-run Congress; 47 percent said they favored Democratic control. This compares to a 55-43 margin in support of Democratic control of Congress in a 2010 I.O.P. survey of this age group.The Gallup Poll has found a slow but steady reduction in Democratic support among whites over the past two decades and a parallel increase in support among white voters for the Republican Party. In the Clinton years, whites favored Republicans over Democrats by 4.1 percentage points; in the Bush years, the Republican advantage grew to 5.4 points; in the Obama years, the Republican Party has pulled ahead by 9.5 points.Extensive polling has already demonstrated that some of the states considered reliable sources of Democratic or Republican Electoral College votes are shifting to a more competitive status.In Georgia, two Democratic candidates, Michelle Nunn, who is the daughter of former Senator Sam Nunn, and Jason Carter, a grandson of Jimmy Carter, have mounted surprisingly strong bids for Senate and governor, respectively, against David Purdue, a Republican businessman, and Nathan Deal, the incumbent Republican governor.Win or lose, Nunn and Carters respectable showing in a low turnout midterm election is virtually certain to turn Georgia into a Democratic presidential target in 2016. The last Democratic presidential candidate to carry Georgia was Bill Clinton in 1992 (who then lost Georgia to Bob Dole in 1996).At the same time, if two Republican governors, Scott Walker in Wisconsin and Rick Snyder in Michigan, win re-election, these two Midwestern states will shift in 2016 from the reliably Democratic column to competitive status.Details down to precinct level results in all the competitive races this year will be studied closely by party officials and political scientists to determine whether Republicans have caught up with Democrats in the world of big-data, high-tech voter mobilization.In the last two presidential elections, the Obama campaign and Democratic interest groups remained far ahead of Republicans in the so-called ground war techniques of locating favorable voters wherever they can be found, registering citizens likely to be supportive, and making sure every supporter casts a ballot, in person, by mail, or through early voting processes.In the current contest, however, both the Republican National Committee and the network of conservative groups allied with the Koch brothers have invested millions in microtargeting innovation, and are attempting to level the playing field.Estimates of the effectiveness of microtargeting vary, but, if the 2016 election is close, new digital strategies developed in recent years to marshal favorable voters will be crucial to the outcome.As the election campaign comes to a close, polls suggest that Republican candidates vulnerable to war on women accusations have learned how to successfully revamp.Senate candidates in Virginia, North Carolina and Colorado have adopted the strategy of signaling support for womens reproductive rights by pointedly endorsing access to over-the-counter morning after contraceptive pills.Representative Cory Gardner, the Republican challenging Senator Mark Udall of Colorado, has not only called for the availability of the day-after pill, he has repudiated his past support for a personhood constitutional amendment that would effectively ban all abortions. Initially considered the underdog, Gardner has pulled ahead of Udall in most polls leading up to Election Day.If Republicans find an effective means to combat Democratic charges that the Republican Party is anti-women, Democrats will lose one of their most potent political weapons.The 2014 election suggests that the intermittently heralded new Democratic majority in presidential elections is not inevitable, that the strong allegiance of core Democratic constituencies is not assured, and that the state-by-state Electoral College map is changing.Taken together, the current contest and the 2010 election demonstrate the strength of the Republican Party in low-turnout, midterm years. Perhaps the most significant development in 2014 is the ability of Republican candidates to break with hard right conservative orthodoxy  even candidates whose own roots are in the hard right. This capacity, insofar as it is carried over into 2016, has the potential to break the pro-Democratic tilt of presidential elections and to force a major strategic re-evaluation by politicians and operatives in both parties.",2014-11-04,abortion

Expects Big Night at Polls,"The outcomes of 36 governors contests, the battle for control of the Senate, nearly 50 competitive House races and countless ballot questions are at stake. Heres how to make sense of it all.","WASHINGTON   It is a recipe for sensory overload: Election returns will start flooding every device and screen Tuesday evening, capturing the outcomes of 36 governors contests, the battle for control of the Senate, nearly 50 competitive House races and countless ballot questions.Some trends are clear: A big night is expected for Republicans, a dreary one for Democrats.But some mysteries and many intriguing questions remain, and their answers will emerge throughout the evening. Here is a guide to what to watch for on election night, and how to cut through the cacophony.How big of a win will this be for Republicans? To gauge Republican strength, watch the Senate races in states that President Obama won in 2008 or 2012. If Republicans, who need to pick up six seats to gain the Senate majority, win in Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire and North Carolina, they are all but certain to take control. If they lose them all or split them, the fate of the Senate may not be known for some time. That is because the Louisiana and Georgia contests could go to runoffs (Louisiana in December, Georgia in January) and the results of the Alaska race may not be known for at least another day.What do the results tell us about the 2016 presidential race?It can be dangerous to extrapolate too much from midterm elections. But the two parties are eyeing key state races for clues about their presidential leanings.Republicans are closely watching Colorado, where Senator Mark Udall and Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, both Democrats, are in danger of losing. Mr. Obama won the state twice, and with a younger, increasingly progressive population, Colorado has been trending Democratic. If Representative Cory Gardner can defeat Mr. Udall, who made his campaign almost exclusively about abortion rights and contraception, it will demonstrate that Republicans still have strength in a state that could be essential to regaining the presidency.Democrats are hoping their Georgia candidates, Michelle Nunn for the Senate and Jason Carter for governor, can either win or at least post strong showings. Of the states that the two parties did not compete for in the 2012 presidential race, Georgia was the closest (Mr. Obama lost by seven points), and it is gradually becoming more of a polyglot hub than an Old South vestige. If Ms. Nunn or Mr. Carter wins or loses narrowly while drawing less than 30 percent of the white vote, it suggests that Georgia will be a competitive presidential state sooner than many observers expected.Do the Clintons still have their magic?With Mr. Obama largely sidelined because of unpopularity, Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton became their partys most in-demand figures on the campaign trail. Between them, they visited 25 states for more than 30 Democratic candidates. Yet some of the candidates they care most about are in peril: Mr. Clinton visited his native Arkansas three times in the campaigns final month, but his longtime friends running for governor (Mike Ross) and senator (Mark Pryor, the incumbent) are both underdogs. So is Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democrat challenging Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Ms. Grimess family has been close to the Clintons for over two decades, but there is only so much that Clinton-centered rallies, fund-raisers and commercials in these Republican-tilting states can do  raising the question of whether Mrs. Clinton, if she runs for the White House in 2016, will try to compete in states that backed her husband for president but embraced Republicans during the Obama years.What can be gleaned from the House races?There are fewer than 50 truly competitive House races, and the only mystery is whether the Republicans increase their already-sizable majority by more or fewer than 10 seats. But there are a handful of contests that could make a larger statement, particularly about whether voters who strongly favor one party in presidential races will elect candidates from the opposite party to the House. Is America on an inexorable road to a more polarized, nationalized style of politics? Watch Richard Tiseis bid to become the first Republican from Massachusetts to be elected to the House in 20 years; Gwen Graham, the Democratic daughter of Bob Graham, a former governor-turned-senator, who is trying to oust a conservative Republican in Floridas panhandle; and Nick J. Rahall II, a Democrat seeking his 20th term in West Virginia coal country, a historically Democratic region that has turned sharply Republican.Will governors races mirror the congressional races?Three governors races will play an outsize role in shaping the postelection narrative. Those are in Florida, Michigan and Wisconsin, where Republican governors are locked in tight re-election contests in states that voted for Mr. Obama in 2012.Democrats seem to have their best shot in Florida, where the states former Republican governor, Charlie Crist, is running as a Democrat against the Republican incumbent, Rick Scott. The polls also show up-in-the-air races in Michigan and Wisconsin, where the Republican incumbents, Rick Snyder and Scott Walker, appear to hold nominal leads.If the Republicans lose one or two of these races, it will complicate what might otherwise be an impressive performance for them in governors contests nationwide. Republican governors in competitive states have no business losing in what should be a good year for the party.What happens to the Obama coalition?Every vote counts, of course, but some constituencies  especially those that made up Mr. Obamas victories  will play a crucial role in shaping the outcomes on Tuesday.Democrats will need to counter a strong Republican advantage with men by winning women by nearly as much. That might require an even larger gender gap in some states than the 18-point one in the 2012 presidential election. Democrats will also need a much stronger turnout among nonwhite voters than they received in 2010. Black turnout in Georgia and North Carolina will be especially important: Follow whether the black share of the electorate approaches or exceeds 2012, when blacks represented 23 percent of North Carolina voters and 30 percent in Georgia.Who will get credit if Republicans win, and who deserves it? A Republican victory will have a thousand fathers. As you watch the returns, watch for the we-were-crucial talking points as the evening wears on. Just a handful of those who will likely claim credit: the Republican National Committee, Senate Republicans, the Karl Rove-backed American Crossroads, groups aligned with the conservative Koch brothers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.If Democrats hold the Senate, the biggest praise will not go to a person or committee, but to the partys sophisticated turnout operation, which was vaunted after Mr. Obamas 2012 win and will be all but politically canonized if they turn back the Republicans.",2014-11-04,abortion

But this view oversimplifies the causes of our political differences.Most people arent ideologically pure, and most dont derive their opinions from abstract ideologies and principles. People are more strongly influenced by the effects of policies on themselves, their families and their wider social networks. Their views, in short, are often based on self-interest.This point may seem obvious, but it is overlooked by many political scientists who focus on other explanations: parents and peers, schools and universities, political parties and leaders, and that abstract and nebulous catchall, values. But the most straightforward explanation, demographics, is also the most persuasive.Consider the evidence: Unemployed people are more than twice as likely as people working full time to want unemployment benefits increased. African-Americans are by far the most likely proponents of affirmative action and government help for African-Americans. Rich white men are especially likely to oppose income redistribution. Of course, there are many exceptions, from African-American conservatives like Herman Cain and Ben Carson to redistribution-loving tycoons like Warren E. Buffett and Bill Gates. But they are not typical.Self-interest is not limited to economics. People who want to have sex but dont at the moment want babies are especially likely to support policies that ensure access to birth control and abortion. Immigrants favor generous immigration policies. Lesbians and gay men are far more likely to oppose discrimination based on sexual orientation. Those who arent Christian are far more likely to oppose discrimination based on religion. Those who do best under meritocracy  people who have a lot of education and excel on tests  are far more likely to want to reduce group-based preferences, like affirmative action.A focus on self-interest helps explain why three-quarters of people who went to church as children dont attend church in their 20s. The young people most likely to abandon the church are those engaging in the kinds of lifestyles  involving alcohol, recreational drugs, premarital sex and nonmarital cohabitation  that religious conservatives condemn.Something similar explains the economic views held by college-educated people. Most end up leaning right on tax-and-spend issues later in life because  having been to college  they have higher incomes. Despite their early socialization, as adults start making their own decisions, their religion and politics usually align with their interests.Republicans and Democrats differ in another important way: in their commitments to policies that favor members of some groups over others. Democrats, for instance, favor policies that protect racial minorities, immigrants, gays and non-Christians. For this reason, they attract members of these groups (especially those with the most education). Republicans, in contrast, favor policies that work against members of these groups.Raising the issue of interests in politics often leads to this question: What about working-class whites who vote Republican? Our research confirms what other scholars have pointed out: Its not true that these voters ignore their economic interests. Over the past decade, among whites with household incomes in the bottom fifth, there have been roughly eight Republican voters for every 10 Democratic ones. Among the top fifth, there are around 16 Republican voters for every 10 Democratic voters.In short, when less-educated, white, native-born, heterosexual Christians vote for Republicans, theyre not necessarily ignoring their interests. They simultaneously hold conservative views on discrimination issues and liberal views on tax-and-spend issues. They often dont vote, but when they do, they split relatively evenly between the parties.African-American churchgoers are similarly divided  conservative on lifestyle issues, liberal on economic ones  but tend to favor Democrats.If the United States set policy simply by polling its residents, it would look quite different. There would be greater spending on the poor, health care, Social Security and education. Immigration would be reduced. School prayer would be allowed. Anti-American speech by Muslims would be restricted. Abortion would be legal in cases of rape and fetal deformity, but illegal if the abortion was motivated by not wanting more children, by being poor, or by being single.Why doesnt America look like this? Negotiations at the federal level result in more conservative economic policies, and more liberal social policies. Thats because they involve one set of highly educated, wealthy representatives negotiating with another, and the policies that result reflect their own core interests.Jason Weeden, a lawyer and psychology researcher, and Robert Kurzban, a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, are the authors of The Hidden Agenda of the Political Mind: How Self-Interest Shapes Our Opinions and Why We Wont Admit It.",2014-11-04,abortion

Andrew M. Cuomo, widely expected to win a second term, addressed supporters in Times Square as his challenger, Rob Astorino, campaigned at numerous events.","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo rallied supporters in the heart of Manhattan and across upstate New York on Monday, while his Republican challenger, Rob Astorino, hunted for votes across New York City and its northern suburbs, as time waned on a campaign with little suspense anywhere but in the State Senate.Mr. Cuomo was widely expected to win a second term on Tuesday. Mr. Astorino, the Westchester County executive, has never seriously dented Mr. Cuomos lead in the polls, as the governor spent heavily to try to ensure an impressive and potentially stature-raising margin of victory.But there remained serious questions about whether Mr. Cuomos appeal would be strong enough to deliver the State Senate into the hands of the Democrats, something the governor had sworn to fight for, but spent little time stumping for as the election season progressed.On Monday, Mr. Cuomo held a noontime get-out-the-vote rally in Times Square  with Kathy Hochul, a former congresswoman from western New York who is his candidate for lieutenant governor. The mood seemed celebratory, with placard-carrying supporters in abundance  many of them members of labor unions supporting the governor  as befuddled tourists looked on.Addressing the crowd, Mr. Cuomo brought up a recent comment by a supporter of Mr. Astorinos who had suggested that New York City voters would not turn out because they were lazy.Tomorrow we speak with one voice, the governor said. They say were lazy  you show them the biggest vote in history.Also on hand were two Democratic statewide elected officials with whom the governor has clashed: Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman and State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli, who each spoke briefly. Both also hold comfortable leads in the polls.Mr. Astorino campaigned more aggressively, with a dozen events and interviews on the agenda, capped by an evening rally at a golf course in Yonkers alongside John P. Cahill, the Republican candidate for state attorney general.Mr. Astorino struck a confident tone throughout the day, telling a morning radio interviewer that Tuesday would offer a lesson in how the mighty have fallen.Later, he stumped on Staten Island with Representative Michael G. Grimm, who is seeking re-election but is under indictment on charges of fraud, tax evasion and perjury.It was a sometimes ungainly pairing. At a supermarket stop, Mr. Grimm was heckled by one passer-by, who told him: Youre a crook. You should be in jail, as Mr. Astorino stood silently nearby.Mr. Astorino later defended Mr. Grimm, predicting that he would be eventually cleared of the charges against him. He also said he did not see any inconsistencies in campaigning with Mr. Grimm while also reminding voters of another ethics imbroglio: the Moreland Commission, the anticorruption panel that Mr. Cuomo formed, and then hastily disbanded in March, leading to a federal investigation.Governor Cuomo disrespected the people of New York, Mr. Astorino said between campaign stops. He should be indicted and thrown out of office.At an afternoon event in Albany, Mr. Cuomo continued to paint Mr. Astorino as an extreme conservative whose views, including opposition to abortion rights, were out of step with New York values.They have offered this state nothing except a step back, he said, adding that their philosophy is basically this: in society it is every man for themselves.In his first four years, Mr. Cuomo has struck a less aggressive pose toward many other Republicans in Albany, working with the rival party to pass four on-time budgets, something he has consistently promoted during the campaign.The governor, who fended off a primary challenge from the left in September, has also promised to return control of the Senate to Democrats, but has only campaigned in earnest for a few.Among those attending the Albany event were State Senator Cecilia Tkaczyk, a freshman legislator who is in a fierce rematch with George Amedore, a former state assemblyman, in the 46th District, near Albany.Polls have shown Ms. Tkaczyk trailing Mr. Amedore by 11 points. Two other Democratic incumbents, State Senators Ted OBrien of Rochester and Terry Gipson of Rhinebeck are also seen as vulnerable.Mr. Cuomo said a Democratic majority would be critical to the success of his legislative goals for a second term. It all rests on the Senate, he said.But, in a bit of expectation-adjusting, he also suggested that the outcome of State Senate races rested less on his own ability to carry the Democratic ticket than on hot-button regional issues like hydraulic fracturing, the contested form of natural gas extraction that his administration has yet to make a decision about despite years of scientific study, and a national trend toward Republican candidates.I dont think its going to be about coattails, he told reporters.Mr. Astorino was probably hoping the same thing, as he wrapped a whirlwind day at an event at the Dunwoodie Golf Course in Yonkers. He was introduced by former Gov. George E. Pataki, who spoke about his defeat of a Democratic incumbent  Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in 1994. It was a surprising victory that Mr. Astorino said he would love to replicate.Are you ready, he asked, to party like its 1994?",2014-11-04,abortion

Among them:AbortionBallot initiative aimed at ending or severely curtailing womens access to safe and legal abortion care will be contributing to the election night drama in three states: Colorado, North Dakota and Tennessee.Colorados Amendment 67 is a repackaged but unimproved version of the absurd and unconstitutional personhood proposals that voters in the state overwhelming rejected in 2008 and 2010. Like the earlier iterations, it would confer on fertilized eggs legal rights and protections that apply to living individuals, making abortion criminal even in cases of rape or incest or to protect a womans health. It is opposed by both the Democratic and Republican candidates in Colorados hard-fought Senate race. Another personhood measure, North Dakotas Constitution Measure 1, stands a better chance of success. It would protect the inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development.The Tennessee initiative backed by that states Republican governor, Bill Haslam, and many members of the Republican-dominated state government, also stands a decent chance. It states that nothing in the Tennessee Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion  potentially opening the floodgates for even more harsh abortion restrictions than the state already has.Time and time again when voters have understood whats at stake they have overwhelmingly rejected these kinds of measures, even in conservative states like Mississippi and South Dakota, noted Jennifer Dalven, the director of the A.C.L.Us Reproductive Freedom Project. The results this round, she said, will turn on getting out the word that the intent is the same:  to make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion.  Dorothy SamuelsMarijuanaThe lonely experiment in legalized recreational marijuana, so far waged by only two states, Colorado and Washington, may get bigger.Residents of Alaska and Oregon will vote on whether to legalize recreational marijuana, and residents of Washington, D.C. will vote on whether to repeal criminal and civil penalties for personal possession and allow limited, private cultivation. Polling in Alaska is all over the place, the Oregon race is too close to call, and it looks like D.C. will go ahead and end prohibition.The editorial board supports legalization generally and these ballot measures in particular. Decades of locking people up for using a drug less harmful than alcohol has done little or nothing to curtail consumption, while ruining the lives of those unlucky enough to get arrested. Juliet LapidosThe Minimum WagePolls suggest that voters in four red states  Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota  are expected to approve binding ballot measures that would raise the minimum wage in their states above the federal level of $7.25 an hour. Those votes should send a strong signal to Republicans who have bitterly opposed a Democratic proposal in Washington to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour by 2016.None of the measures would raise the minimum to the level advocated by Democrats in Congress, which, the editorial board has argued, is in itself not high enough relative to labor productivity and inflation. But these ballot initiatives are important nonetheless because they provide real-word evidence that a higher minimum wage has broad bipartisan support among voters.If Republicans do take control of the Senate as most political pundits are predicting, the party would be smart to renege on the promise Senator Mitch McConnell, who hopes to become majority leader, made earlier this year to Republican donors that he would not schedule a vote on raising the minimum wage.

In a coffee shop on Last Chance Gulch, a woman approached Mike Wheat to say she was planning to knock on doors for him. Its getting pretty brutal out there, she said.Mr. Wheat, a State Supreme Court justice running in the most expensive judicial race on record in Montana, nodded. In a parade of menacing television ads paid for by conservative groups, he has been attacked for a history of supporting extreme partisan measures (voting to raise fees on hunting licenses), and for allowing convicted criminals to use legal loopholes to go free. On the other side, unions and trial lawyers have accused his opponent, Lawrence VanDyke, of being in the pocket of out-of-state special interests.When Justice Wheat, 66, decided to run for another eight-year term on the court, he said, I never really anticipated that I would end up with a race like this. I never thought it would turn into this gigantic money battle.But judicial races have been evolving into another political battleground for big money. A last-minute surge of spending brought the total spent on television commercials to $12.1 million in 10 states, according to two groups that track judicial campaign spending. This election cycle, the spending race has been fueled by the Republican State Leadership Committee, which pledged to spend $5 million on a judicial fairness initiative, and contributed $400,000 in North Carolina last week.In the one election that has already taken place, in August, conservative efforts were unsuccessful. Despite spending more than $500,000 to unseat three justices, Tennessee voters retained them.In Montana, independent conservative groups have spent about $640,000  $469,000 by a political action committee financed by the Republican State Leadership Committee and $170,000 by Americans for Prosperity, the conservative group backed by the brothers David H. and Charles G. Koch, according to figures provided by the Brennan Center for Justice in New York and Americans for Prosperity.In response, a political action committee financed largely by Montana trial lawyers and unions has spent $475,000. The money dwarfs what the candidates have raised under Montanas strict individual contribution limit of $320: $132,000 for Mr. VanDyke and $143,000 for Justice Wheat, according to the most recent campaign filings.Its becoming one more log on the fire of the growth in big-money pressure politics, said Bert Brandenburg, the executive director of Justice at Stake, which advocates judicial election reform. Whats different is, of course, we want judges to be different. We pay legislators to make a promise and keep a promise; we pay judges to decide a case one at a time and ignore outside pressure. If money affects a legislators vote, it stinks. If money affects a judges decision, youve just violated the Constitution.Justice Wheat, a trial lawyer, grew up in Montana, served in the Marine Corps in Vietnam and began practicing law in 1978. He was elected to the State Legislature as a Democrat and ran unsuccessfully for attorney general before being appointed to the Supreme Court, the states highest court, in 2010 by a Democratic governor. The next election he was subjected, as all appointed justices are, to a retention vote, and won.He has participated in hundreds of cases, voting to require a wealthy landowner to allow access to a public waterways and to allow same-sex couples to receive benefits, and dissenting from the court when it allowed new gas wells to be drilled  because, he said, the required environmental impact studies had not been conducted. In criminal cases, he has sided with both the accused and the prosecution. He is friendly to plaintiffs and trial lawyers, voting to allow a bat manufacturer to be held liable for the death of a teenager hit in the head by a baseball, and dissenting in a case in which the court denied a $1.2 million fee arrangement for lawyers.Nonetheless, he has been endorsed by former justices and Republican officeholders, who say they resent out-of-state interference and what they view as an injection of partisanship.To take a little sliver of my record and bend it to a political message that theyre trying to get across, its wrong, its disingenuous and its misleading to the voters, Justice Wheat said.His challenger, Mr. VanDyke, 41, grew up in Montana and worked for his fathers construction company, earning an engineering degree before winning a scholarship to Harvard Law School. As an editor on the Law Review, he defended a book that argued that it was constitutional to teach intelligent design in public school. After graduating, he worked in Washington and Dallas for Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, the large corporate law firm that has given rise to prominent conservatives like Kenneth Starr.He came back to Montana when Tim Fox, a Republican, was elected attorney general in 2012 and appointed Mr. VanDyke to the post of solicitor general. There, Mr. VanDyke placed a special emphasis on writing amicus briefs supporting gun rights and anti-abortion laws. In one brief he wrote with Mr. Fox, they argued that Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision preserving a womans right to an abortion, should be reconsidered in the light of recent, compelling evidence of fetal pain. But he quit in May after conflicts with colleagues.Asked about critics who say he has tried to hide the extent of his conservatism from voters, he said, I am running on the platform that I am going to follow the law regardless of my personal preferences.Corporate interests, who say they are trying to preserve jobs and create growth, and trial lawyers, who say they represent the voiceless against the wealthy and powerful, have long gone head to head in judicial elections. As in any arms race, both sides say they are just trying to defend against the other.Right-of-center interests have been long outspent by left-of-center interests on judicial races, said Matt Walter, the executive director of the Republican State Leadership Committee. So we feel like weve provided some measure of balance for voters to make an educated choice.Alicia Bannon, a lawyer at the Brennan Center, said there have been some races where business groups have been vastly outspent. But nationally, she continued, conservatives have been the bigger spenders. According to her analysis: Among the top 10 spenders on Supreme Court races from 2000 to 2009, 69 percent of spending came from business interests and conservative groups. In 2009 to 2010, the figure was 70 percent. In 2011-12, things were more evenly divided: Among the top 10 spenders in 2011-12, 52 percent of spending came from business interests and conservative groups.Mr. VanDyke said courts in Montana had long been controlled by trial lawyers who funded election campaigns in a pay-to-play scheme, pointing to a 2004 race in which the Montana Trial Lawyers Association contributed $326,000 to retain a justice, James C. Nelson.There is no way that I could have a chance against the trial lawyer money machine without independent expenditures coming in and helping me, Mr. VanDyke said.Al Smith, the executive director of the trial lawyers group, said lawyers were trying to ensure that candidates were credible and had experience with Montana law. In 2004, he said, the challenger was inexperienced and the group anticipated a large amount of spending from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that never materialized.In 2006, 2008, 10, 12, we didnt spend anything  nothing, zero, he said. The idea that weve been spending all this money for decades is absolutely false.",2014-11-03,abortion

It was warm and sunny and smelled of cinnamon-orange tea inside a roadside cafe here in the mountains, but as a dozen Democrats waited for Senator Mark Udalls campaign bus to arrive for a last-minute pep rally, the air was laced with dread.In the final polls before Election Day, Mr. Udall was trailing his Republican challenger, Representative Cory Gardner. Early voter returns tracking Colorados first major election run entirely through mail-in ballots showed that Republicans had turned in 104,000 more ballots than Democrats, though they were hoping to close the gap.Democrats had spent the campaign assailing Mr. Gardners positions on abortion and birth control, trying to paint him as a Cro-Magnon opponent of womens reproductive rights  was their strategy failing them?Im really worried about Gardner and Udall, said Michael Merrifield, a Democrat running for a State Senate seat, who attended the Udall rally. Ive even had Democrats say to me, Im just tired of hearing about the womens issue.I live in a Democratic district, said Alma Cremonesi, a property manager in nearby Colorado Springs. Theyre not voting.Ms. Cremonesi said she had a thick stack of papers with the names and contact information of hundreds of likely Democratic voters  the fruits of sophisticated voter turnout operations that in recent years have helped push Democrats over the top here and in tight elections across the country. There are about 600 registered Democrats in her precinct, and Ms. Cremonesi said her job was to reach the 400 who had not yet mailed in their ballots. It was really overwhelming, she said.Years of Republican stumbles, combined with booming growth along the diverse and increasingly urban Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, have helped Democrats turn this states political roster as blue as the cloudless sky on this autumn morning. Democrats control both Senate seats and the governors mansion, and have majorities in both chambers of the state legislature. But this year, Republicans believe they can ride a wave of voter discontent  with new gun-control laws, health care reform and an uneven economic recovery  back into power.Lets claw back that lost territory, Bob Beauprez, the Republican hoping to unseat Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, said at a rally last week. Lets make Colorado a red state again.As the campaign closes, Democrats are still trying to convince voters that Mr. Gardner is more conservative than the earnest, grinning Republican who has lofted ahead in polls and won an endorsement from The Denver Post. Speaking to students on the campus of Colorado College, in Colorado Springs, Mr. Udall pointed out that Mr. Gardner opposes same-sex marriage, and said Mr. Gardners positions on climate change, renewable energy and college loans showed no vision for the future.As he does at many stops, Mr. Udall brought up his passion for mountain climbing to describe what has become a bitter, high-spending race. You dont schmooze your way up a mountain, he said. You dont climb it by accident. You dont trash-talk your way up a mountain. You just go climb it.The airwaves are a blizzard of Senate campaign ads  more than 55,000 have aired since January 2013, according to the Wesleyan Media Project. High-powered proxies are flying in to rouse the faithful. Bill Clinton, Michelle Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have come out for Mr. Udall. Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey are stumping for Republicans.Last week, dozens of Republican volunteers packed Mr. Gardners campaign offices in the college towns of Boulder and Fort Collins to get a handshake or selfie with the amped-up candidate. Spotting a boy in a Denver Broncos football jersey, Mr. Gardner whipped out his cellphone and showed him a photo of John Elway, the Broncos general manager and Hall of Fame quarterback, who has donated to Mr. Gardners campaign.The boys father, Dave Holdbrook, a truck driver who has been on disability for several years after a job-related injury, said he had already mailed in his ballot for Mr. Gardner.Im really concerned about whats going to happen with Obamacare, he said. Spendings just out of control, and Udalls lined up with Obama 100 percent of the way.Mr. Gardner, pivoting between reporters, voters and volunteers, offered a rapid-fire recitation of his case against the Democrats: Mr. Udall is a social-issues warrior who does not represent the entire states values. The economic recovery may have cut unemployment to 4.7 percent in Colorado, but it has left too many people behind, especially in cities like Pueblo and Colorado Springs. Government is choking off small businesses. Coloradans are working harder and harder and falling further behind. People in much of the state feel they have been forgotten. There should never be a forgotten Colorado, Mr. Gardner said.Outside his Boulder office, a group of students supporting immigration reform lined up to heckle Mr. Gardner about his opposition to granting citizenship to undocumented immigrants. Republican volunteers faced them down, shouting: Udall lies! and Detect! Detain! Deport!Mr. Gardner had long since left, but the two sides kept yelling at each other as the sun sank behind the mountains.",2014-11-02,abortion

Once he lights up, his high will be rapid and intense.Zach spends hundreds of dollars on smoking devices. But he has a side income. This evenings session was preceded by visits to three medical marijuana dispensaries, where, using his state-issued card, he bought pot products to sell to friends at a markup. Runners  campus argot, as in running around buying for others  are an open secret on campus.Zach takes a seat on his overstuffed sectional and tells how it happened: His first day living on campus, a sophomore had taken him to a dispensary for a pizza with marijuana baked in. He asked how he could get his own card, and friends coached him on telling a doctor about anxiety, nausea or back pain. I just said I had a bike accident when I was younger, and that caused lower back pain, which caused nausea and that caused anxiety, he recalls. I was afraid it wouldnt happen, so I just got all three knocked out. He presented a bill mailed to his dorm as proof he was a state resident, which he wasnt, and received a card allowing him to access medical marijuana immediately, two ounces at a time.Some of Zachs clients are under 21 and cannot buy recreational cannabis legally. But others are older students who simply dont want to pay the hefty tax  three times that levied on medical marijuana. So despite the abundance of recreational cannabis products since the first retail shops opened in January, there is still a vibrant black market for medical marijuana, which has been legal in Colorado since 2001 with a doctors recommendation.Theres definitely still the demand, says Zach, who is on track to graduate in December. He makes anywhere from a few dollars to a thousand a month, depending on how much he hustles, but he says that overall sales have declined a bit, what with retail shops, student growers and all the medical cards.Its difficult to say if students are smoking more. There is no long-term data by age, but statewide about 16,000 18- to 24-year-olds are on the medical marijuana registry. Thats 14 percent of all cardholders. City of Boulder tax revenue for medical marijuana for the first six months of 2014 was up 30 percent, at $500,000  about equal to revenue on recreational marijuana.Nationally, marijuana use among young adults has clearly been trending upward. The percentage of college students who reported smoking within the previous year plummeted from a high of 51 percent in 1981 to a low of 26.5 percent in 1991, and has been zigzagging back up, to some 36 percent in 2013, according to the Monitoring the Future Study at the University of Michigan. Data released in September show that one of 20 college students (one of 11 men) gets high daily or near daily, the highest rate since 1981. To put that in perspective, from 1990 to 1994, fewer than one in 50 students used pot that frequently.Experts say that the increase is surely a reflection of relaxed laws governing marijuana in some states, a movement gaining momentum. Floridians will face a ballot initiative on Tuesday on whether to legalize medical marijuana, which is allowed in almost half the states. Alaska, Oregon and District of Columbia voters will decide whether to follow Colorado and Washington State, where recreational marijuana has been legal since 2012.The amendments ban smoking in public  on streets and in parks, shops and restaurants. The same holds for campuses, including university housing.Dr. Donald A. Misch, associate vice chancellor for health and wellness at the University of Colorado, says that his main concern about the way legalization will affect students is that the industry  and associated advertising and commercialization  promotes the notion that cannabis is harmless. Monitoring the Future asks high school seniors if they see great harm in smoking regularly: 60 percent do not. In 2005, 42 percent did not.Dr. Misch is working with other campus officials to increase awareness about the effects of the substance, including its impact on learning. It is not going to turn you into an ax murderer, he says, but what I tell people is: The good news is that marijuana is in many ways better than alcohol. The bad news is its not as benign as many people want you to believe. Tucked away in a windowless basement room in the universitys Wardenburg Health Center, three clean-cut undergraduates are examining how marijuana is affecting them. Breathe,  a sign suggests in the softly lit room. Backpacks slung to the floor, the students form a restless crescent  pencils tapping, legs jiggling  around a new-age rug of concentric circles.Did anybody get in more trouble over the weekend? asks Stephen Bentley, a substance abuse counselor. They hadnt. The session, designed to help them see the discrepancy between getting high and reaching their goals, is one of three they have been mandated to attend. All are under 21 and were caught smoking.Marijuana citations by the campus police are, in fact, down  154 as of Oct. 3, compared with almost 256 in the same period last year. Christina Gonzales, dean of students, says the university is moving from a punitive stance to a more educational approach, easing up on enforcement. But last year, 718 students who had been sent to the health center by the courts or university after a substance-related offense (mostly alcohol) were found to be engaged in pot use that put them at risk.Michael, a sophomore from Colorado, was caught over the summer in a Boulder park for possession. A bike cop came up and saw me exhale. He paid fines and fees of about $150, performed 24 hours of community service and had to complete Mr. Bentleys three-part class. If he stays out of trouble for several months, the court will wipe his record clean. During the summer, he was smoking about five times a week but has slowed down with the start of classes.Mr. Bentley asks the group about problems with memory, which seems to resonate with Michael. If I get high a number of times per week, he says, I notice that my memory slumps a little.Mr. Bentley empathizes. You cant remember your car keys, phone?No, its not like that. If a friend tells me an answer to a problem when Im working on homework and Im not quite there yet, I cant remember it.So, you cant hold it in your mind, Mr. Bentley affirms. No judgment, no confrontation, no labels. This is the mantra.Mr. Bentley and counselors at other universities say they are seeing a small but growing number of students who have been smoking since age 14 and are serious users. He mentions dabs, an exponentially powerful form of marijuana. Last year, he got an email from a member of the housing staff. Students were wielding a butane torch in the dorm. The kids were saying, Were making crme brle on the hot plate. Not exactly. The torches heat a nail. A dab of pot concentrate is placed on the head. Vapors are inhaled.Thats the way things work in this culture, says Mr. Bentley, who has more than 20 years in the addiction field, 10 at Boulder. People on the front lines are playing catch-up a lot of times. Word spread quickly through the staff of the potential fire hazard.Universities are searching for ways to respond to marijuana, the most abused substance on campuses after alcohol. But interventions are often adaptations of programs for heavy drinkers that dont capture the marijuana experience, says Jason R. Kilmer, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Washington. In a typical program for experienced smokers, students answer questions adapted from a widely used index of alcohol-related problems: Has the student ever passed out after using? Got into a fight? But they arent asked about eating too much, coughing and problems with sleep, motivation, memory and attention  top unwanted effects of marijuana named in a recent survey of students by Dr. Kilmer and colleagues. Helping students recognize problems can prompt them to reduce consumption.Some colleges, including the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, Boston College and the University of Southern Indiana, have been adding programs tailored to marijuana users. C.U.-Boulder offers a tier of psychoeducational options  two levels of individual sessions for mild and more serious users, and a group program for moderate and heavier users. For students unable to curb their use, a more extensive program is being planned to help them add structure to their lives and find relaxation alternatives  yoga, maybe.Its a retention strategy as well, Mr. Bentley says. Users, even infrequent, are more likely to drop out, according to a 2013 report from the University of Maryland.Alan J. Budney, a researcher and professor at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, ticks off academic fallout: Not getting to class, changing majors, the B average becomes a C average  they are small things that arent disastrous but they can change the course of where you are heading.Research on universities efforts is scant. Several studies have shown encouraging, if short-term results. Three months after a brief intervention, students from two campuses in the Northwest reported smoking less and experiencing fewer pot-related consequences; ditto for Wilmington students one month after their program.At the heart of the sessions is motivational interviewing, which gets students to voice their own ambivalence about their use and eventually consider changing it.Students first discuss whats good about getting high, how it lubricates social interactions and dissipates boredom and stress. Michael, a driven computer engineering major, tells Mr. Bentleys group that pot helps him feel his emotions. Marijuana changed my point of view on life, not to take things so hard and go easier on myself. And, of course, there are the perception-altering qualities. Ben, a junior, smiles and says: When youre high, watching a movie or going to a concert is freaking awesome.They also discuss whats not so good (words like bad are taboo). Spending too much: I dont want to even think about that, says Kevin, the third member of the group, who smoked multiple times a day as a freshman but has cut back to three or four times a week. Lack of motivation scores, too. And anxiety. If you have anxiety in your life regularly, it amplifies it, Ben offers.As students reveal their dislikes, counselors listen intently for signs of self-medication for anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. But mostly, they listen for any hook that might motivate a student to cut back.Relationship troubles caused by a partners disapproval of their marijuana use is a biggie, says Rebecca Caldwell, director of the substance abuse program in Wilmington. So are slipping grades, a factor motivating the three in Mr. Bentleys session. For an athlete, it might be diminished lung capacity.Because marijuanas effects are subtle, some students dont connect the dots with, say, feeling tired after a nights sleep. Some dont want to see the connection. Pot becomes part of who they are. Oregon State University shut down its group program two years ago and now offers only individual sessions because participants were enabling one another, says Robert C. Reff, director of the substance abuse program.I ask: Who are your friends? How many smoke marijuana? And they say, All of them. Ask students what has changed at the University of Colorado since legalization and most will say: not much.Boulder has a long history with cannabis. Hippies flocked to this oasis of independent thought, drawn by a bustling music scene and student protests. As the city morphed into a counterculture outpost and activist hotbed  passing strict environmental laws, relaxing drug enforcement and opening one of the states first abortion clinics  getting high was not just a way to tune out but also a political statement.The only rules here are no rules, Rob Pudim, a resident, told a Newsweek reporter in a 1980 piece entitled Where the Hip Meet to Trip. The only people in town who arent comfortable, he said, are straight people who need boundaries.The campus still draws from afar. Nearly 40 percent of its 26,000 undergraduates are from out of state  a high percentage for a public university. They are attracted by mountain adventure and a stunning setting. The Flatirons, the steep slabs of rock that dominate the landscape, feel close enough to touch. Many students are here because of the robust science programs; C.U. is a member of the Association of American Universities, an exclusive group of research institutions. And because of its party-school reputation.On a recent Friday, a clutch of students and friends gather around a table garnished for an evening of casual indulgence: beers, playing cards, tubes of medical marijuana and a bong. All are 21, or almost there, and from other states.Several voice sentiments that are shared in other corners of campus. They didnt come here simply because its located in a permissive pot town, but cannabis culture certainly played a role. I could have went to a bunch of sweet public schools, says Erik Mingo, and I chose this one because I knew it was pretty accepted here. I knew people had an open mind.Mr. Mingo dropped out after the spring semester to work at a start-up. He has largely quit smoking, and isnt indulging on this night. I just didnt really need it anymore, he explains. It helped me relax and think about myself and the world, and I just wasnt getting the same return. His priority now is excelling at a demanding job, he says. I was moving on just naturally in my life.The campus is not under a cannabis cloud. Sometimes one sees a lit joint in the open or a vape pen in class, drawing ire from professors. But students and others talk about a shift in how they view cannabis consumption. Once an act of rebellion, it no longer seems to hold symbolic power. Now its just part of everyday life, says Joseph Kaley, 27, who graduated in 2009 and manages a Mexican restaurant on the Hill, an off-campus gathering spot. Mr. Kaley attended three of the campuss famous April 20 smoke-outs, lighting up each time to protest marijuanas criminal status at the time.In 2012, the university successfully shut down 420, saying it had grown so large it was disrupting academic life. Many were angered, particularly by the methods used to ward smokers away: Workers spread smelly fish fertilizer on the quad and anyone without a student identification card was turned away.New students, when asked, see the smoke-out as a piece of quirky campus history. Its just kind of fading from peoples memories, says Wyatt Ryder, 20, the chief of staff of the student government, which last April held a symposium offering an all-inclusive inside dive into the realm of cannabis culture.The goal was to have a very nuanced discussion about marijuana, said Caitlin Pratt, 23, Mr. Ryders colleague in student government. Panelists discussed making money in the industry, the effects of cannabis on the mind and efforts to legalize the substance in other states. One of the most popular panels was led by Nolan Kane, a C.U. professor attempting to map the cannabis genome to better understand marijuanas medical, fuel and biotechnology potential.A few months later, Mr. Ryder attended a national conference for student government representatives. He was accosted with questions  and jokes  about pot culture at his university. Mr. Ryder, who doesnt even smoke, was shocked to be appointed the conferences unofficial marijuana expert.I just think its fascinating, he said, because to us in Colorado, its not such a big deal. But to other people, its a major issue.",2014-11-02,abortion

Andrew M. Cuomo wants to win as many votes as possible in the election on Tuesday, but some liberals suspect he also wants to weaken a political party.","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo wants to win as many votes as possible in the election on Tuesday. Some liberals suspect he has a second goal: to weaken the Working Families Party.The party, made up of liberal activists and labor unions, has irked Mr. Cuomo for years by trying to push him to the left, though the governor will still appear on its ballot line on Election Day.But Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, is threatening to cut into the partys share of the vote by promoting his own political party, the Womens Equality Party, on whose ballot line he will also appear.I think everyone knows that Governor Cuomo is trying to kill the Working Families Party, because its the only group that has ever really stood up to him, said Anita Thayer, a Working Families Party state committee member from Albany. Just the fact hes trying so hard to get rid of us obviously means were a thorn in his side and doing something right.The election will test the wisdom of an uncomfortable political truce that the Working Families Party reached with Mr. Cuomo in the spring, after it had threatened to run a candidate against him. Instead, the party agreed to endorse the governor after he promised to push for a number of its goals, including a Democratic takeover of the State Senate.But Mr. Cuomo has been less than forceful in following through on that promise. The candidate that the party had recruited to run against him, Zephyr Teachout, challenged the governor in the Democratic primary and won a third of the vote.The predicament facing the party is a product of New Yorks unusual voting system, which allows candidates to appear on multiple ballot lines. Parties must receive 50,000 votes in the race for governor to preserve their ballot line, and the number of votes they receive determines their position on future ballots.Mr. Cuomo and his allies formed the Womens Equality Party over the summer, and he has placed womens issues at the center of his campaign. He has sought to draw a sharp distinction with his Republican opponent, Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive, who opposes abortion rights.Im a man who has seen Albany disregard women, and Im sick of it, Mr. Cuomo wrote in an email to supporters on Thursday, asking them to vote for him on the Womens Equality Party ballot line. He has echoed that request at campaign rallies focused on womens issues, to which he has traveled on a bus branded the Womens Equality Express, and in advertising financed by his re-election campaign.In a radio interview on WNYC on Friday, Mr. Cuomo offered a quip that seemed to minimize the Working Families Party.Weve formed every kind of fringe party for every kind of reason, the governor said. We have Democrat, Republican, Green, red, white, blue, working people, working short people, working tall people. Weve never had a womens party. This is the home of Seneca Falls. Let the women make their voice heard.Mr. Cuomo said the suggestion that he was trying to damage the Working Families Party was really tortured analysis, adding, I am less concerned with the internal political machinations of who has political power, and Im more interested in social change.In addition to the likelihood of losing votes to the Womens Equality Party, the Working Families Party also faces the risk that some disenchanted liberals will protest Mr. Cuomo by voting for Howie Hawkins, the Green Party candidate.Allen Roskoff, president of the Jim Owles Liberal Democratic Club, which has endorsed Mr. Hawkins, said the Working Families Party had defeated its own purpose this year by coming out for Andrew.If they had endorsed Zephyr Teachout, they would be riding high, and their numbers next week would be tremendous, he said.The Working Families Party is pressing voters to stick with its ballot line. The party has sent mailers featuring the image of Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, and on Friday it released a video from Whoopi Goldberg urging voters to send a clear progressive message. This weekend, the party also plans to roll out a robo-call featuring the actress Cynthia Nixon.Bill Lipton, the partys state director, said the party decided to stick with Mr. Cuomo because he promised to support some of its top goals, such as raising the minimum wage and providing public financing for state political campaigns. But well never hesitate to criticize him when hes wrong, he said.",2014-11-01,abortion

But some are now questioning whether pulling focus away from such issues as jobs and the economy was a good idea.","WASHINGTON   Democrats are nervously counting on an enduring edge among female voters in most states to prevent a Republican rout in Tuesdays elections. Yet so great is the uncertainty that even before the returns are in, some are second-guessing the partys strategy of focusing more on issues like abortion and birth control than on jobs and the economy.The danger for Democratic candidates is that their advantage among women could be so reduced by dissatisfaction with President Obama and the countrys course that it is not enough to offset Republicans usual edge among the smaller population of male voters. Should that happen, a party pollster, Geoff Garin, acknowledged, Theyll lose.But he and other Democratic strategists professed optimism, however tempered, for the partys imperiled Senate majority, among other things. Mr. Garin pointed to surveys of states with the most competitive Senate contests showing that on average Democratic candidates lead among women by about 12 points, while men favor the Republican by an average of nine points. Since women account for more than half the electorate, Democrats theoretically can withstand some erosion of support.As for the partys emphasis on womens issues, he said, If Democrats werent running on these issues, the situation would be much worse.The headwinds that you get from Obama and other factors affect everybody  they dont only blow in the faces of men, Mr. Garin added. Even in the face of those headwinds, Democrats are still much better able to succeed with women voters than with men voters.In Kentucky and Louisiana, new polls grabbed attention for suggesting that Republican Senate candidates had made inroads with women. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senates Republican leader, was essentially tied among women with the Democratic challenger, Alison Lundergan Grimes, in a Bluegrass Poll taken Oct. 25-29. But the poll, by SurveyUSA, does not meet polling standards of The New York Times because it was partly conducted using automated phone calls.Louisianas embattled Democratic senator, Mary Landrieu, narrowly led her Republican challenger, Bill Cassidy, among women and men likely to vote by Tuesday, according to a poll conducted Oct. 11-24 by the University of New Orleans Survey Research Center. But both groups flipped in Mr. Cassidys favor for the expected December runoff election that will be required by state law, assuming neither candidate exceeds 50 percent.Yet in a number of battleground states for the Senate and for governor, Democrats continue to have enough of an advantage among women to be in contention, even though many of the states are heavily Republican.That was true for Senate candidates in Colorado, Iowa, Georgia, Arkansas, New Hampshire and North Carolina, recent polls indicated. In Iowa, a Democrat, Bruce Braley, had a 12-point advantage among women over his Republican rival, Joni Ernst, who led by 15 percentage points among men, in a poll conducted for CNNORC International this week; over all, the two were statistically tied. Ms. Ernst has been a particular target of womens groups because  unlike Cory Gardner in Colorado, another Republican Senate candidate  she has not backed off her support for a personhood amendment conferring constitutional rights at conception, which would effectively outlaw abortion and some fertility treatments and birth control methods.Both parties strategists are scouring the rush of final polls and state tallies of early voters to gauge whether Democrats are succeeding at their ambitious goal that has defined this campaign season: persuading and turning out women, particularly minority and unmarried women. Those are Democrats most reliable supporters, but also the groups most likely to skip voting in a nonpresidential election year. Married white women are more likely to vote, and tilt toward Republicans.Democrats and allied womens groups say they are confident the partys candidates will do better among women than in 2010, the previous midterm election year, when Republicans overall won female voters by a single percentage point and captured a majority of the House and many state legislatures. Page Gardner, founder of the Voter Participation Center, which works to increase voting among unmarried women, said single women are more engaged than earlier in the year. A recent Washington PostABC News poll, however, suggested their interest is lower than in recent elections.Its certainly true that wed be doing better if we were doing better with women, but I do not see a disproportionate drop with women relative to men, said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster.Trends are hard to discern from the array of state and national polls. The evidence about womens leanings is mixed, and sometimes contradictory.In Arkansas, the Republican candidate, Tom Cotton, was tied with Senator Mark Pryor among women in a poll of likely voters conducted Oct. 4-7 by Fox News. Yet Mr. Pryor had an 11-point edge among women in an Oct. 19-23 poll for NBC News and Marist Colleges Institute for Public Opinion.On balance, I am not convinced the Democrats will make sufficient inroads with white women to make up for the margin by which they are going to lose white men, said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster. Democrats have not won a majority of white women since 1992.Tuesdays results, Mr. McInturff added, would tell whether it is possible that the single-minded focus that most Democratic candidates attached to the war on women meant they never conveyed an economic and jobs message that might have led a higher chunk of the persuadable male vote to vote Democrat.Republicans increasingly make that argument that Democrats miscalculated in their zeal to galvanize women who otherwise would not vote in a midterm election  especially since The Denver Post this month endorsed Mr. Gardner, the Republican candidate, for Senate, criticizing the Democratic senator, Mark Udall, for an obnoxious one-issue campaign about contraceptives.Democrats counter that Republicans use the phrase Republicans war on women more than Democrats to stoke a backlash among older and married women who reject partisan, feminist-sounding rhetoric and lean Republican. Ms. Greenberg said Republicans were deliberately misconstruing Democrats legitimate attacks. Yet she and other Democratic strategists complain their party has not effectively espoused a broader economic agenda, when women tell pollsters their top concern is jobs and the economy.White House aides say the president has tried to show how to make the case for Democratic policies and to take some credit for the economys growth, yet Mr. Obama himself is an unwelcome messenger given his unpopularity. Nonetheless, on Friday the president was in Rhode Island to speak  as the White House announcement put it  on the economy and the importance of pursuing policies that help women succeed.",2014-11-01,abortion

Representative in Upstate New York Is Strong Among Democrats,"Representative Chris Gibson, a Republican, has a 41 percent favorability rating among Democrats, and a wide lead over Sean Eldridge, the Democratic candidate.","KINGSTON, N.Y.  A local Democratic lawmaker is casting a vote on Tuesday for Representative Chris Gibson, a Republican, because hes down to earth. A longtime volunteer for Democratic campaigns is supporting Mr. Gibson because hes run a positive campaign. A retired Democratic union worker will back Mr. Gibson because, after an hourlong meeting, he concluded that Chris is a good man.The campaign in New Yorks 19th Congressional District, pitting a plain-spoken, lifelong local resident against the polished, newly arrived husband of a Facebook founder, has drawn national attention  and an infusion of outside money  as a supposed tale of nouveau riche liberal ambition, real-estate excess and carpetbaggery run amok.But in its final days, the race here in the Hudson Valley and the Catskills is emerging as something even rarer, and perhaps more intriguing, in an era of reflexive partisanship: a case study of how a Republican can cultivate, win over and retain an unusually high level of support from Democrats in a swing district, while adhering to Republican positions.What many predicted would become a harsh referendum on the audacity of Sean Eldridge  a first-time Democratic candidate with a thin rsum and a thick wallet  has instead revealed the depth of bipartisan affection for Mr. Gibson, a decorated veteran of two wars who returns his $4,300-a-month military pension to taxpayers, has capped his service in Congress at eight years, and travels the district in a black ragtop Mustang (a gift from his wife when he returned home from duty in Kosovo).Despite a barrage of negative ads against him, Mr. Gibson, 50, holds a wide lead over Mr. Eldridge, 28. Most strikingly, according to a Siena College poll of likely voters this week, Mr. Gibson has a 41 percent favorability rating among Democrats  the envy of the Republican Party.That is phenomenal, said Steven A. Greenberg, a Siena College pollster. In the neighboring 18th Congressional District, by comparison, former Representative Nan Hayworth, a Republican trying to reclaim her seat, is viewed favorably by only 16 percent of Democrats.Mr. Greenberg called it impressive that 28 percent of Democrats said they would vote for Mr. Gibson. The poll had Mr. Gibson leading by 23 points over all.At a pizzeria here in Kingston on Thursday, such Gibson Democrats were not hard to find.Youre doing a good job, Jack Becker, a 58-year-old Democrat, said as Mr. Gibson campaigned at a weekly Kiwanis luncheon. If something was wrong, I could imagine needing a shake-up. But I dont right now.A former high school point guard who grew up in the town of Kinderhook, Mr. Gibson has run on a message of studied moderation, boasting of his role with the group No Labels, which has sought to counter the prevailing partisanship in Washington.In an interview, he spoke warmly of Democratic colleagues, calling Representative Peter Welch of Vermont a good friend, marvelous and fantastic, and saying I really like Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, who has the seat Ms. Hayworth hopes to reclaim and has sponsored bills with Mr. Gibson.His record stands out for its ideological haziness. He voted against cutting federal funds for National Public Radio and in favor of research into the causes of climate change. He was the rare House Republican to support legislation prohibiting most employer discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and to oppose sending American ground troops to fight the Islamic State.Outside a school in Grand Gorge, Mr. Gibson ran down the motley list of groups that have endorsed or supported him: The Environmental Defense Fund; the National Rifle Association; the state teachers union; the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. How often, he asked, do you look at a group like that, and see such an eclectic set of interests getting behind the same candidate?Even voters who disagree with him over emotional issues like abortion rights (he supports restrictions after 21 weeks), same-sex marriage (he opposes it) and the Affordable Care Act (he voted to repeal it) appreciate his rigor, visibility and openness, he said.Im in all these communities, he said, adding, Voters appreciate that.It was a not entirely implicit rebuke of Mr. Eldridge, who moved into the district in 2013, buying a $2 million home an hour from the $5 million Hudson Valley house he already owned with his husband, Chris Hughes  and prompting claims that he had moved just to run for Congress.Mr. Eldridge, in an interview on Wednesday, said that he was disheartened by Mr. Gibsons electoral strength at this late stage. Look, to be frank, he said, I think his popularity is higher than one would like it to be a week out. When I took on this race, I certainly understood that I was challenging an incumbent who was relatively popular in the grand scheme of things.But he said Mr. Gibsons reputation for moderation was both unearned and overstated. I dont believe its moderate to vote to defund Planned Parenthood and to restrict a womans right to choose at every opportunity, as hes done in Congress, Mr. Eldridge said at the crowded home of a Democratic councilwoman in Plattekill on Wednesday, drawing nods from the party faithful, most of them women.Mr. Eldridge, a Brown University graduate who started a company that invests in local businesses, built a robust political operation with seven campaign offices and 1,000 volunteers. But at times he has run a discordantly national race in a district deeply protective of its local identity, focusing on issues like the minimum wage, campaign-finance reform and abortion rights.Local leaders said casting Mr. Gibson as out of step with his neighbors had failed for a simple reason: He is well liked, and those neighbors do not recognize the demonized view of him in ads from Mr. Eldridge and his allies.Brian J. Coons, a Democratic supervisor in Pine Plains, said he had nothing against Mr. Eldridge, but did have a strong rapport with Mr. Gibson, who has come to the smallest events in his town. Chris Gibson gets into the community, he said. You can talk to him. Thats the bottom line.",2014-10-31,abortion

As he steps to front doors along the winding roads here in his rural House district, State Representative Joe Radinovich announces that he is there to introduce himself, and in case you want to yell at me about something.There is reason to anticipate yelling.Mr. Radinovich and his fellow Democrats won control of this states government two years ago by flipping both legislative chambers, and pushed through tax increases for the wealthiest Minnesotans, acceptance of President Obamas Medicaid expansion for the poor, and approval of same-sex marriage.Now Mr. Radinovich, 28, is facing the same Republican rival he defeated by just 323 votes in 2012, and his opponent is mounting a blunt, aggressive campaign accusing Democrats of overreaching.The only thing people are more disgusted with than deadlock in St. Paul is one-party control in St. Paul, said Dale Lueck, 65, a Navy retiree who raises beef cattle and is Mr. Radinovichs challenger. Even people who thought that was a good idea at one point have come to be concerned about the kind of excesses that happened, Mr. Lueck said the other day, then rumbled off in his white pickup to knock on more voters doors.Twenty-three states are now controlled by Republicans, and 13 by Democrats, the most states under single-party rule in six decades.With Mr. Obamas poll ratings poor and midterm elections traditionally favoring the party that does not control the White House, Republicans are hoping to add Iowa and Arkansas to the states entirely under their control as well as to break the Democrats lock on power in places like Colorado and here in Minnesota.Democrats view the governors races in Wisconsin, Kansas and Michigan as among their best hopes of defeating a Republican incumbent and regaining at least some voice in those Republican-held state capitals, and are pouring energy and money into final efforts to get out the vote.The trend toward one-party control of statehouses has made the states a testing ground for party policies in an era of gridlock in Washington.Colorado, dominated entirely by Democrats, approved limits on ammunition magazines, background checks on private gun sales and in-state college tuition for some illegal immigrants, and expanded mail-in voting. Wisconsin, held solely by Republicans, sharply limited collective bargaining rights for most public sector workers, reduced early voting and expanded school vouchers. In both states, recall elections followed, and in Wisconsin thousands of protesters marched for weeks around the Capitol, while some counties in Colorado called for secession.The last two years were the most active policy-making years in states in years, said Tim Storey, an elections analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures. And in some places I think voters may be saying, Well, wait a minute, I think we need divided government or maybe some more balance here.Among 36 governors races, about a dozen are seen as especially close, including several that will decide whether a single party keeps full control of a state. What has happened now has been uncommonly extreme and harsh, said Dick Bond, a former Kansas Senate president, who is among a group of Republicans supporting Paul Davis, the Democrat challenging Gov. Sam Brownback, whose party has carried out a firm agenda of tax cuts since 2011.With more than 6,000 state legislative elections, dominance in about 15 state legislative chambers might shift and the parties are fighting strategically for the few seats that would allow them to take control of a legislative chamber  and either gain single-party control or, in more cases, end it for the other party.Republicans have their eyes on upper houses in Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Nevada and Oregon, and lower houses in Kentucky, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico and West Virginia. Democrats say they see possibilities for taking control of State Senates in places like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as well as Washington and New York (where Republican-led coalitions are now in control), and houses in Arkansas and Michigan.In Michigan, Democrats are pouring in far more resources than they did in 2010 for get-out-the-vote efforts to defeat Rick Snyder, the Republican businessman-turned-governor, while also pressing to take the State House, which Republicans control by nine votes.The voters have a serious case of buyers remorse right now, said Lon Johnson, the chairman of Michigans Democratic Party, ticking down provisions passed since Republicans took full control there in 2011: prohibiting requirements that workers pay fees to unions as a condition of employment, taxing retirees pension income, and increasing regulation of abortion facilities.But Dick DeVos, a leading Republican donor in the state who once ran for governor, said he believed that one team having the ball had proved its value in four short years, particularly given the state of the economy when the Republicans took over.In Michigan, we were not at a time where we had to be careful about making mistakes, Mr. DeVos said. Having partisan bickering and no action, we would have been stuck in Michigan for years. We didnt have time for that. Wed be stuck in last place. Did they do it perfectly? No. Is it a better place? Yes.In Colorado, where the Democrats won full control in 2012, there has already been fallout. Two Democrats were removed in recall elections in 2013, cutting the partys hold on the State Senate to a single vote, and Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, is fighting for political survival in a tight race with Bob Beauprez, a Republican. In the State Senate, Republicans have targeted eight seats in the hope of gaining some say  though by no means complete control.It shortens the rudder, Senator Bill Cadman, the Republican minority leader, said of the prospect of divided government. You cant take massive turns in extreme directions when the legislatures balanced.In at least one state, North Carolina, this fight over one-party control has bled beyond the State Capitol into a tight race that could help decide control of the United States Senate. Kay Hagan, the incumbent senator, has struck out at Thom Tillis for his role as House speaker in that states Republican-run Capitol.After Republicans took sole control of state government in 2012, the state took a sharp turn to the right, cutting taxes and business regulations, reducing unemployment benefits and allowing concealed guns in bars and restaurants.The Hagan campaign has managed to make her federal election a referendum on the state legislature and education issues you usually dont see in these sorts of races, said Thomas Mills, a Democratic political strategist and blogger in Carrboro, N.C.Here in Minnesota, Mr. Luecks is one of a handful of races Republicans are paying special attention to in a push to end the Democrats lock on this states capital, its first complete dominance over St. Paul in more than two decades. The State Senate is not up for election this fall, and polls have shown Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, ahead of his opponent, Jeff Johnson, a Republican, leaving Republicans to channel much of their attention on winning control of the House, which Democrats hold, 73 to 61.The fight has centered on a handful of House races in areas like the one around Aitkin  a district with a single stoplight and where a far quieter race was exceedingly close two years ago.Here, the Democratic Legislatures decision to approve same-sex marriage in 2013 raised eyebrows; a year earlier, a ballot measure amending the State Constitution to define marriage as between a man and woman failed statewide, but was supported by more than 60 percent of voters in this district. Mr. Radinovich voted to legalize same-sex marriage.Our state has turned into a little Obama playground, said Kari Abbott, chairwoman of the Aitkin County Republicans. One leaflet here from a G.O.P. Rural Caucus reads: One party control = Out of Control spending.Mr. Radinovich, who snacks on gummy worms along the campaign trail, has had a sudden education in partisan politics. He has been to about 4,500 homes along these roads, seen surprisingly high outside spending on this race  both for him and his opponent  and faced a barrage of questions at these front doors.As to what has unfolded since 2012 with one-party control in St. Paul, Mr. Radinovich often recalls an earlier time  a government shutdown in 2011 when a Republican-led Legislature could not settle with the Democratic governor on a budget.Look, we had years of divided government, Mr. Radinovich said. We saw what that did.",2014-10-31,abortion

His is not one of those hard-up campaigns that have to worry where the next sign or brochure is coming from. As a 60-year-old businessman whose fortune runs into nine figures, Mark Greenberg has been able to furnish plenty for his run for Congress.But when a homeowner here asked for an extra-large lawn sign to match his neighbors, Mr. Greenbergs campaign manager, Bill Evans, talked him into taking a smaller one.Not that it would have hurt Mr. Greenbergs cause to brandish a little Republican brawn in Cheshire, which is home to the Democratic incumbent, Elizabeth Esty. But Mr. Evans said Mr. Greenberg was too conservative to spend $100 for a sign on a street already crowded with Mr. Greenbergs name.Ms. Esty and her campaign staff are far less inclined to leave anything to understatement. Elected two years ago to represent a Congressional district serving communities northwest of New Haven, Ms. Esty, who is 55, has significant money of her own from a family manufacturing firm and can call on party resources to help keep a seat that national Democrats had until recently feared was vulnerable.She is the one who has set the tempo of this race, said Gary Rose, chairman of the political science department at Sacred Heart University, adding that Mr. Greenberg was running a relatively lackluster campaign.In 2012, Ms. Esty lent her campaign $600,000 to clinch her victory against Andrew W. Roraback, a well-regarded Republican state legislator who was expected to seek a rematch, but who was plucked by the states Democratic governor for a judgeship. Many considered the move a shrewd way of sidelining a strong competitor.As this years incumbent, Ms. Esty has had enough help from Democratic organizations and groups to avoid having to dip into family assets, giving her a bigger campaign war chest than Mr. Greenberg, a man she paints as an out-of-touch millionaire.She has also proved to be a cagey fighter, willing to engage in rough-and-tumble tactics, but with a smile. She has exploited her opponents bluntness about political hot-button issues and cast herself as independent of President Obama, a man she slathered in praise on election night in 2012.As a longtime Cheshire resident who has observed her political ascendancy, Professor Rose said: She can be ruthless. I dont mind saying that.Despite their mutual status as well-to-do Ivy Leaguers  Mr. Greenberg roots for Cornell, while Ms. Esty attended Harvard College and Yale Law School  the two candidates present stark contrasts.On abortion, Mr. Greenberg, who has run for Congress twice, says he is pro-lifer. Ms. Esty is unabashedly pro-choice.She wants to raise the income limits on the Social Security tax. Mr. Greenberg prefers enacting a gradual rise in the retirement age that would mostly affect those under 50.Representing a district that includes the site of the Newtown school massacre in 2012, Ms. Esty supports background checks for people who want to buy guns. Mr. Greenberg supports a bare-bones check but is leery of further restrictions  I believe in the Constitution is his typical refrain.There is also the delicate matter of former Gov. John G. Rowland. Convicted in 2004 of abusing his office, he now faces a return to prison for a second set of crimes resulting from efforts he made to inject himself surreptitiously into Congressional races in 2010 and 2012 in the district Ms. Esty and Mr. Greenberg are vying to represent.Mr. Greenberg helped the prosecutions case last month when he testified that Mr. Rowland offered to help him with his 2010 race, but wanted to be paid off-the-books in a manner that would have been hard to detect.Mr. Greenberg resisted Mr. Rowlands overtures and was never charged with wrongdoing. Yet Ms. Esty rarely misses a chance to demand that Mr. Greenberg come clean about his ties to the disgraced governor.Her questions are justified, she has told reporters, because her opponent never personally said no to Rowland.In fact, Mr. Greenberg had sent Mr. Rowland an email explaining that he had decided to continue on my present course until the finish line and would not be needing additional consultants.The candidates have also sparred over caustic items contained in opposition research about Mr. Greenberg compiled by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that was revealed by The Hartford Courant. Mr. Greenberg calls the document 99 pages of hate.The bulk of the research dwells on lawsuits filed against Mr. Greenberg or affiliates in his real estate business. The dossier also states that Mr. Greenberg identifies as Jewish, a remark he found offensive, especially paired with its repeated assertions that he was a shady landlord. As a real estate investor, Mr. Greenberg has amassed a large portfolio of properties in New York and Connecticut, ranging from Manhattan co-ops to suburban shopping centers.Ms. Esty has disavowed any responsibility for the documents contents or existence and argues that the only one making an issue out of Mr. Greenbergs religion is Mr. Greenberg.The document is filled with erroneous information. For example, one lawsuit involving a baby sickened by lead paint had nothing to do with Mr. Greenberg, and after reporters pointed that out, the Congressional Campaign Committee removed references to the suit from the dossier. With so much hitting below the belt going on, joint appearances have begun to resemble a Punch and Judy show.At a debate in Waterbury, Mr. Greenberg accused Ms. Esty of lying in her commercials and held aloft an enlarged copy of a newspaper article that castigated her for running a dramatically misleading ad unsubstantiated by the facts,"" that falsely claimed Mr. Greenberg wanted to dismantle Social Security because he once called the system a failure.I strongly disagree with the reporters assessment, Ms. Esty retorted, claiming that the ad was assembled from the candidates own words.The candidates were back sharing a stage more recently at Cheshire High School. There, a member of the Young Republican Club challenged them to explain why campaigns engage in attack ads.Elections are about choices, and part of what you do is draw that contrast, Ms. Esty said.Mr. Greenberg was having none of it. We have a very nasty campaign where lies have been hurled at me, he said, prompting applause. They should stop.Leaning against the stage after Mondays appearance, Mr. Greenberg was in good spirits. He said that if voters rejected him again on Tuesday, there would be no fourth try. With a wife, five children, a sprawling real estate business and an animal shelter that he and his wife built in Bloomfield to rescue animals, he would keep busy. I can take a hint, he said, smiling as he sauntered off for another cup of coffee and another round of meet-and-greets.",2014-10-31,abortion

Mr. Baker choked up as he recounted the meeting.It is a mark of how lackluster this race for governor has been that the Baker fish story quickly became the only really memorable moment of the entire campaign. The story took on heightened interest the next day when the Baker campaign said that the encounter had taken place in 2009, and a hunt by the news media for the fisherman had come up empty-handed.As the Massachusetts governors race comes down to the wire, with recent polls giving Mr. Baker a slight edge over Ms. Coakley, many were left puzzling whether tearful displays of emotion help or hurt a candidate. But perhaps most significantly, the episode shifted the spotlight away from Ms. Coakley, whose campaign style has been the dominant subject of the race.In 2010, she suffered a humiliating defeat, losing to Scott Brown, a Republican, for the United States Senate seat long held by Edward M. Kennedy. She was roundly criticized for being too aloof and seeming to take the race for granted.This time, Ms. Coakley, 61, the state attorney general, promised that no one would work harder, and the news media has scrutinized her every step of the way. The conclusion seems to be that for a career prosecutor who is used to keeping her emotions in check, she has improved. She connects with voters better, shows flashes of humor and passion, and makes full-throated pleas for peoples votes. And certainly she has pounded the pavement from one end of the state to the other.The question now is whether that has been enough.Voters view Mr. Baker, 57, a former health care executive, more favorably, according to polls. He, too, has transformed himself after a 2010 defeat, when he lost the race for governor and was criticized as too harsh and angry. Ms. Coakley has portrayed him as a coldhearted numbers guy, more concerned with the bottom line than with people; this time, he has sought to project a kinder, gentler self. People who know him say he is by nature weepy, but the fish story was the first evidence of it in public.Baker 2.0 is not a threatening guy, said Maurice Cunningham, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts Boston. Hes very moderate, as opposed to four years ago.All the newspapers that have made endorsements, including The Boston Globe, have endorsed Mr. Baker, who served in the administrations of two Republican governors. And he leads among independents, who make up 55 percent of voters in Massachusetts. (Only 11 percent are registered Republicans, and 33 percent are Democrats.)Perhaps most worrisome for Ms. Coakley, her money is drying up. After a draining primary fight, she started the fall campaign with less cash on hand. As of mid-October, she had $300,000 in the till; Mr. Baker had $1.2 million.Mr. Baker has also received more outside money  an infusion of $8.3 million, compared with $5.6 million for Ms. Coakley.Shes a better candidate than she was in 2010; shes run a better campaign; and she has better people around her, said Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic strategist. But the one thing that hasnt changed is that shes short on money.Ms. Coakley waves away questions about how the Democratic nominee could be lagging in Massachusetts, where Democrats hold all statewide offices, all seats in the congressional delegation and majorities in both houses of the State Legislature.Weve been making headway, she said Sunday as she left a church in South Boston. We know because of the ideas we have and the organizing we have, were going to win this race.But Massachusetts has never elected a female governor; it was only two years ago that it elected Elizabeth Warren as its first female senator.And Ms. Coakley is not benefiting from the kind of gender gap that helped propel Ms. Warren into office. Independent women are tacking away from the Democrat, said David Paleologos, a pollster at Suffolk University. His polling released Thursday found Ms. Coakley with a mere five-percentage-point advantage among women, whereas Ms. Warren enjoyed a 20-point advantage in polls in 2012.Mr. Baker has stressed the need to balance the states one-party rule as he points to recent embarrassments  the deaths of children supposedly under state protection, the breakdown of the website for the states health insurance marketplace, scandals at the states drug lab.Mr. Baker avoids mentioning that he is a Republican; Ms. Coakley mentions it often. Mr. Baker tries to blur policy differences between himself and Ms. Coakley; she emphasizes their differences and priorities, such as her support for early childhood education, reducing the costs of student loans and backing a ballot measure to give employees up to 40 hours of sick time.Always supportive of abortion rights, Mr. Baker this year has emphasized his support for same-sex marriage, even making a campaign commercial with his gay brother. He has at least neutralized Ms. Coakleys leadership on that issue  as attorney general, she filed an early challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act, which forbade recognition of same-sex marriages.Mr. Baker has gone after traditional Democratic voters in other ways, putting forth an urban agenda, for example, that includes increasing the states earned-income tax credit to help low-income workers. He promoted it Sunday among Haitian voters in the distressed Mattapan section of Boston.Gov. Deval Patrick has been dubious about the repackaged Mr. Baker. He is singing the same tune in a sweeter key, but the lyrics are exactly the same, Mr. Patrick told Democrats in Lowell last weekend as he sought to fire them up to canvass the neighborhoods for Ms. Coakley.Democrats have a vaunted get-out-the-vote operation, and if Ms. Coakley does win, much of the credit will go to the party organization.I cant challenge that $8 million thats come in in negative advertising because we dont have the money, she told those same canvassers in Lowell. But we have the feet and we have the hands and we have the votes, and thats how were going to win! Right?",2014-10-31,abortion

Pat Quinn, a Democrat, and Bruce Rauner, a Republican and wealthy political novice, are neck-and-neck in a deep-blue state that President Obama calls home.","ALSIP, Ill.   At least his home state is one of the places where Barack Obama is still welcome on the campaign trail.Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois has thrown open his arms to the president, who told a crowd of 6,000 recently, I care about what happens here.Governor Quinn desperately needs black voters, who still adore President Obama, to turn out in force for him on Election Day. For his part, the president wants to avoid the embarrassment of losing deep-blue Illinois.But despite Mr. Obamas support and some positive economic news this year, Governor Quinn is running no better than neck-and-neck with a wealthy political novice, Bruce Rauner. Promising to use his business skills to tame state government, Mr. Rauner has poured $26 million of his fortune into tapping voter fatigue over high taxes and one-party rule in Springfield, the state capital.In their final debate last week, both candidates reduced their messages to single words, numbingly repeated: The governor battered Mr. Rauner as a billionaire, and Mr. Rauner labeled Governor Quinn a failure.The unexpectedly close race has become a battle over geography and demographics, with Mr. Rauner looking to maximize support in the suburbs north and west of Chicago, especially among white women, while Governor Quinn reaches out to blacks in the city and southern suburbs.In visits to three African-American churches on Sunday, the governor harped on one issue to motivate voters: raising the state minimum wage to $10 an hour. He quoted the prophet Amos: One of the things he said was, Woe to those who afflict the poor, Governor Quinn said at the Lighthouse Church of All Nations. And that is why I believe in raising the minimum wage in Illinois.The Quinn campaign points to tapes of Mr. Rauner advocating a position he no longer says he holds, that the state would be better off if its $8.25 minimum wage was $1 lower. It rarely misses a chance to highlight the Republicans extreme wealth  his nine homes and ranches, a $140,000 membership in a wine club.Still, Mr. Rauner, 58, has gained support by promising relief from Illinoiss sordid political history. He tells audiences of his teenage daughter who did not want him to become governor because then, she feared, he would go to prison. Two recent Illinois governors were convicted of corruption: George Ryan, a Republican, and Rod R. Blagojevich, a Democrat, whose 2009 impeachment ushered Mr. Quinn, the lieutenant governor, into office.Governor Quinn was elected governor in his own right by a thin margin in 2010, but he continues to suffer from perceptions that he is in some ways an accidental governor, and not the true boss in Springfield, where entrenched Democratic lawmakers have held power for decades. The Chicago Tribune measured the governors job approval at only 34 percent last week.At a restaurant that Mr. Rauner visited on the northern edge of Cook County on Saturday, diners, mostly white, complained of a state tax hike on personal and business incomes in 2011, originally meant to be temporary, which Governor Quinn now says should be permanent.I have never voted for a Republican anything in my life, but I voted for Rauner, said Paulette Kirscher, 69, a school teacher-turned-business owner, who cast her ballot in early voting. I am very unhappy about these Illinois politicians. I think things need to change.The Tribune poll suggests that Mr. Rauner has pulled essentially even with Governor Quinn because of voters like Ms. Kirscher, white suburban women who strongly favored the Republican.Ms. Kirscher said she would not have broken her lifelong Democratic allegiance if not for assurances that Mr. Rauner would protect abortion rights. He says he has no social agenda. Asked on Saturday about a charge that Gloria Steinem, the womens rights activist, made at a Quinn rally  that Mr. Rauner could not be trusted to protect abortion rights  he replied, Thats baloney.I have an agenda that is about jobs and schools and taxes and fighting corruption, he said. I dont have a social agenda.Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, the second Republican in the Senate to support same-sex marriage, said that being a social moderate and fiscal conservative was the key to a Republican winning statewide in Illinois. He praised Mr. Rauners choice to steer clear of recent Chicago appearances by two Republican firebrands, Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas.Mr. Rauner promises to roll back the 67 percent personal income tax increase of 2011. The tax raise was originally sold as a way to fix Illinoiss budget crisis, including $100 billion owed to retired public employees, the worst pension mess in the nation. Governor Quinn forced through a separate pension rescue last year, which unions are fighting in court.The governor maintains that a tax rollback would cost the state $4 billion and lead to teacher layoffs and cuts to social services like child care.Mr. Rauners pitch is simple: Democrats have had their chance and failed. But he has offered few details about how to balance the states books. In an interview, he said taxes could be lowered without cutting into schools by eliminating wasteful spending.Illinois has become the worst-run state in America, he said. I can really shake it up in a way that a standard politician cant.The Quinn campaign has dug into Mr. Rauners career as a private equity investor to portray him as heartless.Mr. Rauner, whose 2013 income was $60.1 million, was chairman of the private equity partnership GTCR, which bought and sold interests in hundreds of companies. He boasts of making millions of dollars for the Illinois teachers pension fund, but some investments ran into trouble. Three officials of one company went to prison for accounting fraud. At a trial now underway in Florida, GTCR is accused of selling a nursing home operator to avoid damages in wrongful death suits. Mr. Rauner has said he was unaware of such problems.Over lunch at a McDonalds  a choice in keeping with the governors portrayal of himself as more in touch with everyday people  he had harsh words for Mr. Rauners career.He calls himself a businessman, the governor said as he opened the packaging of a second apple pie. Hes not a businessman. Hes a profiteer. Hes had 12 bankruptcies, caused great harm to many people. Hes given himself a lot of money out of it. Hes using it now to have a hostile takeover of the government of Illinois.To counter this caricature, Mr. Rauner tells audiences about inheriting a work ethic and a desire to give back to the community from his family. He omits mention of his father, a senior executive at Motorola, and paints a portrait of a Swedish-speaking grandfather who milked dairy cows and lived in a double-wide trailer. He always gave back in church, Mr. Rauner told supporters on Saturday. Even when it hurt to put $3 into the collection.",2014-10-31,abortion

Both appeared in The Times on the same day. One celebrated the improbable journey of a young man from a Rwandan dump to the halls of Harvard. Justus Uwayesu, photographed in front of the iconic John Harvard statue in Harvard Yard, didnt run as the other children did when a American charity worker approached them more than a decade ago as they scavenged for food. I want to go to school, the boy told his American rescuer. This fall, he enrolled as a freshman at Harvard.The other story reported the intervention of New York State officials in a scandalous situation in suburban school districts in the New York City area. Faced with an influx of undocumented Central American children whom immigration authorities have released to live with relatives or other sponsors, school districts in the region seem to be doing their best to keep these kids out of school.School officials know they cant demand proof of legal immigration status, thanks to Plyler v. Doe, a 1982 decision in which the Supreme Court ruled that states cant exclude undocumented children from the free public education provided to all other children. So school systems have been demanding proof of residency in the district, which families who are trying to make the best of patchwork and last-minute arrangements often cant provide. The bureaucratic impasse has left these children, finally safe from the gang violence that led to their long journeys north, languishing in their new homes. The state is investigating. The students have a constitutional right to be educated, John B. King Jr., New Yorks education commissioner, said last week.Human potential enabled, and human potential suppressed: The two stories are opposite sides of the coin. Ill focus here on the undocumented children, and on the brief, shining moment 32 years ago when the conservative Burger court ruled for the undocumented children. But this isnt just a walk down memory lane. The story of Plyler v. Doe contains a lesson for the Roberts court today.The alien children case, as Plyler v. Doe was known at the court, was big news in its day. But it soon faded from view because the state that had tried to keep the children out of school was an outlier. (Big surprise, it was Texas.) No other state had dreamed up such a policy, so the decision had no immediate impact outside a single states borders. The decision was scarcely heard from again until the wave of anti-immigrant legislation in the past decade. Im quite sure that Arizona and other show me your papers states would have barred the schoolhouse door to undocumented children if they thought they could get away with it.Also, Plyler v. Doe was a self-consciously nonexpansive decision. The vote was 5 to 4. The question the court addressed was whether, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Texas may deny to undocumented school-age children the free public education that it provides to children who are citizens of the United States or legally admitted aliens. (Note that Justice William J. Brennan Jr., whose majority opinion I just quoted, was a man ahead of his time in his use of undocumented, when the much more common word choice, in this newspaper and nearly everywhere else, was illegal alien.)The court answered the question precisely, addressing only the right of the children, and only their right to an education. As became clear when several justices papers were opened to the public years later, the majority opinion was the result of an intense behind-the-scenes struggle between Justice Brennan, the leader of the courts shrinking liberal bloc, and Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., a Nixon appointee well to Justice Brennans right.Justice Brennans initial instinct was to use the case, with its sympathetic facts, to accomplish two cherished goals: to declare that education was, in constitutional terms, a fundamental right, and to give the most exacting judicial scrutiny to government policies that drew distinctions between legal residents and undocumented aliens. The result would have been greatly enhanced constitutional protection for noncitizens. Brennan had four votes for these propositions, but he needed a fifth.The only potential fifth vote was that of Justice Powell, a former head of the Richmond, Va., school board who believed strongly in the value of public education. He agreed from the outset that the Texas policy was unconstitutional. But he refused to sign on to Justice Brennans sweeping constitutional vision. In 1973, over Justice Brennans dissent, he had written the majority opinion in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, holding that the inequality resulting from local property-tax-based school financing did not violate the Constitution and rejecting the notion that education was a fundamental right.As I reconstructed the Plyler v. Doe back-story based on the justices papers, Justices Brennan and Powell engaged in a genteel but deadly earnest fencing match over what the opinion should say. Powell stood his ground, insisting that he would sign no opinion broader than necessary to resolve the problem at hand. Brennan scaled back his ambitions bit by bit until he reached Powells comfort zone. (Even the narrow final result went too far for a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department, who made his disappointment clear to his boss, Attorney General William French Smith. This is a case in which our supposed litigation program to encourage judicial restraint did not get off the ground, and should have, John G. Roberts Jr. wrote in a memo that came to light when he was named to the Supreme Court.)My point in this narrative is to bring us to Justice Powells concurring opinion. He emphasized the unique character of the case  in other words, take this decision for what it is, and dont try to extrapolate. It hardly can be argued rationally, he said, that anyone benefits from the creation within our borders of a subclass of illiterate persons many of whom will remain in the state, adding to the problems and costs of both state and national governments attendant upon unemployment, welfare, and crime.This wasnt poetry and it wasnt elaborate constitutional doctrine. It was common sense. Justice Powell argued not from the vantage point of the children so much as from that of American society as a whole. The Supreme Court, in his view, was appropriately intervening to save the country from a policy demonstrably destructive of the social fabric.That brings me, as promised, to the Roberts court. Late on a Friday night earlier this month, the Supreme Court voted in another case from Texas to permit the states voter ID law, the strictest in the country, to take effect. A federal district judge in Corpus Christi found after a nine-day trial that the laws stringent requirements for particular forms of identification would prevent as many as 600,000 Texans, 4.5 percent of all those registered, from voting next month. The impact, Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos found, would fall disproportionately on black and Latino Texans. She ruled that the law violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965  the section that remains functional after the Supreme Court cut the heart out of that law last year  and that it operated as an unconstitutional poll tax. Judge Ramos issued a permanent injunction to bar the state from applying the law.The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  yes, the same court that brought us the Texas abortion clinic closings, before the Supreme Court granted a reprieve two weeks ago  gave Texas an immediate stay of the ruling, putting the voter ID law back into effect for next weeks election. The plaintiffs then asked the Supreme Court to lift the stay.The six justices who let the stay remain in effect didnt bother to explain themselves beyond the word denied. That left it to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and two others, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, to explain in dissent what was wrong with that outcome. (Where was Justice Stephen G. Breyer? I have no idea.) The dissent was issued shortly after 5 a.m. on the morning of Saturday, Oct. 18, the 81-year-old Justice Ginsburg having stayed up all night to finish it.The greatest threat to public confidence in elections in this case, Justice Ginsburg said, is the prospect of enforcing a purposefully discriminatory law, one that likely imposes an unconstitutional poll tax and risks denying the right to vote to hundreds of thousands of eligible voters. A law, in other words, that in the full glare of publicity and on the verge of a highly polarized election, threatens destruction to the social fabric in the most dangerous way, by shutting thousands of citizens out of the democratic process of choosing their leaders.There is no right more basic in our democracy than the right to participate in electing our political leaders, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the court in April of this year. His subject then was the right to spend money in politics, not the right to vote. If people conclude that the current Supreme Court majority cares more about the first than the second  surely a logical inference  the court will have entered a dangerous place. And so  as a conservative justice once realized in another context  will the country.",2014-10-30,abortion

A politician at a street fair is usually an inconvenience, an ordeal to be endured as he thrusts a flier at your chest and a smile at your face. But the silver-haired candidate pushing his 1-year-old in a stroller through the funnel-cake stands and craft booths at the harvest festival here did not have to try so hard. The glad-handers rushed up to him.Id vote for you! I voted for you plenty of times! shouted Mark Wells, 58, a retired state employee.Edwin W. Edwards, 87, a four-term former governor and eight-year former federal inmate, is back on the trail, this time as a long-shot Democratic contender for a House seat and salvation for magazine feature writers in a dreary election year.For all his color, though, Mr. Edwards, the populist rogue who embodied Louisiana politics from the 1960s to the 1990s, charming one half of the state and mortifying the other, might as well be a ghost.The main political event this year, the Senate race, could not be further removed from the Edwards era. No one here at the harvest festival was particularly excited about Senator Mary L. Landrieu, a three-term Democrat, or Representative Bill Cassidy, the Republican challenger who will most likely face Ms. Landrieu in a runoff. A few said they might vote for Rob Maness, a hard-right Tea Party favorite and retired Air Force colonel who is also running, though most acknowledge his chances are slim.They used to say that the biggest sin in Louisiana politics was to be boring, said R. Michael McHale, a lawyer in Lake Charles. Now Louisianas become more like Washington. To a certain extent, elections arent even about Louisiana anymore.Louisianans will say, and perhaps scorn you if you disagree, that theirs is an exceptional state.Exchanges in French can still occasionally be heard among the older people on the bayou, and at a Starbucks on a bland commercial strip in Lafayette it is possible to have a conversation with a woman about trapping and cleaning muskrat. Much of Louisianas distinctiveness is innate, given a set of natural resources  the mouth of an important river, abundant oil and gas reserves underground and off the coast, and a rich but exceedingly fragile coastline  that guarantee singular benefits and liabilities.But among the greatest expressions of Louisianas particularity have been its politics: populist, locally attuned, based on personality rather than party, fond of deal-cutting, often ethically dubious, but, above all, interesting. Or, at least, that used to be the case.Roughly $40 million has been spent on the Senate race here by campaigns and outside groups, and television is saturated with a wave of nasty ads that have exasperated the fact-checkers. But it is not the most expensive race in the country, nor is it remarkably nastier than the rest of the paint-by-numbers Senate campaigns this year.Mr. Cassidy is running a generic if effective Republican campaign, tying Ms. Landrieu to President Obama, to Harry Reid, and to Washington in general. Ms. Landrieu could be described as the standard-bearer for an older style of Louisiana politics, with a bring-home-the-bacon campaign. But even she is relying for her survival on millions of national ad dollars and a typical Democratic constituency of black voters and women.There are reasons for this: Over the past decade, the bungled government responses to a series of hurricanes, including Katrina, and to the BP oil spill have drained the appeal of entertaining politicians; an aversion to taxes has rendered the old populism model unsustainable; and, perhaps most of all, the effects of 24-hour news channels, national political debates on television, and the Internet have left hyperlocal politicking a mostly fading memory.Politics is more nationalized now, said John Breaux, a former senator and among the last of the Cajun Democrats who could routinely win statewide.Mr. Breaux was discussing the states politics over lunch at a white-cloth Italian restaurant in Washington, where, like many retired Louisiana legislators, he is a lobbyist. It used to be folks were not that concerned about what was happening everywhere else; they were concerned about their own state. Now theyre watching Fox News every night. You have an opinion that is national in scope, not Louisiana in scope, he said.In states where politics has served as a drab backdrop to daily life, this might not be such a big deal. But politics in Louisiana, which the writer A.J. Liebling once described as having an intensity and complexity matched only in the republic of Lebanon, has traditionally taken center stage. Even as it came to be seen as a malevolent force across the South, government remained an organizing part of life here. The states old Robin Hood-style populism  in which oil companies were heavily soaked, if otherwise given full rein, while taxpayers were spared  was considered quite agreeable. Spending on education, health care and infrastructure was generous, and the people did not have to pay for it.Politicians were allowed to be funny because the idea was they werent stealing your money, they were stealing Standard Oils money, said Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana.This arrangement fell apart after the big oil bust of the 1980s. The shortfall was somewhat remedied by gambling proceeds, sales taxes and income taxes, but these sources brought along with them corruption indictments and antitax crusades. With a major boom in petrochemical activity, the heady days may return. But for now, state services have been cut to the marrow, and a $1.2 billion shortfall may await in next years budget.Even as the economics changed, Louisianas politics remained unusual: The state was alone in the Deep South in voting twice for Bill Clinton and is now the only one of the five Deep South states with a Democrat in the Senate.This distinctiveness endures in part because the state has three broad categories of voters  not two, as in most other Southern states. White Protestants have mostly been reliable conservatives in northern Louisiana. An engaged black electorate in New Orleans and elsewhere forms a Democratic counterweight.The white Catholic voters spread across southern Louisiana, many of whom identify themselves as Cajun, make up the third, and often electorally decisive, group. This bloc resists ideological labeling. Cajuns are traditional and conservative but, in part because of the history of discrimination against the Cajun culture in Louisiana, can also be receptive to appeals about obligations to the poor and a little more forgiving on matters of personal virtue.Furthermore, said J. Curtis Joubert, 83, a former mayor of the Cajun town of Eunice, they knew how to enjoy a good election.When chickens started hearing the sound trucks roll into town, theyd hide under the houses because they knew the barbecues were going to be starting up, Mr. Joubert recalled. The chickens dont run and hide anymore. Theyre all inside watching television.The Waning Cult of PersonalityOver a late afternoon beer at a bar in the southern Louisiana city of Houma, Norby Chabert lamented this state of affairs.Retail politics is now virtually nonexistent, said Mr. Chabert, a state senator. He is a son of a populist political dynasty  his fathers name is on the local hospital. But he switched parties to become a Republican in 2011, part of a wave of defections that followed the election of Mr. Obama and the success of unapologetic partisans like Senator David Vitter, a Republican.Now its just BS, man, he said of the campaign trail. Its TV and radio and direct mail. Your personal style has to matter for 30 seconds.For much of the Senate race, the front-runner has been the Republican, Mr. Cassidy, a gastroenterologist with a much milder disposition than the hard-hitting anti-Obama message his campaign suggests.Tracy Donovan Smith, a lobbyist in Baton Rouge, recalls one afternoon years ago when he, Mr. Cassidy and Mr. Cassidys wife were racing down the highway to make it to a Republican gathering in New Orleans. Mr. Smith said he had looked up from the back seat and had been surprised to see what the Cassidys were doing in the front: discussing a daily Bible lesson.Its like were going to this convention, we have to do our Bible study, Mr. Smith said admiringly. I think they still do it.Edwin W. Edwards this is not.In an interview at a mostly empty Baton Rouge restaurant, Mr. Cassidy attacked the Affordable Care Act, but he said he had little interest in politics.In one sense I enjoy running for office, he said. Am I a political junkie? Absolutely not. I read biographies. Of presidents. But I also read Knowledge and Power by George Gilder.As Louisiana politicians in either party note when his name comes up, Mr. Cassidy does not come off as particularly charming or polished. (Cassidy is as bland as this tablecloth, Mr. Breaux said. His mannerisms arent translating, was how Mr. Chabert put it.) During the interview, the impression was reinforced when Mr. Cassidy guffawed in the middle of a question, pointing to a television and remarking about a football player hitting another in the groin with his helmet. But there is a tradition here of dry-toast politicians. For all their attempts at change, they have tended to be remembered mostly by the punch lines about them delivered by the very rogues they were trying to oust from office.Former Gov. Earl K. Long used to puncture his reform-minded opponents as humorless high-hats. Mr. Edwards used to joked of one opponent for governor, David C. Treen, that he was so slow that it took him an hour and a half to watch 60 Minutes.These days, a lack of pizazz is worn by some Louisiana Republicans as a badge of honor, a sign of seriousness of purpose.Mr. Cassidy talked of the widespread anger at the old way of politics that set in after the disasters of the last decade, a fury that led to a flourishing of muckraking journalism and civic activity in New Orleans, post-Katrina.Billy Tauzin, a Democratic-turned-Republican former congressman and now, naturally, a Washington-based lobbyist, put it this way: Breaux, Tauzin and Edwards were colorful. And I hope we were competent. But they just want competence now. They want professional people.A Change in PitchBurt Tietje is not sure it is that straightforward.Mr. Tietje, 59, is a farmer in rural Jefferson Davis Parish, in the heart of what used to be the Seventh Congressional District, now extinct, which sent so many Cajun Democrats to Washington, including Mr. Edwards and Mr. Breaux.Mr. Tietje was never attracted to that crowd. His mother lost her job as a schoolteacher because of her familys opposition to the Long dynasty. He was a lonely but proud Republican, because that stood for good government. Until it became something else, he said.He saw the Republican pitch change sometime in the 1990s. A message of disdain for populism and cronyism was overshadowed by an antipathy to abortion and gun control, a change driven by the Internet and cable news. Any backlash to the bungled government response to the hurricanes, Mr. Tietje said, was just a lagging indicator.The only thing I hear in stump speeches now is national Republican issues, Mr. Tietje said. Nobody talks about local issues anymore. I watched the entire Seventh District move from populist Democrats to this right-wing, gun-toting majority.In 1996, the year Ms. Landrieu won a squeaker for her first Senate term, the archbishop of New Orleans declared that voting for her, with her advocacy of abortion rights, could be considered a sin. Now drivers on the way to Lafayette are greeted by a large billboard denouncing Ms. Landrieus 100% pro-abortion voting record.Abortion and gun control are not the only issues that have driven the people of southern Louisiana away from the Democrats. When there is less money to go around, a populist economic agenda gives way to older resentments.Former Gov. Mike Foster, another Democrat-turned-Republican from Cajun country, in a common theme here, cited voters angered by welfare benefits, which he called the giveaway stuff. He said: They drive through cities, see people walking through streets or on their porches drinking beer and on some sort of take, and they dont like that.Picking a SideA smattering of politicians and local officials gathered under a tent in the parking lot of St. Leo the Great Church in the no-stoplight town of Leonville, waiting for Ms. Landrieu. She was coming to announce that thanks to a federal grant, Leonville was finally to begin construction on a drainage culvert.This was the kind of visit that Ms. Landrieu, whose political family name is esteemed in New Orleans but carries less sway outside the city, has been making all over the state. Her case for re-election has largely been based on the clout she would have as a four-term senator.It is hardly a populist pitch  her campaign highlights endorsements from happy oil company executives  but it does hew to an old Louisiana line that an unfriendly federal government can be made to work for the state if properly wrangled. The members of the courthouse crowds wondered if the state had changed too much for this still to work. Bill OReillys take-no-prisoners mentality has passed on to a lot of people, said Earl Taylor, the parish district attorney. Its gotten so divisive. You cant live in the middle ground anymore like John Breaux did.Now, with everyone having to pick a side, even a populist appeal, such as it exists, comes in two starkly different varieties.On one side is the view, as explained by Mr. Cassidy, that an overreaching and ever-growing government, personified by the deeply unpopular Mr. Obama, stifles industry and thus the livelihoods of the working class. This is a strong message in an oil-and-gas state where people bump up frequently against federal regulators.Ms. Landrieus version is that rampant privatization and an agenda of slashing services, as personified by the deeply unpopular Governor Jindal, have proved to be much more painful in practice than in theory. This message has its own resonance in a state quite visibly dependent on federal money like flood insurance and disaster aid.In a brief interview under the outdoor tent, Ms. Landrieu talked of constituent services. But she then veered into an optimistic reading of Catholic Cajun swing voters, suggesting, perhaps somewhat wishfully, that they are being swayed by a higher power than Mr. Obama.I actually feel its starting to change back, Ms. Landrieu said. And you know whos helping? Pope Francis. Pope Francis is having a major impact on the way that people in Louisiana are feeling about issues of the social gospel and helping the poor and getting back to the roots of the Catholic Church.A Wider FocusThe onetime hotbed for Cajun Democrats was Crowley, a town that bills itself as the rice capital of America. Both Mr. Breaux and Mr. Edwards got their start there.The annual rice festival is one of the oldest festivals in the state. Mr. Cassidy visited on one of the days. Ms. Landrieu did not attend, but her campaign team has highlighted her votes for price supports for rice farmers and for funding an expansion project for a nearby stretch of Interstate.None of this seemed to be on the minds of the people in the crowds. The Affordable Care Act came up quickly, amid an antipathy to the president generally. Border security was a chief concern.Whos in charge of this country, the immigrants or us? asked Gregory Mouton, a 28-year-old car salesman with bright red hair who goes by the name T-Rouge. He was speculating on why Mr. Obama seemed so reluctant to declare an Ebola-related travel ban.Mr. Mouton, the son of accordion makers, said he was open to politicians of any party. But he was against anyone who was as supportive of the Obama agenda as Ms. Landrieu appeared to be.Asked whether a politician like Mr. Breaux could win this year on his kind of platform, Mr. Mouton paused.I dont know John Breaux, he said. Ive heard the name.",2014-10-30,abortion

Soldier. Independent Leader.She drops into county courthouses and small-town cafes, and introduces herself as a southwest Iowa farm girl. Her ads remind voters that, having commanded National Guard troops in Iraq, she could become the first female combat veteran in the Senate. She brought her 15-year-old daughter to Hamlin  living proof of the mother line in her rsum.But in a state that is one of two that have never sent a woman to Washington or elected one governor (the other is Mississippi), there is one thing Ms. Ernst never does. She never appeals to Iowans to help her break the glass ceiling.Im not running on my gender, she insists.By running to make history without saying so, Ms. Ernst, 44, is helping to write a new playbook for Republican female candidates. In a year that is proving challenging for women running for the Senate from both parties, Ms. Ernst has broken through with a powerful political message that has helped her build a surprisingly enthusiastic base of support  among men.While Democrats rely on women  a key component of their base  to get elected, Republicans need the male vote to win. This holds true for candidates of both sexes from both parties.Of the 15 female Senate candidates from the two major parties running this year, just two seem assured of victory: Susan Collins, the incumbent in Maine, and Representative Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, both of them Republican.The other 13 are either trailing badly or, like Ms. Ernst, in tight races. Among incumbents, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, all Democrats, are fighting to hang on to their seats. Two other bright Democratic prospects  Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky and Michelle Nunn in Georgia  are in tough races in red states.Ms. Ernst, who beat four men in the primary, stands out as the lone Republican woman in a cliffhanger campaign. If she beats her Democratic opponent, Representative Bruce Braley, in the race to succeed Tom Harkin, she will deprive Democrats of a seat they have held for nearly 30 years  and perhaps help Republicans take over the Senate.Shes a model for the Republican success story, said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. They have run right-wing women before, but they havent had a right-wing woman before who was able to give so many gender-based cues while still maintaining their base.Analysts liken Ms. Ernsts approach on gender to that of President Obama on race.You would be hard-pressed to find a clip of Senator Obama running in 2008 to be the first African-American president, said Kellyanne Conway, a Republican pollster. She advises Republicans like Ms. Ernst against running overtly as a woman.But Ms. Ernst is hardly ignoring her gender. Her ads offer a playful take on masculine endeavors. There she is firing a gun. There she is riding a Harley-Davidson. There she is boasting about castrating hogs on an Iowa farm.But interspersed among those images are other, softer cues: In one new ad, she is seated at a kitchen table talking about the Iowa we leave our children; in another, she says she learned the key to a great biscuit while working at a fast-food restaurant.Around the country, Democratic women are running more explicit appeals to women.In Kentucky, an ad for Ms. Grimes features Democratic women in the Senate. Shatter the glass. Break the ceiling. Its time for Alison, they declare. In Georgia, Ms. Nunns advertisement asks, of her Republican opponent, Can the women of Georgia trust David Perdue?And in Iowa, Staci Appel, a Democratic House candidate, pitches herself as running a race to elect the first woman to Congress from the state of Iowa  even though the same could be said of Ms. Ernst.If Ms. Ernst winds up in Washington, it will be largely because Iowas men sent her there. Ms. Ernst has a 12-point advantage among men deemed most likely to vote, while she and Mr. Braley are closely divided among such women, according to an NBC NewsMarist College poll released this week. But in previous polls, Mr. Braley was doing much better among women  a hint that in the campaigns waning days, Ms. Ernst may be narrowing the gender gap, as she makes inroads among older women.In an election season in which Republicans have gained traction by talking about the threat of Islamic extremism, Ms. Ernst emphasizes her national security credentials  a strong sell with Republicans, and especially men.Last week, she traveled the state with Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and an Air Force reservist. Here in Hamlin, population 252 as of the latest census, Mr. Graham talked up Ms. Ernsts military credentials to the dinner crowd at Darrells Place, a roadside restaurant where the pork tenderloin sandwiches sell for $5.25 and the beer signs flash in neon.It would be nice to have somebody in the Senate, Mr. Graham said, who doesnt talk about boots on the ground, but has had her boots on the ground.Mr. Graham says Republicans are hungry for more candidates like Ms. Ernst. Were a party of short white guys, he said self-deprecatingly, and we need to reflect America.Nationally, Democrats have long outpaced Republicans in nominating women for high elective office, and 2014 has followed that trend. A recent analysis by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University found that there are twice as many as female Democrats running in Senate, House and governors races this year than there are Republican women.Debbie Walsh, the centers director, said Democrats had more infrastructure to support female candidates, through political action committees like Emilys List. And Republican women tend to be more moderate and have difficulty surviving conservative primaries.Ms. Ernst is an exception. Her breakout moment was the hog castrating ad, in which she vowed to rein in Washingtons big spenders, declaring: Lets make em squeal. The ad delighted Republican men but made some Republican women queasy.When I saw that ad, I said, Ew, I dont know if I like that, said Christine Hensley, a member of the Des Moines City Council. Then, Ms. Hensley said, she mentioned it to Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, and he said, Isnt that ad great?If Mr. Braley has a hope of winning, said Ms. Lake, the Democratic strategist, it is by tying Ms. Ernst to the so-called Republican war on women. Recently, Mr. Braley campaigned with Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, the reproductive rights organization, which has attacked Ms. Ernst for her anti-abortion stance and support of personhood rights for fetuses, using the slogan, Women are watching.At the University of Iowa last week, Ms. Ernst was just four minutes into her stump speech promoting her Iowa values, when several young women began shouting her down. The scene grew so raucous that the candidate cut her talk short, ducking inside a classroom building to slip out a backdoor.Women are watching! Women are watching! the protesters chanted as she left. Stacia Scott, a 22-year-old social worker who helped lead the protest, echoed Democrats talking points about Ms. Ernst. Joni Ernst, she said, is not a woman for women.In the end, analysts say, the race may come down to the womens vote. The question, said Dianne Bystrom, the director of the Catt Center for Women and Politics at Iowa State University, is this: Are women going to turn out to defeat a history-making female candidate?",2014-10-29,abortion
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/opinion/nothing-in-moderation.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/04/opinion/edsall-contributor/contibutors-images-slide-CXN2-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg,Nothing in Moderation,What if ordinary voters are even more extreme in their views than members of Congress?,"What if the notion that a large segment of the electorate is made up of moderates who hunger for centrist compromise is illusory? What if ordinary voters are, in many respects, even more extreme in their views than members of Congress?Two political science graduate students at Berkeley, David E. Broockman and Douglas J. Ahler, have made a persuasive case that not only are there few voters who are actually centrist or moderate, but that many voters  and on some issues, a majority of voters  are further to the left or right than the congressmen and legislators who represent them.The Broockman-Ahler argument, if its correct, undermines advocacy organizations, think tanks and commissions premised on the belief that moderates remain a powerful but untapped source of support in federal elections. Such organizations include Third Way, a pro-Democratic think tank, which contends that In the eleven most competitive Senate races of 2014, moderates hold the key to Democratic wins; the Centrist Project, which asserts that Most Americans Are Moderates; the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget; the Bipartisan Policy Center; the Progressive Policy Institute; the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform; the Concord Coalition; No Labels; and the Campaign to Fix the Debt.Political scientists have long debated how polarized ordinary voters are compared with political elites. In a paper completed earlier this month, An Artificial Disconnect, Broockman disputes in detail the work of scholars and activists who have sought to promote an ambitious reform agenda based on the widely accepted empirical finding that voters reliably support more moderate policies than elites. The mistake here, Broockman writes, is to crucially rely on the assumption that voters preferences can be summarized on one dimension.Broockman explains the problem as follows:One voter might support liberal policies calling for much higher taxes on the rich and also support a conservative stand in opposition to same-sex marriage. When the two responses are averaged, though, he or she would be defined as a moderate.Meanwhile, lets say that our hypothetical voters congressman supports relatively conservative policies in both cases and reliably casts relatively conservative votes. Because of the legislators ideological consistency, he or she is estimated to be "" extreme on the continuum, as Broockman puts it. But who is actually the extremist?Earlier this year, to further strengthen their case, Broockman and Ahler designed and conducted an innovative online survey of 1,240 respondents recruited by Survey Sampling International. The survey asked voters not only whether they supported the Democratic, centrist or Republican positions on a range of issues, but also offered respondents the option of taking more extreme positions  further to the left or right  than most Democratic and Republican members of Congress would be willing to support.In the case of taxes, for example, the survey offered respondents seven choices, of which four were extreme.The extreme choices on taxes on the left are: to establish a maximum annual income, with all income over $1,000,000 per year taxed at a rate of 100 percent, and to decrease federal taxes on the poor and provide more services beneting the middle class and the poor; or to increase federal income taxes on those making more than $250,000 per year to pre-1990s levels (more than 5 percent above current rates). Use the savings to signicantly lower taxes and provide more services to those making less and to invest in infrastructure projects.The extreme choices on taxes the survey offers on the right are: to move to a completely at income tax system where all individuals pay the same percentage of their income in taxes, accomplished by decreasing government services; or to move to a at consumption tax where all individuals pay the same percentage of their purchases in taxes, banning the income tax, even if this means the poor pay more in taxes than the rich. Signicantly decrease government services in the process.The results challenge those committed to the moderate voter thesis. The policies supported by a majority of respondents, 59 percent, were more extreme than the policies that political elites typically support. Of the 59 percent, 40 percent swung left, and 19 percent to the right. The distribution is shown in Figure 1.When Broockman and Ahler performed the same analysis combining survey respondents responses to 12 survey questions, going beyond taxes  guns, abortion, immigration, Medicare, health, environment, Social Security, gay rights, labor unions, contraception and education  49 percent of the respondents took more extreme stands than those taken by partisan elites, 30 percent to the left and 19 percent to the right. Figure 2 illustrates their analysis.In a separate study, Ahler and Broockman sought to determine whether voters adopted extreme positions in surveys because there were no consequences, whereas in the real world of governing, these same voters might prefer their elected officials to take more moderate stands. This proved not to be the case: voters support for a politician who adopts their previously expressed issue views, including their more extreme views, does not abate even when explicitly informed that an alternative politician is more moderate.Broockman and Ahler appear to be exercising influence in the debate over polarization and moderation.I asked Morris Fiorina, a political scientist at Stanford who is the author of the book Culture War? The Myth of a Polarized America, for his views on the Broockman paper. Fiorina wrote back: I think everyone who has read his paper believes he really nailed that point.In an extended email exchange I conducted with Broockman, he pointed out that some of his and Ahlers findings raise the question: Should elected officials cast votes reflecting the majority views of their constituents?I asked Broockman if a politician could more successfully represent constituents by casting each legislative vote to reflect majority opinion in his or her district. Broockman replied:If voters are more extreme than the politicians who represent them, where does this leave us?In an additional paper published in September, How Ideological Moderation Conceals Support for Immoderate Policies: A New Perspective on the Disconnect in American Politics, Ahler and Broockman reach a pessimistic conclusion:They continue:In other words, Americans can look forward to a recurrence of public dissatisfaction for which there is no remedy and to intractable conflict among elites resulting in the inability of either side to enact a durable agenda.",2014-10-29,abortion
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/upshot/mark-udall-faces-a-turnout-challenge-in-colorado.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/27/upshot/28UP-Colorado/28UP-Colorado-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg,Mark Udall Faces a Turnout Challenge in Colorado,"Although the example of Michael Bennets unlikely election in 2010 looms large in this race, the two situations are quite different.","Perhaps no campaign figures more prominently in the pantheon of modern political mythology than Senator Michael Bennets election in 2010. Mr. Bennet, a Democrat, won a come-from-behind victory in Colorado after trailing in just about every poll of the final weeks of the race.It is hard to overstate the lore surrounding the Bennet campaign. The story leads Sasha Issenbergs book, The Victory Lab. The legend holds that the Bennet campaign employed cutting-edge field methods, presaging President Obamas re-election, to turn out enough irregular voters to mount a comeback. The Democrats named their huge 2014 turnout effort the Bannock Street Project after the road where the Bennet campaign resided for four years. In part because of this history, many assumed that Mark Udall, a Democratic incumbent, was a clean favorite to win re-election.Instead, Colorado has emerged as a state where Democrats desperately need to do a better job of turning out voters than they did in 2010. Mr. Udall trails in the polls by an even wider margin than Mr. Bennet did four years ago, and hell need an even more favorable electorate to defy the odds again.Mr. Bennets victory is so impressive because he won despite facing a hostile electorate  one in which most voters probably supported Mitt Romney in 2012. Mr. Bennet pulled it off in no small part because he faced Ken Buck, a candidate who alienated many moderate women with his views on rape and abortion. Mr. Bennet attacked Mr. Buck as an extremist for his views on the states personhood amendment.How well did Mr. Bennet do among unaffiliated and Republican voters? Think about it like this: Almost 40 percent of registered voters in Colorado were Republican in 2010, but Mr. Buck managed to win only 46 percent of the vote. He suffered big defections among registered Republican voters, and was clobbered among the states already Democratic-leaning registered unaffiliated voters.Mr. Udall tried and apparently failed to make similar gains with similar attacks against Cory Gardners past support for the states personhood amendment. By most accounts, Mr. Gardner has run a smart race. As a result, Mr. Udall does not seem poised to run so far ahead of Mr. Obama; he could easily even run behind Mr. Obama. He now needs to make up for it with a more Democratic electorate than the one that narrowly elected Mr. Bennet four years ago.How much more Democratic would the electorate need to get for Mr. Udall to win? A very rough guess is that he needs an electorate about halfway between 2010, when Republicans outnumbered Democrats by more than six points, and 2012, when Republicans outnumbered Democrats by two points and when unaffiliated, young voters represented a much larger share of the electorate.That rough guess is illustrated by data provided by SurveyUSA and Monmouth University, which both conducted public polls from lists of registered voters. On average, the polls found Mr. Udall ahead by five percentage points among registered unaffiliated voters, with Mr. Udall enjoying a smidgen more support among registered Democrats than Mr. Gardner did among registered Republicans.If we assume those averages are right  and, obviously, you should not take the averages of two sets of subsamples to the bank  Mr. Gardner would win by about two percentage points if the partisan makeup of the electorate resembled 2010, but he would lose by two points if party affiliation matched 2012. Since many of the unaffiliated voters joining in a 2012-type electorate would be younger and more diverse than the ones deemed likely to vote in recent polls, the tally might underestimate how Mr. Udall would actually do with the 2012 electorate.Halving the gap between the 2012 and 2010 electorates would not be easy. If the Udall campaign wanted to do it strictly by mobilizing more voters, it could take getting at least an additional 50,000 Democratic-leaning voters to the polls  or perhaps one-fifth of the registered Democrats voters who voted in 2012 but not in 2010, when Democrats had their celebrated get-out-the-vote effort. If the Gardner campaign could mobilize additional voters of its own, then Mr. Udalls requirement would jump further.Mr. Udall, however, is not just counting on brute mobilization. The Democrats have one big thing working in their favor: the advent of universal mail voting. For the first time in Colorado, all registered voters will receive a ballot in the mail  whether they request one or not.The question is how many of the voters who didnt participate in 2010 will choose to do so once a ballot arrives at their door. No one knows exactly what to expect, but both campaigns will surely spend the next week chasing down the voters who havent submitted their ballots.Democrats are hoping that the combination of universal mail voting and their mobilization efforts will substantially enlarge the electorate, drawing from the pool of young, Democratic-leaning voters who did not participate in 2010 but did in 2012. Data from the voter registration file indicates that these voters are indeed substantially more favorable to Democrats than the 2010 voters, and a new Democratic-sponsored poll found that these voters support Mr. Udall by a 14-point margin.If the new voters break for Mr. Udall by that margin, Democrats will need more than 250,000 voters to close a two-point deficit among voters returning from 2010. It could easily take more if Mr. Udalls deficit is larger than two points, or if new voters are still somewhat more Republican, older, or whiter than the overall pool of voters who did not participate in 2010 but did in 2012.Given the degree of uncertainty about eventual turnout with universal mail voting, you can start to imagine why Democrats think they still have a way to defy the odds in Colorado.The good news for observers is that the composition of the Colorado electorate wont stay in the realm of speculation for long. Universal mail voting means that about 85 percent of ballots will probably be tabulated by Election Day. Thanks to The Upshots subscription to the Colorado voter file, well have a good sense of the partisan and demographic makeup of Colorado voters well before the polls close.So far, the early vote looks pretty good for Mr. Gardner. More than 650,000 ballots had been tabulated by Sunday night, and registered Republicans outnumbered registered Democrats by 10.5 points, 42.8 to 32.3. If it holds, that will be even better for Republicans than 2010.But it is clear that the earliest mail-in ballots are unrepresentative: Forty-three percent of early voters are 65 or over, and disproportionately from Republican jurisdictions. And buried in the data is a number that might augur well for Democrats: Twenty-one percent did not participate in 2010, and those voters are far more Democratic than those who participated in 2010. If the pace continues and everyone from 2010 returns to the polls, turnout will grow by 450,000 voters.Theres not much question that Democrats will gain as the remaining young voters from Democratic jurisdictions mail in their ballots. The question is how much, and whether it will be enough.",2014-10-29,abortion

Theres just a week to go before midterm elections, and the Republican odds of a Senate takeover are up to 70 percent, as Scott P. Browns chances have improved in New Hampshire. Hillary Rodham Clinton is backpedaling after one of her comments offended some on Wall Street, while Gov. Chris Christie is feeling a backlash from conservatives, and attention is turning to the states that will matter most next Tuesday.It might be a tad hyperbolic to call them the Final Five, but it is increasingly clear that races in Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas and North Carolina will be the most crucial in determining which party controls the Senate. Here is where they stand:Colorado: Senator Mark Udall has hammered the Republican nominee, Representative Cory Gardner, on abortion rights and contraception. But the race may come down to the Hispanic vote. Some Republicans say privately that Hispanics were undersampled in polls showing a Gardner victory.North Carolina: Thom Tillis, the State House speaker, has not lived up to what Republicans expected, and Kay Hagan, the Democratic incumbent, has proved remarkably durable. If Ms. Hagan can hold off Mr. Tillis, there is unlikely to be a national wave.Georgia: That the Democrat, Michelle Nunn, is running even with the Republican, David Perdue, is a late surprise. But with a Libertarian on the ballot, neither may crack 50 percent, and the race would not be decided until a runoff in January. Thats one of the reasons control of the Senate may not be known next Tuesday.Kansas: One big question here is whether the independent candidate, Greg Orman, will caucus with the Democrats or Republicans should he defeat Senator Pat Roberts. Mr. Orman will be eager to assess the overall balance of power before making a decision.Iowa: Democrats have been frustrated by their nominee, Representative Bruce Braley, who was caught on tape criticizing Charles E. Grassley, a Republican and the states senior senator, as a mere farmer from Iowa. If the Republicans win here, their path to the six seats they need for the majority is easy to see. Jonathan MartinThe Ebola crisis is turning into another Hurricane Sandy for Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, politically anyway.Mr. Christies handling of the outbreak has been scrutinized by conservatives, civil liberties groups and medical experts. Criticism mounted on Monday after he released a nurse who had been quarantined in a tent in Newark after returning from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone. The move came after the Obama administration pressured him to relax his quarantine policy.Mr. Christie spent much of Monday trying to explain that he was not flip-flopping. Too late. Rush Limbaugh and Matt Drudge are on the case.The Drudge Report flashed a two-year-old image of Mr. Christie walking arm-in-arm with President Obama after Hurricane Sandy, a reminder that many Republicans blame that embrace  just days before the 2012 election  for costing Mitt Romney the election.Leaving no doubt about his feelings, Mr. Drudge also posted a rare personal tweet that read, Week before another big election and Superstorm Christie blows again.Mr. Limbaugh was even more hostile, arguing that Mr. Christie had caved to the administration and had effectively given Mr. Obama another hug, metaphorically speaking. Whats the punishment for such a crime?We need to quarantine Chris Christie, Mr. Limbaugh said. Alan RappeportLike all of the Republicans mulling a run for the White House in 2016, Senator Rand Paul has hit the campaign trail hard the last few weeks, building up his national image and winning good will among party members.But there is a special strategy to Mr. Pauls schedule.Georgia, Kansas and North Carolina are more than states with Republican Senate candidates in need of Mr. Pauls star power. They are all states with Libertarian candidates on the ballot who could draw a few percentage points away from the Republicans.And in a close race, those points could make all the difference.As something of a hero of the Libertarian movement, Mr. Paul and his support for Republicans could help sway voters who would otherwise back the Libertarian. At least thats what party officials hope.But Mr. Paul is taking a risk that the Libertarian faithful will abandon him entirely in 2016 because he is so openly opposing that partys candidates this year. (His political action committee will start advertising on cable television on Tuesday for Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas and will run online ads in North Carolina to help Thom Tillis, the Republican speaker of the State House.) Jeremy W. PetersSearching for peace, quiet and tranquility this election season? Vote early.Only then will the robocalls, emails, door knocks, online ads and social media pitches stop. (Well, most of them.)Heres why: Early ballots are noted in voter files, which both parties use to microtarget advertising messages for websites, emails, set-top cable boxes and satellite dishes.NGP VAN, the technology firm hired by the Democratic National Committee, pulls data almost daily, and early voters are automatically dropped out of canvassing and phone-bank lists. The data is also used in computing voter scores that dictate other messaging decisions, including targeted advertisements.The Republican National Committee removes early voters from get-out-the-vote efforts. The National Republican Congressional Committee will also pull back on targeted advertisements for those who have voted early. And Targeted Victory, the Republican technology firm, offers clients a self-service system to automatically exclude those who have voted. That saves money that would otherwise be wasted on someone who has already cast a vote, the company says.Voting early wont stop ads on broadcast television or fund-raising emails.

Carol Shea-Porter and Ann McLane Kuster, the two House Democrats running for re-election here, are probably well aware that a recent history of their seats looks a bit like musical chairs.Ms. Shea-Porter won her seat in the First District on the wings of voter frustration with President George W. Bush in 2006, the same year a Democrat named Paul Hodes ousted the longtime Republican representative in the Second District, Charles Bass.In 2010, Ms. Shea-Porter lost her seat to Frank Guinta, a Republican and the former mayor of Manchester, and Mr. Bass won his seat back, beating Ms. Kuster in her first try for the job, as voters across the nation revolted against the Affordable Care Act.And in 2012, as voters gave President Obama a second term, Ms. Shea-Porter was elected again, while Ms. Kuster beat Mr. Bass.Now, Ms. Shea-Porter and Ms. Kuster are locked in tight re-election battles with opponents who are eager to tie them to President Obama, who has a 40 percent approval rating here. If the back-and-forth of recent history is any guide, their races could be a bellwether for the broader national political order when the dust settles after Election Day.The two races are playing out in genuine swing districts  the number of which, according to The Cook Political Report, decreased by 45 percent between 1998 and 2013  with large groups of independent voters who are susceptible to political mood swings and a variable turnout between midterm and presidential election years.These voters tend to take out their frustrations with whoever they perceive to be in charge when things arent going right, said David Wasserman, the House editor of The Cook Political Report. Thats made these districts look like Ping-Pong balls.The Second District runs from the bottom to the top of the state, while the First District looks like a jagged bite out of its eastern side, and both encompass college towns, suburbs and mountainous swaths where the states motto, Live Free or Die, feels particularly apt.There just arent that many purple states, so New Hampshire kind of sticks out, said Linda L. Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. Were going to continue to see this kind of shifting back and forth.This wasnt always the case. The First District was held by Republicans from 1985 to 2007 (except for about a month when it was empty), while the Second District saw just one Democrat serve (for two terms) between 1915 and 2007.This was not a swing district, Ms. Shea-Porter says of her district, until I made it one.Ms. Shea-Porter, 61, was a little-known but vocally antiwar social worker when she won her districts 2006 Democratic primary and then eked out a victory against the Republican incumbent, Jeb Bradley, with no help from national Democrats.In 2006, I kept saying, the middle class is stumbling, the poor have fallen, said Ms. Shea-Porter. I think that struck a nerve and it still does.The district leans slightly Republican, with a broad base of independents, and so Ms. Shea-Porter is always on the edge  and lately, as it turns out, stuck in a tug-of-war with Mr. Guinta. After taking Ms. Shea-Porters seat and then losing it back to her, Mr. Guinta, who has worked as an insurance consultant, has returned for a third round, and Politico has identified Ms. Shea-Porter as one of the five most endangered House members.That district in particular really seems to rise and fall with the fortunes of the president and the incumbent party nationally, said Dean Spiliotes, a civic scholar at Southern New Hampshire University. He added, I think shes extremely vulnerable.At a Rotary Club forum here late last month, Ms. Shea-Porter and Mr. Guinta shared a stage for the first time since their 2012 campaign.This country is going in the wrong direction, Mr. Guinta, 44, said after telling the audience that he had been a productive congressman. Ms. Shea-Porter worked to distance herself from Mr. Obama, pointing out that she had voted against arming moderate Syrian rebels last month and that she had called for the resignation of Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of Health and Human Services who presided over the disastrous launch of the online federal health exchange.Most recent polling has shown the race to be close; The Cook Political Report rates it a toss-up.Representative Kuster, a 58-year-old lawyer and ex-lobbyist whom many in the Second District call Annie, comes from a long line of New Hampshire politicians. She faces Marilinda Garcia, a 31-year-old state representative and harp teacher. Ms. Garcia, who has been identified as a rising star by the national Republican Party, has drawn supporters like House Speaker John A. Boehner and Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul to appear at fund-raisers and campaign stops with her. Conservative outside groups like the Club for Growth have made big media buys on her behalf, but her fund-raising lags behind Ms. Kusters.Ms. Garcia has repeatedly criticized Ms. Kuster for not appearing enough around the state. At a town hall in Littleton, just north of the White Mountains, earlier this month, Ms. Garcia stood next to a cardboard cutout of Ms. Kuster and answered questions, selected by a moderator, about health care.In an interview, Ms. Garcia sought to link her opponent with Mr. Obama, and referred to a statement he made in Illinois  much to Democrats chagrin  that tied him to the midterm elections. As he said himself the other day, basically his policies are on the ballot, said Ms. Garcia. She added, Representative Kuster isnt really establishing or setting herself apart as an individual or her own person.Ms. Kuster has focused her campaign on retail stops at diners and local businesses, where she greets voters with zeal, and has released a bevy of television ads that say Ms. Garcias views  and votes in the State House  on abortion and womens health issues are too extreme for New Hampshire.The presidents not on the ballot, these issues are whats on the ballot, Ms. Kuster said after a campaign stop at a whiskey distillery in Nashua.Recent polling shows a single-digit race, and Real Clear Politics recently rated it a toss-up.Analysts says Ms. Shea-Porter is more likely to lose her seat than Ms. Kuster. New Hampshire has not split its House delegation since the early 1990s.Who knows, said Mr. Spiliotes, the civic scholar. Sometimes you just get these big waves, and suddenly everybodys gone.",2014-10-28,abortion

Those were the days.In recent weeks, the court has addressed cases on the great issues of the day without favoring the nation with even a whisper of explanation. In terse orders, the court expanded the availability of same-sex marriage, let a dozen abortion clinics in Texas reopen, and made it harder to vote in three states and easier in one.Judges and lawyers who used to have to try to make sense of endless, opaque opinions now have to divine what the Supreme Courts silence means.There is something odd about the courts docket these days. When the court considers a minor case on, say, teeth whitening, it receives a pile of briefs, hears an hour of arguments and issues a carefully reasoned decision noting every justices position.When the stakes are higher, the court turns oracular.The courts unexplained orders dont always live up to its otherwise high standards of legal craft, said William Baude, a law professor at the University of Chicago. The court doesnt tell us its reasoning, and we dont even know for sure which justices agree with the result.It is probably useful to distinguish between two kinds of orders: ones denying petitions urging the court to hear appeals and ones taking action on emergency applications in cases pending in the lower courts.On Oct. 6, the court issued the first kind of order, turning down seven petitions asking it to review appeals court decisions striking down bans on same-sex marriage. The Supreme Courts move in short order effectively increased the number of states that allow gay couples to marry to 35 from 19.The court receives about 8,000 petitions seeking review every year and accepts roughly 75. It would be a lot of work to explain why it turns down the rest.If the court is to do its work, it would not be feasible to give reasons, however brief, for refusing to take these cases, Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in a 1950 opinion.It takes four votes to add a case to the Supreme Courts docket. All a denial means, Justice Frankfurter said, is that fewer than four justices thought it was a good idea to hear that case.This court has rigorously insisted that such a denial carries with it no implication whatever regarding the courts views on the merits of a case which it has declined to review, he wrote. The court has said this again and again; again and again the admonition has to be repeated.Thomas C. Horne, Arizonas attorney general, may need another reminder. In explaining why he would not appeal a federal judges order striking down his states ban on same-sex marriage, he said the Supreme Court has shown an unwillingness to accept review of the issue.In light of that, Mr. Horne said, it would be foolhardy to pursue an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, and then to the Supreme Court.The probability of persuading the Ninth Circuit to reverse todays decision is zero, he said. The probability of the United States Supreme Court accepting review of the Ninth Circuit decision is also zero.That may well be right. But it is an inference from vanishingly thin evidence. And that evidence, the Supreme Court has repeatedly instructed judges and lawyers, should be ignored.The Supreme Courts other recent orders came in response to emergency applications concerning elections and abortion. It is less clear why those orders did not give reasons, particularly as some of them came with dissents.The orders certainly gave lower-court judges very little guidance.Consider Judge Edith Brown Clement, who recently had to try to figure out what to make of three of the courts orders in election cases. The justices had allowed Ohio to cut back on early voting and let North Carolina bar same-day registration and the counting of votes cast in the wrong precinct. But they had stopped Wisconsin from requiring voters there to provide photo identification.Judge Clement, of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, did the best she could to identify a theme.While the Supreme Court has not explained its reasons for issuing these stays, the common thread is clearly that the decision of the court of appeals would change the rules of the election too soon before the election date, she wrote on Oct. 14. The stayed decisions have both upheld and struck down state statutes and affirmed and reversed district court decisions, so the timing of the decisions rather than their merits seems to be the key.Judge Clement guessed right. The Fifth Circuit allowed Texas to use its strict voter ID law in the November election, and a few days later the Supreme Court agreed, again without explanation.Professor Baude said a murmur of reasoning might have been in order.The justices are being cautious, but too cautious, he said. Theyre used to having time to be thoughtful. When they issue an order under time pressure, they may want to avoid saying too much and setting a bad precedent. But when the order reverses a lower court or disagrees with a dissent they should tell us why, at least a little bit.At his confirmation hearing, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said he would strive to make the courts opinions clear and accessible.I hope we havent gotten to the point where the Supreme Courts opinions are so abstruse that the educated layperson cant pick them up and read them and understand them, he said.In a way, he has achieved his goal. The courts opinions in this falls orders are not abstruse. They are absent.",2014-10-28,abortion

Under President Jos Mujica, who cannot run for re-election this year, it has won approval of laws legalizing marijuana, same-sex marriage and abortion.But Luis Lacalle Pou, 41, a leader of the conservative National Party, has mounted a strong challenge to Mr. Vzquez. Mr. Lacalle Pou, a lawyer and a son of a president of Uruguay in the 1990s, is vowing to scale back plans for the government to take the leading role in growing and selling marijuana, while also focusing on worries over rising crime and quality of schools.Before the race began, security and education had emerged as two important concerns, said Rosario Queirolo, a professor of political science at Catholic University in Montevideo. Voters are looking to issues beyond economic demands.Mr. Mujica, 79, has presided over robust growth during his five-year term while lifting Uruguays international profile. Although Mr. Mujica retains high approval ratings, big parts of the population are resistant to his social changes. Uruguay allows re-election for presidents only after intervening terms.Though Uruguay remains one of Latin Americas safest nations, an increase in violent crime has rattled many residents. In addition to the voting for president and legislators, Uruguayans also voted Sunday in a plebiscite to determine whether the age at which someone can be criminally charged as an adult should be lowered to 16 from 18.We see too much aggressiveness in the streets, said Susana Rodrguez, 66, a pensioner who supports Mr. Lacalle Pou. Crime is getting out of control.Official results in the election were not expected to be released until after Sunday.Mr. Vzquez, a doctor and a moderate leftist who was president from 2005 to 2010, also signaled during the race that he was open to watering down Uruguays marijuana law, which was approved last year. He has also expressed opposition to the legalization of first-trimester abortions, which was approved in 2012, and vetoed similar legislation as president in 2008.Still, for many voters the election came down to a choice between supporting continuity for the governing Broad Front, or a shift toward more conservative policies. Some drew comparisons between Mr. Lacalle Pou and his father, who unsuccessfully sought to privatize state-controlled companies in the 1990s.I think hell bring back the same policies as his father, looking after large economic interests without worrying about those at the bottom, said Manuel Vila, 67, of Montevideo.",2014-10-27,abortion

Andrew M. Cuomo to appeal to female voters.","On Monday, Gloria Steinem, still feminisms leading oracle, sent an email to 200,000 New Yorkers urging them to vote for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and other candidates seeking election on the Working Families Party line. Her note pointed to the organizations work on paid sick leave (she mentioned it twice), on raising wages for the underclass, on fighting for tax increases on the wealthy and for expanded rights for domestic workers.New York should be a beacon to the nation by telling the truth, Ms. Steinem wrote. Our society is more unequal than ever. Things are toughest for low-income women, people of color and the children who depend on them.In his four years in office, Governor Cuomo has appeared as a champion of the invisible roughly as often as the brokers on Million Dollar Listing have shilled for small, modest apartments. But the more votes the Democratic governor receives on the Working Families line, the more  one might presume  he will feel bound to honor progressive promises that narrowly secured him the partys endorsement in the first place.What threatens a robust count is the sudden formation, announced by Governor Cuomos running mate, Kathy Hochul, over the summer, of the Womens Equality Party, a component of a branding effort on the part of the governor to appeal to female voters.The campaign has the governor and his running mate touring the state on a bus called the Womens Equality Express, holding rallies on abortion rights and other aspects of the governors Womens Equality Act, which languished in the State Legislature. In one significant sense, the marketing would seem to have been successful. Although recent polling data from the Siena Research Institute reveals the governors favorability ratings at a relatively low 54 percent, the gender gap is significant, with 65 percent of women surveyed saying they have a favorable opinion of him, and only 41 percent of men.Noticeably absent from Ms. Steinems email is any reference to abortion at all. Mr. Cuomo has talked about the issue repeatedly in the course of the campaign, reminding voters during a televised debate on Wednesday night, for instance, that he would stand up for a womans right to choose as if it were truly imperiled in a state that has one of the strongest laws protecting abortion in the country, and some of the richest and most liberal women on earth.The Womens Equality Act, which includes a welcome strengthening of laws on sexual harassment and discrimination, stalled on a proposition that would have altered language around restrictions to abortions occurring after 24 weeks. As the law currently stands, these third-trimester abortions are permissible when a womans life is in danger; under the rewording they would also be allowed when a womans health was jeopardized. On the one hand, this is no small distinction. But on the other hand, even staunch advocates of revising the law cannot recall the last time  or possibly any time  since abortion was legalized that a patient or physician in New York was prosecuted for terminating a third-trimester pregnancy.The Cuomo campaign has arguably resurrected a longstanding divide in the womens movement between those more singularly concerned about issues of sexuality and reproductive rights, and those focused on the grittier economic issues that affect womens lives more broadly if not always as dramatically. The Womens Equality Party has a number of celebrities who have lent their names in support, including Lena Dunham, the creator of Girls, Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, and leaders of Planned Parenthood and Naral. The face of the movement belongs to Christine C. Quinn, former speaker of the New York City Council who has spoken often about the importance of reproductive choice, but who opposed paid sick leave for a long time during her tenure on the Council.On Thursday, Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke on behalf of the governors feminist credentials, invoking her own past struggles as a young lawyer and mother. The same day, the Working Families Party released a video featuring prominent female politicians and activists urging voters to cast their ballots on the Working Families line, and by implication, to spurn the Womens Equality Party. The women  among them the Manhattan borough president, Gale A. Brewer, and Representative Nydia M. Velzquez, both Democrats who had initially lent their names to the womens party and found themselves quickly disillusioned  are essentially arguing that progressive economic policies are what will ultimately bring women closer to parity.The Working Families Party to me represents, since its creation, all the progressive ideals that are important to women and families  paid family leave, choice  to women and low-income women working two and three jobs, Ms. Velzquez told me, explaining that she hadnt participated in any events for the Womens Equality Party.Also appearing in the video is Ai-jen Poo, a recent recipient of a MacArthur grant for her advocacy around rights for domestic workers. Earlier in the month, State Senator Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat, declined offers to attend events for the Womens Equality Party. In an email that she wrote to Ms. Quinn and that was published on the website Capital New York, Ms. Krueger wrote: Women are 54 percent of the voters in this state. When they vote on the Democratic line, Democrats win. I do not wish women to be relegated to some non party.Theres another matter on the minds of some political women as well. So many ballot lines are simply too confusing. People understand Republicans and Democrats, Zenaida Mendez, the leader of New York States chapter of the National Organization for Women, told me. It took me a half an hour to explain all of this to someone.",2014-10-26,abortion

Tennessee Vote Tests That Idea,"Anti-abortion forces are trying to pass Amendment 1, which states that nothing in the Tennessee Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion.","MEMPHIS   The online video features idyllic snatches of Tennessee daily life: guitar players, old barns, church socials  and the official Tennessee welcome sign, glimpsed through the window of a car passing over the state line.But then there is a strategically placed, and purely fictional, detail: The welcome sign announces Tennessee as Your Abortion Destination.The video was designed by abortion opponents here who believe that Tennessee has for too long been a Bible Belt outlier due to a State Supreme Court decision in 2000 that ruled that the states constitutional guarantee of a right to privacy includes the right to an abortion. Over the years, the ruling has served as a partial bulwark against the wave of abortion restrictions that have swept other conservatives states.Now, anti-abortion forces are trying to change that at the ballot box by passing Amendment 1, which states that nothing in the Tennessee Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion.Two other states, Colorado and North Dakota, are also trying to restrict abortion this Election Day with so called personhood ballot measures, which would extend extra rights and protections to the unborn. Colorado has previously voted twice against versions of the measure.Here in Tennessee the ballot fight has taken center stage this political season, and abortion opponents are buoyed by the Democratic Partys comically poor chances of recapturing the governors mansion. The partys challenger to incumbent Bill Haslam, a Republican, is Charles V. Brown, a retired construction worker and political neophyte best known for his suggestion that Mr. Haslam be strapped to an electric chair.When theres no real candidate to vote for, its hard, said Rebecca Terrell, the executive director of Choices, a clinic in Memphis that offers abortions, in acknowledging that abortion rights forces face a hard time getting out the liberal vote.Governor Haslam has voiced his support for Amendment 1, as have many members of the Republican-dominated state government. Supporters say the amendment would allow legislators to bring the state in line with the rest of the region rather than serve as what, to them, is a kind of abortion haven. The Tennessee health department says that 23 percent of women who received abortions in 2013 lived outside Tennessee.For a woman in the fast-growing city of Southaven, Miss., for example, the trip to Mississippis sole abortion clinic, in Jackson, is three hours by car. Mississippi law requires women to undergo counseling, and a 24-hour waiting period, before an abortion may be performed.But the same patient can be at Choices, one of two Memphis abortion clinics, in 20 minutes. Tennessee requires no special counseling and no waiting period.Should Tennessee be the abortion capital of the Bible Belt? said Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Nashville-based Southern Baptist Convention, in a post on Twitter last month.Abortion rights advocates reject such characterizations, noting that even with the 2000 ruling, legislators have enacted abortion regulations, including a 2012 law mandating that physicians who perform abortions have admitting privileges at a local hospital.They also argue that the percentage of out-of-state patients fails to account for Tennessees geographic setting. It is surrounded by eight states whose residents often travel to places like Memphis for all kinds of big-city services.The 2000 ruling was the result of a lawsuit brought against the governor at the time, Don Sundquist, by groups including the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood. The court ruled that a womans right to terminate her pregnancy is a vital part of the right to privacy under the State Constitution, making any regulations of that right subject to a rigorous strict scrutiny standard. Both abortion rights advocates and anti-abortion forces agree that it created a level of protection for abortion higher than that afforded by the federal courts.In the ruling, the state court also struck down three abortion-related provisions, including a required two-day waiting period; a mandate that only physicians may give informed consent to an abortion patient; and a requirement that all abortions after the first trimester be performed in a hospital.Anti-abortion campaigners have been trying to undo the ruling for years. They were helped along by the election of a wave of conservative, anti-abortion candidates to the State Legislature in 2010. These members, in 2011, helped Amendment 1 garner the two-thirds supermajority necessary to put it on the ballot in the next election for governor.Brian Harris, a coordinator of the Yes on 1 campaign and president of Tennessee Right to Life, said the court ruling has left state law out of character with the states culturally conservative populace.Mr. Harris said Tennesseans should have the same rights to enact abortion regulations as their counterparts in neighboring states.The debate in Tennessee is playing out as the federal judiciary struggles to determine how much regulation of the abortion industry is permissible, and how few and far between abortion clinics may be until a womans constitutional right to an abortion is violated.Earlier this month, the Supreme Court blocked a Texas law that would have imposed new standards on clinics, forcing many of them to close.The battle here over the abortion amendment has grown fierce. By the end of September, the campaign committee Vote No on One Tennessee, Inc., had raised $1.9 million, the bulk of it from the states two Planned Parenthood chapters. The Yes on 1 Ballot Committee had raised just over $900,000, much of it coming from smaller donations from individuals, churches and local anti-abortion groups.A key argument of the Vote No group is that the measure would restrict privacy rights and allow politicians to meddle in personal decisions.Steven Hershkowitz, a Vote No on One spokesman, said the group hoped to appeal to conservative voters who were generally anti-abortion, but believed that there should be some exceptions.Mr. Hershkowitz noted that if Tennessee were to pass Amendment 1, and the United States Supreme Court, at some later date, were to overturn its Roe v. Wade ruling making abortion legal, the State Legislature would be free to restrict abortion even in cases of rape, incest or a grave health threat to the mother.Mr. Harris said the Vote Yes faction, despite being outspent, is counting on rallying motivated evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholics. The group was running a television ad in which people walk down a city street with mouths covered in tape as an announcer says the state high court ruling silenced the right of the people to enforce reasonable regulation of abortion.In a Vanderbilt University poll conducted in April and May, 71 percent of respondents said they opposed the idea of giving the Legislature the authority to regulate abortion. And opponents are somewhat cheered by a state law that requires that the amendment earn more than 50 percent of the total number of votes cast in the governors race.Outside of the Planned Parenthood branch in Memphis recently, many of the protesters who keep vigil in front of the clinics parking lot were eager to vote yes.The laws are more lenient  thats why more people are coming here, said Elizabeth Orians, 52, who was holding a sign that said Pray to End Abortion.But not all were of the same mind. John Brindley, 46, an industrial supply salesman, spent a recent Friday morning seeking allies in the men who had driven women to the Planned Parenthood clinic.He said he would be voting against Amendment 1. He unquestionably believes that abortion is a great evil. But allowing it to be regulated more, he said, would only create cleaner facilities to murder children in.",2014-10-25,abortion

Lets think about the immediate reactions that different Jews had to the Oct. 14 arrest of Rabbi Barry Freundel, the spiritual leader of congregation Kesher Israel in Washington, who has been accused of using a secret camera to spy on women immersing in a mikvah, the Jewish ritual bath.Jews throughout modern Orthodoxy, the branch of Judaism in which Rabbi Freundel is so prominent, were horrified, and ashamed, that one of theirs could be accused of an act so perverted.Secular, Reform and Conservative Jews rolled their eyes. The mikvah is principally used by Orthodox women, who, after not touching their husbands while menstruating, must immerse in a mikvah before resuming sexual relations  a rule that strikes liberal Jews as sexist and anachronistic. While feeling compassion, these Jews may have also thought, Why are 21st-century women still going to the mikvah?Orthodox women who had immersed at the Georgetown mikvah that Rabbi Freundel supervises felt violated and angry. Carrie Bornstein, the executive director of Mayyim Hayyim Living Waters, a community mikvah here outside of Boston, described one such woman, who happened to visit her mikvah on the night the news broke.She had been a regular user at the Kesher Israel mikvah, Ms. Bornstein wrote in The Times of Israel, and our mikvah guide recounted that when she arrived she looked ashen and could hardly speak about what happened. (Allegedly happened, that is.)And me? Amazingly, I had never seen a mikvah  and this in an age when mikvah use is spreading: to the non-Orthodox, to children and the elderly, and to more men. In fact, Rabbi Freundels arrest brought attention to the kind of mikvah  for the Orthodox, controlled by a man  that activists have been working to make a thing of the past.So I came to meet Ms. Bornstein, whose Mayyim Hayyim, which opened in 2004, is the best-known of the community mikvahs, which are designed to be more welcoming, safer, and more theologically innovative than traditional Orthodox mikvahs. The website of Mayyim Hayyim (which means living waters in Hebrew) lists 32 mikvahs in its network, across the United States and in Canada and Israel.The community mikvahs are kosher for traditional uses: for women who have finished menstruating, for men purifying themselves before the Sabbath, for brides or grooms before their wedding day, as the final act of a conversion to Judaism. But they operate with the progressive philosophy that individuals can decide for themselves how to observe this ritual.So if a Jewish woman wants to immerse in the mikvah to help the healing process after an abortion, or a suicide attempt, thats fine, according to those who run community mikvahs. If a young boy wants to immerse to mark his becoming a bar mitzvah, thats O.K., too. New rituals can be created, and indeed should be. Many of the new-fashioned mikvahs are housed at or near Conservative or Reform synagogues, whose members, not feeling religiously obliged to immerse, sometimes embrace the mikvah as part of their individualized spiritual practice.The mikvah has also caught on among some feminists as a separate womans space, with special meaning at times of miscarriage or menopause.Above all, a community mikvah should be safe and private, said Ms. Bornstein, a professional educator who in 2012 became Mayyim Hayyims second director. Which is why Rabbi Freundels arrest cut so deep.I was horrified, Ms. Bornstein said. This organization, and my lifes work, every minute of the day that I am pouring into this, is around protecting safety and privacy.Ms. Bornstein worries that a fear of voyeurism would now be added to all the other fraught emotions that women bring to the mikvah: You are coming to a strange building you have never been to, have to take off all your clothes, there might be somebody in the room with you, you are speaking Hebrew, you are getting married or becoming Jewish or have just finished treatment for breast cancer. You are in a moment of transition, and you are already on edge.Sara Luria, a Reform rabbi who runs ImmerseNYC, which uses an Orthodox mikvah in Manhattan but provides its own, specially trained guides, said that Rabbi Freundels arrest affirmed her sense of calling.My first thoughts were, Thank God were doing what were doing,  Rabbi Luria said. Women tell us stories about how they werent safe at their mikvah. Sometimes the female mikvah attendant was intrusive. Other times, the water wasnt clean, or they didnt have what they needed in the changing room, or they waited for an hour in the prep room  naked  and the buzzer didnt work, and they couldnt go out to check. There are so many issues of safety at the mikvah.Mayyim Hayyim was conceived in 2001 by Anita Diamant, the author of the best-selling novel The Red Tent. She was upset by the cold, assembly-line feel of many mikvahs, in particular by what message they sent to converts.People converting to Judaism were not being given the kind of welcome they deserved, Ms. Diamant said.So Mayyim Hayyim was designed to be welcoming, and to embody the Jewish principle of hiddur mitzvah, that commandments should be performed beautifully. It is a converted Victorian house, with cozy rooms for sitting and study, and with space for art exhibitions. When I visited, the gallery displayed works by the potter Steven Branfman from the year of mourning after his son died, when he threw a pot every day.Dasi Fruchter is an Orthodox Jew who grew up near Washington, where Rabbi Freundels wife was once her teacher. Women from her community typically use Orthodox-controlled mikvahs. But Ms. Fruchter, a third-year student at Yeshivat Maharat, a New York City yeshiva that is the first to ordain Orthodox women as clergy, is a rabbinical intern at ImmerseNYC. And she says that she is less worried about other cases of voyeurism than about overreaction to them.One thing I and my colleagues at other mikvahs worry about is a hyper-vigilance around the mikvah, that there is more fear, Ms. Fruchter said. She echoed a hope that I hear elsewhere, that the modern mikvah movement, as Rabbi Luria calls it, makes mikvahs less hidden, and more talked about.I hope this incident moves the mikvah from something secret to something private,  Ms. Fruchter said.Before I left Mayyim Hayyim, I asked if I could immerse in the mikvah. It seemed the thing to do, to have even the barest sense of how vulnerable the experience can feel. And I did  my first time ever. It was a bit scary, and it felt a bit forced, since I was on journalistic assignment. But everyone there was supportive, and kind. The water was wonderfully warm (Id expected it to be chilly). And I was totally confident there were no hidden cameras.",2014-10-25,abortion

Andrew M. Cuomo presents the package of new gun laws known as the Safe Act as one of his greatest successes, but that is not how it is viewed across stretches outside New York City.","In large stretches of upstate New York, it is the reason Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is deeply unpopular. To many voters in New York City and its suburbs, it is one of his crowning achievements.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, made New York the first state to pass a broad package of new gun laws after the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. Seizing a singular political moment, he called it the Safe Act, and he implored Congress to follow his lead.Nearly two years later, as he seeks a second term, Mr. Cuomo presents the act to his supporters as one of his greatest successes, and Democrats are assailing the governors Republican challenger, Rob Astorino, for being lax on guns. It remains one of the most far-reaching pieces of gun-control legislation passed in response to the Newtown shooting.But in pushing for passage of strict new gun laws, Mr. Cuomo alienated a vocal constituency across upstate New York, a region he has otherwise wooed. In court, gun owners have challenged the constitutionality of the laws; on lawn signs and bumper stickers in places like the Catskills and western New York, they demand their repeal.Counties, towns and villages have passed resolutions denouncing the laws, and some counties have even demanded that their official seals not be used on any paperwork relating to them. In response to an open records request, the governors office shared hundreds of pages of such resolutions, from far-flung places like the Adirondack town of North Hudson, with 238 residents, to more populous areas like Erie County.The calculation when it was passed was people were going to get mad for a little while and then get over it, Stephen J. Aldstadt, the president of the Shooters Committee on Political Education, said. I dont think people are getting over it. Despite its scope, the Safe Act was not everything it was originally intended to be, and there were stumbles. A provision limiting the size of gun magazines, for example, turned out to be unworkable.Thirty-two days after the shooting in Newtown, on Jan. 15, 2013, Mr. Cuomo signed the act into law. The measure included an expanded ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as a broader requirement for background checks, and tougher penalties for gun crimes.The Safe Act really meets the test of good gun policy, Leah Gunn Barrett, the executive director of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence, said. It keeps guns out of the wrong hands, and I think it does that quite effectively.The legislation also sought to keep guns out of the hands of people with mental illnesses by requiring mental health professionals to report to the authorities any patient who was likely to be dangerous. As a result, about 34,500 people in New York are now barred from having guns; some mental health advocates have expressed concern that too many people have been categorized as dangerous.So far, New York lawmakers have allocated $34 million to cover the costs associated with the laws, such as information-technology upgrades, according to the state budget office.Some gun owners have complained that the process that produced the legislation moved far too quickly, and state officials have run into legal hiccups and technological challenges since the laws were enacted. Critics also say the Cuomo administration has not been transparent in putting the laws into effect.One provision included in the act was struck down by a federal judge because of a spelling error. Another, which limited the size of gun magazines to seven rounds, had to be revised after the governor conceded seven-round magazines were not widely available.(The laws were amended to allow the sale of 10-round magazines, with gun owners prohibited from loading more than seven rounds at a time. But the same judge struck down the  restriction on loading more than seven rounds, calling it arbitrary. The state is appealing that ruling.)A requirement that ammunition sales be subject to background checks, another aspect of the laws, has not been put into effect, because the state has not yet established a system for conducting the checks. And there are lingering questions among officials as varied as sheriffs and county clerks about what the laws require of them.Its been a long and difficult road since January of last year, said Alex M. Wilson, a lawyer for the New York State Sheriffs Association, which has filed amicus briefs asserting that the Safe Act violates the Second Amendment.One of the most controversial elements of the Safe Act was its requirement that the owners of firearms defined under the laws as assault weapons register them with the State Police.Many gun owners said they would not comply; the deadline for registering passed on April 15. The State Police have refused to say how many gun owners have registered; a spokeswoman, Darcy Wells, said that such information was exempt from disclosure under New Yorks Freedom of Information Law.The State Police have received requests for aggregate registration data from numerous people, including Michael Genier, an engineer from Horseheads, N.Y. His request was denied, as was a subsequent appeal. In an interview, Mr. Genier said he suspected that Mr. Cuomo did not want the data publicized because it would show that few people had registered. You may or not like the law, he said, but you cant change it without proper information.In an Oct. 3 advisory opinion, the states Committee on Open Government said the State Police had no legal basis to keep the aggregate data secret, and a firearms instructor from the Rochester area filed a lawsuit in state court this month seeking the information. Ms. Wells, the State Police spokeswoman, said the agency was reviewing the advisory opinion.Some data released by the state shows that one major fear among gun owners has not come to fruition: Law enforcement officials have not gone out of their way to enforce provisions of the Safe Act against otherwise law-abiding state residents.Through late September, when data was most recently available, the states Division of Criminal Justice Services said no arrests had been reported to the agency for the misdemeanor of failing to register an assault weapon  the requirement that many gun owners have openly defied.In total, there have been about 3,300 instances in which a person was charged with at least one offense established by, or strengthened under, the Safe Act, such as possessing a weapon on school grounds or buying a gun for another person who is forbidden to have one. (In those instances in which a person was charged with multiple Safe Act offenses, state records showed only the most serious charge.)In 92 percent of cases, the charge was criminal firearm possession, a newly created felony; most of those were in either Brooklyn or the Bronx. The district attorneys in those boroughs said that in some instances in the past, those found with an unlicensed handgun could be charged only with a misdemeanor; now, they can be charged with a felony, which carries a stiffer sentence.As he campaigns for re-election, Mr. Cuomo has trumpeted the Safe Act in some, but not all, of his appearances. At a rally in the Riverdale section of the Bronx in September, he spoke of his work on gun control, same-sex marriage and abortion rights to show how he was trying to restore New York as the progressive capital of the nation.We said, lets take those tough issues and solve them and show leadership, the governor said. Lets take the issue of gun violence, where too many innocent people have died, and lets pass sensible gun control once and for all, and dont tell me it cant be done. Ill show you it can be done. And that law is going to save lives.At a speech three days later in Buffalo, Mr. Cuomo discussed only same-sex marriage and abortion rights, not gun control.In a poll conducted by Siena College in March, the Safe Act drew support from 63 percent of voters statewide. But opinions varied significantly by region: 79 percent of voters in New York City and 63 percent in the citys suburbs approved of the laws, compared with only 45 percent in upstate New York.The Safe Act is viewed very differently depending on which county youre in, Frank A. Sedita III, the Erie County district attorney, said. Mr. Sedita said the new laws have had a negligible effect on how I do my job in prosecuting gun crimes.On a Sunday in late September, more than 400 gun-rights advocates crowded into a hotel ballroom on Long Island to hear Mr. Astorino and others criticize Mr. Cuomo and the Safe Act.It literally made criminals out of law-abiding citizens overnight, Mr. Astorino, the Westchester County executive, told the crowd at the Firearm Civil Rights Conference in Hauppauge. Governor Cuomo took away your rights. Take away his job.With voter-registration cards waiting on every seat, the message was clear: Gun owners should have a say in Novembers election.That sentiment was echoed by James W. Porter II, the president of the National Rifle Association, who, at the same event, called the Safe Act pure government-sanctioned lawlessness, which attracted loud applause.Yall are on the front lines of defending our constitutional rights and protections, Mr. Porter said.Several of those in attendance said that with the Safe Act, Mr. Cuomo was focused only on regulating responsible gun owners.If you keep changing the laws and think its going to stop violence, I just dont understand that, Candace Dein, 62, of West Islip said as she flipped through a magazine about handguns. I dont understand why theyre going after the people who have legal guns.Gregory Farren, 67, a Democrat from Flushing, Queens, said the November election was crucial for gun advocates. He wore an Astorino campaign sticker.My ability to own guns, he said, is at stake this year.",2014-10-25,abortion

In a recent e-mail interview, Ms. Pollitt discussed how she wants to change the debate about abortion, the importance of women sharing their stories and more. Below are edited excerpts from the conversation: What do you see as the biggest difference between societys attitude toward abortion now and its attitude when Roe v. Wade was decided?Today, Roe looks like a bolt out of the blue, but in 1973 it looked like the logical next step in the rapid advance of womens rights, privacy rights and public health. The fact is, women were having large numbers of illegal abortions before Roe: everyone knew this. So Roe was seen as a way to make abortion safe, and as enabling doctors to care for their patients as they thought best. [Justice Harry] Blackmuns decision was very practical: he focused a lot on doctors rights to give good patient care and on the injuries and deaths caused by illegal abortion  mostly to poor women, who could not travel to New York, where abortion was already legal. (Women of color were much more likely to die in clandestine abortions, and unlike today the court was troubled by laws that disproportionately affected minorities.)Today weve forgotten that history. Abortion is a symbol  of social decay, sexual irresponsibility, hedonism and, of course, womens autonomy, about which we are deeply ambivalent. Even pro-choicers prefer to talk about rape victims and wanted pregnancies that turn into medical catastrophes, when the truth is most unwanted pregnancies are the result of voluntary sex, and most abortions now, as before Roe, are for social, economic and personal reasons.Your book is an argument against using the language of safe, legal and rare that is so common on the pro-choice side. But could fighting that language potentially alienate the muddled middle you describe, and turn some people who take comfort in the safe, legal and rare rhetoric away from supporting pro-choice policies? I think we should say safe, legal and available. Rare opens up a whole can of worms: it could mean, lets have more birth control, which of course would be great and something pro-choicers support  and the organized anti-abortion movement opposes  but it could also mean, lets make it harder for women to get abortions, because right now its too easy. It implies theres an ideal number of abortions, and you know what it is. But in fact, a lot of women have babies now because, thanks to the Hyde amendment, which bars federal funds for Medicaid abortions, they cant afford to end a pregnancy, especially given the way restrictions have ratcheted up the cost (travel, motel, child care, time off work). Fact is, we dont really know how many abortions there would be if every woman who wanted one could have one.The book includes stories about individual women and their experiences. Was it difficult to get people to talk?I found women were eager to tell their stories. So much had been bottled up for so long. I got emails from all sorts of women  ones who had had illegal abortions 60 years ago, and ones who had ended pregnancies quite recently. Women buttonholed me at parties. Oh, I hear youre looking for women to talk about their abortions! Well, heres mine.In the 1970s, several prominent women (Gloria Steinem, Nora Ephron and others) signed a statement in Ms. magazine saying they had had abortions. Do we need more of that kind of openness from well-known people today?Yes, and from ordinary people, too. Three in 10 American women will have had an abortion by menopause, and many will have had more than one. That is a lot of women! And most of those women had help  from parents, boyfriends, husbands, friends. Abortion is part of the fabric of American life, and always has been. But fear and shame keep women silent, and in that silence misogynist stereotypes flourish: the girl or woman who ends a pregnancy is a slut or a child-hating cold-hearted career woman. Actually, most women who have abortions already have children: 61percent are mothers.What did you learn while researching the book that surprised you most?Did you know that in the late 1960s the Southern Baptists came out for liberalizing abortion laws? That in 1968 Ronald Reagan, then governor of California, signed what was at the time the most liberal abortion law in the land? Like religious fundamentalism, the anti-abortion movement is not as ancient as it looks. Its a contemporary phenomenon formed by the marriage of patriarchal religion and right-wing politics. And I know some readers are raising their eyebrows at my use of the word patriarchal. But the home base of the anti-abortion movement is in religious denominations where women are formally subordinate  the Catholic church, where women are shut out of the priesthood, which is where the power is, and the Southern Baptist and other evangelicalfundamentalist churches, where wives are commanded to submit to their husbands. If thats not patriarchy, what is?You write that the abortion debate suffers from disregard for the seriousness of motherhood. How so?When people talk about abortion as a matter of convenience, theyre saying having a baby is no big deal. Anyone can do it, even a 12-year-old! But pregnancy and childbirth are huge events, and mothering a child is serious, life-changing work. If we respected that work we would respect womens intense desire to time it well. And we would help mothers a lot more  we dont even have paid maternity leave, let alone affordable daycare. Theres a lot of job discrimination against pregnant women and women with kids. And a lot of poverty. Its as if we say to pregnant women, you had sex, now you have to have a baby. But once the baby is here, we say, not my problem, whyd you have a baby if you cant support it?  Are there any arguments on the other side of the debate that either give you pause or that you respect on a purely intellectual (if not practical) level?Someone (actually, a pro-choicer at a Planned Parenthood fundraiser) said to me, its okay to say youre not going to have a baby now, but its wrong to say youre not going to have this baby now. I struggle with abortion for, say, Down syndrome. At the same time I ask myself: if Down syndrome could be prevented, that would be a good thing, so why does abortion feel different, since its not yet a person? I dont find the anti-choice perspective intellectually persuasive at all  the personhood of the fertilized egg, sex as a kind of contract to have a baby. But emotionally there is something appealing about accepting life with all its imperfections and difficulties and even sorrow, rising to the occasion and making something good out of it.  The problem is they want to force this view on others, and by others I mean women, because they have no more interest than the culture at large in demanding real sacrifice by men who get women pregnant. The culture seems to be talking about this issue all the time, but rarely in ways that move the conversation in a new direction. How do you hope your book can do that? My aim is to turn the abortion paradigm on its head. We talk about abortion as a bad thing  even pro-choicers fall into this language when we say its an agonizing decision, the hardest decision a woman ever makes. Really? A woman who had no thought of becoming a mother before she got accidentally pregnant and is in no position to care for a child now suddenly thinks, I should have a baby? I argue that legal abortion is a social good. It benefits us all: everyone gains when women have babies when they can best raise them well  men, children, families, society. ",2014-10-24,abortion

I just never hear Sam Houston referred to as a liberal. And those of us who liked Sam Houston want to keep him on our side.In November, the 15-member elected board is set to approve new social studies materials, including books and online tools that will be used in Texas public schools for the next eight years.Publishers have spent 18 months developing their versions of world, United States and Texas history and shepherding them through rounds of expert reviews, revisions and public comments, hoping to get their texts into the Texas market.The final edit is now in the hands of a Republican-controlled board whose bruising, political battles over curriculum standards, including infighting over everything from creationism to what caused the Civil War, have previously flared into national view.In the textbook-approval process, state law limits the role of the education board to vetting instructional materials for factual errors and ensuring they meet Texas curriculum standards. But the process can still provide an opening for strong-willed board members to wield outsize influence, such as pushing to include pet historical figures or alter the presentation of politically charged topics like climate change or Islamic fundamentalism.Guidelines from the Texas Education Agency define a factual error as an objective inaccuracy or a bias so severe that it interferes with student learning. The latter category creates a large gray area, said a board member, Thomas Ratliff, Republican of Mount Pleasant.In the nebulous world of interfering with student learning, said Mr. Ratliff, whose district crosses 31 counties in Northeast Texas, when does bias become so bad that it becomes an error?Case in point, the question whether Sam Houston was a liberal. Asked by a colleague to explain how that constituted a factual error, Ms. Hardy said it was methodological.When you give a modern context to a historical event, that is a factual error in my opinion, she said. Its almost like an anachronism.The process of reviewing the more than 100 social studies products has revealed obvious mistakes like grammatical errors or incorrect answers on end-of-chapter quizzes. But more often, potential flaws have fallen into less objective territory: whether an account of the Arab-Israeli conflict strikes an appropriate balance, for example, or whether a profile of Hillary Rodham Clinton should be included in a section on American leaders.At the recent meeting, board members suggested that publishers make it clearer that Jews were the primary target of the Holocaust, add context to show that not all anti-abortion campaigners use violence and note that the bodyguards who assassinated the Indian leader Indira Gandhi were Sikhs.Another time, as food for thought, the boards chairwoman, Barbara Cargill, Republican of The Woodlands, told a publisher that while she appreciated a texts discussion of the role of religion in the French Revolution, there could be greater coverage of how it played in the American Revolution.An exchange between a board member, Ken Mercer, Republican of San Antonio, and Rhonda Haynes, a vice president for textbook publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, illustrated the challenge that publishers face.Mr. Mercer questioned whether a section on world religions included balanced coverage of the good and the bad of Islam, as required by the state curriculum standards known as the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills, or T.E.K.S.Ms. Haynes said it depended on who is defining balance. The size of a textbook and then the need to meet certain T.E.K.S., it limits opportunities to include a greater discussion, she said. To add more, we are just stuck. There is not enough room to do it.A 2011 law diluted some of the boards control over instructional materials, in part to limit the ability of members to force publishers into making last-minute changes.The law ended a requirement that any approved materials cover 100 percent of Texas curriculum standards, which curbed the boards ability to knock a textbook off the list over a few errors. It also shifted the responsibility for buying instructional materials from the state level to the local level, allowing school districts to buy products outside of the state boards recommended list.But most Texas school districts still look for the state boards seal of approval when selecting their instructional materials.The boards vetting process carries weight as an assurance that instructional materials meet a certain quality threshold, said Alicia Thomas, who has served as as an academic officer for both San Antonios North East Independent School District and the Houston school district, where she worked until 2012.It provides a foundation upon which school districts can make individual decisions, she said, adding that without the board, each school district would need to undergo that process at the local level.Board members continue to control the state curriculum standards last updated for social studies in 2010 that publishers aim to follow.The whole structure is in a way a charade, said Jacqueline Jones, the chairwoman of the history department at the University of Texas at Austin. (U.T.-Austin is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)In September, Dr. Jones delivered a detailed report to the state board identifying severe biases and omissions of fact in an American history textbook up for approval that she said encouraged ideological biases that are either outside the boundaries of established, mainstream scholarship, or just plain wrong.It was very frustrating, she said, to realize when she testified before the board in September that most of the errors were the result of publishers following curriculum standards set by the state four years ago, meaning they were unlikely to be corrected.The whole thing is very bizarre to me that people can just say we want to glorify this country, and we dont want students to dwell on unpleasant aspects of the past, she said.Such a sanitized version of history would cause students to alternate between getting cynical and being bored, she added.They know we live in a hyperpartisan society today, that there are real debates about all kinds of things, she said. For textbooks to sweep that under the rug strikes me as very odd.",2014-10-24,abortion

Rahall II has defiantly held on to his seat in a district that faults White House policy for the areas declining coal industry.,"PRINCETON, W. Va.   Pro-jobs. Pro-coal. Pro-life. Vote Republican!!! reads a prominent sign coming into town.And that ought to be the end of the story here in southern West Virginia, with its beleaguered mining industry and largely white population that fills the pews of evangelical churches on a Wednesday night as readily as on Sunday morning.The region voted overwhelmingly Republican in the presidential contest two years ago, part of the historic defection of West Virginia Democrats, who hold a 2-to-1 registration advantage, from the national party over social issues like abortion and, more recently, opposition to environmental regulation.And yet a Democratic congressman, Nick J. Rahall II, has defiantly held onto his seat here in the sparsely populated Third District, which runs from the rugged Appalachian coal fields in the west to the famed white-water rafting of the New River Gorge.First elected in 1976, Mr. Rahall has had his campaign for a 20th term, against the Republican candidate, Evan Jenkins, become one of the most ferocious House races in the country. There is a torrent of outside money, blistering ads from conservative groups supported by the billionaire Koch brothers and a contest that after nearly $14 million in spending has come down, two weeks before voting, to a tossup.While the race will not affect partisan control of the House, considered safely in Republican hands, it will make a statement about whether Democrats can survive in southern border states. The millions of dollars coursing through the inexpensive television markets of the state in Mr. Rahills contest are far more than in the race for West Virginias open Senate seat, where a Republican, Shelley Moore Capito, has taken a comfortable lead.If Mr. Rahall hangs on, it will be because his ties to voters cemented over four decades  what supporters call his brand  overcome the antipathy of West Virginians to President Obama, and especially White House energy policy that many blame for hard times in coal country.Republicans have really turned the anger at Obama and the coal issue into an organizing principle, Mr. Rahall said on Saturday during the Mercer County Democratic Party bean dinner in Princeton. I probably have the most anti-Obama district represented by a Democrat in the nation.The race is clouded with distortions from both sides. Mr. Rahall says that Mr. Jenkins would take away miners black lung benefits. Mr. Jenkins accuses Mr. Rahall of supporting a carbon tax that raised electric rates. Fact-checkers have been busy debunking both claims.Some of the antipathy of West Virginians to the White House would seem to defy economic self-interest. Mr. Rahalls district includes some of the poorest counties in the state, where reliance on food stamps, Medicaid and other federal benefits is high. All would be rolled back under budgets passed by the Houses Republican majority.The coal industrys long decline is economically complex. When Alpha Natural Resources, one of West Virginias largest coal operators, warned 1,100 employees of potential layoffs in July, it blamed a worldwide glut of coal, competition from cheaper natural gas and lower-cost coal from western basins  as well as Environmental Protection Agency regulations.But in the charged political arena, complexities fade and both sides identify a sole culprit for the industrys struggles: the administrations anti-coal regulations.Everyone knows Obama declared a war on coal. Nick Rahall stands with him, says a television ad running this month by Freedom Partners Action Fund, a group supported by Charles G. and David H. Koch.Mr. Rahall and his supporters have tried to turn the tables by attacking Mr. Jenkins wealthy backers. The Koch brothers coming in here from New York, spending millions trying to elect Evan Jenkins. Theyre not welcome, they dont belong, a miner says in an ad run by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.In a debate last week, Mr. Rahall boasted of standing up to my party to stop the overreaching, overzealous, job-killing E.P.A. agenda.It is a tough argument to win, however, given the presidents desire to leave an environmental legacy of lower carbon emissions from power plants, as proposed by the E.P.A. this year.Mr. Rahall has struggled to explain his vote in 2013 for a budget proposal by the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which included a $25 per ton carbon tax. He has said that he does not support a carbon tax and that he voted for the liberal budget blueprint, which badly failed in the House, to make a statement against Representative Paul D. Ryans Republican budget, with its many cuts to social programs. That plan passed the House but not the Senate.Mr. Jenkins, who served in the State Legislature as a Democrat before switching parties last year, does not buy it. This president has written off West Virginia, he said. Hes written off coal, and unfortunately, weve got a congressman who has helped him every step of the way.The air blitz against Mr. Rahall, 65, began nearly a year ago, almost unheard-of so early, when Republican-leaning national groups like the Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Prosperity  also supported by the Kochs  began attacking his vote for the Affordable Care Act.Democratic groups sensed trouble and jumped in to counter the attacks. We were effective in at least fighting back, said Matt Thornton, a spokesman for the House Majority PAC, citing private polls that showed Mr. Rahall rebounding in the spring.The National Republican Congressional Committee, which considers Mr. Rahall one of its top three House targets this year, has pumped more than $2 million into the race. I think this is the first time people are starting to say maybe we like Nick Rahall but we dont like what hes doing in Washington anymore, said Ian Prior, a spokesman for the Republican campaign committee.Neither side is confident of victory and ads are booked through Election Day, for a total of $13.8 million for the cycle, according to a Democratic group that tracks ad spending.On Saturday, Mr. Jenkins, 54, greeted voters at a celebration of the New River Gorge Bridge, where thousands walked across the impressive structure and watched parachutists drop 876 feet to the riverbed. Im Evan Jenkins, running for Congress, hoping for your vote, the candidate told Nindo Punturi, who was working at one of many vendor booths.Youll probably get it, Mr. Punturi replied.Kathy McGaha, a retiree, also offered support, saying she did not like Mr. Rahall. He voted for everything with O-bummer, she said.Bernard Meadows, who worked in a coal mine in Mercer County for two decades until they shut it down in the 1980s, said he knew Mr. Rahall but was leaning in a different direction. I just think its time for a change, he said.But when Mr. Jenkins approached Charles Treadway, he heard a different opinion. Ive been with Rahall for years, and Ive got to stick with Nick, said Mr. Treadway, a laid-off miner.He said Mr. Rahall was being blamed unfairly for the troubles of the coal industry. I put it simply: All youve got to do is follow the money, he said, adding that cheap natural gas prices were the reason many miners were out of work.",2014-10-24,abortion

John W. Hickenlooper and Senator Mark Udall, are in fierce re-election races, and both parties are spending millions in a state not quite red or blue.","ERIE, Colo.  To trace the border between the liberal and conservative corners of the American West, head down East County Line Road, a two-lane asphalt stripe parting the plains here in Northern Colorado.To the east lies Weld County, a conservative stronghold where 20,000 oil and gas wells pump day and night, and Republicans are so dominant that they are running unchallenged for county assessor, clerk and a commissioners seat. Fifteen miles to the west is Boulder, where a Buddhist-inspired university offers classes in yoga and the Tibetan language, and nature activists are working to carve out legal rights for ecosystems and wild species.Straddling those divisions is Erie, a town of 21,500 whose perch along County Line Road embodies the shifting politics and demographics of a Western swing state where Republicans are waging a spirited battle to reclaim power after recent years of Democratic gains. Two prominent Democrats, Gov. John W. Hickenlooper and Senator Mark Udall, are in fierce re-election fights, and both parties are spending millions to claim a bellwether win.Colorado is subjected to extremes, said Roy Romer, a former governor. Its not just blue and red. Its also urban and rural. We have a history to this.To some, the social and demographic changes that have shaded Colorado blue in recent elections are welcome. But Colorados political leanings have tilted back and forth in surprising ways since it became a state in 1876, sometimes marching in lock step with Republican ranching and mining magnates, and other times bolting to support populists or so-called Silver Republicans who detested the once-dominant gold standard.This is not a blue state, said Ted Trimpa, a lawyer and political strategist who helped to craft the Democratic rise to power in the statehouse over the past decade. This is very much an independent state, and more and more reflects where people in the rest of the country are.The contest between Mr. Udall and his Republican challenger, Representative Cory Gardner, a second-term congressman from far eastern Colorado, has become one of the most competitive and expensive Senate races in the country. It is a must-hold seat if Democrats have a shred of hope of retaining their Senate majority. For Republicans, it offers a long-sought chance to reclaim a marquee statewide office and show that they can once again win in a Western state that is growing more urban, Hispanic and socially liberal.The campaign has touched on energy drilling and the economy, President Obamas health care law and the size and role of government, but at its core has been a battle for the votes of women and Latinos. In 2010, Democrat Michael Bennet defied a nationwide Republican surge to win a Senate race here, in large part because Democrats hammered his Republican opponent on abortion and contraception. As for Latinos, they now represent 14 percent of Colorados electorate and 21 percent of its population, and while many are reliably Democratic, Republicans have been going door to door to try to sway them.Democrats are pressing their advantages with both groups in campaigning against Mr. Gardner, casting him as an anti-immigrant conservative who wants to broadly outlaw abortion. Mr. Gardner does oppose abortion, but he has tried hard to soften his conservatism and appeal to the center, saying he wants to make birth control available over the counter and no longer supports a personhood referendum that would grant legal rights to embryos.This will also be the first major election to test Colorados new all-mail voting system, in which ballots were sent to all registered voters three weeks before Election Day, ideally  in the eyes of those who proposed the change  increasing turnout. The new law, which will also allow people to register to vote up through Election Day, was approved by the Democratic-controlled legislature over loud Republican objections.A CliffhangerAnalysts say this may be the closest Senate race in the country, and so candidates are fanning out across the heavily Democratic neighborhoods of Denver, the deeply Republican suburbs of Douglas County and growing bedroom communities like Erie.Here, new homes (From the $300s!"" declare billboards) are cropping up on old pastureland, gazing out at new oil-and-gas well pads. Construction and a drilling boom have helped to pull Colorado out of the recession, pushing unemployment down to 4.7 percent and reviving tax revenue. But economists say that job growth has not kept up with the states explosive population growth.One of Eries largest employers, a gun-magazine manufacturer named Magpul, is leaving town out of disgust with new gun-control laws passed last year by Democrats. As many as 200 jobs are leaving for Texas and Wyoming. Joe Wilson, a former mayor and National Rifle Association member, said he was not upset with Magpul for leaving, but with politicians for tightening gun laws.It was nuts in a down economy to have an industry ejected from the state, he said. It shocked people.Eries partisan hues mirror the rest of the state. About 30 percent of voters here are Democrats and 32 percent are Republicans, but each party is outnumbered by independent voters. Residents say the towns politics and demographics are changing fast with the arrival of more people priced out of the Boulder area.Everybodys a transplant at this point, said Shawne Beeson, who moved here in September from the northern Denver suburb of Westminster, beckoned by good schools and affordable homes. He opened a computer-repair shop in a shopping plaza.Im just part of whats happening, he said. I think this place is going to become a lot more Boulder. As prices shift, theyre all going to come here.As a die-hard Democrat, Mr. Beeson said, living in a politically diverse town has required some concessions to civility. He said he listened politely when he disagreed with a customer, but admitted that he once snapped at a man who was fuming about this summers influx of young Central American refugees.I sort of went off the rails, he said.Growth and DiversityThe last two decades brought growth and diversity in Denver and the towns that spill eastward from the Front Range of the Rockies and cluster along Colorados two major interstates. The area is now a polyglot quilt of immigrants from East Africa, Central America and Southeast Asia. Vietnamese noodle houses line Federal Boulevard in Denver. Somali and Burmese refugees slaughter cows at the meatpacking plants outside Fort Morgan.Twenty-five years ago, Colorados population was about two-thirds the size it is today, and much whiter and more conservative. In 1991, Focus on the Family moved its headquarters to Colorado Springs, becoming a clarion voice of Christian conservatism in the national and local culture wars.On the northeastern plains, near the Nebraska border, Mr. Gardners hometown, Yuma, embodies a white, rural conservatism that is changing fast. It is a solidly Republican agricultural and ranching city where hunters arrive every autumn for pheasant season, and Mr. Gardners family still runs a farm-equipment business.In the last 30 years, though, waves of once-migrant workers from Mexicos Chihuahua State have settled here, drawn by jobs picking beets and pumpkins and working in the dairies and hog-feed lots. Latinos now make up about 40 percent of Yumas population, compared with 4 percent in 1990. Half the preschoolers and nearly half the elementary-school students in Yuma come from Spanish-speaking families, said Margo Ebersole, with the Rural Communities Resource Center.The Latino community has been growing faster by threefold than any other community in Colorado, said Jessie Ulibarri, a Democrat and one of a dozen Hispanic legislators in the state house. But cultural acceptance has not always matched demographics. People look at us and still perceive us to be perpetual foreigners, he said. I dont know how many times Ive been told by people that if I stand up for immigrants, I should go back home.Over the summer, when the push for immigration reform stalled in Washington, Hispanic activists flocked to Mr. Gardners district offices in northeastern Colorado to pressure him to vote for a comprehensive package that passed the Democrat-controlled Senate, supported by Mr. Udall. But Mr. Gardner says that granting citizenship or its benefits to millions of undocumented immigrants will only encourage more illegal immigration.Toward the southern border of the state, where the county names change from Lincoln and Custer to Huerfano and Costilla, a Republican state representative named Clarice Navarro-Ratzlaff said she believed conservative messages about small government, low taxes and family values could resonate with the states Hispanic population.As she drives across her district, Ms. Navarro-Ratzlaff said she sometimes stopped at homes with Latinos for Obama signs in the yard. She tells her story, of being a fifth-generation Coloradan who was raised by a single mother. Of how she worked nights in a pickle plant and is still paying off her college loans. She talks about how she registered as a Democrat because her mother told her to, but found a home in the Republican Party. And in a state where borders and state lines were drawn up around Hispanic families who had lived here for centuries, Ms. Navarro said the Republican message on immigration has the potential to resonate.Our Hispanic culture believes in securing our borders, she said. We want to honor the law-abiding citizens that have followed the appropriate steps to becoming an American. Democrats have used this against us, but the fact remains that illegal is illegal.Rugged CollaborationThe tourists are back in Estes Park, a summertime Brigadoon at the foot of Rocky Mountain National Park. Last September, all of this was water, mud and devastation.As the worst floods in a generation carved a $2.9 billion trail of devastation through the state, they washed out roads in Estes Park, swept homes off their foundations and wrecked the floors of Julie Piepers main-street restaurant, Mama Roses.On this diamond-clear summer day, Ms. Pieper was serving up turkey-bacon wraps and homemade potato chips to about 100 supporters who had come to see Mr. Udall. A passionate mountain climber who lives in the mountain town of Eldorado Springs, Mr. Udall completed a quest this summer to scale Colorados 100 highest peaks. He looked at home weaving through the sun-bronzed crowd, which included hikers, kayakers and Dr. Thomas F. Hornbein, a climber whose ascent up the West Ridge of Mount Everest remains one of the greatest feats of mountaineering.Mr. Udalls pitch to the crowd was rugged collaboration. He said the phrase exemplified how government agencies and nonprofits, residents and businesses worked together after the floods. People took in neighbors who had been washed out. They set up zip lines to cross torrential rivers. In a year, much of the devastation has been repaired or is well on the way.The response was spectacular, Ms. Pieper said. Ive got friends who are Republicans who support this crew because of the response.Mr. Udall has attacked Mr. Gardner for his votes during last years government shutdown, which came as flood-stricken towns remained cut off from the world and scores of families were still homeless. In Estes Park, he called it irresponsible and disqualifying, in my view, to being a United States senator.Mr. Gardner said he had pushed to find a solution to the shutdown as it dragged on for two weeks last October, and said he and Mr. Udall had worked together to get federal money for recovery here. We were in helicopters together overseeing the efforts in the days following the flood, Mr. Gardner said in an interview. It is below the office of the United States Senate to attack a member of the delegation he knows was a partner.The Udall campaign and other groups have also attacked Mr. Gardner for co-sponsoring the Life at Conception Act, a bill that would grant full legal rights to people from the moment of fertilization. It would potentially outlaw abortion at any stage and  critics contend  some forms of birth control. While Mr. Gardner said he no longer supported a similar personhood measure on the ballot this November in Colorado, he has been forced in debates and interviews to explain why he is still backing the federal bill.For Democrats, the focus on abortion is part of a strategy aimed at making Mr. Gardner appear as anti-woman as possible to voters like Ann Cerny, a pathologists assistant in Erie. She said her views on spending and government made her a Republican at her core, but that working with fetal tissue samples every day in her lab had put womens health issues front and center this election.As a woman, I want to make sure womens health care is O.K., she said. Personhood, anything with abortion  thats my job. I have to have freedom of choice. Her conclusion: I cannot vote Republican.But to Debbie Brown, a former Republican campaign manager who now leads a statewide womens group, the attention to reproductive issues is maddening. In 2010, Ms. Brown watched Democrats win 56 percent of the womens vote in the 2010 Senate race, in part by portraying Republicans as dogmatic enemies of abortion and birth control. She organized the Colorado Womens Alliance as a conservative counterweight to liberals whom she says are obsessed with reproductive politics.What else you got? she asked over coffee one rainy morning. I could care less about birth control. Its widely available, and I think thats awesome. Theres not a crisis.While Mr. Gardners campaign argues that his positions are being distorted by the Udall camp, Ms. Brown and her group are trying to change the definition of what constitutes an election-year womens issue. What about energy? she asked. What about jobs, wages and health care? In panels she has assembled, Ms. Brown said women felt that the laserlike focus on reproductive issues was a ploy for their votes.When money is so tight that your family disconnects the phone line and cable and wears sweaters to save on heating, worrying about abortion laws seems like an unaffordable luxury, said Margo Branscomb, a single mother in the southern Denver suburb of Centennial.Everybody needs to stay out of the bedroom, she said. It should be an individuals choice in all respects, whether its a wedding or all these social issues.In Erie, from behind the counter of his gold and silver shop, Levi Hatgi is watching the changes rippling through Colorado. He works with a Smith & Wesson handgun strapped to his hip, but says guns need to be kept out of certain peoples hands. He says politicians have tilted tax policies to favor big corporations over small businesses, and he knows small-business owners who have been hurt by the Affordable Health Care Act. But he says he feels alienated from Republicans because of their tight embrace of religion.It has been a year since he and his fiance, Megan Huckaby, moved to Erie, and Ms. Huckaby has drawn one firm conclusion about its place here in this battleground: Its right on the line.",2014-10-24,abortion

Im in my mid-40s, married, with teenage children and no plans to have another baby, but here I am five weeks in with an unwanted pregnancy despite using contraception. It can happen, folks. I am reaching out as every OBGYN Ive reached out to will either not do it, or give a referral. Given that its early, Id like to consider the option of nonsurgical termination via the pill, however NO doctor on the list of OBGYNS that my PCP gave me offers this service. My OBGYN doesnt, either. Im stressed, and depressed about having to do this, but it has to be done. If anyone of you can refer me to a proper doctor that provides abortion services, particularly the pill as part of their practice, please PM me. I need your help. Thank you.Its not unusual for women who consider themselves past their child-bearing years to become pregnant and realize, no matter what their ultimate choice, that theyre unprepared to even consider the matter. Few women talk about inadvertent pregnancy once theyre beyond their teens and 20s. A woman may have left the medical practice that served her when her children were born years ago, shifting to a more general health care provider, or may not even have a regular doctor. A phone call to a medical office inquiring about abortion services from an unknown potential client is likely, for many reasons, to be met with caution at best. It is difficult, especially given whats going on in terms of restricting access to abortion, to find a provider, said Dr. Vanessa Cullins, vice president of external medical affairs for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. We dont talk about abortion and how to access it in a concrete way, especially once youre of an age when youre not thinking about it anymore.While few OBGYNs in private practice offer abortion services, most will refer you out, Dr. Cullins said, not just throw you to the winds to find out on your own. But in the absence of a professional willing to help, she suggested two websites: PlannedParenthood.org and prochoice.org, both of which offer location-based listings of providers offering safe abortion services or nonjudgmental advice about the decision to terminate a pregnancy or continue it.  The listings arent comprehensive and include only members (in the case of prochoice.org, the website of the National Abortion Federation) or Planned Parenthood offices, but offer a good place to start, and women in need of abortion services should move quickly. The safest abortion is an early abortion, she said, which is one reason this information should be readily available.Dr. Cullins cautions against web searches for abortion provider, which can lead to groups focused on preventing abortion (often called Pregnancy Crisis Centers) rather than providing it. Most providers will readily state on their website or over the phone whether they offer medical (prescription medication) or surgical abortions or both, and will describe the process and fee structure. Women may also find links to organizations purporting to offer online prescriptions for medical abortions. Schemes abound, and even assuming that the medication delivered is genuine, there are real legal risks.  Women with an established relationship with a caregiver may be more readily able to obtain advice and referrals, and should approach the matter directly with their doctor, nurse or midwife  another reason to work to maintain a regular health care provider, which many women neglect once the intense pregnancypost-birth periods have ended, especially if they use a birth control method that doesnt require an annual renewal (and thus a visit). In an ideal situation, a woman will be able to seek, and receive, the care she needs from her own doctor. Absent that, this information offers one place to start.",2014-10-22,abortion

The $3.5 million it is spending on it is more than one-third of the $9.5 million that the group has spent in the state since Labor Day.

Andrew Cuomo has used his formidable political skills to achieve major advances for New York. He pressured and ultimately persuaded some Republican legislators to allow same-sex marriage in the state in 2011. That provided momentum for marriage equality nationally and changed many lives for the better. At least 30,000 same-sex couples have celebrated legal marriages in the state since the law changed.He pushed through the strongest gun-control measure in the country after the mass killing of schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. The new law expanded the ban on automatic weapons and big ammunition magazines and requires background checks for private gun sales, changes that are an improvement to public safety. Many voters upstate have anti-Cuomo bumper stickers and lawn signs registering their anger at the gun control bill. These are badges of political courage for Mr. Cuomo.His budgets have been on time, and though his tax policies have favored the wealthy, he managed to get higher credit ratings for the state for the first time in decades.While The Timess editorial board chose not to make an endorsement in the Democratic primary in September, we recommend Mr. Cuomo for re-election on the basis of these achievements. His Republican challenger, Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive, does not have broad experience and, on many issues, is out of step with most New Yorkers and the needs of this state.The decision not to endorse in the primary between Mr. Cuomo and his challenger, Zephyr Teachout, a national expert on political corruption and campaign reforms, reflected our disappointment with Mr. Cuomos failure to make good on his promise  made four years ago  to clean up Albany. It is our hope that, if Mr. Cuomo is elected to a second term, he will devote the next four years to achieving genuine, meaningful reform of Albanys political culture, which remains mired in corruption.His first order of business should be to use his political muscle to change the sham campaign finance laws that have turned Albany into a place that best serves moneyed interests and the politicians in hock to them.That means reducing contribution limits to candidates; ending unlimited donations to party housekeeping accounts; and prohibiting contributions from limited liability corporations, which are used by corporations and individuals to give essentially unlimited amounts of money to candidates. And the most crucial reform is public financing for campaigns  the best way to inject competition into legislative races now almost controlled entirely by incumbents.Mr. Cuomo himself has benefited from lax rules that have allowed him to raise nearly half of the $45 million for his campaign mostly from the developers and lobbyists giving $40,000 or more. Mr. Cuomo has said that while he supports reforms, the Legislature refuses to play ball. He could set a decent example for Albany lawmakers by refusing to take tainted, albeit legal, pots of money himself. That might allow him to shame the Legislature into acting; now, lawmakers can point to his finances and jeer. Reforming his own practices might also help restore his reputation after his sudden shutdown of the anti-corruption Moreland Commission, which had started looking into issues that may have involved his political supporters. A United States attorney has now taken up that work.Another major disappointment was Mr. Cuomos failure to veto redistricting maps in 2012. Those maps were designed by legislators to thwart competition and harden the status quo in Albany. A state constitutional amendment on the November ballot  Proposal One on revising the states redistricting procedure  would undoubtedly make things worse. Mr. Cuomo should stop pushing for this deeply flawed measure.Mr. Cuomos Republican opponent, Mr. Astorino, has not shown that he is ready to take over such a large and diverse state. He was re-elected in 2013 to a second term as executive of Westchester County, a relatively wealthy swath of suburban New York City. He is against abortion rights, and he has said that he wants to weaken the Cuomo gun-control law. His tax policies would provide even more rewards for the wealthy than Mr. Cuomos. His continuing attempts to fight a 2009 court order to end segregation patterns in zoning have resulted in the loss of millions of federal dollars to his community. Mr. Astorino also wants to get rid of the Common Core education standards, a crucial effort to improve academics across the state. That would be another mistake.Another candidate, Howie Hawkins of the Green Party, is a dedicated environmentalist who wants a minimum wage of $15 an hour and free tuition to state colleges, among other progressive proposals. His candidacy is unrealistic, but his ambitious ideas are useful goads to the governor from the left.Mr. Cuomo has proposed a new list of campaign promises, including an infrastructure bank that would use some of the money from recent bank settlements and other sources to help repair bridges or other facilities around the state. If done right, that bank could help with another promise to transform LaGuardia Airport, other state airports and transit facilities in the New York City area.Mr. Cuomo promises that he would push the Legislature to pass the entire Womens Equality Act. It includes pay equity, tougher human trafficking laws and stronger state protections for abortion rights. He wants to expand cooperation between businesses that need skilled workers and the states education system. He vows to fight to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour and pass an expanded Dream Act to allow immigrants to apply for tuition assistance at state colleges. And he says he would seek public financing of all statewide and legislative races as part of extensive campaign finance reforms.For those reasons, despite our criticisms, we support Mr. Cuomo for re-election. He is a strong governor who has shown he can end legislative inertia when it suits him. He needs to use those powers to clean up New York States government.",2014-10-21,abortion

In his interview with Robin Roberts, he said he thought the issue would, and should be, worked out at the local level, thus implicitly denying that marriage was a constitutionally protected right.It would appear he has evolved again. In theOct. 27issue of The New Yorker, Jeffrey Toobin reveals that the president has dropped his federalist stance.Ultimately, I think the Equal Protection Clause does guarantee same-sex marriage in all fifty states, the president told Mr. Toobin. The Obama administration has not yet made this argument before the Supreme Court. If a circuit court rules against marriage equality and the Supreme Court decides to take up this issue, it will have the opportunity to do so.Despite the presidents14thamendment argument, his conversation with Mr. Toobin may annoy some in the community fighting for marriage equality. Over the last several years there has been a split between those who want the Supreme Court to move slowly on addressing the constitutional question  to avoid a repeat of the Roe v. Wade decision, which arguably made abortion rights more controversial  and those who think that no delay could possibly be justified.Mr. Obama is an incrementalist. As you know, he told Mr. Toobin, courts have always been strategic. There have been times where the stars were aligned and the Court, like a thunderbolt, issues a ruling like Brown v. Board of Education, but thats pretty rare. And, given the direction of society, for the Court to have allowed the process to play out the way it has may make the shift less controversial and more lasting.",2014-10-20,abortion

Paul R. LePage, a tough-talking Republican, is seeking a second term in a state known for electing moderates and independents.","WATERVILLE, Me.  In a state with a long tradition of electing moderates and independents, Gov. Paul R. LePage, a fierce partisan, is definitely a departure.With Tea Party backing, he burst onto the scene in 2010 breathing anti-welfare fire, bludgeoning Democrats and bristling with unapologetic comments that bordered on the profane.A former millworker with a back story out of Dickens  the oldest of 18 children of an abusive, alcoholic father, he ran away from home at 11  Mr. LePage, 66, has earned his share of admirers.A majority of voters, however, did not want him as governor in the first place. Yet he could win another term in November  again without a majority.In 2010, Mr. LePage, a Republican, squeaked into office with 38 percent of the vote against two major candidates. Now, after four turbulent years, polls show him at about that same level as he again faces two challengers who have divided the forces against him.But his task this year appears harder.His Democratic opponent, Representative Michael H. Michaud, 59, a six-term congressman and former president of the State Senate, is much better positioned than the Democratic nominee in 2010.Mr. Michaud (whose name has been pronounced as both MeSHOW and MeSHOO; he has no preference) enjoys the support of national Democrats, unions and environmentalists. (President Obama, still more popular than unpopular among Democrats here, is stumping for him this month.) Mr. Michaud is a former millworker as well, but unlike the governor, he did not attend college. If elected, he would become the countrys first governor who is openly gay.Mr. Michaud and Mr. LePage are in a tight race, according to a University of New Hampshire poll conducted last month for The Portland Press Herald, with Mr. Michaud at 40 percent and Mr. LePage at 38 percent.Working in Mr. LePages favor again this year is the presence of a third candidate, Eliot Cutler, an independent. Mr. Cutler, 68, a wealthy lawyer and businessman, ran against Mr. LePage in 2010 and nearly beat him, with 36 percent of the vote. This time, Mr. Cutler trails in third place  partly because of Democratic resolve to unite behind Mr. Michaud  but he still diffuses the anti-LePage vote.The higher Mr. Cutler climbs in the polls, analysts say, the more likely he is to siphon votes from Mr. Michaud and hand the election to Mr. LePage. If Mr. Cutler were not in the race, the University of New Hampshire poll showed, Mr. Michaud would lead Mr. LePage 50 percent to 44 percent.In other words, Mr. LePage needs Mr. Cutler. This dynamic is shaping the race and has been evident at the three debates held so far. An animated Mr. LePage, something of a ham on stage, has nodded and smiled at many of Mr. Cutlers comments while shaking his head in exasperation at many of Mr. Michauds. Mr. LePage and Mr. Cutler have even exchanged high-fives, prompting Democrats to call their unlikely relationship a bromance.The crosscurrents can be confusing to voters. Nate Blair, 28, a hotel manager here, said he was leaning toward Mr. Michaud but wanted to hear what Cutler has to say. He will not vote for Mr. LePage (He makes Maine look uneducated) but worries that a vote for Mr. Cutler is a vote for Mr. LePage.Some analysts say fostering such confusion is Mr. LePages goal. Theres an attempt to create a certain degree of chaos so that anti-LePage voters who havent gone to Cutler yet will say that Michaud cant win and will move to Cutler, said Amy Fried, a political scientist at the University of Maine.A crafty Mr. LePage played into this dynamic last week at a debate in Augusta. Given a chance to question his opponents, Mr. LePage had Mr. Cutler acknowledge that Democratic leaders had asked him to be their candidate before they went to Mr. Michaud. The state party chairman, Ben Grant, has said however that he never asked Mr. Cutler to be the nominee.Whatever the strategy, the barrel-chested Mr. LePage, who evokes Broderick Crawford, the actor who played a Huey Long-like politician in the film All the Kings Men, has dominated Maine politics for the last four years.He boasts of enacting the largest tax cut in Maine history, paying off $500 million that the state owed to hospitals and helping the private sector create 22,000 jobs. The centerpiece of his candidacy is his visceral opposition to welfare, especially those who take advantage of the system. He has placed a five-year cap on some welfare benefits, leading to a 41 percent reduction in welfare cases.But he is best known for making inflammatory remarks. As your governor, he declared during the 2010 campaign, youre going to be seeing a lot of me on the front page, saying, Governor LePage tells Obama to go to hell.  He has compared the Internal Revenue Service to the Gestapo. Most infamously, when members of the N.A.A.C.P. complained of his skipping a ceremony for Martin Luther Kings Birthday, he told reporters, Tell them to kiss my butt.At one debate, Mr. LePage explained his most incendiary comments by saying he had uttered them in his first two years as governor. So even a Frenchman can be taught to cool down, he said, drawing laughter from the audience.His campaign portrays his bluntness as a virtue. Voters in one television ad praise him as brutally honest and extremely candid.Mr. LePage sees himself as having an executive personality, with little patience for political niceties.Im not the best and most polished politician, he said at a debate in Portland. In fact I hate the word politician. I prefer the word businessman, because thats what Ive done my whole career, and I believe my actions speak for themselves.Mr. Michaud has framed his campaign as a referendum on Mr. LePage, who he says has hurt the state and damaged its reputation.People are fed up, Mr. Michaud said. Theyre tired of the divisiveness, the partisanship and the failed policy of this administration.Mr. LePage vetoed five separate bills to expand Medicaid coverage, and he cut existing Medicaid coverage for nearly 38,000 people. Maine is one of only two states (with New Jersey) where the number of people without health insurance has increased. And last year, Forbes ranked Maine as the worst state for doing business for the fourth straight year.Mr. Michaud has represented the conservative Second Congressional District in rural northern Maine since 2003. His votes earned him high marks from the National Rifle Association and the enmity of abortion-rights groups. But he says he has evolved on abortion, and he now has the backing of abortion-rights groups. That move  and his coming out last year as gay  was seen as helpful in more liberal southern Maine.Mr. LePage paints Mr. Michaud as an old-line Democrat and backbencher in Congress who has accomplished little. Its so easy to work across party lines when you do nothing, Mr. LePage snapped at a debate.Mr. Cutler blames both parties for Maines economic nose dive and says the state is being run like a 5-year-old runs a lemonade stand.But he has become more critical of Mr. Michaud, attacking him at the debate in Augusta for suggesting that his votes against abortion rights came in the distant past.Im glad Mike has evolved, but hes not being honest, Mr. Cutler said. He cast those votes when he was 24, 34, 44 and even 54. It took him 30 years to evolve.All this has left Mr. Cutlers supporters and some Michaud supporters in a difficult position, toggling between a sense that Mr. Cutler might make a better governor but that only Mr. Michaud can beat Mr. LePage.Edward J. Suslovic, a Portland city councilman who backs Mr. Cutler, said he was getting pressure from fellow Democrats to switch to Mr. Michaud. But privately, they acknowledge that Eliot is smarter and he has a more developed plan to get Maine out of the economic doldrums, Mr. Suslovic said.Mr. Michaud said in an interview that he expected Mr. Cutlers backers to move his way. Some tell me they feel obligated to him, but if it looks like he cant win, theyll support me, he said.Not so fast, said Mr. Cutler. He has suggested that if his support has not surged in the polls by late October, he might release his supporters. In an interview, Mr. Cutler did not slam the door on that option, but he sounded like a candidate who was in the contest to stay, asserting: I dont have any intention at all of getting out of this race.",2014-10-19,abortion

Voting was your own business, a government-sanctioned secret. I was told that no one would ever ask me whom I voted for, and if for some reason of ignorance or terrible manners they did ask, I didnt have to tell. The notion that I got to choose the person who ran the country (a minor misconception of how voting worked) without admitting that I was the one who had done it appealed to me greatly.Say so long to secrets. Now we wear our voting intentions across our chests and on our bumpers. We assert our political selves in every aspect of social media. I know who everybody  my friends, my neighbors, my movie stars  is voting for. Life would be so much more peaceful if I didnt. Eventually, what I considered to be a better part of my character was worn down by this barrage of self-expression. In 2008, I had a pin on my book bag that read, My Mama Votes Obama, thus outing both my mother and myself. Not that I needed the button; I drive a Prius.If you feel its presumptuous to guess peoples voting record by looking at their cars, go straight to the irrefutable evidence and look in their yards. Where I live, the lawns bristle with campaign signs. People on corner lots often opt for oversize signs on wooden bases that must be delivered by flatbed truck, while those who live midblock content themselves with three or four identical signs so that you will not only know whom theyre voting for but also the strength of their convictions.So convinced are some in the power of their message that they campaign not only to undecided voters, but also to undecided candidates. Perhaps they imagine Jeb Bush or Elizabeth Warren will walk down their street, see their own name in the shrubbery, and think, Well, if its important enough for that person to put up a yard sign then maybe I should just go for it!Those signs remain through the seasons, pelted by sprinklers, baked by the sun, buried beneath leaves, encrusted in ice, until finally the boys from the prep school down the street jump up and down on them in the middle of the night after a football game. Trust me, Ive seen it.Tennessee has voted for Republican presidential candidates since Bill Clinton left office. Nashville, the states capital, leans slightly Democratic, not that it does anybody any good. Our next-door neighbor bucked this trend in 2008 with a profusion of Sarah Palin signs, the ones with the big smack of red lipstick. Our houses are close together, and our neighbor owns a foot of grass on our side of his driveway. We water that strip of grass and mow it and aerate the soil, but he owns it, which is why he could put one of those lipstick signs on it, making it look for all the world like his affection for Governor Palin was our affection for Governor Palin.Were voting for McCain now? my husband asked, after coming home from work.Like the prep school boys, I waited until the middle of the night and then moved the sign to the other side of my neighbors driveway. There it stayed, never mentioned, while the neighbor and I continued to nod to each other politely on evening walks. I looked forward to the end of that particular political season for a million different reasons, but especially because I wanted never to have to look at those red lips again.I dont know who relies on yard signs to choose their president, but I will admit I sometimes rely on them for less consequential elections. Our recent primary for the 2014 midterm was such small potatoes I was feeling too lazy to bother voting. My neighbors, involved citizens every one, had signs declaring their intentions in State Senate races, State House races, the office of county clerk and a school board seat. I looked at the names in befuddlement. A barrage of robocalls came in from morning until night, and on the weekends the candidates themselves knocked on our doors.FRANKLY the Democrats all sounded more or less alike. I was more interested in the Republican primary. Our two-term senior United States senator, Lamar Alexander, whose moderate nature I often admire, was being hounded by a Tea Party candidate. But because I am a registered Democrat, I would have had to request a separate ballot to vote for him. There was also a hot Republican primary race in the Fourth Congressional District (not mine). The incumbent, Scott DesJarlais, a physician who had vocally opposed abortion rights and same-sex marriage, was found to have supported his ex-wifes two abortions and tried to pressure his mistress into having one as well. (He still ended up winning the primary with a margin of 38 votes out of nearly 70,000 cast.)So I decided not to vote in the primary. I would show up for the midterm election in November; surely that would be enough. I tried not to think about the fact that I was giving up a privilege others had fought for  a privilege that black men didnt have in this country until 1870, nor women until 1920, nor the very poor until the 24th Amendment abolished the poll tax in 1964.Thankfully, an article in the newspaper changed my mind. Three sitting State Supreme Court justices, appointed by Tennessees former Democratic governor, could be ousted in part as a result of an initiative funded by Americans for Prosperity, the conservative political advocacy group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers. Just when I thought it was safe to nap through a little local primary election, I was reminded that enjoying democracy meant getting off the sofa.After dinner, my husband and I walked the three blocks to our polling place at the fire station in a light summer rain. I knew how to vote for the justices, but the school board still stumped me. I will admit I was leaning heavily on my neighbors yard signs. Up and down the street, the signs were divided equally between Becky Sharpe and Mary Pierce. I had read the handouts each candidate left at our door and they both seemed like good choices.Outside the fire station, three people holding signs stood the prescribed 500 feet from the door. Among them was our most politically active neighbor, with a sign for John Ray Clemmons, a candidate for state representative. I have enough civic passion to go and vote in the rain, but I doubt Ill ever have enough civic passion to hold a sign outside a voting precinct in the rain. Another man also had a Clemmons sign, and beside him was a man with a sign that said Becky Sharpe. Since I so easily could have been swayed in one direction or the other where the school board was concerned, I decided to cast my vote for the woman who so nearly shared her name with Thackerays antihero in Vanity Fair. I believe that more important votes have been cast on less rationale than that.The fire station was empty except for a few dedicated poll workers. They explained that the ballot was long and complicated and that we should take our time. Standing not too far from my husband, I went to work. There was one group of names that were completely unfamiliar me, and since there was no curtain between us, and no one else there voting, I asked him for help.No, he whispered sharply. Vote for yourself. I realized then if we had gone to high school together he never would have let me cheat off his test.I skipped that question, but I did O.K. on the rest. I voted to keep the justices, and the justices, I am pleased to report, remain in their jobs. I put my I voted sticker on my shirt and thanked the poll workers for their help. We would all be back for the November election. I experienced a familiar rush of good civic feeling.Voting is like brickwork  the trick is to keep at it every election season, laying brick after brick. Not just the presidential elections. The midterms. The primaries. Because if you miss one, the whole thing starts to slide.I said good night to my neighbor who was still standing outside in the drizzle. My husband stopped to ask the man with the Becky Sharpe sign if he actually knew Becky Sharpe, though I figured he must. No one would stand in the rain with a sign for a school board candidate unless he knew that person.Shes my wife, the man said.Becky Sharpe lost.",2014-10-19,abortion
