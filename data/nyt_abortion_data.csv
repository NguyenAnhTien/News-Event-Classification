Very carefully.Of all the well-loved seasonal spices, nutmeg stands out for its long and slightly twisted history. In the Middle Ages, it was used to end unwanted pregnancies. More recently, desperate prisoners embraced it as a rather miserable drug substitute. So, on occasion, have teenagers, some of whom wound up at poison control centers. A couple of years ago, a man in Sweden claimed that nutmeg had induced him to spit at strangers on the street.  Its not that nutmeg cases are that common, said Leon Gussow, an Illinois toxicologist who publishes a blog for professionals called The Poison Review. But toxicologists do recognize it as one of the more interesting spices in the kitchen. As Dr. Gussow noted recently in Emergency Medicine News, awareness of the spices poisonous and exotic side effects has been around for some time. Nutmeg is the seed of an evergreen tree, Myristica fragrans, native to Indonesia although now cultivated widely. The spice mace comes from a thin protective layer that encloses that seed. The spice trade first brought nutmeg to Europe in the 12th century, where it rapidly gained a reputation as a seed of unusual potency, strong enough to fight infection (including the Black Plague), stimulating enough to bring on menstruation, poisonous enough to induce an abortion. It also earned shady credentials for inducing a kind of hazy, druglike high that could include hallucinations.The effect was potent enough that nutmeg mythology eventually became part of prison culture, even into modern times. In the 1965 book, The Autobiography of Malcolm X, the activist describes purchasing it from inmates in a South Carolina prison, concealed in matchboxes, and stirring it into water. A penny matchbox full of nutmeg had the kick of three or four reefers, he wrote. Toxicologists say that description is somewhat misleading, an overly romantic account of nutmegs generally unpleasant effects. It takes a fair amount of nutmeg  two tablespoons or more  before people start exhibiting symptoms. These can include an out-of-body sensation, but the most common are intense nausea, dizziness, extreme dry mouth, and a lingering slowdown of normal brain function. Dr. Gussow said nutmeg experimenters have compared it to a two-day hangover.People have told me that it feels like you are encased in mud, said Dr. Edward Boyer, professor of emergency medicine and chief of the division of medical toxicology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Youre not exactly comatose, but you feel really sluggish.  And your remembrance of events during this time period is incomplete at best.The main chemical culprit in nutmeg is called myristicin which forms naturally in the seeds (and in other plants, occurring in trace amounts in carrots). Myristicin belongs to a family of compounds with psychoactive potential that occasionally are used to make much stronger psychotropic drugs. It has been included in recipes for MMDA. And it is chemically related to another compound, safrole, also found in nutmeg, which is sometimes used in the synthesis of the street drug Ecstasy. Of course, this doesnt mean that the natural compound acts like these synthetic drugs. But  a junior chemist might think that you are going to end up with a similar effect, Dr. Boyer said. And he suspects that is one reason many of the poisoning cases seen in the United States involve teenage home experiments. Still, nutmeg incidents are rare  at least, those reported to the authorities. We do see a few pediatric cases where parents left an open spice jar where a child could reach it, said Dr. Patrick Lank, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University. Dr. Lank was a co-author of a recent paper tracking 10 years of nutmeg poisoning, as reported to Illinois poison control centers. The authors discovered 32 cases in a 10-year period; 17 were accidental and 15 were deliberate. Of the deliberate cases, most involved young people between the ages of 15 and 20 who were mixing nutmeg with pharmaceuticals. Of that group, one had such a bad reaction that he ended up on a ventilator.Adolescents can have really bad effects when they mix nutmeg with other things, Dr. Lank warned.  A study in California, tracking 119 incidents involving nutmeg from 1997 to 2008, reached a similar conclusion, although the authors found a higher level of deliberate abuse.  In that case, 72.3 percent of the poisoning cases involved intentional use.Abusers were significantly more likely to require medical evaluation than non-abusers, the authors noted. But, as with the Illinois study, they reported no fatalities. Dr. Boyer said he has seen just two cases of nutmeg poisoning that required hospitalization in 15 years, and both of those were teenagers looking for a high. They recovered more slowly than we expected, and then the nutmeg story crept out, he said.  The rarity of the cases means that even though nutmeg information is available online, there is enough information about the negative effects that most people appear to avoid it anyway.  Its clear that the stories on the Internet have not led to large numbers of nutmeg abusers turning up in emergency rooms, Dr. Boyer noted.The usual holiday samplings of nutmeg  the dusting on eggnog or a cocktail, the quarter-teaspoon sprinkle that goes into a pie or cake  is not a risk to revelers. In those doses, the woodsy, sweet flavor should simply be enjoyed. ",2014-11-25,abortion

She was 65.Her death was confirmed by her spouse, Minnie Bruce Pratt, who said in a written statement that the cause was complications from multiple tick-borne co-infections, including Lyme disease.Feinberg, who resisted being called Ms. or any other gender-specific honorific, wrote fiercely and furiously on behalf of those she saw as oppressed because of their sexual, ethnic, racial or other identities. A longtime member of the Workers World Party, a Marxist-Leninist group, and a prolific journalist for its newspaper, she wrote a 120-part series, from 2004 to 2008, explicating the role of socialism in the history of gender politics.Feinberg was an advocate for minorities and for the poor, as well as for gay men and lesbians and others who identified as transgender  an umbrella term, distinct from transsexual, that describes people whose life experience straddles the line between male and female and between masculine and feminine.She herself was biologically a woman but presented outwardly as male  and sometimes passed as a man for reasons of safety, a friend, Julie Enszer, said in an interview. Feinberg, in referring to herself, used the pronouns ze (for she) and hir (for her), though she often said pronoun usage was frequently a matter of context.I am female-bodied, I am a butch lesbian, a transgender lesbian  referring to me as sheher is appropriate, particularly in a non-trans setting in which referring to me as he would appear to resolve the social contradiction between my birth sex and gender expression and render my transgender expression invisible, she explained in a 2006 interview with Camp, a publication in Kansas City, Mo., aimed at gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people and their supporters.I like the gender neutral pronoun zehir,  she continued, because it makes it impossible to hold on to gendersexsexuality assumptions about a person youre about to meet or youve just met. And in an all trans setting, referring to me as hehim honors my gender expression in the same way that referring to my sister drag queens as sheher does.Feinbergs books included two nonfiction studies of gender issues, Transgender Warriors: Making History From Joan of Arc to Dennis Rodman and Trans Liberation: Beyond Pink or Blue, and a second novel, Drag King.But her best-known and most influential work was Stone Butch Blues, a coming-of-age novel, drawn at least partly from her own life, about a young person, born female, who grows into adulthood at odds with her own family and comes to grips with her complicated, unconventional sexual and gender identity at a time when practicing a so-called alternative lifestyle invited stigma, open discrimination and, in many settings, menacing opprobrium.They cuffed my hands so tight I almost cried out, the protagonist, Jess Goldberg, writes in a letter to a former lover, describing a night the police raided a club they were in together. Then the cop unzipped his pants real slow, with a smirk on his face, and ordered me down on my knees. First I thought to myself, I cant! Then I said out loud to myself and to you and to him, I wont! I never told you this before but something changed inside of me at that moment. I learned the difference between what I cant do and what I refuse to do.Leslie Feinberg was born on Sept. 1, 1949, in Kansas City and grew up in Buffalo. Her family was hostile to her sexuality and gender expression, and she left home as a teenager, rejecting them as well.According to a biographical statement supplied by her spouse, Feinberg earned a living mostly in temporary low-wage jobs, including washing dishes, working in a book bindery, cleaning out ship cargo holds and interpreting sign language.In addition to writing, she pursued many causes as an activist. In 1974, she organized a march against racism in Boston after white supremacists had attacked blacks there. She helped rally support for AIDS patients and those at risk in the early days of the disease. A longtime advocate for womens reproductive rights, she returned to Buffalo to work for that cause in 1998, after an abortion provider, Dr. Barnett Slepian, was murdered in his home near there.In addition to Pratt, a poet and activist, Feinberg is survived by an extended family of choice, according to the statement provided by her spouse. She identified as an antiracist white, working-class, secular Jewish, transgender, lesbian, female revolutionary communist, the statement said.In an essay after Feinbergs death, Shauna Miller, a writer and editor who contributes to The Atlantic, wrote on the magazines website that Stone Butch Blues was the heartbreaking holy grail of butch perspective, a book that was instrumental in her coming to terms with her own sexual and gender identity. The novel, which has been translated into several languages including Chinese and Slovenian, changed queer history, she wrote.It changed trans history. It changed dyke history. And how it did that was by honestly telling a brutally real, beautifully vulnerable and messy personal story of a butch lesbian.",2014-11-25,abortion
