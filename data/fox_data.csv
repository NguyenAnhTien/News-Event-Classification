Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/10/31/largely-ignored-ballot-measures-across-us-could-impact-latinos/,"Along with hundreds  maybe even thousands  of candidates fighting to get themselves elected to political offices across the country there are more than 140 ballot initiatives that are being decided on Tuesday All of them asking voters to take sides on issues as varied as drivers cards for undocumented immigrants in Oregon and raising the minimum wage in Arkansas to recreational marijuana and stricter gun laws That is actually a very low number of ballot measures down from nearly 190 in 2012 But that doesnt mean that there isnt a lot at stake both in terms of important issues as well as money spent by itself one California ballot measure Proposition 45 which would allow the states insurance commissioner to intercede in conflicts over health insurance rate hikes has drawn more than 50 million in spending by outside groups A number of those ballot initiatives could have a direct impact on the lives of Latinos and this has politicians activists political action committees and voter organizations on all sides hoping to win over this key demographic There are less ballot initiatives this year but the ones that are on the ballot are very important Justine Sarver executive director of the Ballot Imitative Strategy Center told Fox News Latino The Latino voting population is not huge in a lot of these states but it is still very important The ballot initiative in Oregon  the Alternative Driver Licenses Referendum  is probably the one that could most directly affect the lives of Latinos The measure is a citizens veto referendum on State Bill 833 a bill passed in 2013 by the Oregon Legislature which grants official driver IDs to people who cannot prove legal presence in the US  Justine Sarver executive director of the Ballot Imitative Strategy Center The proposal has enflamed sentiments on both sides of the immigration debate Trying to make life easier for these people here illegally just makes me ashamed and embarrassed that that our government supports this measure Cynthia Kendoll a campaign manager for Protect Oregon Driver Licenses told FNL Kendoll and other opponents of granting government identity cards to undocumented immigrants and others who cant prove theyre in the country legally is that theres no way to prove the people who apply for the cards are who they claim to be  making the system ripe for corruption This is one of the most fraudriddled documents in the nation Kendoll said of SB 833 Weve got a pervasive culture of corruption where we pick which laws apply to whom and how to enforce them Supporters counter that these documents help keep roads safer as people who may have been driving without insurance or a licensewill go through the training process and be more accountable The measure makes sense because it makes drivers know the rules of the road and it is not a proxy for immigration laws Becky Straus legislative director of the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU of Oregon told FNL It has nothing to do with immigration but instead its about drivers safety and civil liberties Oregons 60 Driver and Motor Vehicle Services offices could begin issuing driver cards in as little as 30 days if the initiative passes Recent polling data suggests the majority of likely voters are leaning toward vetoing SB 833 Oregon would become one of 12 states in the US to allow drivers cards for undocumented immigrants while only two states  Arizona and Nebraska  deny drivers license to young people granted protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA program Illinois also has a number of proposals on the ballot in this years elections including a nonbinding question about raising the minimum wage in the state but the most pressing for Latinos in the state is the Right to Vote amendment Proponents and adversaries of the initiative alike have suggested that the amendment is at least in part meant to discourage a controversial voter identification card like that being used in Texas but the main thrust of the proposal is to ensure that no person is denied the right to vote based on race sex color ethnicity as well as a host of other factors When Illinois state Senate voted back to put the amendment up for vote in November the move was widely praised by Democrats who claim that proof of citizenship measures unfairly disenfranchise lowincome people  often Democrats  who dont have IDs or the money to acquire them No voter should have to face the suppression tactics that we see in other states across the nation Democratic Gov Pat Quinn said in a prepared statement as he encouraged voter approval earlier this year The US Supreme Court said last week that Texas can use its controversial new voter identification law this election A majority of the justices rejected an emergency request from the Justice Department and civil rights groups to prohibit the state from requiring voters to produce certain forms of photo identification in order to cast ballots Democrats in Illinois including the bills sponsor Sen Kwame Raoul have not denied the fact that the Right to Vote amendment is an attempt to dissuade any implementation of voter ID laws It is definitely definitely intended to discourage voter ID laws Raoul said If you cast a vote for this you are casting a vote against voter ID laws For the amendment to go into effect it would need to garner the approval from either 35 of the people who vote solely on the question or a majority of all people voting in the election Some of the other measures that are piquing interest across the nation deal with issues like birth control gun ownership and the legalization of marijuana In Colorado a personhood amendment would add fetuses to those protected by the states criminal and wrongful death act Opponents say it would effectively ban abortions In North Dakota Measure 1 would provide the inalienable right to life for humans at any stage of development Supporters and opponents differ on what impact it might have on abortion regulations Voters in Oregon Alaska and the District of Columbia all have the chance to legalize the recreational use of marijuana by adults a step already taken two years ago by voters in Colorado and Washington state A measure in the Latinocentric state of Florida would legalize medical marijuana use Washington state has two competing gunrelated measures on its ballot with one pursuing background checks for all gun sales and transfers including private transactions and another that would prevent any such requirement involving purchases from private sellers The Associated Press contributed to this report  Follow Andrew OReilly on Twitter aoreilly84 Follow us on

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/09/26/pot-legalization-measure-exposes-califs-conflicted-relationship-drug/,SAN FRANCISCO  California has a long history of defying conventional wisdom on the issue of marijuana including its embrace of the drug in the 1960s and its landmark medical pot law 14 years ago So it may not be all that surprising that a November ballot measure to legalize the drug has created some odd alliances and scenarios Pot growers have opposed it Some police have favored it Polls show the public is deeply divided Only politicians have lined up as expected Nearly all major party candidates oppose the measure And hanging over the whole debate is the fact that marijuana remains illegal under federal law     As the Nov 2 election nears Proposition 19 has become about much more than the pros and cons of the drug itself The campaigns have framed the vote as a referendum on everything from jobs and taxes to crime and the environment The measure gained ground in a Field Poll released Sunday pulling ahead 49 percent to 42 percent among likely voters The poll also found that Californians have become steadily more permissive toward the drug since pollsters began quizzing state residents about their attitudes 40 years ago Proponents say the measure is a way for the struggling state and its cities to raise badly needed funds A legal pot industry they say would create jobs while undercutting violent criminals who profit off the illegal trade in the drug I think its a golden opportunity for California voters to strike a real blow against the Mexican drug cartels and drug gangs said Joseph McNamara who served as San Joses police chief for about 15 years That would be a greater blow than we ever struck during my 35 years in law enforcement Supporters including a group of former and current law enforcement officials have called attention to the failure of the socalled War on Drugs to put a dent in pot production in California and they say police need to pursue more dangerous crimes To pull ahead opponents will have to convince voters that legalized marijuana will create a greater public safety threat than keeping it illegal If the price drops more people are going to buy it Lowincome people are going to buy marijuana instead of buying food which happens with substance abusers said Pleasant Hill police Chief Pete Dunbar who also speaks for the California Police Chiefs Association one of many law enforcement groups against the measure As a result he said legalizing marijuana would only encourage the cycle of theft and violence driven by people who need money to buy drugs Opponents of Proposition 19 argue that the wording of the proposed law would compromise public safety by gutting restrictions on driving and going to work while high The state district attorneys group has come out publicly against Proposition 19 as have many county governments the editorial boards of the states biggest newspapers and Gov Arnold Schwarzenegger who said the law would make California a laughingstock Under the proposed law adults 21 and older could possess up to an ounce of marijuana for personal use and grow gardens up to 25 square feet The proposal would allow cities and governments to decide for themselves whether to tax and allow pot sales Opponents say a vague disorganized patchwork of regulations would ensue and lead to chaos for police and courts Theres also the prospect of legal chaos given the fact that pot will remain illegal under federal law regardless of what happens Every former Drug Enforcement Administration boss is asking President Barack Obama to sue California if the measure passes on the grounds that federal law trumps state law  the same argument the administration used in suing Arizona over its immigration law Proposition 19 is the brainchild of Richard Lee an Oakland medical marijuana entrepreneur who spent more than 1 million to get the measure on the ballot Also the founder of a trade school for aspiring marijuana growers and retailers Lee has pushed legal marijuana as a boon to the states economy and an important source of tax revenue to help close the states massive budget deficit The Service Employees International Union the states biggest union has endorsed the measure as an economic booster But analysts have said the economic consequences of a legalized pot trade are difficult to predict The state Board of Equalization last year said a marijuana legalization measure proposed in the state legislature could have brought California up to 14 billion in tax revenue On Friday the agency said Proposition 19 which leaves marijuana taxing decisions to local governments contained too many unknowns for its analysts to estimate how much the measure might generate In July the nonpartisan RAND Drug Policy Research Center forecast that legalizing marijuana could send prices plunging by as much as 90 percent Lower prices could mean less tax revenue even as pot consumption rose the group said The potential price drop has brought unexpected opposition or at least suspicion from rural pot farmers who fear the loss of their traditional though legally risky way of life Marijuana has become so crucial to rural economies along the states North Coast that even some local government officials are working on plans for coping with a pot downturn The states medical marijuana economy is thriving as hundreds of retail dispensaries across California sell pot to hundreds of thousands of qualified patients And some medical marijuana supporters have said Proposition 19 could undermine the credibility of the drug as a medical treatment Im just against the whole concept of the recreational use of marijuana said Dennis Peron the San Francisco activist who was the driving force behind the 1996 ballot measure that legalized medical marijuana,2010-09-26T10:09-04:00,drugs

in your body and then affect your immune system and brain Researchers have pinpointed two main cannabinoidsTHC and cannabidiol or CBDas beneficial ElSohly tells me The biggest difference CBD doesnt make you high Trouble is when exposed to the high temperature of a burning joint the 500 or so chemical compounds in marijuana can produce hundreds or thousands of byproductsmany of which are thought to be carcinogens Research suggests that marijuana smoke can contain up to 70 percent more carcinogenic materials than tobacco smoke And while many researchers think thatlogicallymarijuana smoke should cause lung cancer studies remain inconclusive See Does Smoking Pot Cause Lung Cancer But ElSohly contends that the smoke itself isnt the biggest issue at this point Theres an inherent problem with the smoking of marijuana as a delivery system he says Fortyfive years ago Dr Lester Grinspoon now an associate professor emeritus of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School would have never agreed with the idea of marijuana as a medicine He thought his friends who lit up were ruining their health Who would blame him The US government seemed to agree In 1970 it classified marijuana as a Schedule I drugalongside heroin and LSDas a substance with high abuse potential and no accepted medical purpose But in 1967 Grinspoons teenage son was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia Chemotherapy left him with no appetite vomiting spells and nauseathe kind you feel right down to your toe nails the doctor remembers The drugs that were supposed to ease the pain didnt So Grinspoons wife pulled up to Wellesley High School and asked her sons friend for weed A few minutes before his treatments Grinspoons son would take a few puffs We neverfor as long as he livedhad to deal with that awful experience of seeing what he went through again he says But bring something you smoke to the medical world and chances are theyll balk at the idea Smoking is not an accepted route of administration for medication says Dr Peter Friedmann professor of Medicine  Community Health at Brown University There are so many variables in the smoking process Its ludicrous to think you could come up with a dosage ElSohly adds This is in part why the FDA approved Marinola lowdosage formulation of synthetic THC that comes in capsule form The drug is used to stimulate appetite in people with HIV and control the nausea and vomiting thats associated with chemotherapy Its a good option for people with conditions like cancer who dont respond to common drugs Its also incredibly versatile Does it lower intraocular pressure for glaucoma patients Yes it does Does it reduce anxiety Yes it does Does it stimulate appetite Yes it does ElSohly says Find out which health risk research suggests smoking marijuana could increase  The problem Marinol is one of only two FDAapproved THCbased drugs and unlike say Advil your body doesnt absorb it well Only about 10 to 20 percent of the dose becomes available for your body to use That makes it unpredictable For some people the drug works great others see no benefit whatsoever says ElSohly Whats more it often makes those who it does work for higher than if they had smoked potanother absorption issue Which leaves a clear challenge for researchers Create a THC delivery method that leads to better absorption while reducing its psychoactive effect ElSohly and his team are on track to do this at their Ole Miss research facility Theyve developed a patch that would be applied above your gum line and deliver THC in a way that circumvents Marinols absorption problems If approved the product could be effective for relieving everything from nerve and cancer pain to glaucoma and anxiety Read about the dangers of marijuana and the issues

Fox,http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2014/10/20/apnewsbreak-colorado-health-officials-seek-to-ban-pot-infused-brownies-cookies/,DENVER  Colorado health officials want to ban many edible forms of marijuana including brownies cookies and most candies limiting legal sales of potinfused food to lozenges and some liquids The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment told marijuana regulators that many forms of edible marijuana are naturally attractive to children and violate the laws requirement to prevent the marketing of marijuana products to children The recommendation was obtained by The Associated Press in advance of a third and possibly final workgroup meeting Monday to draw up rules for identifiable markers or colors for edible marijuana products so they wont be confused with regular foods The health departments recommendation sent to the regulators Oct 14 would effectively take most forms of edible marijuana off store shelves The final decision will be made by the Department of Revenues Marijuana Enforcement Division which oversees retail marijuana sales Lawmakers have ordered state pot regulators to require potinfused food and drink to have a distinct look when they are out of the packaging The order came after concerns about the proliferation of potinfused treats that many worry could be accidentally eaten by children Statewide numbers are not available but one hospital in the Denver area has reported nine cases of children being admitted after accidentally eating pot It is not clear whether those kids ate commercially packaged pot products or homemade items such as marijuana brownies The Health Departments recommendation would apply only to products sold commercially including a form of liquid pot called a tincture that can be added to foods The Health Departments recommendation is one of several made to marijuana regulators The advocacy group Smart Colorado wants to see a requirement that edible versions of marijuana be colored marked or stamped to indicate they contain the drug The marijuana industry opposes a ban on most pot products A spokesman for Dixie Elixirs which makes marijuanainfused sodas and mints said Monday that the rules go too far and may not be able to keep potinfused foods out of childrens hands Labeling and packaging are the best and only way to deal with accidental ingestion said Joe Hodas Dixies chief marketing officer He said the rules would help drive the black market A Health Department spokesman did not immediately comment on the agencys proposal which comes as authorities warn parents about lookalike potinfused candies at Halloween Denver police released a video earlier this month about the danger of possible mixups Some marijuana edibles can be literally identical to their namebrand counterparts department warned in a statement urging parents to toss candies they dont recognize ___ Kristen Wyatt can be reached at httpwwwtwittercomAPkristenwyatt,2014-10-20T13:39-04:00,drugs

lighting joints under Seattles Space Needle early Thursday morning with nary a police officer in sight bespoke the new reality Marijuana is legal under Washington state law Hundreds gathered at Seattle Center for a New Years Evestyle countdown to 12 am when the legalization measure passed by voters last month took effect When the clock struck they cheered and sparked up in unison     A few dozen people gathered on a sidewalk outside the north Seattle headquarters of the annual Hempfest celebration and did the same offering joints to reporters and blowing smoke into television news cameras I feel like a kid in a candy store shouted Hempfest volunteer Darby Hageman Its all becoming real now Washington and Colorado became the first states to vote to decriminalize and regulate the possession of an ounce or less of marijuana by adults over 21 Both measures call for setting up state licensing schemes for pot growers processors and retail stores Colorados law is set to take effect by Jan 5 In another sweeping change for Washington Gov Chris Gregoire on Wednesday signed into law a measure that legalizes samesex marriage The state joins several others that allow gay and lesbian couples to wed That law also took effect at midnight allowing gay and lesbian couples to start picking up their wedding certificates and licenses at county auditors offices Those offices in King County the states largest and home to Seattle and Thurston County home to the state capital of Olympia planned to open the earliest at 1201 am Thursday to start issuing marriage licenses Because the state has a threeday waiting period the earliest that weddings can take place is Sunday Technically Washingtons new marijuana law still forbids smoking pot in public which remains punishable by a fine like drinking in public But pot fans wanted a party and Seattle police werent about to write them any tickets The department told its 1300 officers on Wednesday just before legalization took hold that until further notice they shall not issue citations for public marijuana use Officers will be advising people not to smoke in public police spokesman Jonah SpangenthalLee wrote on the SPD Blotter The police department believes that under state law you may responsibly get baked order some pizzas and enjoy a Lord of the Rings marathon in the privacy of your own home if you want to He offered a catchy new directive referring to the film The Big Lebowski popular with many marijuana fans The Dude abides and says take it inside This is a big day because all our lives weve been living under the iron curtain of prohibition said Hempfest director Vivian McPeak The whole world sees that prohibition just took a body blow Washingtons new law decriminalizes possession of up to an ounce for those over 21 but for now selling marijuana remains illegal I502 gives the state a year to come up with a system of statelicensed growers processors and retail stores with the marijuana taxed 25 percent at each stage Analysts have estimated that a legal pot market could bring Washington hundreds of millions of dollars a year in new tax revenue for schools health care and basic government functions But marijuana remains illegal under federal law That means federal agents can still arrest people for it and its banned from federal properties including military bases and national parks The Justice Department has not said whether it will sue to try to block the regulatory schemes in Washington and Colorado from taking effect The departments responsibility to enforce the Controlled Substances Act remains unchanged said a statement issued Wednesday by the Seattle US attorneys office Neither states nor the executive branch can nullify a statute passed by Congress  a nonissue since the measures passed in Washington and Colorado dont nullify federal law which federal agents remain free to enforce The legal question is whether the establishment of a regulated marijuana market would frustrate the purpose of the federal pot prohibition and many constitutional law scholars say it very likely would That leaves the political question of whether the administration wants to try to block the regulatory system even though it would remain legal to possess up to an ounce of marijuana Alison Holcomb is the drug policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington and served as

between those advocating the legalization of medical marijuana and those against such a move The act is named after Putnam a former Green Beret and Howard County Farm Bureau director who advocated for the legalization of medical marijuana He died of cancer in 1999 The Compassionate Use Act reduced the penalties for marijuana possession to a maximum 100 fine provided a patient has a recommendation

production distribution and sale of marijuana Tuesday If approved Uruguay would be the first country to regulate the marijuana market from production to retail AP PhotoMatilde CampodonicoThe Associated Press MONTEVIDEO Uruguay  Uruguays plan to set up a legal regulated marijuana market has reached its final legislative stage with the Senate expected to approve the plan by late Tuesday and send it to President Jose Mujica for his signature Senators prepared for a long day and night of speeches after debate begins Tuesday morning The body is dominated by Mujicas ruling Broad Front coalition which wants to make Uruguay the worlds first nation to put the government at the center of a legalized marijuana trade     Congress lower house already passed it and the Senate rejected all proposed amendments so Senate passage would put the law on the desk of Mujica who is one of the plans biggest boosters despite saying hes never tried pot himself This is a plague just like cigarettes are a plague Mujica told reporters recently Polls say twothirds of Uruguayans oppose the plan despite a national TV campaign and other lobbying efforts funded by billionaire currency speculator and philanthropist George Soros whose Open Society Foundation and Drug Policy Alliance campaigned for the proposal Hannah Hetzer a lobbyist for the Alliance moved to Montevideo for the campaign and celebrated the Senates expected passage Its about time that we see a country bravely break with the failed prohibitionist model and try an innovative more compassionate and smarter approach she said in a statement Monday night Mujica says the goal is to get organized crime out of marijuana dealing not to promote the use of pot The government hopes that when licensed growers providers and users can openly trade in the drug illegal traffickers will be denied their profits and go away During its hearings the Senate Health Commission received extensive arguments from educators psychiatrists and pharmacists urging it to back away from the plan Psychiatrists predicted a rise in mental illness Pharmacists said selling pot alongside prescription drugs would harm their professional image Marijuanas negative impact on learning is well known and is related to educational failure behavioral problems and depressive symptoms teacher Nestor Pereira testified representing the National Public Education Administration But Senate committees sent the proposal for a floor vote without changes hoping to avoid a return trip to the lower chamber where it passed by a single vote Socialist Deputy Julio Bango who coauthored the proposal told The Associated Press This is not a law to liberalize marijuana consumption but rather to regulate it Today there is a market dominated by drug traffickers We want the state to dominate it The project includes a media campaign launched Friday aimed at reducing pot smoking by warning of its dangers to human health Uruguays drug czar Julio Calzada said no pharmacist or other business will be forced to sell the drug Calzada said his office will have 120 days to craft regulations following adoption Mujica pledged that his government will work through the traditional southern summer holidays to make the rules as precise as possible There will be much to discuss and to work on Well spend the summer working Theres nothing magic about this the president said As for concerns that Uruguay could become a mecca for marijuana tourism Mujica stressed that the measure would restrict the legal sale of pot only to licensed and registered Uruguayan adults Marijuana grower Marcelo Vazquez told the AP he cant wait to pay taxes on the weed hes grown illegally for 20 years After repeated police raids and arrests hes optimistic He has a greenhouse of marijuana plants growing outside Montevideo and is thinking about creating a business catering to licensed growers who lack space in their own homes This is a huge opportunity and we have to take advantage of it Vazquez said My lifelong dream has been to legally cultivate marijuana and to live off this to pay my taxes,2013-12-10T00:09-05:00,drugs

NEW POLL DEMS FARING WORSE THAN 2010
Whats the point of generic ballot poll questions After all there are no generic candidates And thats precisely how candidates win in difficult environments in this age of nationalized elections They define their opponents as out of the mainstream and themselves as independent of their own parties But in the closing days of an election such as this one there may be no metric more valuable since it is one of the only insights we have into how latebreaking voters will cast their ballots in close contests If candidates havent succeeded in defining those terms by now especially given the surge in early voting it is unlikely they will be able to And if the late breakers go as the new WaPoABC News poll suggests Democrats will be headed to bed early on Nov 4 while Republicans are uncorking the celebratory champagne The 6point advantage for the GOP among likely voters would be enough to flip several tossup races to Republican candidates and might even be enough to shoo a couple of more elephants into the barn including Scott Brown in New Hampshire

WaPo With multiple crises confronting the country  a majority now says the governments ability to deal with big problems has declined in the past few years Among those who say this more  by 3 to 1  blame President Obama and the Democrats rather than Republicans in Congress

Double double toil and trouble  Struggling with female voters and young voters Democrats fare worse in the latest WaPoABC poll than they did at the same point ahead of the disastrous 2010 election and at the same level as the punishing 1994 midterm elections that cost them both houses of Congress Without any significant increase in Democratic intensity since the previous polling cycle the auguries are getting dire for the presidents party

How narrow is President Obamas appeal this cycle Just consider where is making one of his only campaign appearances Milwaukee JournalSentinel When President Barack Obama arrives in Milwaukee on Tuesday his task will be to help mobilize AfricanAmericans and other key Democratic voting groups who still give him positive ratings despite his lackluster standing nationwide The president will be visiting North Division High School in an overwhelmingly AfricanAmerican ward that he carried with 99 of the vote in 2012 outpolling Republican Mitt Romney 843 to 5

WSJ The states the president will be visiting  Michigan Connecticut Maine Pennsylvania and Wisconsin  are not home to this cycles most critical races Indeed he wont be campaigning for Democrats in any of the Senate races that could decide which party controls the chamber for the last two years of his presidency The only Senate candidate Mr Obama is currently scheduled to appear with before Election Day is Democrat Gary Peters in Michigan who is so far ahead that Republicans pulled their advertising in the race this month Thats a marked departure from a few months ago when White House officials left open the possibility of Mr Obama campaigning in Louisiana for incumbent Sen Mary Landrieu DLa

in Las Vegas Werners medical marijuana referral business was shut down by authoritiesAP LAS VEGAS  Nevada is known for letting just about anything slide whether its booze bets or brothels But even here there are limits It has been OK to smoke pot to treat illness for ten years But dont think about selling it Lately federal agents and local police have taken notice raiding several pot shops in

wholesome neighbors of Colorado Arizona and California I really thought they would leave us alone said Pierre Werner whose familys pot shop was raided and who now faces federal charges No one should go to prison for a plant Political leaders and historians say these activists dont know Nevada Sure they say the state has libertarian leanings and is generally willing to prosper from activities that

by Nevadas hedonistic reputation began targeting the Silver State Until 2000 Nevada had one of the nations strictest marijuana laws when possession of a single joint was a felony punishable by a year or more in prison The earliest campaigns to loosen such punishments were easy sells The medical marijuana law then removed criminal penalties on the use possession and cultivation of marijuana by

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2010/10/19/benefits-marijuana/,iStock The state of Californias recent step toward fully decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana with Prop 19 has reignited one of the more contentious flash points in modern societywhere if anywhere marijuana has a place Few things illustrate the controversy better than a comparison of the web pages that purport to separate myth from fact published by the Drug Enforcement Administration DEA and the Drug Policy Alliance DPA They are almost mirror images of one another addressing the very same points but drawing on different studies to reach their preferred conclusions Its stunning to see how differently these agencies can interpret the same information     There is a single salvation from this cherrypicking pointcounterpoint the seminal report Marijuana and Medicine Assessing the Science Base This comprehensive summary of marijuana was written in 1999 by the most highly regarded nongovernmental medical organization in the country the Institute of Medicine and it serves as the primary source for the information in this article concerning the risks and benefits of marijuana Health Risk Myths  Realities The essential questions are whether the active ingredient in marijuana a cannabinoid chemical compound known as THC has any medicinal value whether the risks associated with its use outweigh the benefits and whether THC answers a need not currently met by any other medications on the market In the course of that debate several health risks are often cited Marijuana overdose There is no existing evidence of anyone dying of a marijuana overdose but this doesnt preclude the possibility of experiencing adverse or unpleasant effects when it is consumed in large amounts For comparisons sake alcohol overdoses claim approximately 5000 casualties per yearThis is often cited as a reason that marijuana is safer than other drugs like alcohol Memory Marijuana does impair shortterm memory but only during intoxication THC has been shown to have a negative effect on memory and chronic abuse of marijuana will cause permanent impairment Addiction The DEAs general opposition to marijuana is comprised of 1 that whatever medical value it has is already fulfilled by other equally effective drugs on the market and 2 that marijuana is highly addictive Both points can be turned upside down There is already an abundance of drugs that do the same job as products already on the market and they receive approval anyway This seems to run contrary to the DEAs first argument And even a cursory look at many of the Schedule II opiates and amphetamines shows that high addiction potential is not a basis for legal classification of drugs The point is that marijuana is not physically addictive and even if it was the DEA would appear to be quite hypocritical arguing this point The immune system If smoked marijuana were to inhibit the activity of Tlymphocytes in the blood it would compromise the bodys ability to fight infection This would put some people at the mercy of opportunistic infections and diseases notably those who have immunosuppressive conditions like HIV or lymphoma However the data does not support this What it does support  barely  is the compromised immunity of the lungs due to the smoke from marijuana Heart problems It is accepted in medical circles today that marijuana use causes no evident longterm cardiovascular problems for normal persons The DEA aggressively goes after this point claiming that according to Harvard researchers in the hour after having smoked marijuana ones heart attack risk goes up five fold However this fact is not properly cited and is indicative of the DEAs sloppy attempts to cite its sources Marijuanas effects on blood pressure are complex and inconsistent as of yet _________________________________________________________________________ More from AskMencom The Health Benefits Of Green Tea 5 Things You Didnt Know Drugs Cocaine 5 Things Men Should Know Is Weed Recession Proof Top 10 Sin Cities _________________________________________________________________________ Cancer Is THC considered a carcinogen cancercausing in humans Not according to the two most esteemed agencies of relevance the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC and the US National Toxicology Program NTP However the same cannot be said for smoking marijuana as the smoke from burning marijuana shares an array of dangerous and potentially carcinogenic chemicals with cigarette smoke The DPA fumbles here saying there have been no reports of lung cancer related solely to marijuana subtly hinting that its even possible to determine causation for any cancer in the first place It should be said that although the DPAs information is generally more reliable than the DEAs it does contain its fair share of porous arguments The gateway effect Does marijuana use lead to harder drugs Most longterm studies show that those people who report having tried disparate drugs like cocaine and heroin often share a history of having smoked marijuana However the implication that marijuana causes people to try harder drugs is as yet unproven and indeed it may act as an alternative to more dangerous drugs Potential benefits No serious proponent of medicinal marijuana would claim it cures anything Marijuana does however treat symptoms  pain nausea  that are caused by a wide range of illnesses Pain management The receptors in the brain that allow uptake of cannabinoids like THC are actually part of the most widespread receptor system in the body Not only is the body naturally attuned to these molecules it also uses them to great effect  numerous studies have established that cannabinoids help reduce pain and other distressing symptoms Antiemesis Some chemotherapy regimens are notorious for causing terrible bouts of nausea and vomiting and both THC and marijuana have been explored as antiemetic antinausea medication Smoking marijuana does give the desired effect in a matter of minutes and could therefore relieve the symptom quickly The potential drawback If marijuana becomes fully legalized in plant form and open to commercialization  a stance largely supported by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws NORML  one notoriously vile group of manufacturers is uniquely poised better than any other to take control of the emerging market Big Tobacco Having fully established its disinterest in the public health generations ago by the shady promotion of smoking the idea of Big Tobacco becoming the nations pot supplier should frighten anyone favoring legalization and regulation Still much to learn The dearth of useful clinical trial datarandomized controlled doubleblind trials involving large patient populationsis the biggest hurdle facing marijuanas legitimacy While numerous smaller tests have been performed that support both sides of the health argument political and economic reasons will form the primary impetus for the legalization of marijuana For a state like California whose budget deficit amounts to billions of dollars the potential tax revenue from legalized marijuana is a lot of money that is currently going up in smoke,2010-10-19T13:02-04:00,drugs

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/07/02/colorado-lawsuit-calls-for-tax-reductions-on-recreational-pot/, Marijuana legalization advocates are suing to block state and local governments from collecting certain taxes on weed sold in Colorado out of concern that businesses paying the fees would incriminate themselves at the federal level The suit which addresses the complications that arise from a state legalizing a drug that remains illegal under federal law was filed in Denver District Court by local attorney Rob Corry The main goal is to reduce the 29 percent wholesale and retail taxes collected at the state and local levels on sales of recreational marijuana and specifically block those taxes that apply only to their industry     Recreational marijuana was legalized in Colorado when voters approved an amendment to the state constitution in November 2012 Legal sales began Jan 1 But the lawsuit contends that requiring those involved in Colorados legal marijuana industry to pay taxes could get them in trouble with the feds Theyre open records and they are admitting to a federal crime Corry said Its still a federal crime to sell marijuana and I dont agree with that law but it is the law Corry filed the suit on behalf of six individuals two of whom use only pseudonyms in the complaint Colorado Gov John Hickenlooper Denver Mayor Michael Hancock the Denver Treasury Division and the state Department of Revenue are listed as defendants The suit uses the rationale that federal law takes precedence over state law The underlying rationale of the preemption doctrine is that the Supremacy Clause invalidates state laws that interfere with or are contrary to the laws of Congress The fact that there are marijuanaspecific taxes Corry maintains puts every single one of these business owners and every single one of these consumers in danger of federal prosecution potentially Thats a violation of the Fifth Amendment But when it comes to taxes the federal government also is entitled to its share explained Amanda Cruser a Denver area tax attorney who once worked for the US Department of Justice On the federal side if you dont pay your income taxes and you dont pay your employment taxes youre going to be subjecting yourself to criminal tax charges she said The irony of the federal government collecting taxes on a substance illegal under federal law is not lost on federal drug task force head Tom Gorman As far as I know if the federal government takes money from a criminal enterprise thats part of money laundering Gorman said When they can seize the money because its illegal but then to take it in and use the money to me would be a violation of law in itself In an August 2013 press release the Justice Department said it had notified Colorado and Washington the two states that have legalized recreational marijuana that it would essentially look the other way  at least for now The Department has informed the governors of both states that it is deferring its right to challenge their legalization laws at this time the statement said That stance has done little to clarify the situation since this and subsequent administrations would reserve the right to change that policy The lack of certainty has left both opponents and proponents of marijuana legalization frustrated and confused I think the federal government needs to make up its mind whether they have supremacy over state law and then enforce that law Gorman said It makes no sense The federal government needs to step up and say if you wanna change it change it in Congress not state by state Corry a legalization advocate agrees This question of the tension between federal law and state law is the question that confronts the marijuana community every day he said Our governor has been essentially impotent He should demand that Congress should do something about this and we hope this lawsuit by depriving them from tax revenue will cause that to happen,2014-07-02T00:46-04:00,drugs

benefits and the government should allow its use for that purpose according to an Associated PressCNBC poll released Tuesday Respondents were skeptical that crime would spike if marijuana is decriminalized or that it would lead more people to harder drugs like heroin or cocaine There also was a nearly even split on whether government spends too much or the right amount enforcing marijuana laws Almost no one thinks too little is spent     Marijuana use  medically and recreationally  is getting more attention in the political arena California voters will decide in November whether to legalize the drug and South Dakota will vote this fall on whether to allow medical uses California and 13 other states already permit such use The balloting comes against the backdrop of the Obama administration saying it wont target marijuana dispensaries if they comply with state laws a departure from the policy of the Bush administration which sought to more stringently enforce the federal ban on marijuana use for any purpose In the poll only 33 percent favor legalization while 55 percent oppose it People under 30 were the only age group favoring legalization 54 percent and opposition increased with age topping out at 73 percent of those 65 and older Opposition also was prevalent among women Republicans and those in rural and suburban areas Some opponents worried legalization would lead to reefer madness I think it would be chaos if it was legalized said Shirley Williams a 75yearold retired English teacher from Quincy Ill People would get in trouble and use marijuana as an excuse Those like Jeff Boggs 25 of Visalia Calif who support legalization said the dangers associated with the drug have been overstated People are scared about things they dont know about said Boggs who is married and works for an auto damage appraisal company Americans are more accepting of medical marijuana Sixty percent support the idea and 74 percent believe the drug has a real medical benefit for some people Twothirds of Democrats favor medical marijuana as do a slim majority of Republicans 53 percent Peoples views on legalizing marijuana or on allowing its use for medicinal purposes were largely uniform across different regions of the country despite the fact that legal medical marijuana use is concentrated in the West Bill Hankins 77 of Mason Mich opposes legalizing marijuana but strongly favors using the drug medicinally Michigan is among the states that allow medical pot It has been shown through tests to alleviate pain in certain medical conditions said Hankins who said he experimented with pot when he was younger If Hankins fell gravely ill and my doctor said I should have it to control the pain I would use it he said California was the first state to approve medical marijuana in 1996 and has been the hub of the socalled Green Rush to legalize marijuana But a patchwork of local laws in the state has created confusion about the law and lax oversight led to an explosion of medical marijuana dispensaries in some places In Los Angeles the number of dispensaries exploded from four to upward of 1000 in the past five years Police believe some were nothing but fronts for drug dealers to sell marijuana to people who have no medical need and the city recently adopted an ordinance to reduce that number to 70 in coming months Among those surveyed 45 percent said the cost of enforcing existing laws is too high and 48 percent said its about right Democrats men and young people were most apt to say the cost is exorbitant With state and local governments desperate for cash some legalization proponents are pushing marijuana as a potential revenue stream But only 14 percent of those surveyed who oppose legalization would change their mind if states were to tax the drug John Lovell a spokesman with the California Narcotics Officers Association said he wasnt surprised by the poll results because people already are aware of widespread abuse of legal prescription drugs and alcohol Given that reality we dont need to add another mindaltering substance that compromises peoples five senses Lovell said Allen St Pierre executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws said that since the organization was formed in 1970 theres been a slow but steady erosion of opposition to marijuana Every single metric is pushing toward a zeitgeist in marijuana reform he said Ann Broadus 58 of Petros Tenn strongly opposes legalization and medicinal use but even she sees the day when the laws will change Probably somewhere down the road it will be legalized but I hope not she said I think if it becomes legal these druggies would be worse off The APCNBC Poll was conducted April 712 2010 by GfK

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/08/14/colorado-gov-hickenlooper-struggles-to-fend-off-gop-rival/, Colorado Gov John Hickenlooper is in a fight for a second term thats turning out far tighter than anyone would have expected with recent polls showing him virtually tied with Republican challenger Bob Beauprez His challengers strong base of conservative support is proving problematic for the Democratic incumbent     Floyd Ciruli a Colorado pollster and political analyst noted that Colorado governors typically get reelected and John Hickenlooper really looked strong about a year and a half ago But the outcome of this years Republican primary as well as public pushback over the governors support for gun control laws and other decisions in office are creating the perfect political storm Theres a lot of dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs with John Hickenlooper Beauprez said Several requests by Fox News for an interview with Hickenlooper went unanswered The former Denver mayor easily won his first race for governor against a Republican Tea Party candidate with little support and thirdparty candidate Tom Tancredo However he now faces a much stiffer challenge from Beauprez considered an establishment Republican  The Republicans for the first time in almost a decade managed to get through a primary with a strong candidate Ciruli said And they have united behind that candidate very quickly Thats not to say Hickenlooper hasnt had successes His handling of the states response to several devastating wildfires in recent years and the unprecedented massive flooding that hit northern Colorado last fall received high marks from those involved He also earned praise in preparing for the nations first legal recreational marijuana sales which began in January though Hickenlooper had campaigned against the amendment that voters passed As the governor noted in this years State of the State This will be one of the great social experiments of this century And while not all of us chose it being first means we all share a responsibility to do it properly Hickenloopers handling of other controversial issues though has contributed to his approval ratings falling from a high of 66 percent to under 50 percent Peoples constitutional rights their liberty Beaupreaz charged is being trampled over and over again at the state level One of the biggest turning points in Hickenloopers popularity came in 2013 when Colorados Democraticcontrolled legislature passed what was then reported to be the strictest gun control measures in the country As the governor pointed out recently the measures were a response to the mass shooting carried out by James Holmes in an Aurora movie theater the year before We didnt want any family going through what they already had to go through he said The reaction from gun rights supporters was swift For the first time in state history two senators including the Senate majority leader were voted out in recall elections The governors decision on whether death row inmate Nathan Dunlaps execution should be carried out as scheduled last fall also made almost no one happy when he announced a temporary reprieve for the prisoner Explaining that he had changed his mind on the death penalty and no longer supported it Hickenlooper said Dunlap who gunned down four people in a Chuck E Cheese restaurant in 1994 could still be executed by a future governor but not while he was still in office Im not sure why he took the job if he was unwilling to make the tough decisions Beauprez said Whether you happen to be pro or antideath penalty he knew this decision was coming and he made neither one On my watch justice will be served Nathan Dunlap will be executed Hickenlooper may have successfully dodged another bitterly divisive issue though with his recent agreement with Democratic Rep Jared Polis to pull support for antifracking measures on the November ballot As in many western states energy production is a major issue in Colorado Polis personally poured millions of his own dollars into November ballot initiatives that could have essentially shut down oil and gas fracking in much of the state Hickenlooper a former geologist who believes fracking is safe convinced Polis to withdraw his support for the measures This is how we do things in Colorado he announced We have all the interests at the table and you work through the differences and difficulties In return Hickenlooper will create a commission to study the issue and make recommendations The agreement dilutes criticism the governor has faced on the issue from both sides of the aisle Whether Hickenlooper wins in November has ramifications beyond Colorado In the last seven years there has been a monumental shift in the political affiliation of governors in the American West Leaving out the West Coast which is its own political animal looking at the other 14 states in the region half had Democratic chief executives in 2007 Today only two are left Hickenlooper and Montana Gov Steve Bullock If Hickenlooper loses in November Bullock will be the lone Democratic governor left standing between California and Missouri,2014-08-14T11:55-04:00,drugs

recreational marijuana named Space Needle at Sea of Green Farms in Seattle Workers at the grower the first business licensed to grow recreational marijuana in Washington state worked all weekend to have supplies ready for stores that were expected to be granted sale licenses on Monday the day before the first day of legal recreational pot sales in Washington stateAP SEATTLE  Washington state issued its first retail marijuana licenses Monday with a middleofthenight email alerting blearyeyed potshop proprietors that theyll finally be able to open for business Were pretty stoked said John Evich an investor in Bellinghams Top Shelf Cannabis in a 230 am Pacific time interview with The Associated Press We havent had any sleep in a long time but were excited for the next step     Randy Simmons the state Liquor Control Boards project manager for legal marijuana said Sunday night that the first two dozen stores were being notified so early to give them an extra few hours to get cannabis on their shelves before they are allowed to open their doors at 8 am Tuesday The store openings are expected to be accompanied by high prices shortages and celebration The state licensed 14 stores in western Washington and 10 in eastern Washington Spokane has three stores Vancouver Tacoma and Bellingham each have two Seattle and the other cities on the list have one each The issuance of the retail licenses marked a major step thats been 20 months in the making Washington and Colorado stunned much of the world by voting in November 2012 to legalize marijuana for adults over 21 and to create statelicensed systems for growing selling and taxing the pot Sales began in Colorado on Jan 1 It remained unclear how many of the potshops being licensed in Washington planned to open on Tuesday Officials eventually expect to have more than 300 recreational pot shops across the state At Cannabis City which will be the first and for now only recreational marijuana shop in Seattle owner James Lathrop worked into the night Sunday placing noparking signs in front of his building hoisting a grandopening banner and hanging artwork before he turned his attention to his email  and the official notification that he was a licensed marijuana dealer Ive had a long day It really hasnt sunk in yet he said early Monday He planned to hold off on opening his store until noon on Tuesday Know your audience Were talking stoners here he said Id be mean to say they need to get up at 5 am to get in line With the emailed notifications in hand the shops immediately worked to place their orders with some of the states first licensed growers As soon as the orders were received via stateapproved software for tracking the barcoded pot the growers could place the product in a required 24hour quarantine before shipping it early Tuesday morning The final days before sales have been frenetic for growers and retailers alike Lathrop and his team hired an events company to provide crowd control arranged for a food truck and free water for those who might spend hours waiting outside and rented a portable toilet to keep his customers from burdening nearby businesses with requests to use the restrooms At Nine Point Growth Industries a marijuana grower in Bremerton owner Gregory Stewart said he and his director celebrated after they worked through some glitches in the pottracking software early Monday and officially learned theyd be able to transport their weed 24 hours later at 222 am Tuesday Its the middle of the night and were standing here doing highfives and our version of a happy dance he said Its huge for us Pot prices were expected to reach 25 a gram or higher on the first day of sales  twice what people pay in the states unregulated medical marijuana dispensaries That was largely due to the short supply of legally produced pot in the state Although more than 2600 people applied to become licensed growers fewer than 100 have been approved  and only about a dozen were ready to harvest by early this month Nevertheless Evich said his shop in Bellingham wanted to thank the states residents for voting for the law by offering 10 grams of one cannabis strain to the first 50 or 100 customers The other strains would be priced between 12 and 25 he said The store will be open at 8 am Tuesday he said but work remained trimming the bathroom door cleaning the floors wiping dust off the walls and of course stocking the shelves In Seattle among those who planned to buy some of the first pot at Cannabis City was Alison Holcomb the lawyer who drafted Washingtons law She said it was a good opportunity to remind people of the bigpicture arguments for ending nearly a century of prohibition and displacing the black market including keeping nonviolent adult marijuana users out of jail redirecting profits away from criminal groups and ending racial disparities in who gets busted No one thought legalization could happen in our lifetime she said I think this is going to be a little overwhelming for me,2014-07-07T18:04-04:00,drugs

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/04/23/safety-concerns-about-legal-marijuana-edibles/, Two recent deaths and increased emergency room visits in Colorado have highlighted concerns about the safety of legal marijuana edibles Dr George Sam Wang of Childrens Hospital Colorado says part of the problem is that the effects of edible marijuana begin more slowly than smokeable pot though they tend to last longer     One of the dangers that weve been seeing with adult recreational retail use is theyll take the recommended dose wait feel no effects and then continue to stack doses Then before they know it they have a pretty large amount in their system and then they get potentially pretty severe effects he said Investigators say that appears to be what happened to Levy Thamba a college student from the Republic of Congo who had never tried marijuana before Friends say he ate the recommended dose of onesixth of a marijuanainfused cookie on March 11 When he felt no effects he ate the entire cookie six times the recommended dose He later became irrational and jumped off a hotel balcony to his death In an autopsy report the Denver medical examiner concluded that Thambas death was an accident and listed marijuana intoxication as a contributing factor The edibles industry is huge points out Colorado state representative Jonathan Singer About 40 percent of the marijuana industry is in edibles Edibles are a huge part of our business agrees Jamie Perino owner of Euflora situated on Denvers 16th Street Mall and a popular tourist destination Because theres no place for visitors to come and enjoy smoking recreational marijuana  its illegal to smoke pot in public or in hotels  edibles are probably at least 50 if not on some days 70 percent our sales Edibles range from marijuanainfused mints to candies baked goods and beverages Their popularity seems to have taken everyone  lawmakers health officials and the industry itself by surprise State law requires the products be sold in childproof packaging and labels show the amount of the psychoactive ingredient THC they contain Child resistant packaging has been proven to work Dr Wang says But if you take them out of the child resistant packagingobviously a child isnt going to know the difference between a marijuana containing product and a nonmarijuana containing product and they often dont taste any different Wang says that in 2009 2010 and 2011 combined Childrens Hospital had 14 children come to their ER for marijuana intoxication Last year alone that number rose to eight cases and they have had eight more cases in just the first few months of this year Six of those required admission to critical care Most of the kids are toddlers and symptoms vary depending on the size of the child and the amount of marijuana in their system Symptoms range from sleepiness to where weve had kids actually getting breathing tubes to help them breathe and put on a ventilator Singer is cosponsor of a bill that would require pot edibles to be instantly recognizable even when out of the packaging Whether its a stamp or a symbol or a shape or a universal color there should be something thats easily recognizable to both parents and kids so everyone knows what theyre putting in their mouth Perino and many others in the industry think that is going too far I mean it really is a strong industry and has many strong points and to have it over regulated and have things shut down before its even started would be a sad thing to see he said Perino believes parents need to be responsible for keeping these products away from their kids She also believes much of the concern is overblown due to recent media attention on cases like that of Kristine Kirk who was shot and killed by her husband Richard on April 14 At the time of the shooting Kristine Kirk was on the phone with a 911 operator she had called to report her husband was totally hallucinating Police say Richard Kirk had purchased marijuanainfused candy earlier in the day al he was also taking prescription medication Kirk faces a firstdegree murder charge and the case is still under investigation Its really unfortunate two people have lost their lives Perino says But I think that people have been waiting for something to happen so they can say Oh look how bad marijuana is But lets look at the alcohol related deaths since January 1 in Colorado when recreational marijuana became legal How does that stack up Perino says she and her employees take very seriously the task of educating customers about the effects of marijuana especially the edible kind We recommend ten milligrams to start especially if theyve never done them before We tell them to wait at least 45 minutes if not an hour to see how its going to affect them before they ingest any more Singer one of only two state legislators to publicly endorse legalizing marijuana says education is critical but more needs to be done When you have edibles that are shaped like gummy bears or lollypops or lemon drops we need to make sure there is something clear on there that clearly identifies it as not for child consumption he said He maintains his bill which passed the Colorado House unanimously and is now in the hands of the Senate is also good for the industry If the bill becomes law the states Marijuana Enforcement Division of the Department of Revenue will be tasked with deciding exactly how marijuana edibles will be required to look to make them instantly distinguishable from the products they mimic,2014-04-23T17:11-04:00,drugs

stoneandwood huts that dot the Rif valley the heart Moroccos potgrowing region Benabdallah openly grows the crop despite the risk We are regularly subject to blackmail by the gendarmes he said as he scythed through stalks and wrapped them into a bundle     Moroccos marijuana farmers live in a strange limbo in which the brilliant green fields are largely left alone while the growers face constant police harassment A new draft law may bring some reprieve It aims to legalize marijuana growing for medical and industrial uses in a radical step for a Muslim nation that could alleviate poverty and social unrest But it faces stiff opposition in this conservative country as well as the suspicions of farmers themselves who think politicians can do nothing to help them Morocco is joining many other countries as well as some US states in reexamining policies toward drugs and looking to some degree of legalization But Moroccos Islamic faith creates a strong taboo toward drugs despite the centuriesold tradition of growing the plant in the north Morocco is one of the worlds top suppliers of hashish The World Customs Authority reports that in 2013 65 percent of hashish seized at customs worldwide came from Morocco with most of that going to Europe Estimates vary wildly for how much the business is worth but legalization would certainly provide a substantial boost to farmers and to Moroccos anemic economy which will grow by just 25 percent this year But the farmers who cultivate the marijuana plants remain suspicious of any measures by politicians who they claim have never done anything for their poor neglected region They fear that legalization might depress the already low price of 8 a kilogram they receive If legalization happened for all of Morocco we could never compete with the other farmers that have lots of land and the price of cannabis wouldnt be any different than that of carrots said Mohammed Benabdallah an activist in the village of Oued Abdel Ghaya While customers pay top dollar for hashish and marijuana in the famed coffee shops of Amsterdam the Moroccan farmers who produce it make on average just 3000 to 4000 a year Farmers also complain about having to dodge police and avoiding the major towns for fear of arrest   unless they are ready to pay bribes But there are few alternatives The valleys rocky soil is poor and the only crop that seems to thrive is marijuana It was legal to grow under royal mandate in certain regions of the Rif until 1974 when the government passed a blanket ban on the cultivation and consumption of all drugs The securitycentered approach to the problem has failed argued Mehdi Bensaid a lawmaker with the opposition Party of Authenticity and Modernity that has presented parliament with the legalization law If Morocco has a crop that could produce these medicines that could be sold today in the US Canada and France it is an employment opportunity for citizens living in a miserable situation Bensaid told The Associated Press Its a winwin for the state because there is tax and for the citizens because they are in an illegal situation Mustapha Khalfi Moroccos government spokesman and communications minister refused to discuss the proposed draft law when asked by The Associated Press pointing only to government efforts to combat drug smuggling and reduce the amount of acreage under cultivation It remains to be seen if the law will be scheduled for a debate in parliament when the new session begins Oct 10 The government has repeatedly tried but failed to persuade farmers to substitute other crops By 2010 most alternative crop programs had been suspended Walking along terraces of rocky earth 63yearold Mohammed Fathi said he tried to grow other crops and was part of a cooperative that grew olives figs and almonds It failed due to lack of rain Marijuana he said resists the drought that kills other plants,2014-10-07T02:30-04:00,drugs

Fox,http://smallbusiness.foxbusiness.com/entrepreneurs/2014/11/04/main-street-eyes-taxes-wages-marijuana-in-midterms/,Small business owners around the country are casting their ballots as the race to the 2014 Midterm Election finish line comes to an end  and how Main Street votes could determine not just who will go to Washington but also the outcome of key initiatives that affect all of our bottom lines FOXBusinesscom spoke to industry insiders and local businesses to gauge the pulse of Main Street and see what issues the small business community is most intent on following as candidates duke it out From the agriculture industry and the oil sector to franchises and marijuana retailers the recurrent themes that pose hurdles for smaller players are too much regulation minimum wage hikes and immigration reform And in anticipation of a lameduck session theres hope for change but its not all roses According to a survey released last week by the National Federation of Independent Business NFIB a strong majority twothirds of small businesses think Capitol Hill politics are at the heart of the countrys economic problems and 76 believe the current regulatory environment doesnt favor someone looking to start or grow a business Virtually every candidate running claims to care about small business and yet theres a clear sense among small business owners that Washington isnt listening NFIB President and CEO Dan Danner said Still there are signs that optimism is on the rise Smaller players are looking forward with renewed confidence according to the 2014 Hiscox DNA small business survey which found that 51 of smaller businesses in the US are feeling good about the year ahead and want to make sure their voices are heard this week Ag Oil Want Relaxed Regulations for Christmas Across the corn belt smaller farmers and ranchers have a pretty clear holiday wish list to get sorted out that includes tax questions environmental concerns and laborrelated issues immigration reform minimum wage Well be grateful for whatever gets accomplished this year but as for the big picture said Dale Moore executive director public policy for the American Farm Bureau Federation We feel strongly about Congress and the White House getting the fiscal and budget process in order to refuel economic recovery On the topic of taxes getting Section 179 and the bonus depreciation break extended is at the top of the wish list for rural communities in battle ground states like Arkansas Kentucky and Iowa Moore explained If all the indicators so far are right the Republicans will take the Senate which will possibly pose as a doubleedged sword for the agricultural sector according to DTN Washington editor Chris Clayton Clayton explains that smalltomedium size farmers want the EPA off their backs regulatorywise and at the same time dont want to see changes in terms of ethanol A lot of people are concerned if you get a GOP House and Senate there will be changes to renewable fuel standards Clayton explained And people in the corn belt regardless of political views are protective of how that would affect prices of grain But Ag guys arent the only ones feeling the constraints of heavy regulation  in the oil and marijuana sectors most are hoping for the loosening of some rules and perhaps less but more constructive regulations For oil small business will be closely watching the races in certain battle ground states such as South Dakota for indicators on what will happen with the Keystone Pipeline XL Main Street will also be on the lookout in Alaska and Louisiana for indicators on a possible lift on US crude oil export restrictions which could open up business opportunities for all kinds of participants from oil producers and refiners to trading houses and shipping companies The Obama Administration is already studying whether to lift the restrictions on oil exports but this is something that is likely to face a lot of opposition in Congress from both Democrats and Republicans who worry that lifting the restrictions could cause gasoline prices to rise said Herman Wang senior editor of oil news at Platts According to a recent Reuters report depending on who takes a Senate seat from several of these battle ground states and who wins certain gubernatorial races could mean which of the energy topics  EPA carbon regulations the Keystone Pipeline XLs approval relaxing crude oil export rules developing clean energy technology  will take priority Wang says his impression is not much will change even if Republicans take the Senate as its unlikely theyll get a filibusterproof majority Republicans could bring up all the prodrilling antiEPA proKeystone bills they want but either Democrats will likely filibuster them or Obama will likely veto them However he thinks a Republicancontrolled Congress could give the Obama administration some leeway to loosen the spigots somewhat on US crude oil exportsEither way as Wang put it its not a slam dunk anything will happen Marijuana on One Reefer on Two And this is a sentiment echoed by the marijuana sector as they fight to gain ground in Alaska and Oregon on legalization If measures are approved in these two states they would become the third and fourth states to legalize marijuana Voters in Washington DC and Florida will decide whether to allow medicinal marijuana use The marijuana industry in states where it has been legalized Colorado Washington is seeing some of the tightest regulations around  everything from the labeling to the label on the text the list goes on said Mason Tvert director of communications for the nations largest marijuana policy organization the Marijuana Policy Project But while compliance is something retailers deal with what we see is that they want to and its a new industry that want to be legitimate and produce a product thats widely consumed The latest figures on tax revenues from the Colorado Department of Revenue hit a new high in the month of August with recreational sales totaling about 341 million compared to 293 million the previous month And Colorado has taken in about 45 million in total tax revenues from both medical and recreational marijuana yeartodate The industry has also served as a jobs creator across Colorado Per a September report by the Coloradoan the state has licensed more than 18660 individuals and counting to work in Colorados cannabis industry indicating the prospect for new jobs is only growing And according to Alexandra Hall chief economist with the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment as of the first quarter of 2014 jobs growth for the marijuana sector totaled 3523 second quarter figures will be available in November Tvert says its not really a matter of Republicans versus Democrats because there are members of either party who are more progressive on the legalization debate than others but public attitudes are clearly shifting  and its only a matter of time before that is reflected in laws nationwide The Great Wage Debate On the aglabor front where employers are heavily dependent on seasonal labor immigration reform will play a big role in helping hire workers for the available jobs He says theres a worker shortage and while farmers typically pay above the minimum wage theres not enough people willing to do the work to meet the needs of all farmers The lack stems from it being seasonal according to Moore and it results in a significant demand on workers from other countries willing to come do the work Continuing on the topic of jobs raising the minimum wage beyond the 725 federal hourly rate is a key ballot initiative for this midterm cycle in several red states including Alaska Arkansas South Dakota and Nebraska But voters across the country are mixed on the possible hikes and some are saying that increasing costs for small business owners by introducing raised wages wont help drive economic recovery We are new small business owners finding a second career through franchising after serving our country in the military Any labor cost increases especially as we look to build and grow our business would be crushing said Herv Breault Philly Pretzel Factor franchisee For Nancy Bigley CEO of Bottle  Bottega in California her main concern with state specific wage hikes is that it could hamper business expansion into or out of certain states with competitive hourly rates Starting a business has been one of the most exciting yet challenging things that I have ever experienced Bigley said Id like to see a future government that applauds rallies and supports those who decide to take that risk The bottom line she says is that Main Street is hopeful that a Republican majority in the Senate will allow for greater passage of small businessfriendly policies that will encourage both expansion and job creation This is the only way for the small business community to drive economic growth Bigley said  Follow Natalia Angulo on

there is that But I mean the reason I chose not to take drugs and alcohol as well is because I saw what happened in my neighborhood when all of this drug stuff came in late 60s early 70s A lot of people got hurt by it And now the marijuana is ten times stronger than it was back then and I know people who are addicted to marijuana I mean oh its not addictive  yeah it is Its psychologically addicted just like tobacco is But its interesting that you put yourself out there because you are going to be criticized being a square and all of this You know Cranston Rhode Island a working class town there is a lot of pot there a lot of meth there You know that Youre going to go back and they are going to look at you and go you know you dont care about that scrutiny CULPO I dont think its scrutiny I think that the people at that club that are smoking legal marijuana know what Im talking about OREILLY No they dont They think its the best thing in the world These potheads they love it Look at Willie Nelson You know Willie Nelson do you know him CULPO Yes OREILLY He has got a book out that says this is the greatest thing in the world CULPO For him OREILLY Well did you ever talk to Willie Nelson Its like talking to a fire hydrant All right Snoop Dogg says he wants to show kids how to smoke pot You know who Snoop Dogg is You know this guy CULPO Of course and I dont agree with that either And I think hopefully a majority of Americans dont agree with that either OREILLY But Ms Culpo you have got to understand that the mentality on the other side is theres nothing wrong with it its great lets be stoned all the time That is what it is Americans more and more are going over to that side That is why you got the legalization in Washington and Colorado CULPO And that is why its scarier than ever before OREILLY Are you going to make this a campaign are you going to go out and tell young kids not to do it CULPO I think that could work I think I could definitely make a difference OREILLY If you believe it CULPO I absolutely do believe it and I think I could make a difference but I still really do believe that at the root of  I dont think that it will ever be legalized OREILLY Have you ever smoked pot CULPO I cant answer that OREILLY Then thats a yes And  but obviously you dont want to do it anymore CULPO No way OREILLY Do you drink CULPO No Im under age OREILLY Well 20 Yes thats right Well you go to Finland you can drink there if you want But you know kids drink you drink But its not  intoxication is not for you right Intoxication getting drunk not for you CULPO Its definitely not for me during this job While Im an international role model and especially in this country where it is  there is a drinking age I need to respect that Especially not only as a citizen of this country but as a role model I need people to look up to me and feel like they can look up to me OREILLY Well good I hope you do as much good as you can with your Miss

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/10/12/study-legalizing-pot-wont-hinder-mexican-cartels/,SANTA CRUZ California  Mexicos drug traffickers are likely to lose customers in Americas largest pot consuming state if California legalizes marijuana but they wont lose much money overall because Californias residents already prefer to grow their own according to a study released Tuesday That means the proposal on the states November ballot to legalize marijuana also will do little to quell the drug gangs violent and sophisticated organizations that generate billions of dollars a year according to the study by the nonpartisan RAND Drug Policy Research Center     Californians who make up oneseventh of the US marijuana market already are farming marijuana at a much higher rate than in neighboring states and tend to buy domestic rather than smuggled marijuana the study found Tuesday was harvest day on a medical marijuana farm in Northern California where dozens of volunteers cut trimmed and processed hundreds of shopping bags full of freshly snipped buds Were already growing our own in California and what happens in California so goeth the nation said Valerie Corral who helped found and runs a Santa Cruz medical marijuana collective Legalizing marijuana might undercut Mexican marijuana sales but it isnt about to derail the cartels It will just shift their focus California voters will decide next month whether to legalize and tax their own recreational use of marijuana The measure is closely watched in Mexico where more than 28000 people have died in drug violence since Mexicos President Felipe Calderon launched his crackdown on organized crime in late 2006 Both Calderon and President Barack Obama agree the vast profits cartels collect in the US   estimated by federal authorities between 18 billion and 35 billion a year    fuel drug wars south of the border RAND found that less than 2 billion of those profits come from marijuana and that losing the California marijuana market would cost cartels about 180 million    or 3 percent    of all the money they make exporting drugs to the US Mexican President Felipe Calderon said the California proposition is of critical importance We are watching very closely very closely to what will happen in November We are not certain what impact it will have on Mexico he told The Associated Press in an interview last week Making even a slight dent in cartel profits makes legalization worth doing said Drug Policy Alliance spokesman Stephen Gutwillig who supports the Prop 19 California ballot proposal The bottom line is that creating any lawful legitimate market for sales of marijuana to adults isnt good for the criminal syndicates that currently control this gigantic underground economy Gutwillig said Proponents of the proposition say they want to lower prison costs and find new revenue from marijuana taxes and that the measure could reduce violence associated with the illegal drug trade in California and Mexico The Obama administration disagrees and US drug czar Gil Kerlikowske told the AP that the new study backs them up This report shows that despite the millions spent on marketing the idea legalized marijuana wont reduce the revenue or violence generated by Mexican drug trafficking organizations said Kerlikowske head of the US Office of National Drug Control Policy The bottom line is that increased access and availability to marijuana jeopardizes the health and safety of our citizens Some former law enforcement officials however said its hard to imagine there wouldnt be major cartel profits at stake Its ridiculous to claim that ending prohibition wont have a big financial impact on these violent criminals bottom lines said Stephen Downing a supporter of Prop 19 and a former Los Angeles Police Department deputy chief of police But the RAND study concludes the only way to cut into the cartels profits would be the unlikely scenario of legal marijuana growers taking over cartel distribution elsewhere in the US Under that scenario Mexican drug trafficking organizations currently providing at least half the marijuana in the US would lose roughly 20 percent of their total drug export revenues Their remaining profits from more lucrative drugs like cocaine and heroin would continue to flow If that happens then legalization could reduce some of the Mexican drug violence in the long run said Beau Kilmer the studys lead author and codirector of the RAND Drug Policy Research Center But the study authors said they dont believe the federal government will stand idly by if homegrown smugglers were to capture the entire national market now held by Mexicosourced marijuana It would be difficult not to notice that the quantities produced and perhaps even taxed were vastly larger than what is needed to supply the California market alone said the study But some say its already beginning to happen Smuggling in the US will be easy as marijuana can be shipped to consumers in other states through our mail system said economist John Carnevale a drug policy expert who has worked with the US Office of National Drug Control Policy for three administrations There is anecdotal information that this is already occurring Former San Jose California police chief Joseph McNamara says the proposed laws key goal isnt aimed at resolving Mexicos drug violence and questioned RANDs assumptions about marijuana use and sales Can a state facing a 19 billion dollar deficit casually pass up a chance to tax a product that escapes taxation only because it is illegal he

Fox,http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2014/07/08/as-first-pot-stores-prepare-to-open-in-washington-questions-and-answers-about/,SEATTLE  Washington states first recreational marijuana stores open for business this week more than a year and a half after voters decided to legalize tax and regulate pot Some questions and answers about the industry Q When can I buy legal weed A The states Liquor Control Board issued the first two dozen retail marijuana licenses in the wee hours Monday and stores can open at 8 am Tuesday if theyre ready Once stores get their licenses they can place their orders with the states licensed growers who have to wait 24 hours before they ship the marijuana Q Where can I buy A Washington issued its first 24 licenses Monday to shops to sell recreational marijuana 14 stores in western Washington and 10 in eastern Washington   but only about six stores were planning to open Tuesday They include two shops in Bellingham one in Seattle one in Prosser one in Kelso and one in Spokane Some said they planned to open later this week or next while others said they werent sure when theyd obtain marijuana to sell Liquor Control Board list httpslcbappboxcomretail77 Q Will it be expensive A Yes Although some stores say they plan to sell some of their supply for as little as 10 or 12 a gram    comparable to what it sells for at the states unregulated medical dispensaries    others expect it to go for 25 or more The issue is mainly supply Relatively few growers have harvested    the pot being offered for sale in the coming days was grown by only about a dozen producers statewide According to the two labs certified to check the pot for mold and other impurities the samples they had tested by last Thursday represent a maximum initial statewide harvest of about 440 pounds Some growers are asking 4000 per pound wholesale The marijuana is heavily taxed    25 percent at wholesale and 25 percent at retail at least not to mention additional sales taxes Officials dont expect prices to stabilize until after many more growers begin harvesting Q How much can I buy A State law allows the sale of up to an ounce of dried marijuana 16 ounces of potinfused solids 72 ounces of potinfused liquids or 7 grams of concentrated marijuana like hashish to adults over 21 whether youre a Washington resident or not But there isnt expected to be any infused food or drink available right away As of last week the Liquor Control Board had not issued any licenses to processors of those products or approved any edibles for sale Some stores are talking about limiting customers to one 2gram package apiece to make sure theres enough for everyone to buy some Q What took so long to get the stores open A Colorado already had a regulated medical marijuana system making for a smoother transition when it allowed those dispensaries to start selling to recreational pot shops on Jan 1 Washingtons medical system is unregulated so officials here were starting from scratch as they immersed themselves in the pot world and tried to come up with regulations that made sense for the industry and the public The regulations include protocols for testing marijuana what types of edibles should be allowed requirements for childresistant packaging how much criminal history is too much to get a license and what types of security systems pot shops and growers should have Ultimately though much of the delay can be attributed to overwhelming interest The liquor board received nearly 7000 applications from people who wanted to grow process or sell marijuana Each of them needs to be vetted with criminal and financial background checks reviews to ensure theyre not too close to a school or daycare and approval of their business and security plans Its time consuming work and the boards 18 licensing investigators have been swamped Q Where does the tax money go and whos paying for programs to prevent problems A The measure voters passed in 2012 directs 40 percent of the new revenues to the state general fund and local budgets with the rest dedicated to substanceabuse prevention research education and health care But tax revenue hasnt come in yet With sales about to start the state Health Department scraped together 400000 for a new radio and online advertisement campaign urging parents to talk to their kids about marijuana and visit wwwlearnaboutmarijuanawaorg,2014-07-08T02:20-04:00,drugs
Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/01/02/liberalisms-impact-america/,This is a rush transcript from The Five January 2 2014 This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated GREG GUTFELD COHOST Its so funny Its just a rash and its going away     Hello everyone Im Greg Gutfeld along with Kimberly Guilfoyle Beckel Eric Bolling and her New Years resolution is to stop eating butterflies   its Dana Perino This is of course The Five MUSIC GUTFELD So surprise surprise a new poll shows that we Yanks have almost no faith in government And only one in 20 say our government is OK That person is in scientific terms a moron He may be hosting at MSNBC Cheap shot So how can big government thrive when weve seen all the messes it lives Detroit DC Oakland Stockton Harrisburg Cleveland Baltimore on and on progressivism brings poverty Yet as it necrotizes all it invades we still let it infest New York City How come Well if you want to sell something bad youve got to change its name Wealth redistribution is called fairness Strangulation becomes regulation Tax is revenue Carter can then become Obama and Marion Barry is regifted as de Blasio Left success is reinventing failure by disguising disaster I call it heck change surgery So now we have the same old crew salivating over the Big Apple in New York City Mayor Giuliani and Bloomberg built a bionic magnet for business while slashing crime and saving thousands of minority lives It was an amazing feat So what do we hear this inauguration day A chaplain for the sanitation department they have one calling this city a plantation while Hillary looks on smiling And so the same old canard returned about the ignored poor and the greedy rich As you remember the dead cities the test subjects who died in their left wing labs We let another Dr Frankenstein disguised as Dr Wilby ph gets his hands on our healthiest patients And when this apple rot theyll once again call it progress and move on to another victim DANA PERINO COHOST Well happy New Year GUTFELD Yes yes I was gone for a week BOB BECKEL COHOST Nice to have you back Greg KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE COHOST Yes selflifting ph GUTFELD But Bob come on OK I dont know did you watch any of the inauguration GUILFOYLE I did BECKEL Watch the de Blasio inauguration GUTFELD Yes BECKEL No I was flying out to New York City GUTFELD I heard By the way Bob did a great job with you and had to walk home at 500 am BECKEL Thats correct GUTFELD Because there was nobody to pick you up You couldnt get a cab BECKEL Thats right PERINO It is 64 a minute CROSSTALK ERIC BOLLING COHOST I supposed thats what happens when de Blasio takes over GUTFELD Yes see first guy hurt is you the rich PERINO Wasnt it NYPD cop that recognized you though and let you through the crowd BECKEL Yes theyre very helpful Police were very helpful And Kimberly did a terrific job It was  believe me when Ill tell you it was complicated But anyway you know to dump all over government  its funny about government Nobody likes government unless they need it unless they use it GUTFELD Thats a good point BECKEL And if you ask people who are farmers if they want the agricultural subsidies theyll say yes You ask the senior citizens if they want their Social Security theyd say yes But if you ask them about government look in the face of all the stuff youve been hearing of course youre going to be negative about it But the last time they were positive about government was 50 years ago GUTFELD But heres  OK let me ask Kimberly because there was somebody you knew there that was applauding de Blasio Mr Newsom De Blasio is vowing to bring progressive vision to New York City Can you tell me where in New York City there is no progressivism GUILFOYLE Well thats the problem This is why I was so disappointed when I watched all of this inauguration today because I found it to be very negative not even acknowledging the tremendous accomplishments and the progressiveness in New York City I mean it was just so  you saw Bloomberg sitting in the front The look on his face said it all because they ran him into the ground they New York City people that live here everything was just like garbage you know youre not good enough You dont do anything This is a plantation My God if they think New York City is like that what they must think of the rest of the country GUTFELD Thats  you brought that up when we were in the green room What they said in front of Bloomberg whats  PERINO A mayor who worked for 12 Thats what he earned over eight years he got 12  or 12 years was it BECKEL Well hes a multibillionaire PERINO Right This is a guy who gave  he did all these great things from New York City Yes we make fun of the big gulp ban and from lifestyle things that he tried GUTFELD Were allowed to rip him PERINO But the crime rate stayed down and there wasnt a terrorist attack And you actually have  after the major recession of the financial shock business is coming back into the city And the stock market just ends with its best year Thats partly business climate he helped to create And then you have a prepared speech that insult him while hes sitting there Theres just no grace Theres no manners GUTFELD Yes it was funny GUILFOYLE And he paid for their house that theyre going to live in now Basically he out of his own pocket he remodeled the mansion Theyre going to move in and enjoy it Guess thats not bad BECKEL Thats chunk change GUILFOYLE Why dont they live in their own house Benefits too grandiose GUTFELD Eric I dont want to be too gloomy about this I mean look he appointed Bratton which is a good move The city is not going to let him fail or hes going to be out right BOLLING The city is not going to let de Blasio fail GUTFELD Yes BOLLING Well heres the problem I dont  clearly its a very liberal city But the problem is its a test case for every other liberal mayor in the country who wants to see how it works If you really push progressivism further and further left see if the city embraces see if business leave Really we have  weve made fun of Bloomberg over the years pretty harshly on this show and elsewhere but only for social issues only for his goofiness with big gulps and bans on salts and cigarettes and things like that but not for his business climate not for what he did for the economy Dana points out and makes a very good point that businesses  they felt comfortable coming back to New York after 911 because Bloomberg made it a businessfriendly environment De Blasio is not that guy De Blasio is the opposite of that De Blasio is the guy whos going to raise taxes and businesses right now especially Wall Street is going to go what do you mean youre going to raise it even more Were already paying 45 percent City tax along you jack that up even more for the corporate tax  CROSSTALK BECKEL Where theyre going to flee to Theyre going to  PERINO Florida CROSSTALK GUILFOYLE Florida New Jersey Texas BOLLING Theyre going to flee

find a place that doesnt increase taxes BECKEL You know theres one thing about revenue which is that in order to do what you need to do to make the government work you need revenue If rich people have to pay revenue screw them They ought to pay it GUTFELD Youre going to run out of rich people How do you make a rich person if you keep punishing them BECKEL They get a percentage of whats available Those in the middle and the bottom fall GUTFELD So they pay the majority of the taxes if you look at the actual  PERINO And then to the larger point of the monologue in regards to people feeling distrust in government at large I think part of that is because its not  I think there are some rich people who have said count me as somebody that wants to pay more taxes if they thought the reforms were going to actually work GUTFELD Right PERINO But the problem is people are distrustful of government because big programs that get ran through dont work And one of the things that hes  that de Blasio is focusing on is education preK through 12th grade education and free preschool for everybody GUTFELD Yes PERINO The problem is the schools that work the charters are the ones that are basically going to get  the ones that are working are the ones that are going to hurt in all of this GUTFELD Right Speaking  let  I want to play this sound on tape First its Clinton and then its de Blasio from yesterday because de Blasio said says something I think is interesting BEGIN VIDEO CLIP WILLAM J CLINTON FORMER PRESIDENT I strongly endorse Bill de Blasios core campaign commitment that we have to have a city of shared opportunities shared prosperity shared responsibilities MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO D NEW YORK We are called to put an end to economic and social inequalities that threaten

Really like weve been  like whats really going to change if they get more money I think thats the point of peoples distrust of government What is actually going to change BECKEL Do you believe that

to be successful in areas Here in this city its not here Can he do something about that I just wouldnt prejudge the guy You know here  PERINO You prejudged everybody else BOLLING No prejudging Hes

disorder What that is if you spend all your time around people who agree with you and laugh at your jokes all the time you dont know when youre saying something thats not decent So you make a joke like that and you assume everybody is going to laugh which they do but the rest of America is like going youre kind of a jerk Thats liberal consensus disorder The bigger point is everything for left

though I would accept this apology because to me it seems sincere I also dont want any child  black red green whatever whatever color  I dont want them to suffer from more of this I think lets Kieran Romney enjoy his great new family and all the love thats going to come his way And forget Melissa HarrisPerry and let her  forgive her that one crime BOLLING At one point she said wouldnt it be I

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/money/2013/09/01/before-marijuana-uruguay-battled-over-legalizing-whisky/,"MONTEVIDEO Uruguay  The government of Uruguay makes Scotch whisky It also makes and sells rum vodka and cognac and has done so for nearly a century Many people consider this sideline of the state to be an historical accident  a wasteful and even eccentric contradiction But President Jose Mujica says Uruguays long experience at the center of the nations liquor business makes it more than capable of dominating another substance marijuana Final Senate approval of Uruguays marijuana law is expected by late September and the government plans to license growers sellers and users as quickly as possible thereafter to protect them from criminal drug traffickers ruling party Sen Lucia Topolansky who is also Uruguays first lady told The Associated Press in an interview The law specifically creates a legal marijuana monopoly making the government alone responsible for importing producing obtaining storing commercializing and distributing a drug still considered illegal around the world A state entity will license producers and control marijuanas distribution and sale through the same neighborhood pharmacies that sell prescription medicines and toothpaste Purchases by licensed users will be limited to 40 grams 14 ounces a month Potgrowing cooperatives will be encouraged using governmentapproved seeds and people registered with the state will be able to grow up to six plants at home for personal use as long as they harvest no more than 480 grams 17 ounces a year The project passed the House by just one vote and while the ruling Broad Front coalition has an easier majority in the Senate Mujica has been campaigning actively for its passage reminding Uruguayans that their government has been controlling the market for addictive substances ever since the beginning of the 20th century when President Jose Batlle y Ordonez wanted the state to monopolize alcohol production Don Jose Batlle y Ordonez had courage Mujica said in one of his folksy nationwide radio talks which sound much like the fireside chats that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt used to broadcast to Americans The state grabbed it and made a monopoly of alcohol because it couldnt stop the booze and he said at least dont poison the people  the booze should be good Batlle y Ordonez was ahead of his time in promoting social change inLatinAmerica from the separation of church and state to the eighthour workday and maternity leave And he had several goals for alcohol He wanted the whisky to generate government revenues and guarantee a profit stream for farmers funding the production of a national fuel so that Uruguays cars and trucks wouldnt need imported gasoline Uruguay wasnt alone in that fight In 1925 Henry Ford was promoting alcohol as the fuel of the future and it was being blended with gasoline from France to the Philippines But like many other countries Uruguay never achieved this energy independence Oil companies won an intense global campaign to focus on fossil fuels a trend that held until Brazil started using alcohol blends in the 1980s Batlle y Ordonez died in 1929 without seeing his dreams realized but his spirit as a statesman inspired Uruguays congress two years later to create Ancap a state fuel and hardliquor monopoly that still refines imported oil and distills liquor at sidebyside plants in Montevideo today Ancaps whisky sales peaked at 332000 liters 88000 gallons a year in 1970 but then it began bleeding money In 1996 it lost its monopoly on distilled spirits By 2002 President Jorge Batlle  the grandnephew of Batlle y Ordonez  decided to create a new privately administered Ancap subsidiary to manage the stateheld company making it nimble enough to cut costs Now it has 60 employees and generates nearly 1 million a year in profits without any state subsidies Topolansky agrees that whiskymaking is a good model for the marijuana project Back then people were making wood alcohol and other very toxic blends So the government said the people are going to keep drinking but we have to offer a quality product that doesnt carry dangerous sideeffects And the state took over production Topolansky explained She said they need to do the same with marijuana which has long been legal to use but not to sell in Uruguay  a situation she said puts people at the mercy of dangerous criminals Marijuana consumers go to dealers where they sell it mixed with more addictive substances or they sell them something else Its a clandestine world where we cant enter The state needs to regulate this market like it did before with alcohol she said The government says its goal is to lower marijuana consumption in Uruguay by strictly regulating a legal market for it and punishing those who grow sell or use it illegally Controlling alcohol use will help said Uruguays drug czar Julio Calzada His agency considers alcohol to be a gateway substance for marijuana so another bill before Congress would limit beer wine and liquor advertising and ban nighttime sales in places other than bars and restaurants Calzada told the AP that many students in Uruguay drink dangerous quantities of alcohol and that the numbers are getting worse in 2006 one of every four had been dangerously intoxicated by last year as many as one in every three got seriously ill from alcohol But Calzada doesnt blame the state liquor factory for these behavioral problems On the contrary he says it deserves credit for eliminating dangerous brews The state was able to drive out those making wood alcohol and poisoning the people just as Mujica said Today we have to take action with marijuana because those who buy it dont know what theyre buying just the same as what happened with people buying alcohol in 1930 Follow us ontwittercomfoxnewslatino

Fox,http://www.foxbusiness.com/economy-policy/2014/11/04/2014-mid-terms-could-shift-dc-balance-power/,In a historic rebuke of Democratic incumbents Republican challengers are projected to have picked up seven Senate seats in Tuesdays elections decidedly shifting the balance of power in Congress to the GOP Republicans are poised to replace Democrats in North Carolina Iowa Montana Colorado Arkansas South Dakota and West Virgina according to Fox News projections Polls suggested Republicans could gain control of the Senate by winning six elections to gain a majority of 51 seats The seventh seat adds emphasis to the GOP victories And there could be another depending on the outcome of a runoff in Louisiana next month Since the GOP was widely expected to maintain its majority in the House of Representatives  and did  the shift in the Senate will leave President Barack Obama  and all of his highest priorities  isolated by a Congress ruled by Republicans in both chambers The question is whether a Republicancontrolled Congress facing off against a secondterm Democratic president will break the political gridlock that has all but stalled important policy decisions in Washington for years leaving much of the electorate deeply frustrated cynical and increasingly disillusioned Peter Cardillo chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital Management said a Republican victory could lead to less gridlock and more probusiness legislation Specifically Cardillo said corporate tax reform and immigration legislation would likely move to the top of a GOP priority list as Democratic efforts to raise the minimum wage get shelved These are all things that could benefit labor markets Cardillo said Some influential voices on Wall Street are skeptical however that a shift in the balance of power in Congress will have much immediate impact on breaking through the longstanding political logjam Whatever the outcome of Tuesdays election no progress is likely to be made on the key issues of corporate tax reform immigration reform or entitlement reform before the 2016 presidential election David Kelly chief global strategist at JP Morgan Funds said This is quite important in the medium term for US investors since without real efforts to increase both labor and capital supply the US economy is likely to run into a significant capacity constraint in the next two years leading to higher inflation and interest rates Kelly added Meanwhile in New Hampshire Fox News is projecting that Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen will beat Republican challenger Scott Brown in one of the more closelywatched races of this election And in Louisiana in another race that could determine the strength of the GOPs Senate majority Fox News is projecting that the Senate race will go to a runoff on December 6 Based on exit polling Fox projects that threeterm Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu and Republican challenger Bill Cassidy will both fail to exceed 50 of the vote tonight so neither can claim an outright win in Louisianas socalled jungle primary Heres a roundup of the Senate flips from Democrat to Republican In North Carolina Fox projects that Thom Tillis a Republican member of the state legislature will oust US Senator Kay Hagan a firstterm Democrat in a closely fought race that saw spending top 100 million Those turnovers are in addition to an earlier pick up in West Virginia where Republican Shelley Moore Capito defeated her Democratic opponent for seat held by Democrats for nearly three decades Candidates and those with a vested interest in the results have spent 4 billion seeking votes a record for a midterm election A WinWin Situation for Stock Markets A call for raising the minimum wage one supported by President Obama and many Democrats is another hot button issue that has yet to be resolved In the shortterm continued gridlock could actually benefit investors because stock markets have been moving higher in recent years despite Washington dysfunction Maintaining the status quo of a dysfunctional Congress would mean the markets would continue to respond solely to economic data and Federal Reserve policy rather than politicallydriven legislation Its a winwin situation for the stock markets Cardillo said Republicans have not controlled the Senate since 2006 ahead of President Obamas election two years later Control of the Senate may not be determined for months however if individual candidates in Louisiana and Georgia fail to collect more than 50 of the vote forcing runoffs in December and January respectively According to the latest polls Democratic incumbents are battling to retain their seats in Alaska Arkansas Louisiana and North Carolina states in which Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney defeated Obama in the 2012 election Given Obamas plummeting approval ratings voters in those states could play a key role in shifting the balance of power in Congress Other incumbent Senators facing tough reelection bids are Colorado Democrat Mark Udall and Republicans Pat Roberts of Kansas and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky who would replace Nevada Democrat Harry Reid as Senate Majority leader if the GOP gains control of Congress upper house McConnell won his election against Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes The only question related to House races was whether and by how much Republicans would increase their majority All 435 seats were at play and a gain of 13 additional seats would leave the GOP with its largest majority since 1946 Weak Economic Recovery Could Boost GOP With the presidents approval rating hovering at around 40 many Democratic candidates chose to distance themselves from Obamas sixyear legacy in particular Obamas signature piece of legislation the Affordable Care Act which sought to reform the nations health care system but has come under harsh criticism from opponents of all political persuasions In addition many voters are likely to hold the president and his party responsible for an economy that hasnt recovered as quickly as many would have preferred While the headline unemployment rate has fallen sharply in the past few years wages have been stagnant and many Americans have been forced to accept temporary jobs or parttime positions Significant numbers of Americans have also dropped out of the workforce altogether out of frustration in finding a good paying job with benefits The labor force participation rate a key economic indicator for the health of US labor markets is at its lowest level since the 1970s Elsewhere across the country 36 states will elect governors in races that could potentially impact the 2016 Presidential election notably in Wisconsin where incumbent Republican Gov Scott Walker defeated his Democratic opponent In Rhode Island Fox News is projecting that state Treasurer Gina Raimondo a Democrat will beat Cranston Mayor Allan Fung a Republican to replace retiring Democratic Governor Lincoln Chaffee a former GOP Senator In those 36 gubernatorial contests an unusual number of incumbents appeared to be struggling heading into the election While Obama raised millions of dollars for Democratic candidates over the past two years many candidates chose not to be photographed with the president for fear of alienating voters who have grown disillusioned with the president

Fox,http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2011/02/08/medical-marijuana-sellers-money-bank/,April 20 or 420 or 420 has become an unofficial day of celebration on which pot smokers gather in events across the country to call for marijuanas legalization But those who already sell the drug legally under state laws allowing medical marijuana are often finding that the federal ban on the drug puts their access to financial services at risk The legal gray area theyre in makes big banks wary or downright hostile to them so their bank accounts can sometimes go up in smoke Alpine Herbal Wellness in Denver has been open just 10 months and coowner Sue Harank has already switched banks four times Two banks and a credit union closed her account with just a couple of weeks notice Its been one heck of a nightmare says Harank who recently opened a bank account and switched her credit card account to Colorado Springs State Bank the only bank in the state now openly offering accounts to those in the medical marijuana industry Shes far from alone People have gotten their credit card accounts shut down without them even knowing it Harank says And its not just Colorado thats been hit Don Duncan California director of the advocacy group Americans for Safe Access and a member of the board of the medical marijuana collective Los Angeles Patients and Caregivers Group in West Hollywood says his own account was shut down about a year ago Hes heard many similar stories around the state They just summarily close accounts Banks are very unsure if its OK to do business with medical cannabis organizations It ripples out to credit card and merchant services accounts Merchant services accounts let vendors accept credit cards Federal State Laws Conflict The main sticking point is the clash between federal and state marijuana laws According to the lobbying group NORML the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws 16 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical use But the US Drug Enforcement Agency classifies cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug meaning it has a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use California and Colorado are far ahead of the pack when it comes to establishing medical marijuana dispensaries with hundreds of these facilities in the two states Last spring Rep Jared Polis DColo and 14 other members of Congress sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner seeking reassurance for financial institutions Among the letters signatories were Barney Frank DMass and former presidential candidate Ron Paul RTexas The two are cosponsors of a bill to repeal the federal law that makes marijuana use a crime and instead allow states to decide whether to legalize the drug The letter to Geithner asks his office to issue formal written guidance for financial institutions assuring that Department priorities do not include targeting or pursuing institutions whose account holders are involved in a business ostensibly operating in compliance with a state medical marijuana law No response has been received Duncan says In contrast US Attorney General Eric Holder issued a memo in October 2009 telling federal prosecutors they should not focus federal resources in your states onindividuals whose actions are in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana Big Banks Back Away Yet many banks are either hesitant to enter the fray or have backed away after initially offering accounts to medical marijuana dispensaries A representative of Wells Fargo which previously offered accounts to such businesses said in a statement to CreditCardscom In view of the complex inconsistent legal environment relating to medical marijuana dispensaries Wells Fargo Regional Banking has opted not to bank these businesses While medical marijuana dispensaries are legal in some states they are still illegal under federal lawThe policy extends to all medical marijuana dispensaries and based on our customer information we have advised all such businesses that bank with us that they will need to close their deposit accounts Additionally it has been our policy not to provide merchant card processing services to businesses of this type Entrepreneurs See Budding Opportunity Instead smaller companies are stepping in to fill the merchant card processing gap In January MarijuanaPOScom based in Los Angeles announced it was offering merchant account services with a focus on providing debit and credit card processing services to the medical marijuana industry Jesse Cretaro marketing director for MarijuanaPOScom said the company has been in business around six months and has about a dozen medical marijuana collectives signed up for its services He said his company works with banks that accept highrisk clients even though he thinks the higher risk is going into a medical marijuana collective and paying cash which can be a lure for robbers Martin Khemmoro executive vice president of Direct Bancard of Livonia Mich which also provides services to the medical marijuana industry says some of the merchant services processors his company works with are overseas Hes found some medical marijuana dispensaries bill themselves as a vitamin shop or herbal shop in order to get financial services Khemmoro says his business processes credit card payments handles gift cards and rewards cards along with pointofsale systems to keep track of inventory patients and sales Smaller Banks Better Prospects Lance Ott chief executive officer of Guardian Data Systems in Thousand Oaks Calif says smaller domestic banks and credit unions may be more likely than larger financial institutions to service the medical marijuana industry Though in some cases bigger banks will essentially grandfather in existing accounts but not accept new ones Theres a huge stigma associated with the industry Guardian Data Systems offers services such as credit card and debit card processing gift and loyalty card programs online payment processing for merchandise  such as clothing  financial reporting and inventory tracking For the past three years Otts been trying to offer honest secure services to an emerging industry and he says he only works with those businesses that are licensed and set up properly under state law That matches the desire of people like Duncan and Harank Duncan says clinics that are on the up and up want to operate with transparency But all the controversy over financial services forces banking into the shadows Merchant service accounts often are administered through third parties and tend to come under less scrutiny than banks he says Harank says when she switched her bank account to Colorado Springs State Bank she also brought the bank her credit card business rather than remaining with a thirdparty processor Accepting credit cards is critical for our business she says as they serve as a convenience for customers One recent day every transaction at Alpine Herbal Wellnessx was done via credit card Duncan says We just want to obey the law and do whats normal At the end of the day were

  field paled in comparison to his handling of AllPro linebacker Aldon Smith The troubled Smith was taken into custody Friday morning for suspicion of DUI 
  after running his truck into a tree at 7 am where cops allegedly found the 
  Missouri product with his foot still on the accelerator Smith blew a 15 on his breathalyzer test  almost double the legal limit in 
  California  and marijuana also was found in the vehicle It was the second time Smith had been arrested on DUI chargers over the last 
  20 months a time frame which includes an incident in which Smith was stabbed 
  at a house party And understand Smiths latest transgression happened despite the fact he was 
  scheduled to be at the 49ers facility for meetings and practice by 8 am This is a kid whose life is clearing spiraling out of control but the arrest 
  actually gave the star pass rusher a chance to sober up and by noon he was 
  bailed out and back on the practice field with his team a black mark on what 
  has been quite a honeymoon for Harbaugh in the Bay Area Common sense still hadnt taken hold by Sunday and Smith played in all 67 of 
  San Franciscos defensive snaps against the Colts with Harbaugh and the 49ers 
  hiding behind the collective bargaining agreement which to be fair did take a 
  suspension off the table The CBA says only the league can suspend players for substanceabuse issues 
  something that will assuredly happen once the case itself is adjudicated That said Harbaugh could have easily taken a stand as both a football coach 
  and a human being by simple deactivating Smith Instead he placed a win over 
  his old friend Luck above all else including the health and wellbeing of one 
  of his top players Dont think so Back in 2012 Demarcus Dobbs a San Francisco specialteams player was 
  arrested on a Friday and charged with DUI and marijuana possession Dobbs 
  never made the trip to St Louis for the scheduled game over the weekend Harbaugh is hardly the first coach to have a different set of rules for great 
  players but he was the only one twisting his own ethos into a pretzel on 
  Sunday The sole reason Smith is playing is because they care more about winning a 
  childs game than what a man does with his life outspoken former Vikings 
  punter Chris Kluwe said via Twitter After getting their one last pound of flesh from the troubled Smith the 
  Niners finally moved to the public relations phase of their specious plan 
  confirming Smith would be taking an indefinite leave with reports surfacing 
  hes agreed to enter an inpatient facility to deal with his problems I think this was the best thing for Aldon said 49ers CEO Jed York And 
  again theres no right answer here Actually there was a right answer and it was a pretty easy one take a 180 
  degree turn from what San Francisco actually did We feel like there was no right decision York continued There was no 
  right way to do it but this was in our opinion the best way to do it Were 
  going to support Aldon to the fullest as long as hes willing to support 
  himself and work towards making things right Thats lip service Harbaugh York and the Niners organization already tipped their hands on what 
  they think of Smith by playing him against the Colts Hes a disposable prop 
  to help them win games on Sunday Its up to Smith and Smith alone to get the help he desperately needs This is a problem and its something that I will get fixed Smith said 
  Ill do everything in my power to make sure that this never happens again I 
  also wanted to let everybody know that once again Im sorry and like I said

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/01/13/feds-crack-down-on-colorado-medical-pot-dispensaries/, US prosecutors in Colorado started a crackdown against nearly two dozen medical marijuana dispensaries located within 1000 feet of schools giving the proprietors 45 days to cease operations or face civil and criminal penalties US Attorney John Walsh issued the ultimatum in letters to 23 dispensaries and landlords he said were in violation of federal and state law a statement Thursday from the US Justice Department said     The move makes Colorado the latest battleground pitting federal prosecutors against storefront distributors of marijuana in states that have decriminalized marijuana for medical purposes When the voters of Colorado passed the limited medical marijuana amendment in 2000 they could not have anticipated that their vote would be used to justify large marijuana stores located within blocks of our schools Walsh said He cited a 2011 memo from US Deputy Attorney General James Cole that allows individual federal prosecutors to exercise their discretion to handle marijuana trafficking matters The Colorado move followed an announcement in October by federal prosecutors in California that they were cracking down on medical pot dispensaries they said were fronts for largescale forprofit drug trafficking Last March federal agents also raided greenhouses and dispensaries in 13 cities in Montana cited by authorities as operating illegally under the guise of that states medical marijuana law A month later US attorneys in Washington state issued a legal opinion threatening to prosecute not only dispensary owners and growers but state officials who would have enforced a proposed state licensing system for medical marijuana Washington Governor Christine Gregoire cited that warning in her decision to veto a bill to establish a new regulatory system for statesanctioned suppliers of medicinal cannabis A total of 16 states and the District of Columbia have enacted some sort of legalized medicalmarijuana statutes according to the National Drug Policy Alliance But cannabis remains classified as an illegal narcotic under federal law a point Walsh underscored in his letter to Colorado dispensary operators The dispensary is operating in violation of federal law and the Department of Justice has the authority to enforce the federal law  even when such activities may be permitted under state law the letter said Walsh did not identify any of the letters recipients except to say the businesses were located throughout the state Denver lawyer Robert Corry who represents clients charged with marijuana offenses said in recent testimony before the Denver City Council that there should be no arbitrary distance limits for legal marijuana businesses There is no documented case of any child ever purchasing or obtaining medical marijuana from a dispensary he said Nevertheless Walsh said law enforcement will be on the lookout for other violators and offenders could be subject to asset seizure and property forfeitures Those who do not comply will be subject to potential criminal prosecution and civil enforcement actions Walsh said Because the stores are operating within 1000 feet of a school enhanced penalties apply under federal law,2012-01-13T07:44-05:00,drugs
Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2013/09/26/slumping-kaepernick-leads-4ers-into-st-louis/,"Jim Harbaugh was hoping for a little Luck against his old    college quarterback last week Instead he got a giant distraction from his    troubled AllPro linebacker And now the reigning NFC champion San Francisco 49ers head to Americas 
  heartland underwater as they prepare to face off with the St Louis Rams on 
  Thursday night Andrew Lucks return to the Bay Area was a smashing success much to the 
  chagrin of his college mentor Harbaugh The exStanford star ran for a 
  touchdown while putting together an efficient performance under center as the 
  Indianapolis Colts clamped down defensively on their way to an impressive 277 
  victory over the 49ers at Candlestick Park Luck completed 18of27 passes for 164 yards and did not turn the ball over in 
  outplaying young counterpart Colin Kaepernick while getting a big assist from 
  a Colts defense that held the struggling 49ers offense to 254 total yards and 
  kept Kaepernick firmly under wraps One week after committing four turnovers in a 293 loss at Seattle Kaepernick 
  managed just 150 yards on 13of27 passing while being intercepted once and 
  losing a fumble We have to be better Kaepernick said I have to be better I have to be 
  able to make throws down the field Frank Gore finished with 82 rushing yards on 11 attempts for San Francisco 
  12 which fell under 500 for the first time in the threeyear tenure of 
  Harbaugh And Harbaugh was a loser on two fronts in Week 3 as his misstep on the 
  football field paled in comparison to his handling of Aldon Smith who was 
  taken into custody the Friday morning before the game for suspicion of DUI 
  after running his truck into a tree at 7 am Smith blew a 15 on his breathalyzer test  almost double the legal limit in 
  California  and marijuana also was found in the vehicle It was the second 
  time Smith had been arrested on DUI chargers over the last 20 months a time 
  frame which includes an incident in which Smith was stabbed at a house party So with Smiths life clearly spiraling out of control he was bailed out and 
  back on the practice field with his team hours after the incident a black 
  mark on what has been quite a honeymoon for Harbaugh in the Bay Area Common sense still hadnt taken hold by Sunday and Smith played in all 67 of 
  San Franciscos defensive snaps against the Colts with Harbaugh and the 49ers 
  hiding behind the collective bargaining agreement which to be fair did take a 
  suspension off the table The CBA says only the league can suspend players for substanceabuse issues 
  something that will assuredly happen once the case itself is adjudicated That 
  said Harbaugh could have easily taken a stand as both a football coach and a 
  human being by simple deactivating Smith After the game the team announced he would be taking an indefinite leave of 
  absence to seek help for a substanceabuse problem and by Monday Smith was on 
  the reservenonfootball injury list I am taking a leave of absence to address my health Smith said in a 
  statement on Monday I am sorry that I have affected my team my family and 
  the organization I will do everything in my power to handle this situation 
  the best way possible I appreciate the support of the 49ers and our fans The Rams have their own concerns and they usually start with Cowboys running 
  back DeMarco Murray a mildmannered Clark Kenttype against the rest of the 
  league before slipping into a phone booth and transforming to Superman against 
  St Louis Murray exploded for 175 yards and a touchdown on 26 carries while Tony Romo 
  threw for three scores as Dallas pounded St Louis 317 last Sunday in Week 
  3 action In his previous effort against the Rams back on Oct 23 2011 in Arlington a 
  thenrookie Murray filled in for an injured Felix Jones and ripped off a 
  franchiserecord 253 yards on the ground breaking Emmitt Smiths mark of 237 
  yards along with the singlegame Dallas freshman record of 206 yards held by 
  Tony Dorsett We didnt run it we didnt stop the run we didnt throw it we didnt stop 
  the passing game Rams coach Jeff Fisher said They are a good football 
  team I didnt see this coming This is a defining moment for us right now 
  Weve got to get past this and get ready for the 49ers Sam Bradford ended up 29of48 for 240 yards passing and a TD pass to Austin 
  Pettis for the Rams 12 who have dropped two in a row overall In the first half we just never got anything going played behind the chains 
  all day Bradford said Just a very poor performance on our part In fact St Louis performed so poorly it had a closed door meeting after the 
  contest in an effort to stave off any dissension This is the NFL I hate to state the obvious Im not trying to No team is 
  beyond getting beat any given day and beat badly defensive end Chris Long 
  said I dont think we didnt prepare well Guys just didnt execute and 
  perform We are going to stick together Those things are between coaches and players 
  We have to stick together Nobody is going to come in here and save the day 
  It is on us to change things The Rams and 49ers have met twice annually since 1950 and Thursday nights 
  contest will be the 127th regularseason game between the teams The Rams hold 
  a slight lead in the alltime series 62613 WHAT TO WATCH FOR Some of the concerns when Harbaugh benched Alex Smith for Kaepernick in 2012 
  are finally starting to surface While the move was undeniably a success 
  because San Francisco reached Super Bowl XLVII with the dynamic Kaepernick at 
  the helm the thirdyear player has struggled the past two weeks with his top 
  weapons sidelined The setback in Seattle during Week 2 could be written off a bit because the 
  Seahawks are so dominant at home and have the NFLs best secondary Losing to 
  the Colts at Candlestick set off a few alarms however Indianapolis was a playoff team in 2012 thanks in large part to Luck but the 
  defense is still a work in progress so Kaepernicks inability to get anything 
  going even without his fieldstretchers has to be a concern and more than a 
  few have speculated Smith the current starter in Kansas City who is 2251 
  in his last 28 NFL starts would have gamemanaged San Francisco to a win in 
  that one Footballs not easy There are struggles Harbaugh said Thats one of the 
  things you enjoy about the game that there are struggles Weve got some 
  adversity theres no question about it And well also have the rare 
  opportunity of staring adversity in the face and whipping it Thats our 
  goal Star receiver Michael Crabtree isnt coming back anytime soon and speedy tight 
  end Vernon Davis continues to be slowed by a hamstring injury although he was 
  back at practice on Monday in a limited fashion indicating there is at least a 
  chance he will be ready by Thursday His presence will be key because opposing 
  defenders are starting to realize they can sit on veteran Anquan Boldins 
  routes and neither Kyle Williams or rookie Quinton Patton are consistent 
  enough to pop the top on the other side Well you never lay it on one spot Harbaugh said when discussing the 
  receivers If were talking offensively precision needs to be better and 
  that falls under everybodys purview So well try one more thing As always 
  theres another thing to try and you go back to work and see if you cant 
  improve and fix St Louis has one of the games best playmakers at cornerback in Janoris 
  Jenkins while Cortland Finnegan is the kind of pesky veteran who can get under 
  the opponents skin Theyre a good football team Fisher said of the Niners What they did last 
  year is indicative of that You dont get to where they got last year without 
  being able to overcome adversity They were a few plays away from winning the 
  world championship last year Weve got our hands full Regardless of whos 
  coming or whos not theyre going to be ready to play Defensively for San Francisco Smith is gone for now and fellow AllPro Patrick 
  Willis is also likely to be sidelined during the short week with a groin 
  issue Smith of course has been one of the NFLs premier pass rushers since being 
  taken by San Francisco with the seventh overall pick of the 2011 draft He 
  notched 14 sacks during his rookie season then ranked second in the league 
  with 19 12 sacks last year while helping the 49ers to an appearance in the 
  Super Bowl Willis is a sixtime AllPro and the leader of the San Francisco 
  defensive unit Bradford has to be able to take advantage of the situation but needs some kind 
  of running game as a complement Starter Daryl Richardson injured his foot in 
  the first quarter at Dallas after rushing for just 35 yards on 10 carries in 
  Week 2 Backup Isiah Pead has shown some wiggle as a receiver but not much as 
  a runner at his point Obviously its very important Rams offensive coordinator Brian 
  Schottenheimer said when asked about sparking the run game  I think you look 
  at both games last year against the 49ers we ran the ball pretty well Its 
  never an easy task against them They play with great fundamentals and 
  technique but we need to get the running game going OVERALL ANALYSIS Last year these two teams tied in their first meeting which took 
  place in San Francisco and St Louis won the rematch on an overtime field 
  goal by Greg Zuerlein For whatever reason the Rams tend to play better in divisional action Rams QB 
  Sam Bradford is 511 in his past seven starts against NFC West foes and 
  match up well with the more talented Niners This may be an example where St 
  Louis was clearly looking past Dallas a week ago to this game Weve been on the losing end of a lot of games in the rivalry this 
  organization has Fisher said Now last year we got our feet back on the 
  map but I dont think theres a rivalry yet Its a division opponent Its a 
  big challenge for us on a short week but I dont necessarily see it as a 
  rivalry yet Hopefully well become one Sports Network Predicted Outcome Rams 20 49ers 17    ",2013-09-26T14:41-04:00,drugs

scrutiny More and more having premium pot delivered to your door in California is not a crime It is a legitimate business Marijuana has transformed California Since the state became the first to legalize the drug for medicinal use the weed the federal government puts in the same category as heroin and cocaine has become a major economic force No longer relegated to the underground pot in California these days props up local economies mints millionaires and feeds a thriving industry of startups designed to grow market and distribute the drug Based on the quantity of marijuana authorities seized last year the crop was worth an estimated 17 billion or more dwarfing any other sector of the states agricultural economy Experts say most of that marijuana is still sold as a recreational drug on the black market But more recently the plant has put down deep financial roots in highly visible taxpaying businesses Stores that sell hightech marijuana growing equipment Pot clubs that pay rent and hire workers Marijuana themed magazines and food products Chains of forprofit clinics with doctors who specialize in medical marijuana recommendations The plants prominence does not come without costs say some critics Marijuana plantations in remote forests cause severe environmental damage Indoor grow houses in some towns put rentals beyond the reach of students and young families Rural counties with declining economies cannot attract new businesses because the available work force is caught up in the pot industry Authorities link the drug to violent crime in otherwise quiet small towns For those of us who are on the front lines its not about pot is bad in itself or drugs are bad said Meredith Lintott district attorney in Mendocino County one of the countrys top marijuanaproducing regions Its about the negative consequences on children Its about the negative consequences on the environment Still the sheer scale of the overall pot economy has some

cultivated throughout California the most prized crops come from the forested mountains and hidden valleys of Mendocino Humboldt and Trinity counties  the Emerald Triangle The economic impact of so much pot is difficult to gauge Authorities say the largest grows are run by Mexican drug cartels that simply funnel money from forestraised crops back into their own bank accounts Still marijuana money from outdoor and indoor plots inevitably flows into local coffers Marijuana increases residents retail buying power by about 58 million countywide according to a Mendocino County report The county ranks 48th out of 58 counties in median income but by counting pot proceeds could jump as high as 18th Businesses benefit from momandpop growers who cultivate pot to supplement their incomes and from marijuana plantation workers who descend on the Emerald Triangle from all over the country for the fall harvest Pot trimmers can earn more than 40 per hour In Ukiah the countys largest city

many choices she says Californias green rush was spurred by a voterapproved law 13 years ago that authorized patients with a doctors recommendation to possess and cultivate marijuana for personal use Although a dozen other states have adopted similar laws California is the only one where privately owned pot shops have flourished Los Angeles County alone has more than 400 pot dispensaries and delivery services nearly twice as many outlets as Amsterdam the Netherlands capital whose coffee shops have for decades been synonymous with freemarket marijuana Promoted as a way to shield people with AIDS cancer and anorexia who use marijuana from prosecution the 1996 Compassionate Use Act also permitted limited possession for any other illness for which marijuana provides relief The broad language opened the door to doctors willing to recommend pot for nearly any ailment In a survey of nearly 2500 patients longtime Berkeley medical marijuana advocate Dr Tod Mikuriya found that almost threequarters of the patients used the drug for pain relief or mental health issues Dispensaries began selling marijuana although they were risking federal charges Some operators have become less fearful since US Attorney General Eric Holder said this year that the Justice Department would not target pot operations following state laws reducing the risk of random federal raids that existed under the Bush administration Californias pot dispensaries now have more in common with a corner grocery than a speakeasy They advertise freely offering discount coupons and daily specials Justin

generate 990 million annually through a 50perounce fee for retailers and 392 million in sales taxes The state now collects 18 million each year in taxes on medical marijuana The state would not start collecting taxes on marijuana under Ammianos bill until the federal government lifts its restrictions on the drug Thats not enough for propot activists who want Californians to vote next year on a proposal that would allow adults to legally possess up to one ounce of pot and allow cities to sell and tax the drug Local governments are malnourished and in need of revenue badly said Aaron Smith state policy director for the Marijuana Policy Project which advocates legalization Theres this multibilliondollar industry thats the elephant in the room that theyre not able to tap into Lintott the

production as they already do bulk wine grapes advocates argue Pot prices would fall dramatically forcing growers to abandon costly clandestine operations that authorities say trash the land and steal

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/06/06/colorado-new-black-market-pot-legalization-causing-headaches-for-surrounding/, States are fighting a new kind of border battle against marijuana trafficking The weed used to come from Mexico  now its coming from Colorado Ever since Colorado legalized pot law enforcement officers in surrounding states have noticed a surge in marijuana being brought across state lines     And its causing headaches as the other states face rising costs associated with arresting and processing those who mistakenly think they can get away with transporting marijuana purchased legally in Colorado One of the arguments for legalizing marijuana in Colorado and Washington state  was to reduce the black market said Tom Gorman who heads a multistate task force called the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area In fact the legalized marijuana has become the black market for other states Mark Overman the sheriff for Scotts Bluff County in Nebraska said the trafficking is likely an unintended consequence of Colorados decision last November but it was a completely predictable consequence Like other parts of the nation Overman says theres always been illegal marijuana in his county which sits some 50 miles north of the Colorado border in Nebraska He says the main source used to be international Primarily it was coming from Mexico and drug trafficking organizations in Mexico But probably starting in about 2012 was when we really became aware of the Colorado connection Most of the areas that border Colorado are rural and officials in those regions now say dealing with all the marijuana coming out of Colorado is breaking their small budgets Putting people in jail prosecuting them that costs us money Overman said Officers go to court thats overtime We may have to defend these people and were paying for their defense in many cases Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning said he wont rule out the possibility of taking Colorado to court to ask for reimbursement for the costs of dealing with a problem its neighbor created The feds are keeping an eye on the issue In August of last year the Justice Department issued a press release addressing the legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington Despite the fact the drug is still illegal at the federal level the department said it had informed the governors of both states that it is deferring its right to challenge their legalization laws at this time as long as certain conditions were met One of those conditions was implementing effective measures to prevent diversion of marijuana outside of the regulated system and to other states Eight months later Michele Leonhart head of the Drug Enforcement Administration told the Senate Judiciary Committee the amount of legal marijuana crossing Colorados state lines is definitely increasing The trends are what us in law enforcement had expected would happen she told the committee In a statement to Fox News the DEA said Our efforts will continue to be guided by the enforcement priorities set forth in the August 29 2013 guidance memorandum which include preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states Denver criminal defense attorney Sean McAllister a spokesman for the Colorado chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws said profiling of people with Colorado license plates makes the problem look worse than it is I know of several instances of clients of mine that have told me that first thing that theyre asked when theyre pulled over in Kansas is Hey youre from Colorado Wheres the marijuana he said  He added I think that there is an inherent bias in law enforcement against marijuana and theyre looking for reasons to show that legalization is a problem So they want to stop people and profile people to show that all these people are bringing marijuana from Colorado Gorman called that theory interesting but basically a bunch of bull He said On a traffic stop the officer comes up finds something suspicious maybe a smell or something like that So its kind of random And they estimate we get about 10 percent of what gets through Overman who heads a narcotics task force in western Nebraska also denies that people with Colorado license plates are being targeted Were not profiling anybody and we havent mounted any large offensive to get Colorado marijuana Were just finding it more often In fact Overman points out When you  look at our data most of the people we are apprehending with Colorado marijuana are not from Colorado The top five states does not include Colorado cars The sheriff said people know marijuana is legal in Colorado so they go there get it and

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/04/01/uruguay-legal-pot-to-be-tracked-using-genetic-markers/,"MONTEVIDEO Uruguay AP  Colorado and Washington are grappling with how to track legal marijuana But they could learn a thing or two from a country south of the border Uruguays drug czar says every legal marijuana plant in Uruguay will be registered and tracked using radio frequency tags and that stategrown marijuana will be cloned to include genetic markers making sure that whats grown here stays here Thats a much tougher tracking system than those imposed in Colorado and Washington which recently legalized marijuana use Unlike those US states Uruguay wants authorities to be able to test the pot in any drug users possession to determine if it came from a registered legal source Colorado and Washington also are trying to tag and track plants grown for commercial use But neither state plans to track the pot once sold These states allow adults over 21 to possess up to 1 ounce 28 grams without requiring them to prove they got it from a legal source Many other US states with medical marijuana laws allow pot possession by licensed patients and their police have no standard way of knowing where the product came from or how a user got it Uruguay is the first country in the world to develop a legal nationwide marijuana market The law approved Dec 10 will enable any registered adult to buy up to 14 ounces 40 grams a month in pharmacies or join a marijuana growing club or grow their own pot plants  as many as six per family harvesting no more than 17 ounces 480 grams a year The rules for Uruguays official marijuana market will be published next month but the first governmentgrown plants wont be ready for harvest until the end of the year National Drug Commission President Julio Calzada said in an interview with The Associated Press It will take that long to harvest genetically identical pot from cloned plants whose products can be identified as legal by the authorities he said Uruguay will use radiofrequency tags to track plants and products similar to the Marijuana Inventory Tracking System Colorado began using on Jan 1 for commercially grown weed Calzada said Uruguay already uses the same technology to track beef from field to store shelves Colorados system calls for each commercial marijuana seedling to get a tag when it reaches 8 inches 20 centimeters or gets replanted in a pot at least 2 inches 5 centimeters wide The tags emit a highfrequency radio signal with unique information that can be verified using an electronic reader from several meters away The tags also have scannable bar codes and other identifying information Washington state has a different tracking system that promises to follow its commercial marijuana from seed to sale But no US state is attempting what Uruguay plans to do in terms of policing a legal marijuana marketplace For example Colorado allows adults to grow their own pot at home with no requirements to tag or register those plants or vouch for where they came from and adults are free to give away any pot they grow Washington doesnt allow home growing but like Colorado it has a seedtosale tracking system and doesnt even try to ensure that only statesanctioned pot is possessed by legal users thereafter Uruguay on the other hand is designing a registration and licensing system so complete that authorities hope not only to defeat illegal marijuana trafficking but also to monitor drug users closely enough to get abusers into treatment and gradually decrease consumption Uruguay is the first country in the world to develop a legal nationwide marijuana market The law approved Dec 10 will enable any registered adult to buy up to 14 ounces 40 grams a month in pharmacies or join a marijuana growing club or grow their own pot plants  as many as six per family harvesting no more than 17 ounces 480 grams a year Calzada dismissed speculation by Sen Lucia Topolansky the wife of President Jos Mujica that the government would import pot from Canada which produces legal medical marijuana to get the system going The price of Canadian marijuana is significantly higher than what marijuana sells for in the black market of Uruguay So we would have to sell the marijuana at 8 or 10 a gram when the black market price here is a dollar Instead the government will grow its own cloned plants delaying the launch until years end And that means that for six months following the official publication of the rules next month Uruguay will tolerate illegal marijuana plants in the possession of licensed and registered growers However any nongovernment pot must be registered and tracked using the radio frequency system Calzada said There will be a registration system for the growing clubs and for selfgrowing The person will have to go and declare what hes planting The information about each plant will remain in a database What we want is to know that whats being planted here isnt leaving the country Calzada said Thursday night When a home grower registers his plant well do an analysis and provide a card with a certain code And what well inspect will be these codes which well follow by radio frequency This is perfectly doable Follow us on twittercomfoxnewslatino

couldnt Mujica won the presidency through his charisma and common touch but credits his wife for his political backbone   missing her birthday while visiting the United Nations last week he called her

bother anybody and were so naive that we dont see it  Theyve forgotten about class war To the war between classes and nothing less Topolanskys brother Carlos one year older recalled the familys shock when police showed up in 1969 looking for Lucia the guerrilla It was as if they told you there was a Martian at the door he said She was seen as timid girl and her father never accepted her choice They tricked her he always said But Topolansky makes it clear that she has made her own choices accepted the consequences and has no regrets or bitterness    not even for being tortured or not having children I had certain ideas about freedom And when I made certain political decisions I didnt want any attachments she said Later I was jailed for a thousand years and then the kids didnt come so it doesnt bother me now because I have a lifelong project Asked whether the Tupamaros were justified in killing unarmed prisoners she said History is what it is Were not going to change it by trying to go back and analyze it Now Topolansky is so popular that she may be called on to run for vice president Ill do what my party asks of me she said but insisted that working as a community organizer or union activist would be just as important As a young woman a revolutionary a prisoner and a politician shes always sought public happiness Topolansky said As for personal happiness she said shes already found it on the ramshackle flower farm that she shares with Pepe Mujica known internationally as the poorest president in the world We dont consider ourselves so poor like they say she said

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/10/12/legalizing-pot-wont-hinder-mexican-drug-cartels-study/,SANTA CRUZ California  Mexicos drug traffickers are likely to lose customers in Americas largest pot consuming state if California legalizes marijuana but they wont lose much money overall because Californias residents already prefer to grow their own according to a study released Tuesday That means the proposal on the states November ballot to legalize marijuana also will do little to quell the drug gangs violent and sophisticated organizations that generate billions of dollars a year according to the study by the nonpartisan RAND Drug Policy Research Center     Californians who make up oneseventh of the US marijuana market already are farming marijuana at a much higher rate than in neighboring states and tend to buy domestic rather than smuggled marijuana the study found Tuesday was harvest day on a medical marijuana farm in Northern California where dozens of volunteers cut trimmed and processed hundreds of shopping bags full of freshly snipped buds Were already growing our own in California and what happens in California so goeth the nation said Valerie Corral who helped found and runs a Santa Cruz medical marijuana collective Legalizing marijuana might undercut Mexican marijuana sales but it isnt about to derail the cartels It will just shift their focus California voters will decide next month whether to legalize and tax their own recreational use of marijuana The measure is closely watched in Mexico where more than 28000 people have died in drug violence since Mexicos President Felipe Calderon launched his crackdown on organized crime in late 2006 Both Calderon and President Barack Obama agree the vast profits cartels collect in the US  estimated by federal authorities between 18 billion and 35 billion a year  fuel drug wars south of the border RAND found that less than 2 billion of those profits come from marijuana and that losing the California marijuana market would cost cartels about 180 million  or 3 percent  of all the money they make exporting drugs to the US Mexican President Felipe Calderon said the California proposition is of critical importance We are watching very closely very closely to what will happen in November We are not certain what impact it will have on Mexico he told The Associated Press in an interview last week Making even a slight dent in cartel profits makes legalization worth doing said Drug Policy Alliance spokesman Stephen Gutwillig who supports the Prop 19 California ballot proposal The bottom line is that creating any lawful legitimate market for sales of marijuana to adults isnt good for the criminal syndicates that currently control this gigantic underground economy Gutwillig said Proponents of the proposition say they want to lower prison costs and find new revenue from marijuana taxes and that the measure could reduce violence associated with the illegal drug trade in California and Mexico The Obama administration disagrees and US drug czar Gil Kerlikowske told the AP that the new study backs them up This report shows that despite the millions spent on marketing the idea legalized marijuana wont reduce the revenue or violence generated by Mexican drug trafficking organizations said Kerlikowske head of the US Office of National Drug Control Policy The bottom line is that increased access and availability to marijuana jeopardizes the health and safety of our citizens Some former law enforcement officials however said its hard to imagine there wouldnt be major cartel profits at stake Its ridiculous to claim that ending prohibition wont have a big financial impact on these violent criminals bottom lines said Stephen Downing a supporter of Prop 19 and a former Los Angeles Police Department deputy chief of police But the RAND study concludes the only way to cut into the cartels profits would be the unlikely scenario of legal marijuana growers taking over cartel distribution elsewhere in the US Under that scenario Mexican drug trafficking organizations currently providing at least half the marijuana in the US would lose roughly 20 percent of their total drug export revenues Their remaining profits from more lucrative drugs like cocaine and heroin would continue to flow If that happens then legalization could reduce some of the Mexican drug violence in the long run said Beau Kilmer the studys lead author and codirector of the RAND Drug Policy Research Center But the study authors said they dont believe the federal government will stand idly by if homegrown smugglers were to capture the entire national market now held by Mexicosourced marijuana It would be difficult not to notice that the quantities produced and perhaps even taxed were vastly larger than what is needed to supply the California market alone said the study But some say its already beginning to happen Smuggling in the US will be easy as marijuana can be shipped to consumers in other states through our mail system said economist John Carnevale a drug policy expert who has worked with the US Office of National Drug Control Policy for three administrations There is anecdotal information that this is already occurring Former San Jose California police chief Joseph McNamara says the proposed laws key goal isnt aimed at resolving Mexicos drug violence and questioned RANDs assumptions about marijuana use and sales Can a state facing a 19 billion dollar deficit casually pass up a chance to tax a product that escapes taxation only because it is illegal he

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/27/weed-booze-and-bears-ballot-questions-compete-with-candidates-for-voters/, While candidates and parties duke it out for victory on Election Day a justasheated battle is being waged in a number of states over guns abortion booze marijuana  even bears Ballot initiatives often are the sidebar story of any election but for some voters the debate this year over yes or no on a range of ballot questions has been the marquee issue drawing millions of dollars to each side and in some cases forcing candidates running in those states to take a position     One of the highestprofile battles again is over weed After Colorado and Washington became the first states to effectively legalize  and regulate  nonmedical marijuana in the last election the propot movement is trying to expand the legal weed map next week Unlike several past elections gay marriage is not on the ballot this year But other social and economic hot buttons including the minimum wage are According to electiontracker Ballotpedia voters are weighing in on 153 ballot measures on Election Day Marijuana bans up in smoke Two years ago voters in Colorado and Washington legalized recreational pot statewide and the federal government largely has stayed out of their business On Nov 4 Oregon which voted down such a measure in 2012 Alaska and the District of Columbia will ask voters whether they too want to join the marijuana legalization experiment Promarijuana voices like Morgan Fox at the Marijuana Policy Project say the prospects for legalization are looking good Polls have shown voters in Oregon and DC largely support the measures though voters views toward legalizing weed in Alaska are still a bit hazy Florida with its huge senior community also has a question on the ballot on legalizing medical marijuana They all seem like they are pretty close except for DC which has overwhelming support Fox said But I think they all stand a very good chance of passing Last week Sen Jeff Merkley DOre became the first US senator to support marijuana legalization for his state Drug Policy Action which has received major funding from billionaire currency trader George Soros contributed 500000 to the Yes on 91 campaign in Oregon Washington DCbased New Approach PAC tied to the family of the late billionaire Peter Lewis gave 300000 to the effort Big money plays a huge role in the yes campaign said Kevin Sabet legalization opponent and cofounder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana SAM You have millions of dollars poured in to the yes side and on the no side you just have a lot of volunteers from citizens and groups that dont traditionally have a lot of money They are trying to manipulate from the outside End of the dry spell There arent many places that still ban alcohol though 10 states including Arkansas still have areas that do A ballot initiative that would legalize booze statewide is pitting big fundraising guns at WalMart which wants to want to end prohibition against the liquor dealers who want to keep it It promises to be a big draw on Nov 4 According to local reports 37 out of Arkansas 75 counties prohibit the sale and purchase of alcohol Business interests like WalMart want to be able to sell beer and wine over the counter everywhere in Arkansas Liquor dealers who operate shops just outside dry counties have lined up to defeat the measure known as Issue 4 An October poll by Talk Business  Politics found that 54 percent of voters opposed lifting prohibition statewide Dueling gun measures Following the elementary school shooting massacre at Sandy Hook and other highprofile tragedies involving firearms gun control advocates have been pouring cash into legislative efforts as well as ballot initiatives Washington state has two dueling gun measures at the ballot box on Nov 4 If both win it likely will tie up the issue in court Initiative 594 calls for a comprehensive tightening of the states background check policies  requiring background checks for virtually all purchases including online and gunshow sales Opponents including the National Rifle Association NRA have been vastly outspent as the campaign heads into the last week According to a report in September the proI594 funders including former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg and Bill and Melinda Gates have given 75 million toward its passage Competing measure I591 is supported by gun rights advocates and would do the opposite by barring the state from enacting its own backgroundcheck laws deferring to the federal government on that front It also would prohibit government agencies from seizing guns without due process Dont feed the bears A ballot initiative drawing major national attention in Maine would restrict the way residents can hunt for bears Right now hunters can use a range of tactics to kill their quarry  from trapping and chasing them down with dogs to baiting them with sweets like jelly doughnuts All three methods would be banned if Question 1 passes Maine hunters would have to stalk and shoot bears the oldfashioned way which is more humane proponents say Critics say it would balloon Maines bear population Both sides have spent some 16 million on TV ads to persuade the public Abortion Three state measures would challenge some abortions In Colorado voters will decide whether to amend the state constitution to define the fetus as a person under the criminal code In North Dakota voters weigh the question of whether the state constitution should protect the rights of the unborn In Tennessee a measure would make it easier for the state to pass restrictions on abortion Drugtesting docs and malpractice In California voters will decide whether to require doctors to submit to drugtesting the first such policy in the country Proposition 46 also would raise the cap on painandsuffering awards Proponents say it would be a win for patients while critics say it all amounts to a grab by tort lawyers Sentencing reform Prison overcrowded California is weighing Prop 47 which would dramatically change how the state treats certain nonserious nonviolent drug and property crimes by downgrading them from felonies to misdemeanors The measure also would allow those currently serving time for such offenses to apply for a reduced sentence as long as they have no prior convictions for more serious crimes like murder attempted murder or sexual offenses Minimum wage Several states are asking voters to decide minimum wage increases A South Dakota measure would hike the rate from 725 an hour to 850 An Alaska measure would raise it from 775 an hour to over two years 975 Arkansas and Nebraska also have similar measures on the ballot Illinois is asking voters about the minimum wage but the result is

Incredibles Ive never seen anything like this and Ive owned a business for the last 15 years Selling 40000 chocolatemarijuana bars a month Colorado and Washington the first states to legalize recreational marijuana could be called the US guinea pigs on the business of cannabis While many states are resistant to this new industry and it is still illegal on the federal level companies growing and selling marijuana and ones that support them are seeing so much demand they can hardly keep up Consider Medically Correct According to Eschino his company which supplies medical dispensaries in Colorado is selling 40000 chocolatemarijuana bars a month and doesnt have enough of the pot ingredients to meet the demandMedically Corrects chocolate bars sell for 600 at the medical dispensaries and almost 10 in the retail market Banks not cashing in While the demand is huge Eschino says thats not the only thing that caught him off guard about his business Given the size of the market and the opportunity to profit the lack of interest from banks to lend to marijuana businesses is eye opening he saysIn February the US Department of Justice and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network a unit of the US Department of Treasury gave banks guidelines for working with legal marijuana businesses yet financial institutions are still resistant to the industry We were hoping the statements from the Federal government would have some teeth says Eschino But investors arent avoiding this business Eschino says he gets cold calls on a regular basis from venture capitalists angle investors and others looking to get in on the pot gold rush Everybody wants to get into the business but they come in and undervalue our company he says Dont say its not your fathers weed For Peter Johnson of Colorado Green Tours which gives both consumers and investors tours of the Colorado pot business the client demographic has surprised him Most people would assume people visiting Colorado because of the pot industry would be twentysomething year olds looking to legally get high But it turns out a lot of the clientele signing up for the tours which start out at around 200 and can get much pricier are baby boomers The demographic is considerably older than I had assumed it would be prior to doing research says Johnson There are an awful lot of old hippies that are very happy to live to see this day And its not only the baby boomers that want a tour of this upandcoming business Johnson says he also gets a lot of interest from investors and is somewhat surprised larger companies arent trying to cash in as of yet This is a very large and now pretty lucrative market he says That was quick Travis Howard cofounder of Green Dream Health Services in Boulder Colorado trained himself early on to expect the unexpected when it comes to legal marijuana but one area that he was caught off guard by was the speed in which the state moved to allow the sale of recreational marijuana We knew it would go recreational but thought it would be closer to 2016 says Howard whose company operates dispensaries and provides consultations on getting into the pot business We thought we would get five to seven years of the medical business under our belt before adding something else to the plate Governments take Another area that surprised Howard is the sales tax that has been imposed on the purchase of pot According to Travis in Boulder the total tax is 36 and in Denver its in the high 20 range a far cry from the 6 sales tax in Denver and 85 sales tax in BoulderHoward had figured it would move to 10 or 15 but not as high as it is Its the first time Im hearing from the grow supply stores and nutrient supply stores that the black market growers are thinking theres an opportunity for them to get back into the industry says Howard noting because of the tax rate an 18 of weed will cost 60 to 70 legally but 40 to 50 on the black market While many small business owners are waiting for the day it will be legal in their state running a pot business requires a lot of capital which the banks arent willing to lend Because of that Eschino of Medically Correct says small business owners have to think long and hard before they make a foray into this industry Right now its difficult unless you have a whole bunch of disposable income he says You get no line of credit and even though its a profitable business every penny goes back in We can grow quicker if we get access to more capital but we cant,2014-03-25T16:04-04:00,drugs

This sea change on the state level reflects a rising tide of enthusiasm for legal marijuana According to Gallup 58 percent of people nationwide now say they support legalization And they are putting their money where their mouth is The US market for legal marijuana currently valued at 14 billion is projected to grow to 23 billion in 2014 and 102 billion in five years according to a recent report by ArcView Market Research In Colorado and Washington state the combination of broad popular support and potential for extra tax revenue along with promises to strictly regulate the industry has convinced the federal government to reserve judgment for the time being That is the Obama Administration is willing to permit the adultuse experiment for now which means in some sense overlooking the fact that marijuana is still according to federal law a Schedule 1 narcotic with no known medical value Its politically risky for the federal government to ride roughshod over state laws voted in by a majority of the people says William McGrath a partner at the Washington DCbased Potomac Law Group Political calculation also plays a role The administration is fully aware of which way the wind is blowing on the issue McGrath says A majority of Americans favor legalization and there is overwhelming support among younger voters In return however the Department of Justice has laid out strict requirements that marijuana cultivators and retailers must follow and Colorado has issued rules of its own Two documents totaling more than 230 pages and issued by the Marijuana Enforcement Division a branch of the Colorado Department of Revenue spell out the rules for medical and recreational marijuana businesses The oversight is extensive This business is not for everyone Gehring says Were in a highly regulated industry because of the federal illegalities Barriers to entry

Fox,http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2014/09/29/marijuana-industry-takes-another-step-into-mainstream-by-making-political/,DENVER  The entrepreneurs of the young US marijuana industry are taking another step into the mainstream becoming political donors who use some of their profits to support cannabisfriendly candidates and ballot questions that could bring legal pot to more states The political activity includes swanky fundraisers at Four Seasons hotels and art auctions at law firms And members of Congress who once politely returned the industrys contribution checks are now keeping them Were developing an industry here from the ground up If we dont contribute politically and get out there with the candidates we cant help shape what happens said Patrick McManamon head of Clevelandbased Cannasure Insurance Services which offers insurance to marijuana growers and dispensaries Medical marijuana businesses have been giving to candidates since the late 1990s With the arrival of recreational pot in Colorado and Washington the industry and its political influence are expanding rapidly Pot is now legal for medical or recreational purposes in 23 states and Washington DC More marijuana measures will be on the November ballot in Oregon Florida Alaska and the nations capital so many contributions are being funneled into those campaigns and the candidates who support them Compared with the donations of other industries or advocacy groups the political spending by marijuana businesses is modest But said Tripp Keber head of Denverbased Dixie Elixirs  Edibles which makes potinfused soda food and lotion the word is out that the marijuana industry has money to give Keber attended a summer fundraiser for Colorado Gov John Hickenlooper who opposed legalization in 2012 but has promised to regulate the industry according to voters wishes It was interesting to see how hes starting to evolve I said Im telling you I can get 100 people in the room who would be happy to max out or give the states maximum legal donation of 1100 Keber said A few weeks later in August Keber threw a fundraiser at the Four Seasons in Denver with a goal of raising 16000 for Hickenlooper The event netted 40000 In Washington state the industrys contributions are channeled into reforms that include reducing the tax rate on pot and kicking some marijuana revenue back to cities and counties to encourage more communities to allow dispensaries said dispensary owner John Davis who also serves as director of the Coalition for Cannabis Standards and Ethics Not long ago most marijuana entrepreneurs were trying to scrape a few dollars together to get started Keber said Now this industry is becoming profitable and were taking that profit and investing it politically There isnt a week that goes by where we dont make a political donation The Oregon ballot measure has raised about 23 million A medicalmarijuana question in Florida has attracted nearly 6 million And the Alaska campaign has brought in about 850000 A recreational pot measure in Washington DC attracted few donations perhaps because it appears almost certain to pass Colorados congressional delegation alone has received some 20000 this year from the marijuana industry according to federal campaignfinance data The true figure is probably much higher because many donors do not mention the drug in campaignfinance disclosures The largest federal spender on marijuana advocacy is the Marijuana Policy Project which plans to donate 150000 to federal candidates this year up from 110000 in 2013 The Drug Policy Alliance and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws have also given directly to federal candidates and taxexempt industry groups such as the National Cannabis Industry Association can spend an unlimited amount of untracked money Politicians who used to reject checks from promarijuana donors arent doing that anymore said Ethan Nadelmann head of the New Yorkbased Drug Policy Alliance Still the same candidates who cash the checks arent always keen to talk about it About a dozen recipients of marijuana money declined interview requests or did not return calls from The Associated Press A Colorado state lawmaker who accepts marijuanaindustry donations conceded thinking twice before taking them I always worry about what peoples perceptions will be said Rep Jonathan Singer a Democrat who is the only sitting Colorado legislator who supported legalization But it came down to Im on record for where I stood before I ever took a penny from this industry Todd Mitchem a Denver marijuana industry consultant recalled a fundraiser earlier this year thrown by a maker of cannabis vaporizer cartridges for a state legislator When the company posted photos from the event on its Facebook page the lawmaker asked that the images be taken down They just didnt want to be seen They were still taking the money said Mitchem who declined to name the lawmaker The only member of Congress who responded to the AP was Colorado Democratic Rep Jared Polis a longtime ally of the marijuana industry who has proposed federal legalization As long as this industry Is following our state

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/08/01/uruguay-takes-first-step-toward-becoming-first-nation-to-legalize-marijuana/,MONTEVIDEO Uruguay  Uruguays unprecedented plan to put the government at the center of a legal marijuana industry has made it halfway through congress giving President Jose Mujica a longsought victory in his effort to explore alternatives to the global war on drugs All 50 members of the governing Broad Front coalition approved the proposal in a party line vote just before midnight Wednesday keeping a narrow majority of the 96 lawmakers present after more than 13 hours of passionate debate     The measure now goes to the Senate where Mujicas coalition has a bigger majority and passage is expected to come within weeks for the proposal to make Uruguay the worlds first nation to create a legal regulated marijuana market Sometimes small countries do great things said Ethan Nadelmann executive director of the US Drug Policy Alliance Uruguays bold move does more than follow in the footsteps of Colorado and Washington  It provides a model for legally regulating marijuana that other countries and US states will want to consider  and a precedent that will embolden others to follow in their footsteps Marijuana legalization efforts have gained momentum across the Americas in recent years as leaders watch the death toll rise from military responses to unabated drug trafficking in Mexico and Central America Presidents Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Otto Perez Molina of Guatemala also have called for reforms and a recent report by a commission of the Organization of American States encouraged new approaches including legalization of marijuana But no sitting president has gone as far as Mujica to support the creation of legal alternatives to marijuana trafficking At the heart of the Uruguayan marijuana regulation bill is a focus on improving public health and public safety said Hannah Hetzer a Drug Policy Alliance staffer who moved to Montevideo to help shepherd the proposal Instead of closing their eyes to the problem of drug abuse and drug trafficking Uruguay is taking an important step towards responsible regulation of an existing reality Legislators in the governing coalition said putting the government at the center of a legal marijuana industry is worth trying because the global war on drugs had been a costly and bloody failure and displacing illegal dealers through licensed pot sales could save money and lives They also hope to eliminate a legal contradiction in Uruguay where it has been legal to use pot but against the law to sell it buy it produce it or possess even one marijuana plant Critics warned that marijuana is a gateway drug and said fostering the bad habits of addicts is playing with fire Mujica said he never consumed marijuana but believes regulations are necessary because many other people do even though recent polls suggest twothirds of Uruguayans oppose the plan National Party Deputy Gerardo Amarilla said the government was underestimating the risk of marijuana which he called a gateway drug for other chemical addictions that foster violent crimes Ninetyeight percent of those who are today destroying themselves with base cocaine began with marijuana Amarilla said I believe that were risking too much I have the sensation that were playing with fire Under the legislation Uruguays government would license growers sellers and consumers and update a confidential registry to keep people from buying more than 40 grams a month Carrying growing or selling pot without a license could bring prison terms but licensed consumers could grow up to six plants at a time at home Growing clubs with up to 45 members each would be encouraged fostering enough marijuana production to drive out unlicensed dealers and draw a line between pot smokers and users of harder drugs The latest proposal has some adjustments aimed at strengthening the educational issue and prohibiting driving under the effects of cannabis ruling coalition deputy Sebastian Sabini said There will be selfgrowing clubs and it will also be possible to buy marijuana in pharmacies that is massproduced by private companies An Institute for Regulation and Control of Cannabis would be created with the power to grant licenses for all aspects of a legal industry to produce marijuana for recreational medicinal or industrial use Dozens of promarijuana activists followed the debate from balconies overlooking the house floor while others outside held signs and danced to reggae music This law consecrates a reality that already exists The marijuana sales market has existed for a long time but illegally buying it from traffickers and in having plants in your house for which you can be thrown in jail said Camilo Collazo a 25yearold anthropology student We want to put an end to this to clean up and normalize the situation The heavy toll costs and questionable results of military responses to illegal drugs have motivated marijuana legalization initiatives in the US states of Colorado and Washington and inspired many world leaders to rethink drug laws The secretarygeneral of

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/11/03/pot-activists-vow-push-legalization/,LOS ANGELES  It seemed an easy sell in California The state that gave us medical marijuana would allow pot for recreation Then came the ads newspaper editorials and politicians warning of a world where stoned drivers would crash school buses nurses would show up at work high and employers would be helpless to fire drugaddled workers     A day after voters rejected Proposition 19 marijuana advocates wondered how they failed in trendsetting liberal California Was it the fear of the unknown An older electorate more likely to oppose pot Voters reluctant to go any further than they already had with the nations most lax pot laws Fear of crossing swords with a federal government still intent on enforcing its ban on the drug Whatever the reason activists vowed Wednesday to push on in California as well as in states that rejected other pot measures Tuesday Social change doesnt happen overnight said Paul Armentano deputy director of the National Organization for Repeal of Marijuana Laws In South Dakota voters rejected for the second time a medical marijuana measure   a step first taken by California in 1996 and by 13 other states since Oregon voters refused to expand their medical marijuana program to create a network of statelicensed nonprofit dispensaries A medical marijuana measure on Arizonas ballot remained too close to call Wednesday Californias initiative which would have allowed adults age 21 and older to possess and grow small amounts of marijuana failed 54 to 46 percent An Associated Press analysis of exit and preelection polls found voters opposed Prop 19 regardless of race gender income or education level Blacks and Latinos for example opposed the measure at about the same rate as whites That despite evidence that pot advocates presented during the campaign that minorities are disproportionately arrested on marijuana offenses There is a sense of people wanting to move into a new policy  but still being wary of what that change might mean said Ethan Nadelmann director of the prolegalization Drug Policy Project Roger Salazar a spokesman for the successful campaign to defeat Prop 19 agreed that misgivings about possible social problems from increased marijuana use helped seal the measures fate But he also blamed backers for leaving it up to local governments instead of the state to set sales regulations He also faulted them for promoting the measure as a revenue windfall for the state and a way to undercut drug traffickers and free up police to pursue more serious crimes The risks of legalizing something as important as marijuana were far greater than the potential benefits and the benefits were far from guaranteed Salazar said If they are going to come back with something it has to be a lot more tightly written Preliminary election returns showed Prop 19 winning in 11 of 58 counties with the strongest support in San Francisco and Santa Cruz But in a sign of what a tough sell it was the measure lost in the states vaunted marijuanagrowing region known as the Emerald Triangle of Humboldt Mendocino and Trinity counties Many in the region feared the system they created would be taken over by corporations or would undercut a cornerstone of the local economies by sending pot prices plunging Those most anxious about the economy were not convinced that legalizing pot was worth the potential tax revenue or jobs created by a newly legal marijuana industry A Los Angeles dispensary manager said the proposition was a step in the right direction though its failure wasnt necessarily bad The fact it didnt pass is not really so bad for us because it keeps the status quo for dispensaries and collectives that are already operating said Tim Blakeley 44 who manages Sunset Junction Organic Medicine People need more time to get used to the idea of legalized pot he said For many in California the status quo was also fine but for another reason Just a month before the election Gov Arnold Schwarzenegger signed legislation that made possession of up to an ounce of marijuana the equivalent of a traffic ticket subject to no more than a 100 fine and no arrest or criminal record Prop 19 supporters said they believed Schwarzenegger signed the bill to undercut any sense of urgency around marijuana legalization Abbey Kaufman and Matt McDonald toked up a

werent disappointed Prop 19 failed Right now you can smoke as much pot as you want on the streets of San Francisco Kaufman said If it had passed marijuana would have been treated like booze and there would be a big crackdown on public smoking I think a lot of stoners voted yes just because but I think were better off that it didnt pass Richard Lee the Oakland Calif medical marijuana entrepreneur who sponsored Prop 19 and spent 14 million of his own money to qualify the measure for the ballot and try to get it passed drew hope in the generational divide among the voters The only unequivocal support for the measure came from voters under 30 though even they were not as united in their support as voters 65 and older were in their opposition Lee said the fact that 34 million Californians cast ballots for legalizing marijuana and that Prop 19 came within 9 percentage points of passing were victories themselves He noted that since younger voters supported the initiative a generation that does not fear the drug would one day constitute a majority of the population The issue is generational he said Many of the biggest contributors to the campaign were younger and based in Silicon

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/10/24/missouri-police-preparing-for-grand-jury-decision/,Aug 17 2104  People defy a curfew before smoke and tear gas was fired to disperse a crowd protesting the shooting of teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson MoAP PhotoCharlie Riedel File FERGUSON Mo  Missouri police have been brushing up on constitutional rights and stocking up on riot gear to prepare for a grand jurys decision about whether to charge a white police officer who fatally shot a black 18yearold in suburban St Louis The preparations are aimed at avoiding a renewed outbreak of violence during the potentially large demonstrations that could follow an announcement of whether Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson will face a criminal trial for the Aug 9 death of Michael Brown     Police and protesters have repeatedly clashed since the shooting which prompted a national conversation about race and police tactics Images of officers in riot gear and armored vehicles confronting protesters have drawn widespread criticism Many protesters want Darren Wilson indicted for murder Grand jury proceedings are secret but legal analysts say recently leaked information about Wilsons testimony to investigators may be an attempt to prepare the public for the possibility that he might not be charged The decision could be made public within the next month In the meantime law officers have adjusted their tactics for interacting more peacefully with protesters while also honing their procedures for quick widespread arrests They plan to have a large contingent of officers at the ready but have been meeting with clergy community leaders and students in hopes of building relationships that could ease tensions on the streets I know theres a lot of anxiety theres a lot of fear anticipation about that announcement said Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt Ron Johnson who was put in charge of security in Ferguson in the days after Brown was killed and is now part of a coordinated command with local police But I have a lot of hope Law enforcement officers expect to receive at least a days notice before a grand jury announcement That should provide time for them to execute security plans but may also allow demonstrators to prepare The moment I learn that there is in fact a nonindictment then theres going to be an organized protest said Eric Vickers a black St Louis attorney and civil rights activist Brown was unarmed when Wilson encountered him walking in the street with a friend A scuffle ensued and Brown was shot multiple times Witness accounts of what happened varied with some people saying they saw Brown raise his hands as if in surrender Wilson told investigators he felt threatened while fighting with Brown from inside a police SUV where an initial gunshot was fired according to information provided to several news outlets by people described as familiar with the investigation but otherwise not identified After Brown fled the vehicle Wilson said Brown turned around in threatening manner prompting the officer to fire the fatal shots according to those accounts of his testimony Wilsons description of events was leaked recently as was an autopsy report that showed Brown had marijuana in his system and was shot in the hand at close range Wilson has alleged Brown was trying to grab his gun in the SUV It appears that it may be calculated to soften the blow if there is no indictment said Peter Joy a law professor at Washington University in St Louis who directs the schools Criminal Justice Clinic But he said its conceivable that if the leaks are from law enforcement that perhaps there may be an indictment and this is calculated to garner public sympathy for officer Wilson Wilsons attorneys have denied being the source of the reports The shooting stoked longsimmering racial tensions in Ferguson a predominantly black community with an overwhelmingly white police force Protests have continued for two months in the St Louis area often peaceful but sometimes devolving into clashes between police firing tear gas and demonstrators lobbing rocks and bottles Law enforcement agencies have declined to say whether they will proactively line the streets with more officers as the grand jury announcement is made or position them in strategic locations to react as needed St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said hes learned it works better to let sergeants and lieutenants retain their normal place in the chain of command instead of supplanting them with higherranking officers Weve also learned we have to have a dialogue with our demonstrators so they know what to expect from us and we know what to expect from them Belmar said Police are attempting to better document events and handle widespread arrests more efficiently To ensure its at full strength the state Highway Patrol is limiting trooper vacations around the time of a potential decision and local police may be put on longer shifts After the initial clashes with protesters the state Highway Patrol purchased more shields and equipment for its officers St Louis city police recently spent 325000 upgrading helmets sticks and other civil disobedience equipment said Police Chief Sam Dotson More than 350 St Louis officers now have been trained in civil disobedience tactics St Louis County police and state troopers also have undergone training focused largely on ensuring they understand protesters constitutional rights Belmar Johnson and other law officers have been meeting frequently with clergy students and community leaders Pastors in turn have been preaching messages of nonviolence Earlier this week Democratic state Sen Jamilah Nasheed of St Louis intentionally got arrested for refusing to leave the street in front of the Ferguson Police Department Even that was an act preparation Nasheed said she wanted to show others that you can peacefully protest but you dont have to be violent under the banner of justice for Michael

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/09/26/reporter-alaska-pot-vote/, It was the f it heard round the web Alaska reporter Charlo Greene achieved viral video fame this week by announcing onair she was quitting to work on passing the states Ballot Measure 2 which would legalize marijuana     And as for this job  f it I quit said Greene who until that moment worked for KTVA in Anchorage But will all the attention surrounding her spectacular exit boost the ballot initiative itself Perhaps not surprisingly Greene seems to think so She told FoxNewscom she believes her actions 1000 percent benefit the prolegalization movement If I had just given my two weeks the viewers would have never known she said Others in Alaska arent so sure what the impact will be The marijuana ballot measure polls show has voters about evenly divided and even a small shift could make the difference At the same time the ballot measure has been a hot topic in Alaska for months and both supporters and opponents downplayed the impact Greenes move may have on voters Taylor Bickford a spokesman for the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana in Alaska told FoxNewscom while its entirely possible Greenes outspoken outreach could drive some Alaskans to the polls it doesnt compare to the months of work the campaign has put in to gain support Charlo Greene has transitioned from someone who reported on the ballot measure to a supporter Bickford said But shes just one supporter amongst many Charles Fedullo a spokesman for the Big Marijuana Big Mistake Vote No on 2 campaign told FoxNewscom he believes there will be a high voter turnout for the fall election regardless of Greenes actions as there are many important issues on the ballot When it comes to Charlo Greene people will make up their own minds whether she is a valuable spokesperson for the promarijuana organization he said The attention surrounding Greene whose real name is Charlene Egbe has raised some concerns from the propot movement that the stunt could end up hurting the cause by casting it in a bad light A former neighbor of Greenes also reportedly filed a restraining order against her after claiming his daughter got sick due to the marijuana smoke from her room Greene who runs the Alaska Cannabis Club allegedly threatened the father though she denies it Alaska has a long and muddled history with legalized marijuana University of AlaskaAnchorage Professor Jason Brandeis notes that the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 1975 that Alaskans could possess small amounts of recreational marijuana in the privacy of their homes for personal use The permissible amount commonly is understood to be less than four ounces Alaska also legalized medical marijuana in 1998 However Alaska has several laws on the books that punish any nonmedical marijuana useThis has created what Brandeis called a legal gray area  technically you can smoke marijuana in your home but you can also be prosecuted if youre caught It makes it a little bit tricky Brandeis told FoxNewscom Ballot Measure 2 would do away with that gray area by legalizing recreational marijuana use for people over the age of 21 and regulating its production sale and use in the state Bickford said the changes are long overdue to reconcile the confusing and damaging laws in a state that already has a multimillion dollar marijuana industry Bickford added that many Alaskans believe its better to have Alaskas marijuana industry regulated than in the hands of criminal enterprises However Fedullo strongly disagreed He said the antilegalization campaign is largely made up of volunteers everyday Alaskans worried that national promarijuana organizations are trying to push their agenda in the fiercely independent state People are very concerned he said And Alaskans in general the hair on the back of our neck stands up when we feel there is outside influence coming here Fedullo said a lot of people he has spoken with in the state are worried about the effects legal marijuana has had in Colorado and Washington and what impacts a legal marijuana industry could have on Alaskas communities Greene described the ballot initiative as vital for the movement As for her signoff splash Greene said after watching months of coverage on her TV station she finally got the opportunity to voice her opinion The fact that Im sitting here with you on FoxNewscom talking about Ballot Measure 2 and what it means for Alaskans right here today just shows that whatever I did worked to spark a conversation about marijuana reform in Alaska across the nation and across the world she said Thursday Recent surveys of voters by the Democraticleaning Public Policy Polling indicate support for Ballot Measure 2 may be on the decline In a May poll 48 percent of voters said they would vote yes on the measure while 45 percent said they would vote no and 7 percent said they were undecided However in an August poll 44 percent of voters said they would vote yes on the measure while 49 percent said they would vote no and 8 percent said they were undecided,2014-09-26T07:00-04:00,drugs

makes and sells rum vodka and cognac and has done so for nearly a century Many people consider this sideline of the state to be an historical accident   a wasteful and even eccentric contradiction But President Jose Mujica says Uruguays long experience at the center of the nations liquor business makes it more than capable of dominating another substance marijuana     Final Senate approval of Uruguays marijuana law is expected by late September and the government plans to license growers sellers and users as quickly as possible thereafter to protect them from criminal drug traffickers ruling party Sen Lucia Topolansky who is also Uruguays first lady told The Associated Press in an interview The law specifically creates a legal marijuana monopoly making the government alone responsible for importing producing obtaining storing commercializing and distributing a drug still considered illegal around the world A state entity will license producers and control marijuanas distribution and sale through the same neighborhood pharmacies that sell prescription medicines and toothpaste Purchases by licensed users will be limited to 40 grams 14 ounces a month Potgrowing cooperatives will be encouraged using governmentapproved seeds and people registered with the state will be able to grow up to six plants at home for personal use as long as they harvest no more than 480 grams  17 ounces a year The project passed the House by just one vote and while the ruling Broad Front coalition has an easier majority in the Senate Mujica has been campaigning actively for its passage reminding Uruguayans that their government has been controlling the market for addictive substances ever since the beginning of the 20th century when President Jose Batlle y Ordonez wanted the state to monopolize alcohol production Don Jose Batlle y Ordonez had courage Mujica said in one of his folksy nationwide radio talks which sound much like the fireside chats that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt used to broadcast to Americans The state grabbed it and made a monopoly of alcohol because it couldnt stop the booze and he said at least dont poison the people    the booze should be good Batlle y Ordonez was ahead of his time in promoting social change in Latin America from the separation of church and state to the eighthour workday and maternity leave And he had several goals for alcohol He wanted the whisky to generate government revenues and guarantee a profit stream for farmers funding the production of a national fuel so that Uruguays cars and trucks wouldnt need imported gasoline Uruguay wasnt alone in that fight In 1925 Henry Ford was promoting alcohol as the fuel of the future and it was being blended with gasoline from France to the Philippines But like many other countries Uruguay never achieved this energy independence Oil companies won an intense global campaign to focus on fossil fuels a trend that held until Brazil started using alcohol blends in the 1980s Batlle y Ordonez died in 1929 without seeing his dreams realized but his spirit as a statesman inspired Uruguays congress two years later to create Ancap a state fuel and hardliquor monopoly that still refines imported oil and distills liquor at sidebyside plants in Montevideo today Ancaps whisky sales peaked at 332000 liters 88000 gallons a year in 1970 but then it began bleeding money In 1996 it lost its monopoly on distilled spirits By 2002 President Jorge Batlle    the grandnephew of Batlle y Ordonez    decided to create a new privately administered Ancap subsidiary to manage the stateheld company making it nimble enough to cut costs Now it has 60 employees and generates nearly 1 million a year in profits without any state subsidies Topolansky agrees that whiskymaking is a good model for the marijuana project Back then people were making wood alcohol and other very toxic blends So the government said the people are going to keep drinking but we have to offer a quality product that doesnt carry dangerous sideeffects And the state took over production Topolansky explained She said they need to do the same with marijuana which has long been legal to use but not to sell in Uruguay    a situation she said puts people at the mercy of dangerous criminals Marijuana consumers go to dealers where they sell it mixed with more addictive substances or they sell them something else Its a clandestine world where we cant enter The state needs to regulate this market like it did before with alcohol she said The government says its goal is to lower marijuana consumption in Uruguay by strictly regulating a legal market for it and punishing those who grow sell or use it illegally Controlling alcohol use will help said Uruguays drug czar Julio Calzada His agency considers alcohol to be a gateway substance for marijuana so another bill before Congress would limit beer wine and liquor advertising and ban nighttime sales in places other than bars and restaurants Calzada told the AP that many students in Uruguay drink dangerous quantities of alcohol and that the numbers are getting worse in 2006 one of every four had been dangerously intoxicated by last year as many as one in every three got seriously ill from alcohol But Calzada doesnt blame the state liquor factory for these behavioral problems On the contrary he says it deserves credit for eliminating dangerous brews The state was able to drive out those making wood alcohol and poisoning the people just as Mujica said Today we have to take action with marijuana because those who buy it dont know what theyre buying just the same as what happened with people buying alcohol in 1930,2013-09-01T02:19-04:00,drugs

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/08/31/large-marijuana-farm-proposed-idyllic-colo-countryside-angers-residents/,LONGMONT Colo  The investor saw potential in the scrubby 67 acres tucked away amid multimillion dollar homes He would turn the land into a vast pot farm and capitalize on the booming medical marijuana industry But Scott Mullner a city councilman from Laramie Wyo infuriated his Colorado neighbors with his plan to place a marijuana farm in the midst of their idyllic Northern Colorado countryside     They say the project will damage property values and attract more unwanted attention than the previous business at the location  an organic egg farm Nobody is going to come out and steal a chicken said Lance Messinger 56 who lives less than a mile from the proposed marijuana site So it was pretty benign to the neighborhood is what Im saying Despite a flurry of emails and calls from residents opposed to the idea Boulder County commissioners decided against holding a public hearing on the issue on Tuesday allowing Mullners application to proceed The county banned medical marijuana growing operations in agricultural areas in June but Mullner was able to get his application in before that Commissioners said they had to abide by the rules at the time Mullner still must proceed through the rest of the regulatory process and opponents say theyll continue the fight Were going to keep working on it were going to make it difficult for them and were going to grow our numbers Its unconscionable I cannot believe that they did that said resident Nancy Peters 62 one of 40 opponents who attended the meeting In addition to upsetting the locals Mullners plan is raising questions about the future of growing medical pot in Colorado one of 14 states where it is legal DC also allows marijuana for medical use One question is whether outofstate investors can profit from the stateregulated industry Under state law Mullner cant grow the marijuana because hes not a Colorado resident But if his request is approved he could make a profit by selling or leasing the land to someone who is eligible or he could move to Colorado wait two years to become eligible then grow it himself New state rules that went into effect this year state that a grower can supply only one dispensary But if the farm is divided into subplots each serving a different dispensary business it could theoretically serve many said Brian Vicente executive director of Sensible Colorado a medical marijuana patients group Dispensaries have a Wednesday deadline to meet a state requirement that theyre growing 70 percent of the marijuana they sell and industry watchers see a potential for subdivided farms supplying pot shops I think this is the beginning of marijuana being treated more like a legitimate agriculture product said Vicente The proposed pot farm would be unprecedented in terms of its size and wideopen nature even by national standards In New Mexico and Washington state for example growing operations are secretly located In California the locales of growing operations are not publicly disclosed The exception is the city of Oakland which has approved a plan to authorize largescale pot cultivation beginning in January but the operations would be in industrial not residential areas While Colorado has hundreds of medical marijuana plots most of them are indoors in warehouses or in the growers basement said Jeff Gard a medical marijuana attorney in Boulder This will be the first one that will be out in the open for everyone to see Gard said That doesnt set well with the people who built their dream houses in the countryside about 40 miles north of Denver Messinger said The area offers small lakes and homes and land surrounded by white wooden fences Residents grow alfalfa and sunflowers and advertise the sale of hay Those who have written or called county officials are concerned that a marijuana farm will disrupt their tranquility and make them vulnerable to crime Mullner did not return repeated messages left at his Laramie city office He previously told local newspapers that having the land designated to grow marijuana was an opportunity he couldnt pass up Its the highest and best use as far as farming goes Mullner told the Boulder Daily Camera For his plan to go through Mullner still has to submit a lighting plan and provide an example of a proposed steel entrance gate And he must agree not to use the five buildings on the property for housing or retail sales Even then theres no guarantee that Mullners plan will go forward He must meet local regulations for marijuana growth and some of those arent even in place yet said Commissioner Will Toor The commissioners office said Tuesday existing rules will restrict any growing operations on the rural land to the existing buildings on the property While the operation would still be outdoors and visible for everyone to see the marijuana would have to be grown indoors Counties across Colorado are still grappling with how to regulate growing operations said Eric Bergman policy and research supervisor with Colorado Counties Inc with issues ranging from law enforcement monitoring to taxation to fire mitigation The uncertainly of how it would all work is unnerving to the residents nearby specially not knowing who will ultimately be in charge of the growing operation You dont know whos going to run it said neighbor Messinger It could be a legitimate business operation like WalMart or it could be the Hells Angels,2010-08-31T03:19-04:00,drugs

pot as it does alcohol State Board of Equalization chairwoman Betty Yee a supporter projects the law would generate 990 million annually through a 50perounce fee for retailers and 392 million in sales taxes The state now collects 18 million each year in taxes on medical marijuana The state would not start collecting taxes on marijuana under Ammianos bill until the federal government lifts its restrictions on the drug Thats not enough for propot activists who want Californians to vote next year on a proposal that would allow adults to legally possess up to one ounce of pot and allow cities

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/01/01/legal-recreational-pot-industry-opens-in-colorado-as-world-watches-closely/,"The nations first recreational pot industry opened in Colorado on Wednesday kicking off an experiment that will be followed closely around the world and one that activists hope will prove that legalization is a better alternative than the costly Americanled drug war Business owners who threw their doors open for shoppers at 8 am are looking for the fledgling industry to generate as much revenue as state officials hope it will At least 24 pot shops in eight towns opened after increasing staff and inventory and hiring security More than a dozen people waiting in line outside one shop in Denver as snow fell around dawn Musician James Aaron Ramsey 28 was among them having driven from Missouri He played folk tunes with his guitar as he waited Im going to frame the receipt when I go home to remind myself of what might be possible Legal everywhere Ramsey said who had served a brief jail sentence for pot possession less than a year ago and was excited to legally buy weed Colorado and Washington state approved legal recreational pot industries in 2012 and Washingtons will open later this year They are being closely watched around the world because they are the first regulated taxed pot industries Some countries have decriminalized the drug and the Netherlands lets people buy and sell it but its illegal to grow or process it Just as shops opened Wednesday the Denver police department tweeted Do you know the law and linked to city websites on state and local laws that include bans on public consumption driving under the influence taking marijuana out of state and giving pot to anyone under 21 Shopper Jacob Elliott traveled from Leesburg Va to be among the first to buy legal pot He said he wrote reports in college about the need to end prohibition of marijuana but never thought it could happen in his lifetime This breaks that barrier he said Tinted windows on a black limousine idling outside a dispensary showed another side of the newly legal weed market  people eager to try legal marijuana but not ready to be seen publicly buying it Addison Morris owner of Rocky Mountain Mile High Tours had 10 clients waiting inside who paid 295 for three hours of chauffeuring by a marijuana concierge who would help them choose strains and edible pot products Were your grandmothers pot connection the 63yearold said Were not the hippie stoners who are going to stand in this cold and party Morris said shes booked through the end of February with outofstate clients Guests receive samples in designer bags before getting tours She said shes selling discretion Guests are asked to leave cameras at home Earlier pot users welcomed the new year  and the new industry  by firing up bongs and cheering in a cloud of marijuana smoke at a 1920sthemed Prohibition Is Over party in downtown Denver Skeptics worry the industry will make the drug more widely available to teens even though legal sales are limited to adults over 21 They fear that the increased availability will lead to a rise in drug abuse and crime Preparation for the retail market started more than a year ago soon after Colorado voters in 2012 approved the legal pot industry Washington state has its own version which is scheduled to open in mid2014 Uruguay passed a law in December to become the first nation to regulate pot Pot advocates who had long pushed legalization as an alternative to the lengthy and costly global drug war had argued it would generate revenue for state coffers and save money in locking up drug offenders Still setting up regulations taxation and oversight for a drug thats never been regulated before took some time Colorado set up an elaborate planttracking system to try to keep the drug away from the black market and regulators set up packaging labeling and testing requirements along with potency limits for edible pot The US Justice Department outlined an eightpoint slate of priorities for pot regulation requiring states to keep the drug away from minors criminal cartels federal property and other states in order to avoid a federal crackdown Pot is still illegal under federal law Police in the eight Colorado towns allowing recreational pot sales stepped up patrols to dispensaries in case of unruly crowds Denver International Airport placed signs on doors warning fliers they cant take the drug home in their suitcases With the additional police patrols the airport warnings and various other measures officials hoped they have enough safeguards in place to avoid predictions of public health and safety harm from the opening of the pot shops They are aware of how many people from across the country and around the world were watching We understand that Colorado is under a microscope Jack Finlaw lawyer to Gov John Hickenlooper and overseer of a major task force to chart new pot laws recently told reporters There was no shortage of skeptics worried retail pot would endanger the public A group of addiction counselors and physicians said theyre seeing more marijuana addiction problems especially in youths and that wider pot availability will exacerbate the problem This is just throwing gas on the fire said Ben Cort of the Colorado Center for Dependency Addiction  Rehabilitation at the University of Colorado Hospital Not all marijuana users in Colorado are toasting the dawn of retail sales Some medical marijuana patients groups say theyre worried about supply Thats because the retail inventory for recreational use is coming entirely from the preexisting medical inventory Many in the industry warned patients to stock up before the sales began It was too soon to tell whether prices were going up For now medical patients should have plenty of places to shop Most of Colorados 500 or so medical marijuana shops havent applied to sell recreational pot and many that have plan to serve both recreational and medical patients Marijuana activists were hoping Colorados grand experiment wouldnt be that noticeable after an initial rush of shopping Adults have been buying marijuana around this country for years said Mason Tvert spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project The only difference is that in Colorado they will now buy it from legitimate businesses instead of the underground market

van in the park Pamela Hughes told him the honest truth I said I was smoking a cannabis cigarette she said     She presented the stunned policeman with a written recommendation from her doctor and a copy of Marylands Compassionate Use Act which reduces the penalties for possession of medical marijuana I honestly thought that I wasnt breaking the law Hughes said Rather than take her word for it the officer called for backup that included a canine unit she said Hughes ended up spending several hours in jail She fought the charges and won but only after a lot of time stress and money  three things that her fibromyalgia a chronic condition characterized by widespread pain and fatigue and a reoccurrence of stage IV cancer were already monopolizing Hughes and several other patients told the House Judiciary Committee last week that while Marylands Compassionate Use Act was a step forward for its time the law merely provides them with a false sense of security The patients testified on behalf of a bill that would establish a task force to evaluate the effectiveness and fairness of the current law and consider whether medical marijuana should become legal in the state They said medical marijuana provides relief for certain ailments in ways no other medication can replicate No one testified against the bill and a vote on the legislation has not been scheduled Medical marijuana has been legalized in 13 states including California Maine Rhode Island and Vermont US Attorney General Eric Holder said recently that federal law enforcement will no longer target providers that are operating within state law a major departure from the Bush administrations stance on the issue The Darryl Putnam Compassionate Use Act passed by the General Assembly in 2003 was a compromise between those advocating the legalization of medical marijuana and those against such a move The act is named after Putnam a former Green Beret and Howard County Farm Bureau director who advocated for the legalization of medical marijuana He died of cancer in 1999 The Compassionate Use Act reduced the penalties for marijuana possession to a maximum 100 fine provided a patient has a recommendation from a medical doctor However patients still have to buy their medicine on the street and face the health and legal risks inherent in doing so Those with drug offenses on their records could also face eviction from subsidized housingJohn McCarthy an AIDS activist who has been HIVpositive for 18 years said that medical marijuana has allowed him to reduce his pill intake from 45 to 13 pills a day Most of those pills had been prescribed merely to alleviate the side effects of other pills which include vomiting headaches and neuropathy a condition where the nerve endings burn McCarthy who lives in subsidized housing said a drug conviction under the present law could cause someone to be evicted from public housing no matter how old they were or what their condition was Eric Sterling a Chevy Chase lawyer and president of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation said the law needs to be revised Its really barbaric to think that we would prosecute sick people he said These cases should never go to court The American College of Physicians which calls itself the largest medicalspecialty organization and secondlargest physician group in the United States has endorsed the use of nonsmoked marijuana in cases where it has been proven to have therapeutic value A 2008 policy paper said the organization strongly urges protection from criminal or civil penalties for patients who use medical marijuana as permitted under state laws It advocated further research on the issue and said that the science on medical marijuana should not be obscured or hindered by the debate surrounding the legalization of marijuana for general use Americans for Safe Access a group that advances legalizing marijuana for therapeutics and research and brought many of the witnesses together in Annapolis last week was careful to clarify its intentions Caren Woodson director of government affairs for the group said the goal was to have safe and legal access to medical marijuana for patients and researchers  and thats itThats the line and we dont cross over it she said However some say others are crossing that line every day Jerrod Menz president of A Better Tomorrow Treatment Center Inc a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center in Murrieta Calif said some young people in his state are faking back pain and other hardtoprove ailments in order to legally obtain marijuana He said a client in his early 20s recently admitted telling his doctor he was suffering from foot pain which helped him obtain a medical marijuana card after a fiveminute examination Menz said doctors need to use more care in their examinations to better prevent people from abusing the intent of medical marijuana laws He said that some problems could be prevented by having the federal government regulate medical marijuana like any other drug although he did not endorse such a move For Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Vallario Jr DPrince Georges federal law is the line that shouldnt be crossed  and the reason for the 2003 compromise legislation in the first place How can you pass something thats against federal law he said That really is the bottom line Delegate Henry Heller DMontgomery the sponsor of the bill said the task force would also consider establishing research programs at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland medical schools He said this would not only allow further research on medical marijuana but also help provide a safe product As the law stands Heller said glaucoma and cancer patients at Leisure World a retirement community in Silver Spring where he lives

2 2014 Mujica said Friday that his countrys legal marijuana market will be much better than Colorados where he says the rules are based on fiction and hypocrisy because the state loses track of the drug once its sold and many people fake illnesses to get prescription weed Mujica says this wont be allowed in Uruguay where the licensed and regulated market will be much less permissive with drug users AP PhotoMatilde CampodonicoThe Associated Press MONTEVIDEO Uruguay  Uruguay has finally released its rules for the legal marijuana market it is launching this year detailing how the government plans to get very involved in every aspect of the business But anyone hoping the South American nation will become a potsmokers paradise should probably head to Colorado instead President Jose Mujica suggested on Friday Its a complete fiction what they do in Colorado in terms of controlling the sale and use of legal marijuana Mujica said in an Associated Press interview     Colorado licenses sellers and producers but allows any adult to buy up to 28 grams at a time   and then go down the street and buy 28 grams more In Uruguay consumers must be licensed as well and each purchase will be tracked to ensure they buy no more than 10 grams a week he said Mujica and his ministers plan to sign the regulations on Monday and theyll take effect on Tuesday In two weeks the government will take applications from businesses hoping to become one of a handful of growers supplying marijuana to the state By early December a network of pharmacies will be ready to supply the weed to registered consumers at less than a dollar a gram presidential spokesman Diego Canepa said late Friday As with tobacco the pot will come in packages warning of health risks and smoking will be prohibited everywhere but private homes and openair locations As with liquor motorists will be subject to testing by police to make sure theyre not driving under the influence The state will sell five different strains containing a maximum level of 15 percent THC the substance that gets consumers high Each bag will be barcoded radiofrequency tagged and registered in a genetic database that will enable authorities to trace its origin and determine its legality Canepa said  The rules limit licensed growers to six plants per household    not per person as some pot enthusiasts had hoped And while people who buy in pharmacies will be identified by fingerprint readers to preserve their anonymity every users pot consumption will be tracked in a government database Mujica predicted that many will call him an elderly reactionary once they see this fine print but he says his government never intended to create a mecca for marijuana lovers No addiction is good he said We arent going to promote smokefests bohemianism all this stuff they try to pass off as innocuous when it isnt Theyll label us elderly reactionaries But this isnt a policy that seeks to expand marijuana consumption What it aims to do is keep it all within reason and not allow it to become an illness With bona fide plants registered at the molecular level police can test for illegal weed wherever they encounter it and arrest anyone with pot that lacks the proper genetic markers the rules say Mujica says the system is more transparent and honest than the medical marijuana laws passed by 21 US states and the District of Columbia which he called brutal hypocrisy because people can fake illnesses to get prescription weed There are places where there are forms already filled out with a doctors signature So you go you say that you need marijuana because your ear hurts they fill out the form you prescribe it yourself and with the signature of a doctor he said Mujica who is preparing to visit President Barack Obama in the White House on May 12 predicted that Uruguays system will be much tougher on drug users and more effective in combatting illegal drug trafficking Mujica says his government will license and regulate the entire marijuana business enforcing pot possession rules as well as limits on production and sales so that violators get punished and addicts get help Uruguays leader sat down for a wideranging AP interview in his garden after a quick ride in his Volkswagen Beetle with his wife Sen Lucia Topolansky to the butchers shop to buy some meat for dinner He answered questions surrounded by chickens cats and dogs at the small farm on a hill overlooking Montevideo where he lives and grows flowers for sale Its a critical time for Mujica and the ruling Broad Front coalition which has staked its reputation on outcompeting traffickers and treating marijuana more as a problem of public health than law enforcement Mujica also is negotiating with Obama over Guantanamo He says he wants to help close the US detention center by taking some prisoners but wont agree to Washingtons demand to keep the former terror suspects inside Uruguay They will be able to move freely They can leave But theyve been turned into walking skeletons Theyve been destroyed by what theyve gone through physically and psychologically Mujica said He declined to say more to avoid complicating the talks Weve made our proposal Its the United States that has to decide Mujica is a former guerrilla who led the armed Tupamaro movement before Uruguays 19731985 dictatorship He was jailed throughout the junta years mostly in solitary confinement Now he not only leads his country hes an international celebrity after making passionate speeches against the consumerism and greed Those speeches    and the

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/01/16/critics-pan-obamas-threat-bypass-congress/,This is a rush transcript from The Five January 16 2014 This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE COHOST Hello everyone Im Kimberly Guilfoyle along with Bob Beckel Eric Bolling Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld     Its 5 oclock in New York City  and this is The Five MUSIC GUILFOYLE Tonight Hollywood targets your constitutional right to bear arms while peddling films that promote gun violence Wait until you hear what one of the most powerful men in Tinseltown plans on doing to try to destroy the NRA But first forget about Congress Forget about the Constitution Ladies and gentlemen the president of the United States is putting America on notice BEGIN VIDEO CLIP PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA Ive got a pen and Ive got a phone and I can use that pen to sign executive orders and take executive action Where I can act on my own without Congress Im going to do so Ive got a pen to take executive actions where Congress wont and Ive got a telephone to rally folks around the country on this mission END VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE President Obama warning once again today that he doesnt need to follow the laws of the land to turn around the economy Well a lot of Americans are concerned about that including radio host Rush Limbaugh BOB BECKEL COHOST Ooh GREG GUTFELD COHOST Surprise BEGIN VIDEO CLIP RUSH LIMBAUGH RADIO HOST He can do executive orders to make things fair He can do executive orders and executive actions to get rid of the unfairness Hes going to make this lousy country finally fair Now he might have a pen and he might have a phone but what he does not have is the constitutional power to run this country like a dictator END VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE So Rush calls it the moves of a dictator and one prominent lawmaker is calling it lawlessness Heres Senator John Cornyn BEGIN VIDEO CLIP SEN JOHN CORNYN RTEXAS One of the most common questions I get back home in Texas is people wonder why cant you stop this What do you do when you have an overly politicized executive branch including Eric Holder who refused to hold the president accountable refused to enforce the law and you get what we have now which is essentially a lawlessness in the administration that is very troubling to say the least END VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE One thing I dont like is when you disrespect the law All right So Eric moves of a dictator Is Rush taking it too far or is that exactly what this is ERIC BOLLING COHOST Its exactly what it is I made a quick list Passing ObamaCare through back room deals changing the ObamaCare law arbitrarily after it became law That isnt in the Constitution either  recess appointments when Congress isnt technically in recess He did it   he used an executive pen there He sends drones to kill US citizens which is highly questionable These are all executive pen measures So when people talk  by the way hes going to take  take things like gay rights the environment and other special interest groups down the road as well Hes promised us hes going to do that So when other presidents used the executive pen they used to it for things like should we lower the flag at half mast for someone who died and things like that When President Obama uses it he changes the way America does business So him  that pen in his hands is far more dangerous than any other president at least in modern history if not ever GUILFOYLE And hes got three more years to use it Lets hope it runs out of ink All right Dana your reaction and welcome back DANA PERINO COHOST Thank you GUILFOYLE Someone who does respect the law and did her civic duty on  PERINO I had jury duty and no one picked me OK GUTFELD But you did condemn somebody to death which I thought was quite nice PERINO Just the iPhone clicks were on That was really irritating For a constitutional lawyer sometimes I think the president does himself as much of a service as  the gift that he has rhetorically its really rare that a president would actually lead with this as his option going into the State of the Union He has what he thinks are some really good proposals He could see if he could try  at least try to bring the Congress around and then when they dont come around to proposals that hes going to announce in three weeks then you could say  all right then Im going to try to do executive action Its rare that they start with executive action I also think that the other thing that he doesnt have is the power of the courts and one of the things that businesses dont like is executive orders because theyre not as solid as law and the president in a fifth year of a presidency soon to be the sixth is actually starting to see that now not just in the circuit courts but all the way up to the Supreme Court which are overturning things that were decided earlier on by executive action and then throwing everything back into disarray So what American businesses are looking for are certainty and executive orders dont really get them that GUILFOYLE All right And Greg Im noticing that your tie picks up on Danas beautiful turtleneck I just wanted to point that out beautiful shade of turquoise GUTFELD Were going to get to that later GUILFOYLE All right GUTFELD I dont  Im not  we always hear about this executive order stuff Im more interested in two factions One is the press The media enables this thinking They dont think Obama is accountable They think hes mountable They dont speak truth to power They hump it They are willing to work for this man They are OK if hes a dictator If Obama declared that every Tuesday is eat a dog day the New York Times would ask Pekinese or west highland 2010 Woody Allen said that he felt Barack Obama should be a dictator so that he could get things done and the first thing obviously that Woody Allen wanted done is to make it legal to have sex with stepdaughters The other faction  PERINO Hard to get that passed through GUTFELD I dont know with our Congress American people what about the American people I think the president delights in the fact that they have been roofied by technology and pop culture Theyre not conscious to any expansion of power which is why theyre happy to exist in this dependant decline Obamas basically writing on your face when youre passed out drunk GUILFOYLE Oh that is not nice I mean its not happened to me because I dont do that All right So Bob youve been  BECKEL So Bob GUILFOYLE  youve been making nice noises compared to other ones you make BECKEL Well first of all you notice every time you open the show you always come to me last every single time GUILFOYLE Theres one way to look at that  save the best or worst for last BECKEL Let me clean up and clarify some of the stuff thats going around the table GUILFOYLE You can have well give you time BECKEL First of all hes not reversing any laws Secondly presidents do a lot more than signing executive orders about flags at half staff Every president has interpreted laws the way they think it should be interpreted GUILFOYLE OK BECKEL If these guys are so upset about it Limbaugh and Cornine ph whatever his name is let him go to court instead of whining like a bunch of sissies I mean if they think this is so bad go to court Youve got a way to get out of it PERINO But they are going to court and that was my point Bob For example on the National Labor Relations Board the president is about to be handed a serious defeat by the Supreme Court BECKEL Thats right Well thats fine If thats the way it is PERINO So they wasted our time for five years BECKEL Theyre not going to do it on all these executive orders maybe one or two will be struck down Wait a second if he wants to do this thing hes got the right to do it and if these guys are just going to be little babies about it talk about it They get on the air Limbaugh talks about it Well Rush youve got a lot of money Sue him BOLLING Isnt that what our job to do is right there in media  GUILFOYLE To discuss this  BOLLING  to discuss what politicians  BECKEL Why dont you sue him Youve got a lot of money BOLLING  what politicians are doing so they stop doing it We expose some of the stuff As Dana points out the NLRB what actually went on is when Congress was away but not technically in recess they were home still in  they never gaveled out They are still in session President Obama appointed recess appointed three people to the NLRB board three out of five people He stacked that board without congressional without Senate or any approval and now were finding out most of the rules that have come down for the last two or three years might have to be thrown out of court BECKEL Theres thousands of rules and as far as I know theres three overturned BOLLING You know how much money the American taxpayer has had wasted  BECKEL Wait a minute When you get back to the reality you talk about the National Labor Relations Board which makes some sense because they did when they were in recess But outside of that the thousands of others hes done have they been challenged Have they been overturned PERINO Bob I think what Eric is saying is important That means that the decisions that the NLRB has made hes not talking about President Obamas executive action that those NLRB decisions are now going to be in dispute as well So thats the part of the uncertainty Let me also mention one thing  four Democrats it polls for them very well to call the government shutdown the Republican shutdown Youre going to hear that a lot OK Just as that actually helps Democrats get their people out to vote in 2014 Democrats make a mistake if they dont think that this whole lawlessness President Obama unhinged not going through Congress That actually polls very well for Republicans And in an offyear election with the helicopter in his sixth year and likely not going to win back the House and at risk of losing the Senate this kind of messaging from Cornyn or Limbaugh or whoever it is actually helps Republicans BECKEL So you think now weve got two things weve got ObamaCare and lawlessness Those are the two main issues for Republicans PERINO Jobs Actually you know what Lets pivot back to jobs GUTFELD But these issues are completely pointless The solution for all the people that are complaining right now about President Obama is to find your Obama Would you for God sake elect a winner Thats the issue here is the Republicans cant find a winner BECKEL Thats right because they dont have one GUTFELD Thats my point Theyve got to find one Stop whining  Im with Bob about a lot of the whining because its like do better you know GUILFOYLE Eric answer that BOLLING Its not whining Its really not whining Its President Obama using abusing the executive order abusing  BECKEL So say you BOLLING So say a lot of people I would say a lot of the taxpayers who are going to pay for a lot of the relitigation of all these lawsuits that went through the NLRB and I cant think of the other ones but theres going to be countless countless attacks on some of the decisions hes made with the executive pen Countless Thats us Thats our money Bob PERINO Let alone the hypocrisy CROSSTALK BOLLING And the thing is  GUILFOYLE And hes a constitutional lawyer He must have slept through class BECKEL For one thing ObamaCare hasnt won ph in the courts BOLLING But changing the ObamaCare law on his own after it became law BECKEL Thats been in the courts and the appeals court took one of them and knocked it down CROSSTALK BECKEL Are you kidding it They have been filing lawsuits  the Supreme Court ruled on ObamaCare BOLLING No no no no Were talking about after it became law The Supreme Court says its a law GUILFOYLE And then he changed it BOLLING President Obama said you know what Im eliminating employers from the mandate He arbitrarily did it  took it upon himself to change the law BECKEL And thats in court PERINO It hasnt been ruled on Bob GUILFOYLE It hasnt been decided on yet And it begs the question if he can do all that  if a new president comes into office can he just executive order and wipe it away BECKEL If its within the law sure he can GUTFELD But the issue here isnt what the president is doing is who lets him do it So when a new president comes in a Republican perhaps will not have the same ability to pull these things off because the media wont let him Thats why I go back to the initial villain in all of this is the media the mainstream media Not reflected here that are willing to let him do what he wants because inherently they agree GUILFOYLE Well end it on that note BECKEL Good for them GUILFOYLE All right Next one of the most powerful people in Hollywood is threatening to take down an organization that defends your right to bear arms What movie mogul Harvey Weinstein just told Howard Stern hes going to try to do to wipe out the NRA And later The Daily Show just put together the most dramatic and hysterical ode to The Five and its getting a lot of buzz online You must stick around for that And our reaction coming up on The Five Stay with us COMMERCIAL BREAK BOLLING Welcome back yall One of the things we do here on The Five is point out hypocrisy Politicians saying one thing and doing another celebrities though are some of the worst offenders Watch this clip from a Harvey Weinstein movie VIDEO CLIP PLAYS BOLLING And another Harvey Weinstein film VIDEO CLIP PLAYS BOLLING In fact most of Harveys movies involve guns lots and lots of guns so you could say Mr Weinstein probably owes a substantial portion of his substantial fortune to guns Now listen to Harvey Weinstein talking out of his substantial ass GUILFOYLE Ooh BEGIN AUDIO CLIP HOWARD STERN Do you own a gun HARVEY WEINSTEIN No STERN You dont have any guns WEINSTEIN No Id never want to have a gun I dont think we need guns in this country and I hate it and I think the NRA is a disaster area and Im going to make a movie I shouldnt say this but Ill tell it to you Howard Im going to make a move with Meryl Streep and were going to take this issue head on and theyre going to wish they werent alive after Im done with them END AUDIO CLIP BOLLING All right Well bring it around KG wish they werent alive GUILFOYLE Well first of all I feel traumatized by shooting the snowman in the face Frosty never hurt anybody Yes this is such hypocrisy You pocket millions and millions of dollars off of action movies violent films You line your coffers with it and you make more films that have violence in it and then you have the audacity to go against an organization that is just saying I want to protect our constitutional right to bear arms in a legal and thoughtful way with background checks that also dont want people to get shot and murdered but it doesnt mean that you cant own a gun I mean this makes no sense to me and now look what hes doing Hes luring Meryl Streep into it BOLLING Bobby BECKEL I think Harvey probably overstated the case a little bit but I will say this First of all the NRA has stopped background checks at gun shows and done everything they possibly can to make it impossible to have reasonable gun control GUILFOYLE Bob where do you get this BOLLING Where  GUILFOYLE Bob Bob Bob BECKEL Wait a sec Gun shows were exempted from background checks Now thats fine if thats what they want to do I think theres 5 million law abiding citizens who are members of the NRA and they are fine people They have wanted to have their right to have a gun I understand that The NRA itself is an organization on Route 66 in  outside of Washington DC is full of a bunch of right wing jerks who have tried to do everything they can to subvert reasonable debate and discussion BOLLING Do they have a right to exist the NRA BECKEL Yes barely They have a right Should they  BOLLING A lot of unions are doing the same thing on the left that the NRA is doing on the right BECKEL I think the NRA is a horrible decrepit wretched place BOLLING And some would say that about the Teamsters BECKEL You already have BOLLING Dana a couple of movies Pulp Fiction Django Unchained and Glorious Bastards Killing Them Softly Sin City all Harvey Weinstein movies going on screen Gangs of New York Kill Bill goes on and on Hes very very familiar with the guns PERINO Those are all the movies that Ive watched with my hands over my eyes GUILFOYLE Theyre scary PERINO I dont watch them I cant do it It makes me crazy He would do more of a favor in America to tackle gun violence if he would take on the teachers unions and do a movie about how teachers unions oppose school choice which basically leaves all these young people were worried about that are getting guns and gang activity  gang and drug activity all around the country If they actually had access to better education there would be actually less crime Thats my opinion This is a guy so divorced from reality its like a pimp who thinks hes helping women in the work force BECKEL Did you say a pimp GUILFOYLE What a good analogy Dana CROSSTALK PERINO Well you meet certain people at jury duty BOLLING Oh boy this is setting up a segment later in the show Go ahead GUILFOYLE Dana unleashed Check her out GUTFELD He used no facts and thats the only way you can win a gun control argument is by operating on emotion GUILFOYLE Yes GUTFELD Weinstein appointed himself as the arbiter of your family safety When was the last time his life was in danger probably choking on a veal chop He doesnt need a gun because he has security He travels in rarified air His feet never touch the street  feet mind you that he cant see because hes a corpulent cretin The reason why theres probably going to be more gun death because of what Bob mentioned about the NRA subverting discussion When you make extreme rhetoric about  on both sides there is no solution theres no progress and hes doing the same thing And hes suggesting people should lose all their guns Thats enough people to go buy their guns and it reflects kind of a class warfare its a fundamental hatred of people who have to protect themselves He doesnt have to protect himself because hes filthy rich He has security But the rest of America they dont live like him They have to have a gun at home Hes going after poor people who want to protect themselves Hes a jackass GUILFOYLE Yes in dangerous neighborhood BOLLING So basically  GUTFELD Hes advocating death BOLLING So what Im understanding is hes going to put together a movie that vilifies the NRA and I can only imagine what its going to entail Hes going to have my guess is you know people who are stereotypical gun crazy who  CROSSTALK BECKEL I think Harvey is a little bit removed from reality in all this Even I have conceded that theres nothing youre going to do to stop people from buying guns I mean thats  apparently their constitutional right apparently GUILFOYLE Yes But he wants to stop people who are lawabiding from buying guns Thats the problem Hes not getting any impact with the gang members BECKEL He wants to do away with all guns I personally would like to do away with all handguns GUTFELD He said he didnt want people ownership He said he didnt want  for private ownership BECKEL Well if thats  I didnt hear that part of what he said If thats what he said then he really is off the reservation here but the idea of putting on a movie that takes on the NRA I say  more power to you Harvey Make it as big as you can as broad as you can and get as many stars as you can so many people will watch it because the NRA needs to be exposed for what they are which is a deconstructive force in American political and public dialogue GUTFELD No one will go see this movie No one PERINO But it will still win an Oscar GUTFELD Yes it will win an Oscar but no one go Politically driven ideological pulp doesnt INAUDIBLE Look Lone Survivor is huge Hollywood does not understand that BOLLING Thats a gun movie GUTFELD Yes it is BOLLING All right Were going to leave it there Straight ahead we spend a lot of time explaining the ObamaCare train wreck for just about everybody in America Now get ready to watch funny man Jimmy Kimmel sum it up in 45 seconds Back in a second COMMERCIAL BREAK PERINO All right So we told you earlier this week about ObamaCares youth problem There arent a whole lot of young people signing up for the presidents plan and the ones who are will face higher cost than they might have realized Late night host Jimmy Kimmel just did a great job helping explain that with a hilarious parody Watch this BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS JIMMY KIMMEL COMEDIAN They expect young people to buy insurance the same time PlayStation 4 comes out You know if you want young people to sign up maybe you shouldnt make the laws so you can stay on your parents plan until you turn 26 What kid is going to say no thanks mom and dad Ive got the premiums covered Just to make sure the younger people do sign up the Obama administration is rolling out a new ad campaign thats targeted specifically at the young and vibrant UNIDENTIFIED MALE Hi Im Alex and this is my wife Martha And were both approaching the big 60 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE And we have health care issues to deal with UNIDENTIFIED MALE Its not cheap UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE But fortunately we dont have to pay for it UNIDENTIFIED MALE No you do UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE Thats right You young people are paying for our drugs and our doctors ANNOUNCER The Affordable Care Act next time maybe pick up a newspaper END VIDEO CLIPS PERINO Blogger Ace of Spades had a response to the piece saying that I like everything about this except the part where he encourages young people to vote Then he suggested pick up a newspaper once in a while Id reverse that sequence Pick up a newspaper and then after reading it for a year or two then start voting Greg you just said that you think thats the best thing thats being done on health care GUTFELD Yes No it should have been done two years ago but it was brilliant Also I dont think picking up a newspaper helps because every newspaper endorsed ObamaCare ObamaCare is to health care as a fart is to an elevator GUILFOYLE Ew Oh so gross GUTFELD And what kills me Kimmel is an exception to the celebrities who are  who are pushing this mess who are the worst people because they are exempt from the very suffering that they are putting on everybody else They are the meth dealers who do not take their own product PERINO Eric when we were  leading up to President Obama signing the bill into law one of the things that we talked about and others were trying to get a voice in on the discussion to say that this logically economically the rules of economics it will not work when it comes to the young people Do you think thats going to bear out to be true that the rules of economics are going to be proven once again BOLLING Its happening right now The numbers that the White House released themselves HHS released show 24 percent of young people of the signees are 24 percent of young people They were expecting 40 and knew all the bad stuff was going to happen They never put paper  pen to paper and looked at the numbers There are so many numerical financial flaws in ObamaCare Young people realize Ill take the penalty Ill deal with whatever it takes for the next couple of years Maybe a couple years down the road they will start to pay But in the meantime no one  they are not going to sign up PERINO And you hear them say  BOLLING Its going to cost us hundreds of billions that we didnt expect PERINO Right And you hear them say well and then Ill just hope I dont get into a car accident They actually say that Bob you wanted to get these ads that Magic Johnson and Alonzo Mourning have been chosen by HHS as two of the spokespeople to try to get young people to buy insurance Lets look at those BEGIN VIDEO CLIP OBAMACARE AD MAGIC JOHNSON FORMER NBA PLAYER Young people think they are Superman like nothing is ever going to happen to them But trust me one day something is going to happen and youre going to need a quality health plan So make sure you get ObamaCare ALONZO MOURNING FORMER NABA PLYAER I was at the top of my game I felt invincible But when I went for my regular team physical it turned out I had a serious kidney disease It was caught in time to treat it and lucky for me I was insured Enroll today so you can stay in the game END VIDEO CLIP PERINO Those ads seem very well done but they had employersponsored insurance What they are trying to do is get kids to pay for it themselves BECKEL Yes Well I mean first of all I think they are very good ads The Kimmel thing let me point out its cute and all that But the fact is two things one weve been  younger people have been paying for older people for the last 40 years so I dont know why thats anything new Secondly what we dont include in this 24 percent are the number of people as Greg pointed out who are in their parents plan at 26 and under which are probably a lot So I dont know what percentage of young people really are insured now but my guess is a lot and that was ObamaCare that did that So I would include that as part of ObamaCare Everybody who is under their parents plan  BOLLING Yes but they knew that BECKEL Huh I just  I just want  I want you to add it to the figure youre talking about BOLLING No no I dont have to add it because they themselves said we expect 40 percent of the enrollees  BECKEL Theres no question about that They are way behind I accept that But I think the idea of using people like this to  GUILFOYLE Creative BECKEL It is creative and its the right thing to do because eventually these people will have to have insurance they just are GUILFOYLE Heres the problem They are trying to get after the invincibles right The 19 to 29yearolds OK Magic Johnson and Alonzo Mourning Ive heard of you before but Im young guy you know These things happen to you when youre older They still feel they have time Why is it that they are going to take whatever discretionary money they feel they have left over to put into a system  BECKEL Because most of them are on mom and pops health care plan Thats why GUILFOYLE Yes its a not disincentive Its not going to happen So were not going to get the cash from them BECKEL Theres no disincentive when youre on your parents plan GUILFOYLE Right But what Im saying is they are already on the parents plan so theres no motivating factor for them to try to do anything else BECKEL Why should they GUILFOYLE So theyre not going to give over their money Its cute and charming to try and  BOLLING They shouldnt Youre right CROSSTALK BECKEL When they get off the parents plans they should GUILFOYLE Thats what we just said BOLLING  is that young people shouldnt be on it and theyre not and thats why the system the whole ObamaCare financials of it  BECKEL Excuse me Its because of ObamaCare that they have their parents insurance PERINO I know But its also because they can be on until they are 26 that the president is currently in this predicament that they risk running into the death spiral with the insurance company and then the question will be does the government  does the taxpayer you and I bail out the health insurance companies GUTFELD We probably will Again once again celebrities are the doormats to power Its funny that guys name is Mourning because ObamaCare is creating nothing but misery for everybody Magic Johnson links his HIV and treatment to health care as though ObamaCare would provide the same level of care that a mega rich celebrity would get Is he going to dump his coverage Is he going to dump it and sign up for ObamaCare GUILFOYLE No GUTFELD Will any politician do that Of course not because its terrible GUILFOYLE They need Dennis Rodman for these ads CROSSTALK PERINO Hes a little busy BECKEL By the way hundreds of billions on health care we spend 1 trillion on war Do you think thats well spent CROSSTALK GUTFELD War works BECKEL War works It works real well Take a look at Iraq CROSSTALK GUTFELD I am we won that war BECKEL No we didnt Fallujah has been taken over again CROSSTALK GUTFELD Why is that BECKEL Why GUTFELD President Obama PERINO Dont you love it BECKEL President Obama PERINO Dont you love it when Bob makes our point its great like a walk around the park BECKEL Are you kidding me President Obama because he actually pulled troops out after a tenyear war BOLLING Can we stay on this one more second The reason young people arent signing up  under ObamaCare the deductibles are so massive What young person has 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000 out of pocket un front before he gets paid back a penny Theyre not going to do it BECKEL Thats your math Maybe its true You know what you can do if you let universal  PERINO Weve got to go BECKEL  service ph that everybody get drafted and then they get covered by the government PERINO Round and round the mulberry bush All right Next up a lot of people have been wondering what weve got to say about that epic skit The Daily Show just put together Its about The Five and Greg and I especially got extra attention in it It was very charming Youre going to see what Im talking about Its quite something Stick around COMMERCIAL BREAK GUTFELD Tuesday night the great Daily Show correspondent Samantha Bee attempted to unravel

Molotov cocktails through the windows of two medical marijuana businesses and spraypainting NOT IN OUR TOWN just before the Billings City Council was supposed to take up a ban on any new pot shops Montana and other states that have legalized medical marijuana are seeing a backlash with public anger rising and politicians passing laws to slow the proliferation of pot shops and bring order to what has become a wideopen Wild West sort of industry     They are looking to avoid what happened in California which allowed the pot industry to grow so out of control that at one point Los Angeles had more medical marijuana shops than Starbucks  about 1000 by one count Yeah its out of control  and it needs control if not extinction Montana Sen Jim Shockley said Friday Theres no control over distribution Theres no control over whos growing it Theres no control in dosage Fourteen states have legalized medical marijuana beginning with California in 1996 and the District of Columbia followed suit this month The laws allow chronically ill people to buy marijuana with permission from a doctor But many of these states passed their laws without working out the details And they werent ready for the boom in pot shops that occurred this past year after the Obama administration announced it wouldnt prosecute medical marijuana users In some places law enforcement officials and civic leaders are complaining that there are too many marijuana dispensaries that buyers and sellers are falling victim to robberies and breakins that drivingundertheinfluence arrests are on the rise and that the pot is being sold indiscriminately and winding up on the black market Some state and local governments are now rushing to put regulations in place Colorado lawmakers passed sweeping rules this month for pot growers and the estimated 1100 shops selling marijuana creating a new state bureaucracy led by auditors and criminal investigators who would monitor the industry to make sure for example that the drug is being sold only to patients who have a doctors recommendation Regulators expect only about half of the states dispensaries to continue operating under the stricter rules The Billings City Council approved a sixmonth moratorium on new medical marijuana businesses in May after the violence against pot businesses the previous two nights On Thursday the city of about 90000 people ordered 25 of Billings 81 pot businesses to shut down after discovering they were not properly registered with the state I was hoping this would be a more civil discussion City Councilman Denis Pitman said after the firebombings I wish it wouldnt have gotten to this level Los Angeles officials recently took steps to shut down hundreds of dispensaries and ensure that the remaining ones meet stringent new guidelines Owners must undergo a background check their stores must be 1000 feet from schools parks and other gathering sites and their pot must be tested at an independent laboratory Montanas medical board is considering curbing mass screenings and teleconferences that make it easy for people to get a marijuana card Montana in recent days has seen cannabis caravans mobile operations that pass through town charging people 100 to 150 for a doctors recommendation to smoke pot The push for tighter regulation has infuriated medical marijuana users They are creating ordinances and moratoriums that are blatantly against the law said Jason Christ founder of the Montana Caregivers Network the group that organizes the cannabis caravans They do not serve to protect the welfare of our citizens and they do no good In Colorado earlier this month veterans in wheelchairs college students and dispensary owners packed legislative hearings to speak out against the regulations The hearings lasted eight hours and reached a fever pitch when several people had to be removed for shouting at lawmakers Medical marijuana has been around for more than five years in Montana but the boom came this past year The number of registered users in Montana a state with a population of just under 1 million has gone from 2923 last June to about 15000 today The number of registered suppliers has increased from 919 to about 5000 DUI arrests involving marijuana have skyrocketed as have traffic fatalities where marijuana was found in the system of one of the drivers Montana narcotics chief Mark Long told a legislative committee last month Also Montana confidentiality laws prevent law enforcement from knowing where most medical marijuana businesses are and civic leaders complain they dont know whether the shops are up to city and fire codes or close to churches schools or parks During Colorados legislative debate state Sen Chris Romer quoted the Grateful Dead as he contemplated the spectacle of

Fox,http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2014/01/22/credit-cards-our-moral-guardians/,"When it comes to arbiters of morality and integrity we look toward the Ten Commandments our parents and  in a strange and largely unnoticed new trend  the corporate behemoths that issue our credit cards American Express MasterCard Visa and Discover as enforcers of community standards individual decency and commercial honor Really Really In recent years and rarely at their pleasure credit card companies and the banks that issue credit cards have found themselves bridging the legal voids left by regulatory agencies and politicians Amid pressure from customers consumer advocates and others who have no place left to turn credit card firms have felt compelled to cut off the financial lifeblood of those working in the margins of respectable commerce Online gambling firms Webbased gun merchants Purveyors of legal marijuana for medical or even recreational use Leakers of secret and sensitive government documents And most recently the operators of shadowy websites that charge people to remove online mug shots All have had to curtail or even terminate their activities when credit card issuers and banks stopped processing what some people consider morally questionable financial transactions These topics have definitely been of interest as of late said Sanette Chao a spokeswoman for American Express Only game in town The credit card companies are so large so crucial to modern enterprise that they should not be permitted to act as an arbiter of moral right and wrong said one representative of a cutoff client In an online environment credit cards are one of the only ways of paying said Joe Centrich a Texas lawyer who represents two mug shot websites that have come under fire from people whose images appeared on the sites  and have been cut off by the credit card companies You take away the ability to process credit cards from a business and that business has a very short life span Others welcome the intrusion When the credit card companies become aware that there is an identifiable largescale extortion ring operating through its systems  they should act to curb it said Scott Ciolek an Ohio lawyer who won a settlement on behalf of people who had trouble getting their mug shots removed from the websites represented by Centrich Otherwise these companies all become knowing accomplices When it comes to noncriminal uses like the purchasing of firearms legal marijuana and gamblingthe credit card companies have the right to deny usage but not an obligation as they would in the case of illegal activity Ciolek said But moreover those companies have to consider the effect of their involvement and determine if its something they wish to involve their business employees stockholders and families in These decisions are difficult for credit card firms and they are fraught with complications regarding the loss of revenue the potential for legal action the risk of becoming embroiled in political controversies and the possibility of angering large numbers of customers Credit card companies say they carefully weigh their responsibilities when these issues are brought to their attention Among the factors they must consider the legal standing of the business How widespread and damaging the reported abuses might be The potential legal liability to the card issuer of acting  or not acting The point at which a credit card issuers right to decide who and who not to do business with might cross the line into discrimination In general though the card companies prefer not to discuss the specific rationales for each decision or in many cases even their general philosophies regarding the trend We cannot get into the details of our decision process said Chao the American Express spokeswoman Our decision to prohibit or allow the use of American Express cards for various industries is purely a business decision or in the case of marijuana transactions guided by federal law MasterCard spokesman Jim Issokson said the card issuers guidelines are clearly stated and require our customers to conduct lawful activity where they are licensed to use our brands he said Matt Towson a spokesman for Discover said Unfortunately I am unable to muse on the current environment Representatives of Visa did not respond to several requests for comment Legally card companies appear to be covered The user agreements they craft for credit card holders authorized users merchants and payment processors give the card issuers and their affiliated banks the right to restrict and define the use of the cards Consumer advocates say theyre glad to have the help but they doubt that the card companies are acting altruistically I dont believe these decisions are strictly being made on moral grounds said David Jones president of the Association of Independent Credit Counseling Agencies These banks are very interested in their bottom lines their image with customers and their insulation from lawsuits especially classaction lawsuits In the current hyperlitigious classsensitive environment everyone is afraid to take a stand on anything Jones said After all these banks are profitmaking businesses striving to please their stockholders and fend off the regulatorsIn my opinion that is the motivation despite the appearance of moral sensitivity Whatever the motivation the number and type of incidents involving the severing of credit card and debit card relationships continues to grow Mug shot removal services
In one of the most recent cases involving card issuers and matters of commercial morality MasterCard Visa American Express and Discover now are refusing to process payments to firms that remove  or claim to remove  arrest photos published on a proliferating number of mug shot websites Scores of such sites now regularly search law enforcement websites and download and publish mug shots of people recently arrested  but importantly not yet convicted or exonerated Then the sites wait for the inevitable reaction Thousands of people are shocked and alarmed to find the provocative and reputationdamaging shots easily within view of relatives friends and current or potential employers What to do Often the answer is to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars to operations that offer to have the mug shots removed Some of those operations appear closely related to the websites that publish the photos in the first place Many observers consider this as something akin to extortion and the credit card companies  along with PayPal where accounts often are funded by credit cards  recently decided to decline doing business with most mug shot removal operations For mug shot removal sites when those sites are brought to our attention we conduct a detailed review and cancel as appropriate said American Express Chao We do not accept transactions for mug shot removal services said Discovers Towson Ciolek the attorney for aggrieved people whose arrest photos are now on very public display approved By severing connections with the mug shot firms the credit card companies and affiliated banks eliminate the motivation to move forward with the enterprise and over time the hardship will bring the forprofit mug shot companies to an end he said Centrich the attorney for two mug shot websites sees it differently Its really quite disappointing to me he said There are only a few of these financial institutions  its really an oligarchy  and theyve decided they just dont like this kind of business Legalized marijuana
Though the sale and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes is rapidly being approved around the nation  and Colorado and the state of Washington have legalized pot for recreational use  most credit card companies still refuse to process transactions regarding pot They say the legal environment remains too blurry and they fear violating federal banking and drug laws that remain in effect American Express continues to prohibit the use of the card for marijuana sales Chao said It is our policy to adhere to federal law in such matters MasterCards Issokson said the issue already is complex and seems to be getting more so When it comes to the marijuana issue were facing a situation where theres an inconsistency between federal and state laws he said As such were now seeking guidance from the federal government In this instance the federal government considers marijuana sales illegal but is currently not challenging state laws that legalize marijuana sales Issokson said Given the complexity of this situation we will continue to seek guidance and inform merchant acquirers of any new developments Visa on the other hand seems to be softening its stance saying it will defer to the rules and wishes of each bank or other entity that issues its cards In offering our payment service Visa adheres to the rule of law and seeks to prevent our network from being used for unlawful purposes the company recently told The Denver Post In this instance the federal government considers the sale of marijuana illegal but has announced that it will not challenge state laws that legalize and regulate marijuana sales the company told the newspaper Given the federal governments position and recognizing this is an evolving legal matter with different standards applicable in different states our local merchant acquirers  banks  are best suited to make any determination about potential illegality So for now most legal purveyors of pot still must deal in cash which carries other risks For many businesses this means storing hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal safes carrying sacks full of hundreds to the state Department of Revenue in order to pay taxes and looking for unusual sources of startup revenue the Marijuana Policy Project a Washington DCbased group that lobbies on behalf of reforming marijuana laws said in a statement For some businesses the added burdens have forced them to close shop Online gun sales A key element of the credit card industry recently began refusing to process online transactions involving legal gun sales Authorizenet owned by Visa last September severed its relationship with the nations largest online gun purveyor  the Hyatt Gun Shop of Charlotte NC Authorizenet told Hyatt officials that their operation violated its acceptable use guidelines Other online gun retailers also were cut off Authorizenet is one of the nations leading payment gateways operations that securely link online merchants to credit card issuers The gateways acceptable use guidelines prohibit among others transactions involving any product or service that is unlawful anything obscene or pornographic and anything associated with illegal gambling operations illicit drugs and the sale of firearms Representatives of Authorizenet and Visa have declined to comment specifically on the decision to terminate operations between Authorizenet and online gun shops though they note that Visa itself will still handle payments for such transactions  if they come through a different payment gateway And there is no problem using credit cards for legal purchases at brickandmortar gun shops Still the development has infuriated online gun merchants and their customers some of whom have organized a boycott of any business that displays an Authorizenet logo Online gambling
Under federal law credit card companies now are prohibited from processing transactions connected to online gambling including those related to the immensely popular online poker operations  The federal Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 required card networks and banks to navigate a swamp of conflicting definitions and rules if they wanted to do business with US online gambling sites Most decided the heck with it  were just going to cut off the gambling sites The law took full effect in 2009 and it had an unintended and for some Americans financially disastrous effect It pushed many online gamblers into using offshore gambling sites which soon were accused of defrauding unprotected US gamblers out of hundreds of millions of dollars Now members of Congress and state lawmakers are working  sometimes at cross purposes  to make sense of a chaotic knot of online gambling rules from federal and state laws and regulatory agencies Some measures would continue the ban on credit card use though others would authorize online gambling credit card transactions  under tightly controlled circumstances It is far better for the players financial fate if the safety and security of Internet gaming transactions are in the hands of the US banking system and the responsible and regulated American gaming corporations John Pappas executive director of the Poker Players Alliance which claims more than 1 million members told a congressional committee last month If anything a prohibition would make the likelihood of money laundering or other fraudulent activity far greater because it would be forced underground without any oversight or control WikiLeaks
The operation that takes pride is publishing secret documents leaked from various governments and other entities around the world WikiLeaks was largely crippled in 2010 and 2011 when MasterCard Visa and American Express stopped processing donations The card companies said WikiLeaks which does its work in the service of what it calls transparency was engaging in illegal activity and they would have no part of it MasterCard rules prohibit customers from directly or indirectly engaging in or facilitating any action that is illegal spokesman Chris Monteiro told CNET at the time WikiLeaks and its supporters intermittently found ways around the ban and the operations website now provides an online donation form that encourages credit card donations though with a touch of mystery Since late 2010 credit card donations to us have been blocked by Visa and MasterCard in an effort to suppress our public interest publishing activities WikiLeaks says in a statement concerning the banking blockade against us The blockade is still in effect but as of summer 2012 there are ways around it   WikiLeaks says We have won several victories against the banks in the courts and we will continue to fight the banking blockade How will this all play out No one seems to know though American Express and presumably other credit card companies believe their first responsibility is to the customers who use their cards Highrisk industries account for high levels of card member credit losses and customer service disputes said Chao the American Express spokeswoman Prohibited card acceptances for various industries are designed to protect our card members by limiting fraud and unfair practices among other things See related Amid online gambling boom credit card acceptance lags Buy lottery tickets with a credit card Maybe States limit welfare food stamp debit cards to halt sin purchases",2014-02-17T16:15-05:00,drugs
