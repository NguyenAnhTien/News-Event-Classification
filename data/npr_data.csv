NPR,http://www.npr.org/2014/07/09/329587949/states-push-for-prison-sentence-reform-and-prosecutors-push-back?ft=3&f=,Some red states like Louisiana and Texas have emerged as leaders in a new movement to divert offenders from prisons and into drug treatment work release and other incarceration alternatives By most counts Louisiana has the highest incarceration rate in the country In recent years sentencing reformers in the capital Baton Rouge have loosened some mandatory minimum sentences and have made parole slightly easier for offenders to get But as reformers in Louisiana push for change theyre also running into stiffening resistance  especially from local prosecutors Its all happening as the number of Americans behind bars has started to decline There are multiple reasons for that including crime rates that have been dropping since the 1990s as well as the impact of the Supreme Courts 2011 requirement that toughoncrime California reduce its prison population And theres another factor a growing bipartisan consensus for sentencing reform Local politicians are getting political cover for those efforts from conservative groups like Right on Crime It is a growing consensus on the right that this is the direction we want to be going says Kevin Kane of the libertarianleaning Pelican Institute for Public Policy in Louisiana Most people will point to Well its saving money and thats all conservatives care about But I think it goes beyond that Kane says libertarians are interested in limiting the governments power to lock people away while the religious right likes the idea of giving people a shot at redemption  especially when it comes to nonviolent drug offenders Still not everyone is embracing these ideas In some places theres been considerable pushback  especially when the idea of eliminating prison time for drug offenders arises Pushback In Louisiana In Lafayette La the sheriffs department has reinvented its approach to drug offenders Marie Collins a counselor by trade runs the departments treatment programs She estimates at least 80 percent of the people in the parish jail got there because of substance abuse The concept of Lets lock them up and throw away the key does nothing for society and does nothing for us because you havent taught them anything she says So theres counseling offered inside this jail The sheriffs staff is also constantly scanning the jails population for nonviolent inmates it can release early into the appropriate programs on the outside One option is the Acadiana Recovery Center right next door a treatment program run by Collins and the sheriffs department  though the staffers play down their connection to law enforcement In fact you can seek treatment there even if youve never been arrested If we can be proactive and provide the treatment before they get to jail itll actually cost us less money Collins says Arguments like that are making headway at the state level But reformers in Baton Rouge are also experiencing pushback By most counts the state has the highest incarceration rate in the country and theres a traditional preference for long sentences The states prison population is also hard for lawmakers to ignore Under guard and dressed in gray jumpsuits marked offender inmates work at the capitol building emptying wastebaskets and serving food in the cafeteria Liz Mangham a lobbyist has represented the conservative sentencing reformers in Baton Rouge While theyve made progress she says they appeared to cross a red line this spring with a bill to step down Louisianas stiff penalties for possession of marijuana Under current law possession is a felony on the second offense A third may get you as much as 20 years in prison Mangham recalls the scene when the bill came up for a crucial hearing The Judiciary Committee room was full The anteroom across the hall which is twice the size was full and the halls were full  of district attorneys and sheriffs coming down to oppose the bill she says The bill died on the spot In Louisiana and other parts of the South district attorneys and sheriffs  who Mangham calls the courthouse crowd  have a lot of political clout at the state level She says its understandable why most sheriffs opposed the bill because they house state prisoners in parish jails and every prisoner represents a payment from the state So when youre making money to warehouse prisoners why on earth would you be in favor of sentencing reform Mangham says But the district attorneys opposition is more complex  and interesting And its emblematic of a growing conflict thats taking place nationally between sentencing reformers and prosecutors The Issue Leverage The vast majority of criminal cases in America are resolved through plea bargains Defendants plead guilty out of fear of getting a worse sentence if they dont Plea bargains jumped above 90 percent in the 1980s and 90s in part because a wave of harsh new sentences for drug offenses strengthened prosecutors hands when bargaining with defendants For a DA to have the ability to dangle over someones head 10 20 years in jail that provides them with tremendous leverage to pretty much get whatever they want says Louisiana State Sen JP Morrell a Democrat from New Orleans and former public defender Morrell was one of the sponsors of the marijuana sentencing reform bill that failed in Baton Rouge He says one of the benefits of that reform would have been a reduction in the power of prosecutors to as Louisiana courthouse slang puts it bitch a defendant A reference to Louisianas habitual offender law it refers to a DA threatening to use past convictions  often for marijuana possession  to multiply the length of a defendants potential sentence But what Morrell sees as a problem prosecutors regard as a necessary tool Thats because many states are now considering similar reductions to mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses and Congress is considering a similar move for federal drug charges Prosecutors insist they use the threat of harsh sentences responsibly but say its a tool they cant do without Last fall at a hearing in the US Senate Judiciary Committee the thenexecutive director of the National District Attorneys Association Scott Burns warned against rolling back drug sentences Why now With crime at record lows why are we looking at sweeping changes Burns said He endorsed smart on crime reforms such as drug courts but he cautioned against depriving prosecutors of one of our most effective sticks John de Rosier the district attorney of Calcasieu Parish La says we have people all the time that we know have been involved in robberies rapes and murders We havent been able to prove our cases but were in court with them for secondoffense possession of marijuana What do you think were going to do Thats commonly referred to as prosecutorial discretion and its an argument that alarms sentencing reformers like Morrell That level of discretion ought to be terrifying to people Morrell says If you cannot convict someone of a murder of a robbery whatever the fact that you have a disproportionate backup charge to convict them anyway kind of defeats the purpose of due process The pushback against sentencing reform also comes from a fear that liberalizing drug laws too much could cost lives Even as Morrell was trying to reduce sentences for marijuana this spring the Louisiana Legislature was contemplating increasing real sentences for heroin possession Like other parts of the country Louisiana has been experiencing a surge in heroin deaths People are being found dead with the needle still in their arm says Rep Joseph Lopinto a Republican from Metairie La He sponsored the bill that would require prison time even for a first offense In a perfect world I would like everybody thats on heroin right now to go get treated Lopinto says But most of the time when that come to Jesus moment happens its because of law enforcement Even Collins the Lafayette Sheriffs Department counselor admits prison has its uses I do see putting them in jail and expecting them to get better because we said so is ridiculous she says However if you put them in a treatment program and utilize prison as a motivational tool it is very effective The Scales Of Justice Still if a prosecutor is going to threaten drug users with jail time that threat has to be credible  someone has to be the example And in Louisiana those examples can seem extreme Nobody knows this better than Lisa Ladd whose 27yearold son Corey is now serving a 20year sentence for his conviction for thirdoffense marijuana possession He was arrested with a halfounce Ladd seems dumbfounded by whats happened to Corey He broke the law he does deserve some sort of punishment she says But 20 years The scales of justice are just so way off balance They really are Now shes raising her imprisoned sons infant daughter As she talks about it she breaks down I just lost a son she says and after a moment it becomes clear that shes not talking about Corey Another son who was 23 died of a drug overdose Ladd just got the paperwork from the coroner It looks like it was a mix of heroin and pills Ladds younger son did not have the same kind of legal troubles Corey did Instead of jail he went for treatment in Florida But it didnt take and now hes the one whos dead Would he still be alive if hed had that come to Jesus moment with law enforcement as Lopinto puts it Its that kind of question thats dogging the states as they try to figure out the best way to deal with their stillcrowded prisons Copyright 2014

that for much of the road trip we were being watched Border Patrol agents customs officers cameras sensors radar and aircraft track movement in the Borderland None of that has stopped the struggle to control the border or the debate over how best to do it The Border Patrol  part of US Customs and Border Protection  allowed us a look inside the communications center at its headquarters in Laredo Texas The room had no windows just a giant wall of screens The Border Patrol has mounted cameras high on steel poles overlooking the Rio Grande which in this sector is the border Agents in cubicles watched the monitors A whiteboard on the wall was covered with emergency numbers to call the Drug Enforcement Administration air evacuation and also a phone number labeled Unmanned Drone No were not going to publish the number The man in charge of this South Texas sector tries to marry new technology with old technology Cmdr Robert Harris keeps a saddle in his office We still do have horses Harris told us and I would argue that we have some of the best trackers in the country The trackers are trained to follow footprints in the vast stretches of wilderness along the border Tracking is laborintensive of course but the Border Patrol nearly doubled its manpower in recent years to more than 21000 agents We dont have 100percent visibility on the border said Harris but I have a much higher degree of confidence that if somebody chooses to enter our area of responsibility we have a higherthanaverage chance of arresting that individual But the Border Patrol is under intense pressure Were Not In A Situation To Lose Fights In a series of incidents including one in Harris sector Border Patrol agents shot and killed unarmed Mexicans In some cases the Mexicans were said to be throwing rocks This month the Border Patrol reminded agents to avoid unnecessary risk to themselves or others but it resisted calls for bigger change saying agents have been pelted with rocks hundreds of times per year Asked about the rules under which the agents in his sector operate Harris answered frankly Were not in a situation to lose fights If our agents are assaulted I want them to prevail The Border Patrol is also criticized for not doing enough as we heard when we continued our road trip Outside Eagle Pass Texas we arrived at the home of a rancher whose properly lines the border Dob Cunningham took us for a Jeep ride on the property About a year ago Cunningham said they came over here to my shop and took all the tools and a welder just like that By they he meant thieves crossing the border Cunningham is 79 Decades ago he was a Border Patrol agent and later ran the US port of entry at Eagle Pass These days hes developed a lovehate relationship with the Border Patrol To show us why he drove us toward a bluff overlooking the Rio Grande Residents On Patrol If I holler Bail out  jump out he told us as we neared the edge of a bluff overlooking the river Sometimes these brakes dont work We stopped in time at the foot of a giant steel pole It held two of those Border Patrol cameras aimed up and down the river Cunningham said the wire to one camera was cut He says his property is periodically flooded with thieves marijuana smugglers or migrants When he can Cunningham rounds them up and turns them in Its not in us to steal a penny or turn a blind eye he said Cunninghams friend Larry Johnson recalled a day they found three people on the road they suspected of crossing illegally and picked them up Cunninghams wife Kay remembers another incident right here on the ranch which she calls the night of the big shootout Dob Cunningham spotted something just at dusk and took his gun to have a look Moments later Kay Cunningham heard several gunshots It turned out to be a confused incident involving hunters and suspected border crossers Nobody was hurt Uncertain Allegiances  Cunningham said he cooperates with the Border Patrol and even admires many agents but he has come to doubt the agency as it has grown in size They just hired too many riffraff crooks thugs he said His opinion of the Border Patrol reflects a larger doubt An American flag flies outside his home and hes not sure it will fly here in the future He said the American Southwest could end up being a place of divided loyalties He mentioned the way that Russia was able to seize Crimea from Ukraine on the pretext that the Crimea was populated with ethnic Russians who spoke the Russian language In the same way Cunningham suggested The culture and patriotism will be stronger being Mexican than being American You have border patrolmen right now that dont know their allegiance to the United States The Border Patrol has said its agents are in fact highly trained as well as reliable trustworthy and loyal to the United States For all Cunninghams provocative claims its hard to form a simple view of the Texas rancher Cunningham concedes 98 percent of the border crossers who come through his property are just poor people who want a job He and his wife have sometimes fed them in their home Not only that he can point across the Rio Grande to the homes of Mexican friends Very close friends he said Ive waded the river right up from that house He had dinner with a man on the far side Is that strictly legal I asked if you just wade across the river Oh no he said If the Mexican army caught me Id still be over there It would be an unauthorized border crossing Cunningham a selfdescribed border rat has absorbed the complexity of the Borderland Copyright 2014 NPR,"Sat, 22 Mar 2014 14:21:00

is constantly exploring new ways to launder its gargantuan profits The State Department reports that Mexican trafficking organizations earn between 19 and 29 billion every year from selling marijuana cocaine heroin and methamphetamines on the streets of American cities And Sinaloa is reportedly the richest most powerful of them all according to the Drug Enforcement Administration The capture last month of the Mexican druglord Joaquin Chapo Guzman has cast a spotlight on the smuggling empire he builtOne key to the Sinaloa Cartels success has been to use the global banking system to launder all this cashIts very important for them to get that money into the banking system and do so with as little scrutiny as possible says Jim Hayes special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations for the New York office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE He was lead agent in the 2012 case that revealed how Sinaloa money men used HSBC one of the worlds largest banks as their private vaultICE says in 2007 and 2008 the Sinaloa Cartel and a Colombian cartel wiretransferred 881 million in illegal drug proceeds into US accountsHuge Daily DepositsAccording to a subsequent investigation by the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations cartel operatives would sometimes deposit hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash in a single day using boxes designed to fit the exact dimensions of the tellers window at HSBC branches in MexicoThe bank ignored basic antimoney laundering controls as the investigation found In 2007 and 2008 the banks personnel in Mexico wired 7 billion dollars to corresponding US dollar accounts in New York These were more dollars than even larger Mexican banks wired to US accounts ICE says some of it was drug proceedsYet no red flags were raised because of what a bank official later described as a lack of a compliance culture in the Mexico affiliate according to the Senate reportMoreover the dollar transfers earned HSBC hefty fees The Senate investigation quoted an HSBC email lamenting how the bank would lose 26 billion in revenue from US dollar accounts that it was forced to close because of the Mexico fiascoWhen I was told that there could be in the billions of dollars being moved through these accounts it was very difficult to believe says senior ICE agent Jim Hayes A lot of people have asked Was this complicit We dont believe that they HSBC personnel knew for certain that the money being moved was drug money but they should have knownA Simple PlanIn Culiacn the prosperous capital of Sinaloa where people live cheek by jowl with the cartel even they were shocked that narcodollars could be laundered so brazenlyYou see the building the office the cars the papers the men in suits Everything looks legal Thats what frightens us says Javier Valdez an author and journalist in Culiacan who writes about narcotraffickingThe DEA loves to sell the idea that these guys are super sophisticated criminal masterminds says Alejandro Hope a security analyst in Mexico City and a former federal intelligence agent Its so simple Its so unsophisticated That is what to me is the most disturbing part of this These guys are not even trying that hardThe consequences for ignoring the torrent of dirty money flowing into its Mexico bank vaults were severe for HSBCThe Department of Justice levied penalties and forfeitures of 19 billion on the bank Of course with 26 trillion in assets for HSBC this represented a man with a hundred dollars in his pocket paying a fine of seven cents HSBC was also faulted for hiding prohibited transactions with nations like Iran and CubaThe bank emailed a statement to NPRHSBC has made progress in remediating antimoney laundering sanctions compliance deficiencies But we recognize that protecting against financial crime is an ongoing journey and we have much more to do Since 2011 we have implemented reforms and new controls enhanced our monitoring systems and strengthened and expanded our global financial crime and compliance organization For example the number of fulltime employees in financial crime and regulatory compliance is up 54 percent between 2012 and 2013ICE agent Jim Hayes says fallout from the HSBC case continuesWe think this forfeiture is significant enough to make other banks to look and make sure theyre in compliance he saysBanks Still VulnerableIn the wake of HSBC other banks boosted their antimoney laundering budgets increased knowyourcustomer rules and in some cases dumped highrisk clientsWhich might make you think well now theyve got money laundering under controlDespite all of the efforts banks are still vulnerable to money laundering and its kind of an ageold thing says Kieran Beer editor of the news website of the Association of Certified AntiMoney Laundering SpecialistsThe drug trade is overwhelming in terms of how that money finds pathslike water  to come into the global financial system Beer continuesHSBC wasnt the first or last bank moneylaundering scandalIn 2010 prosecutors detailed how Wachovia Bank had been used by Mexican currency exchange houses to launder at least 110 million in drug profitsIn 2012 The Wall Street Journal reported on an FBI affidavit that laid out how the Zetas Cartel used Bank of America to launder cash through a racehorse operation in TexasAnd last month Western Union agreed to do more

money goes south All the drug profits made on the streets of US cities like Chicago and Atlanta and Dallas are funneled down to ports of entry on the USMexico border where theyre smuggled back into Mexico In 2012 one federal agency alone Immigration and Customs Enforcement seized 411 million in cash hidden in vehicles mostly heading south Once the bundles of US banknotes are delivered to the cartel the money flows in many directions Growers warehousers smugglers assassins and corrupt police and politicians must be paid Mostly the dollars have to be laundered Dirty money has to somehow be injected into the legal economy The prosperous city of Culiacn on Mexicos northern Pacific coast is a good place to see how US drug dollars are spent in Mexico This is home to the Sinaloa Cartel the most powerful and richest drug cartel in the world Its leader Joaquin El Chapo Guzman was arrested last month after 13 years on the run but few analysts in Mexico believe his capture will cripple the mafia he created Dollars Into Pesos The US State Department reported in 2013 that Mexican drug mafias send to Mexico between 19 billion and 29 billion a year from proceeds of marijuana cocaine heroin and methamphetamines sold in the United States Traditionally one of the easiest ways to convert drug dollars to pesos has been casas de cambio or currency exchange houses As part of a crackdown on money laundering federal agents shut down 21 casas de cambio in Culiacn in 2008 but on a visit last month they were all back in business Young women in tight dresses stand in the street hustling driveby customers Were only permitted to change up to 5000 now one money changer who didnt give her name says through an open car window Miguel Angel Vega a journalist for the local newspaper Riodoce is skeptical of her claim If you know them they can go to your house he says driving away and you tell them I have like 50000 Lets do the exchange here in my house And theyll do it because the more they change the more they make Money laundering is a study in trickledown economics in a city like Culiacn Traffickers put a lot of cash into circulation They build palatial homes they buy dresses and jewelry for their wives and girlfriends and they really like flashy vehicles One avenue in Culiacn is lined with luxury car dealerships The new Jaguar agency sells a red convertible XKRS for 213000 and the receptionist says theyll take cash Business Connections Narcos also invest in legitimate businesses as another way to convert dollars to pesos They become partners in shopping centers residential developments hotels restaurants farms and almost any other type of moneymaking enterprise Former Sinaloa Gov Juan Millan once stated that 62 percent of the Sinaloan economy is permeated with drug money In Culiacn the underground economy and the normal economy are the same thing Its everywhere says a 19yearold university student who gives her name as Marisa On the positive side she says You can see a lot of nightclubs and the nightclubs are excellent really On the dark side she continues Myself two times I was in a shooting Once I was with my mom in a car Its normal  Oh another shooting Its bad to say but its true The Office of Foreign Assets Control or OFAC part of the US Treasury Department has identified 35 businesses in Culiacn as being part of financial networks connected to Sinaloa kingpins There are certainly many more than this but Mexico maintains no public database of suspected cartel companies The OFAC charts indicate that moneylaundering networks are usually familybased A trafficker uses his wealth to set up his wife or kids or inlaws in business For instance OFAC states that one of two wives of kingpin Juan Jose Esparragoza who goes by El Azul or Blue is in a group that owns seven gas stations in Culiacn In a visit to the station owned by Buenos Aires Servicios on Guillermo Batiz Paredes Boulevard a heavyset man in a Pemex uniform walked up and identified himself as Fabian Guzman the manager The owner is not here and Ive only been here a few months he said nervously I saw this drugmoney allegation in the newspaper but I dont know anything about it I dont know who the owner is Managers at a shopping center and a childrens daycare facility  also on OFAC charts  expressed similar bewilderment when approached by a reporter Government Response Public officials in Sinaloa have an entirely different explanation of their economic mainstay The thing about laundering money I cant deny that it doesnt exist says state legislator Gmer Monrrez but I can tell you that in el Valle de Culiacn we have four out of the 10 biggest companies that produce and export vegetables to the United States Its true Sinaloa is known as the granary of Mexico and the state symbol is the tomato But then you have to wonder How many tomato farmers drive 200000 Jag convertibles Agriculture is very important but its not as big as they say says local author and journalist Javier Valdez who has written five books about narcotrafficking What drives the economy is organized crime Without the narcos there would be more unemployment fewer companies less income and not as much money in circulation Last summer the Mexican Finance Ministry began enforcing stringent new antimoneylaundering rules Theyre supposed to limit such things as bulk cash purchases and currency exchanges at casas de cambio A ministry lawyer in Mexico City said in an interview that moneylaundering complaints have jumped 140 percent since the new law went into effect The Mexican federal attorney generals office did not respond to an email asking how many of those complaints resulted in criminal cases Does the Mexican government have any interest in disrupting the narcotized economy in Culiacn or anywhere else Its very difficult to close down these financial networks because of insufficient evidence that will stand in a court of law and probably because there is some officials at many levels who might be complicit with those networks said Alejandro Hope a security analyst and former federal intelligence agent in Mexico City Cause Of Death The trail of US drug dollars at work in Mexico ends appropriately at the graveyard Cartel lieutenants tend to die young in this business When they do their families spend lavishly to construct mausoleums that look like small condos In the Jardines del Humayo cemetery you find row upon row of fabulous funerary temples with marble steps glass walls air conditioning and even bathrooms for the family members who come to mop polish and remember their lost loved ones A mason who gives his name as Carlos is overseeing a crew building a new tomb He is asked about the young men who are memorialized in this city of the dead They died of natural causes he says with a chuckle In Culiacn that means by bullets Copyright 2014 NPR,"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 11:07:00 -0400",drugs
NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/03/13/289000532/why-for-profit-prisons-house-more-inmates-of-color?ft=3&f=,A new study by a UCBerkeley graduate student has surprised a number of experts in the criminology field Its main finding Private prisons are packed with young people of color The concept of racial disparities behind bars is not exactly a new one Study after report after working group has found a version of the same conclusion The Sentencing Project estimates 1 in 3 black men will spend time behind bars during their lifetime compared with 1 in 6 Latino men and 1 in 17 white men Arrest rates for marijuana possession are four times as high for black Americans as for white Black men spend an average of 20 percent longer behind bars in federal prisons than their white peers for the same crimes These reports and thousands of others have the cumulative effect of portraying a criminal justice system that disproportionately incarcerates black Americans and people of color in general AfricanAmerican studies PhD student Christopher Petrellas finding in The Color of Corporate Corrections however tackles a different beast Beyond the historical overrepresentation of people of color in county jails and federal and state prisons Petrella found people of color are further overrepresented in private prisons contracted by departments of correction in Arizona California and Texas This would mean that the racial disparities in private prisons housing state inmates are even greater than in publicly run prisons His paper sets out to explain why  a question that starts with race but that takes him down a surprising path Age Race And Money First a bit of background Private prisons house 128195 inmates on behalf of the federal government and state governments or at least they did as of 2010 Theres a continual debate among legislators and administrators as to which is more costeffective running a governmentoperated prison with its government workers and unions or hiring a private company like GEO or Corrections Corp of America to house your prisoners for you States like California Arizona and Texas use a combination of both In the nine states Petrella examined private facilities housed higher percentages of people of color than public facilities did Looking back at the contracts the private companies signed with the states Petrella figured out the reason behind the racial disparity private prisons deliberately exclude people with high medical care costs from their contracts Younger healthier inmates he found  whove come into the system since the war on drugs went into effect  are disproportionately people of color Older inmates who generally come with a slew of health problems skew more white Steve Owens senior director of public affairs for Corrections Corp of America one of the largest private prison companies in the nation calls the study deeply flawed In an email Owens says CCAs government partners determine which inmates are sent to our facilities our company has no role in their selection Furthermore he says the contracts we have with our government partners are mutually agreed upon and as the customer our government partners have significant leverage regarding provisions Its up to the contracting agency he says to decide how it wants to distribute inmates and manage health care costs Owens does not however dispute Petrellas numbers Gloria BrowneMarshall an associate professor of constitutional law at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former civil rights attorney says its a very interesting study What I take away from it is how prisoners are looked at as commodities she says Its all about how the private prisons can make the most money Petrella says he used data compiled by state correctional departments which are divided by censusdesignated categories and included AfricanAmericans AsianAmericans and Pacific Islanders nonwhite Hispanics and Latinos and essentially anyone except those defined by the census as white I know these categories are fungible but this is the data we have to work with Petrella says BrowneMarshall points out that Petrellas findings dont necessarily point to a racial motivation on behalf of private prison companies and Petrella agrees Profit is the clear motivation he says The racial component is more incidental However he says the study shows that policies that omit race continue to have negative impacts He says theres a larger dialogue to be had about what contemporary racial discrimination actually looks like Barry Krisberg senior fellow at the Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute at the University of California Berkeley says the findings surprised him I had assumed private prisons were taking a lot of lowrisk inmates he says that if you went to a private prison youd find a lot of old Anglo prisoners Thats not the case Prison Conditions This raises questions about prison conditions for different kinds of prisoners The rate of violence is higher at private prisons and recidivism is either worse or the same than in public prisons says Alex Friedmann the managing editor of Prison Legal News and the associate director of the Human Rights Defense Center a group that opposes private prisons Friedmann says part of the trouble is attributable to lowerpaid lessertrained staff used in private prisons But some of it he adds may be due to this higherrisk younger population in private prisons So BrowneMarshall asks what are private prisons doing for their agespecific populations Public prisons are devoting a lot of resources to the agespecific needs of their prisoners she says such as building medical facilities bringing in highly paid medical staff and providing expensive mental health care services What about the specific needs of the private prison population Younger higherrisk private prisoners need different kinds of services  especially since theyre likely to get out of prison back into society And historically younger prisoners are more likely to reoffend which BrowneMarshall suggests addressing with education drug counseling anger management and other social services The trouble While courts have intervened to require prisons to have good medical and mental health care as constitutional necessities  things that benefit older and sicker prisoners  programs that mainly benefit younger prisoners arent usually required Another reason why theyre cheaper to house How do we get corporations to do what the incarcerated person needs when the governments not dictating it BrowneMarshall asks That she says is the next question for study Owens says CCA offers safe secure housing and quality rehabilitation and reentry programming at a cost savings to taxpayers Our programming includes education vocational faithbased and substance abuse treatment opportunities Each year he says CCA inmates acquire more than 3000 GEDs A Footnote In compiling his data Petrelle deliberately excludes private prisons with federal contracts from the study He does so because a large portion of federal prisoners in private facilities are there as immigration detainees not sentenced criminals Were he to include federally contracted prisons the disparities would surely be greater Federally contracted facilities also come with their own baggage and civil rights questions Federal prisoners in public facilities as well as state prisoners in private and public facilities have the right to bring lawsuits based on alleged civil rights violations This means state inmates in California could sue the state prison system for providing inadequate health care Arizona inmates in a private facility could do the same against the private corporation that owns their prison and against the state of Arizona However federal prisoners in private prisons cannot bring such lawsuits according to a recent US Supreme Court ruling A prisoner of this status could sue for actual damages but could not bring a civil rights suit against a private prison  the kind of suit that usually forces major changes in how prisons operate in the public sphere Weve gotten to the point where courts intervene in public prisons but only under extraordinary circumstances Krisberg says For federal prisoners in private facilities theres even less legal recourse he says Copyright 2014 NPR,"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 10:03:00 -0400",drugs

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/03/03/283545932/evidence-on-marijuanas-health-effects-is-hazy-at-best?ft=3&f=,Colorado opened its first pot stores in January and adults in Washington state will be able to walk into a store and buy marijuana this summer But this legalization of recreational marijuana is taking place without much information on the possible health effects We should have been doing a lot more research to find out just how useful it is how it affects the brain et cetera et cetera according to Dr Herbert Kleber a Columbia University psychiatrist and drug abuse researcher But he says its been hard to study the effects of Cannabis sativa the plant that produces marijuana A large part of the reason marijuana research has lagged is that its been very hard to get federal approval for such projects as well as access to federally sanctioned supplies of the drug Kleber hopes that the push to legalize the drug will stimulate longdelayed research Meanwhile he thinks its a bad idea I dont think we know what were getting into Hes not the only person who would like to see more science on marijuana and health But not all think the drug poses big health risks or at least not big enough risks to keep it illegal Most cannabis users are moderate users says Mark Kleiman a professor of public policy at the University of California Los Angeles who studies drug policy They use a joint a week or less Jacquelene Cohen the 29yearold director of publicity for a Seattle publisher is a typical user  indulging once or twice a month she says Its just like a small pleasure she says like pouring a nice bourbon for a friend or passing a pipe with marijuana in it Its just something nice to do when youre sitting around conversationally While Kleiman doesnt see enough health risks from marijuana to override the push toward legalization he does worry about users who get hooked on the stuff He says if the price of marijuana falls too much it could result in more dependence especially among adolescents and lowincome users The main risk of cannabis he says is becoming habituated to cannabis and spending your whole life stoned About 11 percent of marijuana users fit the definition of dependence  that is their habit interferes with their life and theyve been unable to cut back Thats lower than the dependence number for heroin and other opioids 23 percent cocaine 17 percent cigarettes or alcohol 15 percent or nicotine 32 percent Heavy users arent hard to find I have friends that Ive never seen not stoned Cohen says It doesnt seem that its that harmful My friends that smoke a lot of marijuana are productive and creative and sociable and they form strong relationships and they make good life choices The National Institute on Drug Abuse says that while marijuana dependence is similar to that for other drugs the longterm clinical outcomes may be less severe Surveys show that 16 million Americans use marijuana at least once a month and 2 million of those meet the criteria for dependence Kleiman says thats not alarmingly high Its not a very high risk he says but its a high risk if its you or your child or your parent or your sibling So people who say Oh cannabis isnt abusable cannabis isnt addictive it seems to me just arent looking at the data The addiction potential is higher among those who start using marijuana at younger ages And the higher potency of marijuana these days may increase the risk of dependency although data are lacking on that point Psychological treatment to wean marijuana users from dependency works about 70 percent of the time according to Kleber the Columbia University researcher Theres promising research indicating treatment can be improved with medication  in particular a combination of synthetic THC the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana plus a longacting drug for high blood pressure only available in Europe When it comes to other adverse health effects the evidence is unclear Marijuana smoke contains many of the same toxic chemicals as cigarette smoke But even heavy marijuana smokers dont seem to have more lung cancer or emphysema Oddly enough Kleiman says the epidemiology has not come in to support the microbiology The obvious speculation is that theres something else in cannabis thats actually a tumorsuppressing agent and people are looking hard at that now Many worry that marijuana might increase the risk of schizophrenia Authorities say theres enough evidence to warn against marijuana use for anybody whos had a psychotic episode or a family history of schizophrenia Still as millions of people have used marijuana in recent years the incidence of schizophrenia has remained static at around 1 percent of the population And then theres driving under the influence Kleiman says one study allowed heavy marijuana users to smoke as much as they wanted before testing them on a driving simulator Even when the subjects were as stoned as they want to be he says they were about as impaired as people who just meet the drunkendriving threshold Thats not entirely reassuring But it suggests that marijuana might not be as dangerous as alcohol when it comes to driving But heres an important point Kleiman says theres some evidence that marijuana users may be drivingimpaired for hours after they think their high has worn off Thats where a real public health campaign could make a difference Kleiman says saying if you smoke cannabis do not drive for something like six hours after  wed have to do the research Thats a lot longer than the subjective high lasts But its probably what you need to get people actually safe Kleiman adds one more key point Cannabis is much more dangerous when it accompanies even a little bit of alcohol So he thinks the bloodalcohol limit for drivers with any level of cannabis in their blood should be zero Of the states considering legalization most are considering legalizing recreational marijuana 17 states or decriminalizing possession of small amounts 12 states and the District of Columbia Twenty states plus Washington DC allow marijuana sale for medical use although in some places the medical pretext is slim Copyright

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2014/02/23/280310526/with-support-for-marijuana-concern-over-driving-high-grows?ft=3&f=,The Lodo Wellness Center in Denver has been selling medical marijuana for several years But since Jan 1 when marijuana in Colorado officially moved from underground to behind the counter the center has also been selling legal recreational pot A majority of Americans now say they support full legalization and the trend is spreading to other states Meanwhile the public health community is warning of a potential safety problem more people driving while stoned But health officials and law enforcement dont yet have the data or the tools to address the concern Public Perception Inside Lodo Wellness Center shoppers dont seem particularly worried about getting behind the wheel with pot in their systems You could smoke about an ounce and still have your motor skills says 39yearold Dante Cox When it comes to one shot of alcohol all that goes out of the window Like Cox several others say its OK to smoke before driving and definitely safer than drinking and driving For advocates of traffic safety their words are concerning I think this is the next big issue in highway safety says Jonathan Adkins executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association He tells NPRs Arun Rath that theres a prevalent feeling in American culture that marijuana is no big deal Well it is a big deal if you use it and then get behind the wheel he says We need to have the same cultural intolerance for marijuana use behind the wheel as we do with alcohol Alcoholrelated crashes still kill around 10000 people a year and research clearly shows how drinking alcohol affects driving The impact of marijuana is much less clear The National Institute on Drug Abuse has done extensive research on marijuanas effect on driving ability The results senior investigator Marilyn Huestis says should give smokers pause We have so many processes in our brain that help us to do a complex behavior of driving and under the effects of marijuana we just dont perform as well she says Assessing Crash Risk After using marijuana Huestis says people generally have more trouble staying in lanes they struggle to do multiple tasks at once and theres a real problem maintaining concentration on long monotonous drives But does that translate into more accidents Studies of the crash risk associated with marijuana have produced mixed results says Anne McCartt senior vice president for research at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Not only do we not have consensus on the risk associated with the presence of marijuana  we dont have information on the crash risk for different amounts of marijuana McCartt says We dont even have good information on how many drivers involved in fatal crashes test positive for marijuana So theres a lot we dont know McCartt says the evidence so far suggests that alcohol has a stronger effect than marijuana on crash risk and that there is simply a larger body of research on the strong association between bloodalcohol concentrations and crash risk Weve used that science for example to enact in all 50 states laws that make it illegal to drive with blood alcohol contents of 008 percent or higher she says We dont have comparable information on marijuana As marijuana use becomes more accepted in the US McCartt says the public safety issue is concerning As a researcher she says its frustrating not to have the science needed to craft effective enforceable laws for drugs including marijuana Testing For Marijuana Even with laws establishing a specific limit police might not have a way to enforce them For alcohol police around the country carry handheld breathalyzers But coming up with a similar test for marijuana is not quite as easy For one the alcohol content of say a Budweiser is on the label But its much more difficult to know the potency of a wide variety of marijuana products Another complication is marijuanas main psychoactive ingredient THC It can linger in the body long after the initial high THC is a molecule that really loves human fat and when you ingest it it sticks in the fat and then it slowly seeps out over the course of a week or a month if you are a heavy user says Timothy Fong an addiction psychiatrist at the University of California Los Angeles The most reliable test for THC is the blood test A few states like Washington and Colorado have even established a kind of legal limit of marijuana in the blood 5 nanograms of THC per milliliter But performing that test often requires that police drive a suspect to a hospital And Fong says its tough to interpret exactly what those tests mean for driving ability Most of the marijuana testing has been done in human laboratories and there you get a wide variety of reactions he says So if you take 100 people and have the same blood level of marijuana youll have 100 different reactions California the first state to legalize medical marijuana recently conducted a roadside study at night finding around 7 percent of drivers had marijuana in their systems Los Angeles is now at the forefront of law enforcements response The city has a federal grant to try out a new roadside drug test oral swabs City Attorney Mike Feuer calls the technology the wave of the future This is a technique under which in the field at the time of the traffic stop an officer can test the saliva of the driver and get an immediate result as to whether there are drugs present in his or her system Feuer says Feuer says the admissibility in court of the swabbing hasnt been tested in California but is likely to be tested in the coming months or next year Legislation regarding the swabs could be down the road as well he says The goal of all of this Feuer says is to assure that there is an effective means of determining whether a driver is impaired not just for prosecution but also to prevent people from driving under the influence in the first place The more commonly known it is that we have a quick and effective technique for determining that the more I hope people are deterred from getting behind the wheel with drugs or alcohol in their system he says Judgment Vs Numbers Advocates in favor of marijuana legalization say they agree that people should know their limits and should not drive while impaired But theyre concerned that police officers will substitute this new technology  and an arbitrary legal limit  for their own judgment I think that people want to have a clearcut blackandwhite solution says Mason Tvert the communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project a prolegalization group They want a specific number that we can use to just say that this person is impaired or not Unfortunately its a little more of a gray area than that Tvert says simply having a number attached to impairment could result in people who are perfectly sober being arrested and charged He suggests that the law enforcement officials judgment should also come into play A bigger concern for Tvert is not the number of pot smokers getting behind the wheel but excessive and overzealous reporting on the subject He does agree however that driving under the influence of marijuana is something that needs to be addressed and discouraged We allow adults to use alcohol responsibly and we punish adults if they use it irresponsibly and that includes driving while drunk he says We should be doing the same thing with marijuana Its in that area that Tvert and Feuer share some common ground Im optimistic that as the debate around legalization of marijuana continues in this country there will be no debate  around the notion that we should be educating the public about the fact that driving while impaired could lead another family to suffer a loss from which they can never recover Feuer says That legalization debate is continuing this year Its likely that marijuana initiatives will be on the ballot in Alaska and Oregon As the momentum increases for marijuana legalization police and lawmakers say they have to respond even with so much still unknown Copyright 2014 NPR,"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 09:14:00 -0500",drugs

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2014/01/08/260797831/how-long-is-too-long-congress-revisits-mandatory-sentences?ft=3&f=,Mandatory minimum prison sentences for drug dealers were once viewed as powerful levers in the nations war against drugs a way to target traffickers and punish kingpins and masterminds But Congress which approved the requirements in 1986 when crackfueled crime gripped Americas big cities is now grappling with a presentday lowercrime reality Have the mandatory sentences put the wrong sort of offenders in prison for too long and at too high a cost for the nation to bear  both literally and figuratively Those questions are expected to be addressed in a comprehensive Senate bill being hammered out in negotiations driven by a seemingly unlikely alliance How unlikely Among those driving the conversation are Tea Party Republicans like Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah and liberal Democrats including Majority Whip Richard Durbin of Illinois and Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy of Vermont Under discussion are proposals that would cut minimum sentences by half give judges more sentencing discretion and retroactively apply new crack cocaine sentencing standards to prisoners convicted under previous requirements Also being considered are inprison programs that could help nonviolent inmates earn earlier release President Obama dipped his toe into the debate recently when he commuted the sentences of eight federal inmates convicted of crack cocaine crimes The convicts would have received far shorter prison terms under the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act standards designed to reduce the disparity between sentencing rules for crack and powder cocaine Theres a lot more momentum today than in the 20 years Ive been doing this says Julie Stewart president and founder of Families Against Mandatory Minimums or FAMM Overincarceration used to be a fringe issue but it has become more of a mainstream concern says Stewart who started FAMM after her brother received a prison sentence for growing pot plants Pushback From Prosecutors But while advocates such as Stewart libertarian thinkers at the CATO Institute and a growing number of conservatives like columnist George Will are pushing for change some drug prosecutors have urged caution The real power and efficacy of federal minimum mandatory sentences is our ability to hold them over certain peoples heads in solving kingpin drug cases or major murders says Scott Burns head of the National District Attorneys Association Burns was among the witnesses who testified about mandatory minimums last fall before the Senate Judiciary Committee The sentencing rules have been an important tool in driving down serious crime Burns says which over the past three decades has plummeted He sees Congress motivation as purely financial Theyre doing this because they are simply refusing to fund more federal prisons period says Burns a former deputy director of National Drug Control Policy during the George W Bush administration There have also however been assertions that federal prosecutors have used harsh sentences as a cudgel to elicit guilty pleas A Human Rights Watch study released in December found that the Justice Department in federal drug cases regularly coerces guilty pleas by threatening long sentences The report came a few months after US Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Justice Department would not pursue mandatory minimum sentences in cases involving lowlevel nonviolent drug defendants We must ensure that our most severe mandatory minimum penalties are reserved for serious highlevel or violent drug traffickers he wrote in an August memo which he followed with a set of guidelines for federal prosecutors A Panoply Of Proposals A bill sponsored by Durbin and Lee would cut by half the 5 10 and 20year minimums now required for first and second drugsale offenses Separate legislation offered by Paul and Leahy would give judges the ability to impose sentences short of the minimum guidelines Additionally Sens Sheldon Whitehouse DRI and Rob Portman ROhio have proposed allowing inmates to shorten their sentences by participating in reentry programs And Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn a Texas Republican has introduced his own bill that among its provisions would allow lowrisk prisoners to serve up to half of their remaining sentences in home confinement or a halfway house Also under discussion is the federal version of the statebased three strikes law which since 1994 has required enhanced sentencing for defendants with two or more previous felony convictions in state or federal courts Life in prison has been mandatory if the defendant is convicted of a serious violent felony and has at least one prior serious felony conviction which can be a drug conviction Leahy at a Judiciary Committee meeting Thursday said he was encouraged by progress made to reach a bipartisan and comprehensive compromise on sentencing reform that includes important yet incremental changes to mandatory minimum sentencing legislation The Financial And Constitutional Angle The financial element of the mandatory sentencing debate is an important consideration Cornyn has touted his reform proposal as an effort to increase public safety and reduce prison costs In introducing his legislation Whitehouse noted that 30 percent of the Justice Departments budget is now dedicated to federal prisons the cost he said has doubled since 2000 As a result he said funding for other important federal law enforcement priorities  from stopping cyberthreats to providing services for victims of crime  has suffered But legal scholars like Erik Luna a Washington and Lee University law professor who has written and testified extensively about mandatory minimum sentencing also assert that the sentencing rules shift power from judges to prosecutors  an infringement on separation of powers doctrine Its an argument George Will recently invoked The policy of mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses has empowered the government to effectively nullify the Constitutional right to a trial Stewart of FAMM says she gives Rand Paul a ton of credit for getting this conversation going He cares deeply about it The question we have to ask is why is prison always the answer she says We have to unlearn the bad habit weve developed of incarceration first Burns the prosecutor says he and members of the National District Attorneys Association are willing to talk about improving the sentencing system but they want more specifics from Capitol Hill We can always do better he says but if you start letting people out who got there for a reason most of them multiple offenders who have been convicted or have pled guilty that would be a problem Why arrest and convict knowing hes going to be back on the street But when a reluctant judge is forced by minimum sentencing rules to impose a 55year sentence on a 24yearold man after his third smalltime marijuana sale conviction Stewart says pointing to the muchpublicized case of Weldon Angelos doing better isnt just an option Its mandatory Copyright 2014

in a variety of ways from untraining dogs that sniff out pot to figuring out how to police high drivers A Smell Once Forbidden Im driving through Seattle on Interstate 5 It runs from Canada clear down to Mexico and cops sometimes call it the Pot Highway because of all the marijuana theyve intercepted along this route But things are a little different now To test how different Im carrying Its less than 1 ounce  a legal amount under state law Really its just a bud But its sitting right here in my cup holder in plain sight and it feels weird having it there Especially because Im on my way to meet some state troopers with drugsniffing dogs This is what we would classify as monthly maintenance training says Steve Gardner who trains the dogs to detect cocaine crack meth and heroin but not marijuana  not anymore State lawyers decided things would be simpler this way since a dogs nose cant tell the difference between legal and illegal quantities of pot Still the dogs dont unlearn the scent Its a perishable skill Gardner explains Over time it becomes less sharp for them but once youve trained them to detect it youre not going to get them away from it But the new generation of dogs  the ones trained since last year  know nothing about pot Piper is one of those Shes getting her reward from her handler for detecting a drug  not pot  thats hidden on a parked truck Not once during her search did she take any notice of me or the bud of marijuana in my coat pocket Dave Rodriguez laments the end of potsniffing dogs That was an important tool using drug dogs to help you establish probable cause says Rodriguez a federal official based in Seattle He works for the presidents drug czar and focuses on highintensity drug trafficking in the Northwest He says that big drug busts may be harder to come by now because local cops are rethinking what to do when they encounter marijuana Everybodys very cautious because they dont want to get sued They dont want to set bad case law he says Its clear Rodriguez doesnt like the states legalization law but he echoes the wait and see policy recently laid out by the Justice Department The real test of that comes next year when growers start producing marijuana under state license The feds say that pot had better not show up in the rest of the country State officials promise to make sure it doesnt High On The Highway The Other Big Policing Issue Its around midnight on Friday and Ray Seaburg a trooper with the Washington State Patrol is roaming the streets near one of Seattles nightlife areas Hes part of a dedicated DUI unit and lately hes on the lookout for drivers who might be trying pot for the first time Youre talking about a stick of dynamite there essentially because essentially that person doesnt know how theyre gonna react to the marijuana theyve smoked because theyve never done it before because it was illegal before says Seaburg The upside for Seaburg is that because pot is legal now drivers are a bit more chatty about it He says people are open about telling him that they smoked even if it was shortly before driving What they may not realize is that theyre giving Seaburg a reason to ask more questions he says for example How long ago did you smoke Did you smoke Do you have any in your possession How often do you smoke Depending on the answers Seaburg might do a field sobriety test and if that doesnt go well he says then at that point we would have to go for a blood draw The ballot initiative that legalized pot also established a DUI limit for THC the active chemical in pot And to check THC you need blood Its a laborious process It takes time to do a warrant says Seaburg It takes time to get a hold of a judge to approve that warrant And then it takes time to go to the hospital to have that blood draw done by a professional Nevertheless police statewide are ordering more blood tests than ever And more of the tests are coming back positive NPR has obtained preliminary numbers for 2013 from the state toxicology lab According to the preliminary statistics roughly 27 percent of the blood tests for suspected impaired driving showed detectable THC Before this year that number was around 20 percent Thats a 7point jump in the months since legalization Is Pot The New Alcohol Do we have a marijuana impairment problem on our highways asks Steve Sarich a medical marijuana seller and activist He answers his own question with an emphatic no Sarich opposed legalization last year because it established the bloodlevel limit at 5 nanograms per milliliter He says the whole point was to prosecute habitual pot users like him  people with high tolerances who he says are OK to drive You cannot show me a study that says 5 nanograms is the level of impairment for everybody out there says Sarich It just doesnt exist Sarich sees the bloodlevel limit as a conspiracy against heavy pot users especially those who say they need it as medicine Conspiracy theories aside it does appear that its riskier now  legally speaking  to drive in Washington state after consuming marijuana Defense attorney Jesse Corkern says hes seeing a tide of what hes dubbed green DUIs Yeah were getting many many more calls from people that have been charged or theyve been arrested over the weekend Corkern says Corkern credits the THC bloodlevel limit for the increase because it draws a bright line for juries like the blood alcohol limit And in fact that was what sponsors of legalization promised to make pot more like alcohol Corkern sees the analogy but he says most people arent there yet You go to the store you pick up a sixpack you throw it in with your groceries and dont think anything of it right Corkern asks We dont have that same approach to cannabis yet as a populace  Its going to take a while for people to get to that comfort zone with cannabis And that includes the police Corkern says its undoubtedly legal to for example carry marijuana in your cars cup holder But is it a good idea He would advise a little more discretion Copyright 2014 NPR,"Wed, 06 Nov 2013 20:44:00 -0500",drugs

political action to be found on statewide ballots Tuesday A total of 31 ballot measures concerning issues ranging from education to gambling to marijuana will go before voters in six states  Colorado Maine New Jersey New York Texas and Washington Thats down slightly from the average of about 42 measures in nine states in oddnumbered years according to Ballotpedia Some of the ballot measures are more interesting than others  and may have broader national implications Here are five to keep an eye on Colorado School Financing Amendment 66 would raise income taxes by 950 million per year to provide the necessary funding for the implementation of a new public school financing system The main campaign supporting the tax hike recently received a combined 2 million in contributions from New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his wife Melinda Groups supporting the measure have raised more than 104 million while organizations in opposition have together raised less than 40000 US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan Colorado Democratic Gov John Hickenlooper and some of the states top teachers unions also back the initiative Duncan said that if voters pass Amendment 66 Colorado will become the educational model for every state to follow Republicans and other tax opponents argue the measure will hurt families and small businesses and that a funding boost wont guarantee a more effective education system Colorado Marijuana Tax One year after Colorado voters approved the legalization of recreational marijuana use they must now decide if they want to tax it Proposition AA would impose a 15 percent excise tax on marijuana sales to help fund the construction of new schools and an additional 10 percent sales tax which will pay for regulation and enforcement If the measure passes the states fiscal analysts project it could bring in 70 million annually The proposition has the support of Hickenlooper the states Republican attorney general and many members of the legalmarijuana industry But some marijuana advocates are against the measure arguing that pot should be taxed at a lower rate similar to alcohol Washington state also legalized the recreational use of marijuana last year and included language placing a 25 percent excise tax on all pot sales in its ballot measure Washington Genetically Modified Food Labeling If voters approve Initiative 522 Washington would become the first state in the country to require manufacturers to clearly label food made with genetically modified organisms or GMOs Some major food and beverage companies have fought hard against the ballot initiative The No on 522 campaign has raised 22 million the most money ever in favor of or in opposition to a ballot measure in the state Half of that has come from the Grocery Manufacturers Association an industry trade group whose members include CocaCola PepsiCo and Nestle Supporters of the initiative have raised about 84 million Most prominent Republicans in the state have joined with the packaged foods industry in opposition to the initiative while Democrats generally favor it A similar measure appeared on the ballot in California last year but voters narrowly shot it down New Jersey Minimum Wage Increase New Jersey voters appear poised to adopt a constitutional amendment that raises the minimum wage by 1 to 825 per hour and increases it annually based on the rate of inflation Currently just four other states have adopted a constitutional provision regarding the minimum wage while 10 states have policies in place that raise it automatically The federal minimum wage is 725 per hour but President Obama called for an increase to 9 earlier this year Republican Gov Chris Christie who vetoed a bill to raise the minimum wage in January opposes the measure as do a coalition of business groups Meanwhile Christies opponent in Tuesdays gubernatorial election Barbara Buono newly minted Democratic Sen Cory Booker and labor unions have thrown their support behind it New York Gambling Six ballot measures will be up for a vote in New York on Tuesday including a constitutional amendment the Legislature approved that would allow for the construction of up to seven new casinos in the state The only gambling currently permitted in New York takes place at casinos owned by the Oneida Indian Nation and racinos which are combinations of horse race tracks and casinos Democratic Gov Andrew Cuomo is a top supporter of the measure which has also won the backing of business and labor groups The gambling industry has spent tens of millions of dollars over the past several years lobbying the state to expand the number of casinos there Advocates argue the plan will spur economic growth provide more school funding and allow local governments to lower property taxes But some opponents are skeptical of its economic potential while others worry about the social problems casinos could bring Copyright 2014 NPR,"Tue, 05

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2013/11/02/242594489/with-rise-of-painkiller-abuse-a-closer-look-at-heroin?ft=3&f=,Abuse of prescription painkillers is a growing deadly epidemic according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention On Oct 24 the Food and Drug Administration recommended putting new restrictions on hydrocodone sold as Vicodin and other brand names Dr Andrew Kolodny believes the restrictions are necessary and will prevent new people from developing addiction But he says there are millions who already have the disease and need access to effective treatment If they dont have access to legal sources for painkillers many of them will turn to the black market he tells NPRs Arun Rath And if they cant find blackmarket pills theyll buy heroin on the black market So while the abuse of painkillers has become a focus for concern the corresponding rise in heroin use is also prompting calls for action The Connection Between Heroin And Painkillers The number of people reporting heroin use in the previous year increased between 2007 and 2012 from 373000 to 669000 Meanwhile federal data from 2011 finds that nearly 80 percent of people who had used heroin in the past year had also previously abused prescription painkillers classified as opioids Opioids  derived from opium  include morphine oxycodone hydrocodone as well as heroin says Kolodny who is the chief medical officer for the national drug treatment network Phoenix House and president of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing Opioids share a similar molecule he says and when they attach to the brains opiate receptor they all cause a very similar effect They give both a positive reinforcement  the effect when you take the drug  but also very strong negative reinforcer which is that youll feel very sick when you dont have the drug he says Those two factors together make opioids extremely addictive Legislating A Call For Help Several years ago John Nygren says his teenage daughter started having trouble She would not come home in the evenings at times She was not going to school There were incremental steps along the way where we saw there were problems he says Nygren is a fourthgeneration Wisconsinite from the small town of Marinette He now represents the town in the State Assembly His daughter Cassie Nygren became addicted to the prescription painkiller OxyContin Eventually she was drawn to heroin  and overdosed on it in 2009 Her mother found her on the bathroom floor struggling to breathe John Nygren says A needle was still in her arm Cassie Nygren hadnt been alone in that bathroom but those who were with her left when she overdosed Nygren says that was probably because they were afraid of the authorities getting involved The paramedics arrived in time to save her life but she has continued to battle addiction Shes been in and out of treatment and is currently serving time in county jail Now John Nygren is using his position to change things in Wisconsin He has introduced legislation to give people legal protection when calling 911 about an overdose Its part of a package of bills to cope with the opioid crisis in his state The Rise Of Painkillers According to the CDC the amount of prescription painkillers sold to pharmacies hospitals and doctors offices across the US quadrupled between 1999 and 2010 With the increase in prescribing what weve seen is that its led to parallel increases in rates of addiction and increases in rates of drug overdose deaths Kolodny says And its gotten so bad that the CDC is now telling us there are more people in the United States dying each year from drug overdoses than car crashes The United States is completely alone in this trend Kolodny says The United States has about 4 percent of the worlds population and were consuming more than 80 percent of the worlds oxycodone supply Were also consuming more than 99 percent of the worlds hydrocodone he says In many cases the prescriptions are entirely legitimate says Dr Elinore McCanceKatz who specializes in addiction psychiatry and is first chief medical officer at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Opioid medications are effective pain relievers and used by the majority of people for that purpose Individuals do not become addicted to these medications when used as clinically prescribed she says But there are people who have vulnerability to addiction McCanceKatz says that opioid addiction is a chronic illness but fortunately very treatable As people get treatment  and that treatment includes medication and psychosocial treatments  they do recover she says Numbing The Pain In Glendale Calif 18yearold Preny Ebrahimi is on the other end of treatment In her familys apartment with her mother looking on she says she struggled in school with attention deficit disorder Around the time she was 13 or 14 Ebrahimi says she fell in with the wrong crowd First there was marijuana Then there were the prescription painkillers which were easy to find Then there was methamphetamine and one day she tried smoking heroin After that day I just fell in love with the feeling and the numbing pain and I just kept doing it and doing it and doing it she says And it just ate away at my life She says she was using every day every hour for about 18 months Eventually Ebrahimi bottomed out She had stopped using heroin on her own but that brought on withdrawal She stole her fathers car to meet a dealer and nearly ran over her father driving away When she got home her family confronted her Everybody was just trying to talk to me and I was going crazy because I didnt want to talk I just wanted to go be alone and do it she says They were like We dont know what else to do You need to stop  The pain became too much Ebrahimi says  for her family and for herself The high itself that numbing pain it was just not worth it anymore to put my family and myself through And I just wanted to stop she says Ebrahimis parents had her placed in juvenile detention and a judge mandated residential drug treatment at Phoenix House She stayed there for five months It has been a long road  one that has clearly taken a toll on her family But Ebrahimi has been clean and sober for almost three years She has a job now and plans to start college in the spring These years sober have been the best years of my life Ive gained so much trust back she says Its a feeling like no other honestly going through all that and being here right now a place youd never thought youd be Copyright 2014 NPR,"Mon, 04 Nov 2013 11:26:00

the past decade Thats in large part because of activists who have pushed to change the narrative around the undocumented If you asked your typical soccer mom what she thought of an unauthorized immigrant she says Well I think of Mexicans running across the border on Fox News  said Tamar Jacoby who runs ImmigrationWorks USA a think tank that advocates for changes to immigration law Back in the midaughts people pushing for an overhaul of immigration laws held largescale rallies that Jacoby said probably turned off lots of Republican voters Jacoby is herself a Republican Thats why I want them to fix it  not because were going to get credit for fixing it but because we want to be able to talk to Latino voters about other stuff she says Now Jacoby says many people think of undocumented young people much more sympathetically as hardworking highschoolvaledictorian types who cant get financial aid for college because of their lack of official status Not coincidentally she said the push to overhaul immigration laws that was moribund just a decade ago has the kind of momentum that suggests some kind of reform might well happen You can hear this shift even in the criticism of immigration reform Consider Iowa Rep Steve Kings attempt to block what he considers amnesty by nudging the characterization of unauthorized young people back in the other older direction For every one whos a valedictorian theres another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds and theyve got calves the size of cantaloupes because theyre hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert A lot of that shift is due to the dreamers the young people who have campaigned and organized around the DREAM Act The proposed legislation would create a pathway for citizenship for potentially millions of young people who were brought to the US as small children theyre culturally American but dont have the benefits that come with legal status or citizenship like the ability to work or apply for financial aid for college The dreamers have enjoyed broad public support President Obama even obliquely referenced them in his second presidential acceptance speech But Jacoby says that support for the dreamers might change if people start to think of DREAMers as activists  that is as agitators as opposed to ideal youth All of which brings us to the Dream 9 Theyre a group of Mexican nationals raised in the US who selfdeported to Mexico Once on the Mexican side they attempted to reenter the US by seeking political asylum They were taken into custody by authorities and once detained staged a hunger strike to draw attention to their cause They say goals were twofold to draw attention to the limbo that young people like them are stuck in and to bring fresh scrutiny to the Obama administrations steady stream of deportations The nine were eventually granted release from detention and will await a decision from a judge on their asylum petitions a process that could take years But their actions have stirred criticism from allies and political opponents alike A growing number of critics say their approach is counterproductive to their goals if not outright dangerous What we ought to be talking  about is the politics in the House and the Republican Party David Leopold an immigration attorney and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association told PRI Leopold said he supports the Dream 9 if not their approach But instead our focus is on this action so it pulls away attention from the big issue which is fixing the system so 11 million can get out of the shadows Leopold pointed to the practical risks of following in the Dream 9s footsteps Once youve left the US its very hard to get back in if you dont have the proper documentation Any other people attempting to mimic the nine arent likely to be as lucky because asylum claims are a long shot As Muzaffar Chishti of the Migration Policy Institute told me last week only 29 percent of asylum claims are granted each year but the number of petitions granted to people from Mexico is even smaller  just 2 percent The odds against asylum petitioners succeeding are kind of high Chishti said But the Dream 9 are now kind of celebrities They were clearly given extra consideration in their credible fear determination Even Luis Gutierrez a congressman from Illinois who has been an outspoken supporter of efforts to overhaul immigration laws said he disagreed with the 9s tactics I do not agree with the actions taken by the Dream 9 because current immigration law is not on their side he told the Daily Beast One of Gutierrezs aides said that the Dream 9s most vocal backers are hardliners who are opposed to compromising on any immigration legislation Gutierrez is an unlikely critic He was arrested in 2010 and 2011 for protesting the Obama administrations policies toward unauthorized immigrants and he enjoys significant street cred on immigration So if Gutierrez wasnt totally on board might the Dream 9 have overstepped Or you could ask another question altogether Arent activists kind of supposed to upset the apple cart I asked Kelly Cogswell an organizer with the Lesbian Avengers which performed directaction events that used to rankle less radical LGBTQ organizations As soon as you start to make any positive progress you get people from the center saying Tone it down were making progress  she says Its hard to keep pushing when you have your allies attacking you But she adds political movements are messy and disorganized with lots of different voices and players I dont think it hurts the compromisers to have more people out there who are more radical Cogswell says I think it gives them more room to maneuver In other words the compromisers get to compromise from further ahead when the conversations start further from the baseline status quo After a while its not about going too far but about going along in the right direction she says adding that any broad political effort needs lots of people trying different approaches With some historical distance we tend to think of the civil rights movement as a unified front and not as a host of different groups with different tactics who often bristled at and beefed with each other That was an idea echoed by Jacoby who compared the push for immigration changes to a concert orchestra The Dream 9 she says is kind of like the guy coming in with the triangle  a small but essential part of the larger effort My view is that we need a little bit of everything  in limits If the whole debate had the tenor of the Dream 9 Id be worried Copyright 2014 NPR,"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 16:11:00 -0400",drugs

baseline for the next three and concerns the alleged largescale abuse by the states Department of Social Services in the courtordered taking of Native American children from their families In an

children some in questionable circumstances At the same time they have largely failed to place them with family or their tribes In South Dakota nine out of 10 Native kids in foster care are in

place as many Native American children with relatives or tribal members as it can findWIESELER If they can be returned to their parent or returned to a relative and they can be safe then thats our goalSULLIVAN Officials say theyre dealing with abject poverty and substance abuse and they have to do whats best for the kids Rysdon is the departments secretary And she says whats best often means driving onto a reservation and taking a childKIM MALSAMRYSDON Of course we think its legal or we wouldnt be doing itSULLIVAN MalsamRysdon says state law supports that But federal law says tribes are sovereign and two South Dakota judges two lawyers and a dozen tribal advocates told NPR a state official cant drive off with an Indian child from Crow Creek any more than a Crow Creek official could drive off with a child from Rapid CityThe allegation of a cultural bias at work is made most clearly in this excerptSULLIVAN Without question some children in South Dakota need to be removed from their families But according to state figures less than 12 percent of the children in foster care in South Dakota have been actually physically or sexually abused Thats less than the national average And yet South Dakota is removing children at almost three times the rate of other states according to the National Coalition for Child Protection ReformTo understand how thats possible how the state can remove Janice Howes four grandchildren and more than 700 other Native kids every year you have to understand one word neglect The state says parents have neglected their children and neglect is subjectiveBOB WALTERS The standards are set too high for our peopleSULLIVAN Bob Walters is a council member for the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe He says what social workers call neglect is often poverty and sometimes Native traditionWALTERS Were family people If theres 30 people in my home thats fine I was raised with my mom and dad and 12 kids Im very thankful I grew up that waySULLIVAN He says social workers are often young and many have never set foot on a reservation He says they dont understand that food is often shared among families State officials acknowledge that only 11 of their 183 caseworkers are Native American But officials say they do yearly training to expose workers to Native practicesSometimes though its not just cultural differences Jolene Abourezk worked for the department for seven years She says taking kids was expectedJOLENE ABOUREZK Its just the norm here that it happens so often people dont question it  like good you are doing a good job for taking more kids in Its just the way its been and it continues to be that wayJanice Howe the grandmother in the opening anecdote surfaces throughout the story serving as a thread that ties it together Part One then closes with an affecting scene of her with her reunited grandchildren bringing the narrative arc to an endSOUNDBITE OF CHILDREN SINGINGSULLIVAN Janice Howe now runs a support group in a church for families that have lost children to foster care On this night 48 people showed up to talk and exchange stories In front Antoinette and Rashauna played Usually when NPR producer Amy Walters and I would visit they would hide They later explained that like their mother they are scared of white people and do not want to talk to them But on this day they drew closer Rashauna took the final step and pointed out a pair of radio headphonesRASHAUNA YELLOW ROBE Can I try them onSULLIVAN They held the microphone up to each otherANTOINETTE YELLOW ROBE Whats your nameRASHAUNA YELLOW ROBE RashaunaANTOINETTE YELLOW ROBE UhuhRASHAUNA YELLOW ROBE I mean unintelligibleSULLIVAN Janice Howe leaned in and quietly asked them what was it like in foster care Rashauna looked up at herRASHAUNA YELLOW ROBE I thought we were going to stay there foreverSULLIVAN And then suddenly Antoinette blurts out a story about how Rashauna wet her pants and the foster parents made her wear the underwear on her headANTOINETTE YELLOW ROBE Whenever Rashauna wet her pants they put underwear on their head  the ones that she peed in on their headSULLIVAN Janice Howe looked away so they wouldnt see her eyes fill with tears Rashauna climbed into her lap As the singing started they slowly swayed knowing that even now Social Services can come back Even now at any time they can take the childrenLaura Sullivan NPR NewsIt doesnt get much more powerful than that I was both moved by the personal stories and enraged by the states actions the first time I listened to the story Having been largely raised in the Jim Crow South I have experienced hypocrisy and racism first handBut thenWell to use a storytelling technique lets set aside the anecdotal story of Howe for a moment and look at the bigger allegation of largescale forced removal of Indian children That is what gives the series importance from a policy perspective not just as a human interest storyCondensing from the above here is the storys caseBlock opens by framing the removals as a disturbing pattern in which the state is taking Indian children at 35 times the rate of white children Sullivan says that this amounts to roughly 700 Native American children a year some in questionable circumstances The some is a rare note of restraint in a series that otherwise unmistakably alleges that the abuse is widespread and is motivated at least in part to obtain federal funds There are thousands of them says Sullivan as she presents a series of grandmothers with grandchildren who were taken away South Dakotas removal rate is almost three times that of other states Sullivan says Families arent being notified as social workers are merely driving on to reservations and taking children  kidnapping a tribal leader calls it The Howe case and other anecdotes indicate that the states purported reasons for removing the children arent true Only 12 percent of the states foster children were removed from their families after having been physically or sexually abused  lower than the national average Thus while foster care is indeed sometimes justified Sullivan notes she says that deciding what constitutes neglect is subjective to which a tribal leader says that the state often mistakes poverty for neglect A former state social worker then drops the hammer She says that its just the norm for social workers to take Indian children from their familiesAn attempted expose comes through clearly Both Block and Sullivan refer to NPRs investigation and Sullivan says what it has found What I hear  and what advocates prizegivers and listeners who have written me hear  is a clear allegation that the state is willfully taking Indian children from their families on a large and unjustified scale This picture is colored in for 23 minutes on All Things Considered an extraordinary block of valuable terrain on NPRs signature afternoon showWhich leads to its own question How true really is the allegation Lets look at the evidenceFirst there is this factual error The comparison among states is both wrong and wrongly presented Sullivan cited as a source the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform This is a small group that advocates for keeping families intact and is critical of foster care in general We should have been told this about the group so that we can better judge its information but we werent Still the groups statistics taken from the federal government appear to be reliableI first heard Sullivans statement  South Dakota is removing children at almost three times the rate of other states  to mean that it was three times the rate of all other states making it a lone outlier It isnt South Dakota was fourth or third highest in removal rates among states depending on whether the ranking is for all children under 18 or impoverished children under 18 according to the advocacy group One can find a few other states in the groups rankings for which South Dakota has a rate three times higher but then we should have been told which onesSullivans comparison with other states meanwhile repeats a critical flaw that I will discuss in greater depth in Chapter 4 The advocacy groups rankings are for all foster children not just Indians Sullivan however never alerts us to this shift in what is being measured She did not explicitly say that the rankings were for all children She also did not indicate what the ranking for just South Dakota Indians might beAdditionally any comparison among states demands context By all accounts foster care is strongly correlated to poverty US Census Bureau data shows that Native Americans nationally have the highest poverty rate among races and Hispanics South Dakotas population is third among states in its percentage of Native Americans Ergo South Dakotas high ranking in removals is consistent with its high percentage of impoverished Native Americans This suggests that socioeconomic factors are at play as well as structural and racial obstacles  and not just government action in foster careLets remember this as we look at the central piece of evidence related to the removal allegation This is the extreme disproportion between the rates that Indian and white children are taken from the families As Block said Indian children make up just 15 percent of the population but account for more than half the children in foster care We probably all know that she means 15 percent of the child population in the state and so can forgive that oversight Block doesnt say that she is comparing Indians with whites but given that the nonNative population in South Dakota is overwhelmingly white that is effectively what she means The Census Bureau estimates that in 2011 whites made up 87 percent of the state population and Native Americans made up 9 percent leaving just 4 percent for all others I myself will thus use white and nonNative interchangeably when making demographic comparisons in South DakotaKim MalsamRysdon secretary of the state Department of Social Services DSS confirmed the 35toone disproportion cited by Block More specifically she told me that while Native Americans in 2010 represented 16 percent of the states population under 18 years old they made up 57 percent of the children forcibly removed under court order from their families This disproportionality is well known in the state and among experts and advocates but it is presented in the NPR investigation as if it were a new finding Beginning with Blocks framing of the series it also is presented as prima facie evidence of cultural bias and abuseThe statistic however turns out to be a poor indicator of eitherIn Chapter 5 I will show how the number of children that the courts take from their families and put in Native American homes is roughly equal to the amount they put in white foster homes This placement in Indian homes most of them of relatives is not mentioned in the series though it softens if not belies the image represented by the 35toone number and the reporters tone of a brutish state that cares little for Indian familiesBut an even more telling insight into just what the 35toone number means comes from looking at a comparative reference group These are Indian children who are not under court custody but have moved in with relatives anyway This is a much much larger group of children The only ones for whom we have measurable statistics are the ones living with kin who receive welfare aid under the federalstate Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program or TANF It is probably safe to say that like the children in state custody these children come from economically poor families that have broken down for whatever reason This group by itself is nearly eight times the size of the number of children under court custody As Chart 21 shows there was a monthly average of more than 3600 such children in FY10 and FY11 a large sample size that gives some statistical validity to observing themAnd what running the numbers on this reference group shows is that their demographic disproportion is even greater than that of the Indian children taken by the courts The Native reference group amounted to 72 percent of all the states children of all races who moved out of their families under the voluntary arrangements with TANF kin in FY10 This is nearly five times the population weight of the states Native Americans under the age of 18 This fivetoone disproportionality in other words is even more jawdropping than the 35toone ratio for children moved out by court order There may be hidden explanations we dont know for the difference but an obvious key variable is whether the courts and social workers control the outcome or not When they do the removal rate is lower not higher than what many extended Indian families are doing on their own This suggests that extended Indian families have set their own high removal rate which the state is following21 Native And NonNative Children in Kinship Families Receiving TANF Support Under And Not Under State and Tribal Court Custody FY10 and FY11Source South Dakota Department of Social ServicesState officials insist that they prefer to let extended families take over most of which happens without the state ever knowing MalsamRysdon said that social workers usually step in only when they are told of emergencies and even then they still prefer to defer to an extended family if it can offer safety and care for a kinship child I cannot confirm what state officials say but certainly the statistics partly back them up If judges and social workers are to be judged fairly all this should have been reported but wasntThe disproportionally high breakdowns meanwhile also suggest that something terribly wrong is going on inside many Indian families in South Dakota But whatThe series in a major failure says little about this larger context Possible cultural historical or social answers get tossed out along with the question of whether parental neglect might be a justification for the high removal numbersHere is pretty much the full treatment of neglect onair repeated from aboveSULLIVAN Without question some children in South Dakota need to be removed from their families But according to state figures less than 12 percent of the children in foster care in South Dakota have been actually physically or sexually abused Thats less than the national average And yet South Dakota is removing children at almost three times the rate of other states according to the National Coalition for Child Protection ReformTo understand how thats possible how the state can remove Janice Howes four grandchildren and more than 700 other Native kids every year you have to understand one word neglect The state says parents have neglected their children and neglect is subjectiveBOB WALTERS The standards are set too high for our peopleSULLIVAN Bob Walters is a council member for the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe He says what social workers call neglect is often poverty and sometimes Native traditionWALTERS Were family people If theres 30 people in my home thats fine I was raised with my mom and dad and 12 kids Im very thankful I grew up that waySULLIVAN He says social workers are often young and many have never set foot on a reservation He says they dont understand that food is often shared among families State officials acknowledge that only 11 of their 183 caseworkers are Native American But officials say they do yearly training to expose workers to Native practicesYou will note that the state never gets a chance to explain what it means by neglect The state in fact has a long list of conditions that go far beyond physical or sexual abuse Among them for example are an illegal drug environment sustained emotional harm and leaving a child home alone without proper care  conditions that I suspect most of us would consider legitimate grounds for determining abuse and neglectHere is the full list as supplied to me by the governors officeAn abused andor neglected child SDCL 268A2 is defined as a child1 Whose parent guardian or custodian has abandoned the child or has subjected the child to mistreatment or abuse2 Who lacks proper parental care through the actions or omissions of the childs parents guardian or custodian3 Whose environment is injurious to the childs welfare4 Whose parent guardian or custodian fails or refuses to provide proper or necessary subsistence supervision education medical care or any other care necessary for the childs health guidance or well being5 Who is homeless without proper care or not domiciled with the childs parent guardian or custodian through no fault of the childs parent guardian or custodian6 Who is threatened with substantial harm7 Who has sustained emotional harm or mental injury as indicated by an injury to the childs intellectual or psychological capacity evidenced by an observable and substantial impairment in the childs ability to function within the childs normal range of performance and behavior with due regard to the childs culture8 Who is subject to sexual abuse sexual molestation or sexual exploitation by the childs parent guardian custodian or any other person responsible for the childs care9 Who was subject to prenatal exposure to abusive use of alcohol marijuana or any controlled drug or substance not lawfully prescribed by a practitioner as authorized by chapters 2242 and 3420B or10 Whose parent guardian or custodian knowingly exposes the child to an environment that is being used for the manufacture use or distribution of methamphetamines or any other unlawfully manufactured controlled drug or substanceThe state objects to Sullivans onair description of neglect as a subjective term Here I side with Sullivan Judging what constitutes an environment that is injurious to the childs welfare for example is subjective This is why we have judges who deal with each case one by one More important to me than the semantics is whether the courts or social workers are systematically unreasonable in applying the standards This was not investigated by the series however Some DSS critics say that tribal social workers are less inclined than state ones to find neglect and recommend removal If true that would be an important story to exploreThe issue of when to keep families intact or split them for the benefit of the child bedevils all communities not just Indian ones National trends have swung back and forth over what is best dividing people of good will Failure to examine any of this and ignoring the many sides and perceptions of neglect represents incomplete and unfair reporting This everyday story in The Washington Post for example has nothing to do with Indians but shows how states across the country are constantly slicing and reslicing how to define neglectHow much real neglect however defined might there be in the Indian foster care cases I dont know MalsamRysdon in her interviews with me repeatedly said the same that tribal leader Walters did poverty by itself does not constitute neglectOf Bob Walters example of 30 people crammed into a presumably small home MalsamRysdon told me Twenty kids sleeping in a small living room or in a small environment is not in and of itself a safety concern But if they dont eat for three days or if no responsible adult is around then safety concerns go up We stand by our process to assess that I suspect that most Native Americans would find this position reasonable and would themselves raise questions about the conditions for children in a home with 30 people in it Whether social service workers are as reasonable in their judgments and execution I cant say But neither did the series explore this question as it should haveWhat MalsamRysdon does say is the obvious There is a correlation between poverty and neglect She correctly insists that correlation is not causation But sadly some of the reservations in South Dakota are among some of the poorest places in the nation and are afflicted with some of the worst social illsThis can best be seen at Pine Ridge an iconic reservation among Native Americans It was here at Wounded Knee in 1890 that between 150 and 300 Lakota Sioux men women and children were massacred by US cavalrymen In 1973 a group of some 200 Oglala Lakota and members of the American Indian Movement seized what by then had become the tiny reservation town of Wounded Knee and held out for 71 days against federal and state law enforcement officers Two people died The protests were against both the United States government and the local tribal leadership Two years later two FBI agents were shot and killed at Wounded Knee The Indian Child Welfare Act drafted by thenSouth Dakota Senator James Abourezk grew in part out of the sympathetic national reaction to a history of suffering and exploitation highlighted by the protest at Wounded KneeThe reservation remains in the news but more now for just the suffering Articles and books recite a statistical slate of misery A highlyreviewed book last year Days of Destruction Days of Revolt by Chris Hedges and Joe Sacco focused on four of the worst places for poverty in the nation and Pine Ridge was one of them NPRs Neal Conan interviewed Hedges last August about the book on Talk of the Nation Shannon County which is made up of Pine Ridge Reservation had the lowest per capita income of any county in the country in the 2010 Census The Rosebud Cheyenne River and Crow Creek reservations were close behind Unemployment on them is variously estimated at between 70 percent and 89 percentAs Nicholas Kristof wrote last year in The New York TimesHalf the population over 40 on Pine Ridge has diabetes and tuberculosis runs at eight times the national rate As many as twothirds of adults may be alcoholics onequarter of children are born with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and the life expectancy is somewhere around the high 40s shorter than the average for subSaharan Africa Less than 10 percent of children graduate from high schoolMatthew Power wrote earlier in HarpersThe youth suicide rate is ten times the national average One in three women is a victim of rape Life expectancy is roughly equivalent to Somalias Plagues of alcohol drugs domestic and gang violence Pine Ridge is as profoundly damaged a place as exists in AmericaNPRs own reports over the last year and a half have included segments about the federal governments reinvestigation of 45 deaths on the reservation a lawsuit filed against big brewers by the Oglala Sioux Tribe for contributing to the alcohol problem and an audio slideshow in partnership with National Geographic featuring images of poverty on Pine Ridge by photographer Aaron HueyI have never been to Pine Ridge or South Dakota I cannot confirm the accuracy of these accounts But their statistics of family dysfunction and social misery are so overwhelming that clearly child neglect has to figure somewhere in there Certainly an investigative series reporting on foster care removals by the state cannot sidestep the social ills with just a few throwaway lines and the dismissal of neglect as a reason Pine Ridge may be even more interesting because it has its own tribal social workersThe series falls into a wellmeaning but old trap that academics and policy makers from our two major national political parties have been leaving behind This is the trap of focusing so much on blaming the state or racism or structural reasons for problems shared by some group to the point that it infantilizes the group members as if they were not adults and had no responsibility of their own Many AfricanAmerican leaders and scholars today for example rue their denial in earlier decades of the disintegration of the black familyNone of this is to say that racism or structural obstacles dont exist or are not significant factors They are and they need to be reported But the singleminded framing of the series on cultural abuse by social workers and judges is limited and nave It is not in keeping with NPRs normally sophisticated analysis and exacting standards for an intelligent audienceThe storys brief mentions of neglect amounted to little more than throwaway lines For example Sullivan said Without question some children in South Dakota need to be removed from their families I disagree that this is enough Delving in much greater detail into the social context is not another story but should be an integral part of this story if it is to be complete accurate and fair As it was those lines of minimal context were followed onair with a but or a still as the first one did Still federal law says that except in the rarest cases Indian kids must be placed with relativesMeanwhile South Dakota listeners caught a weakness in the Yellow Robe narrative Janice Howes story is heart wrenching but several doctors lawyers and others from the state wrote to advise caution They noted that the story should be confirmed with the court case files and that those files and court proceedings were closed to the public under the states righttoprivacy laws Some states in recent years have opened child removal cases to the public The strong impression given by the anecdote is that state social workers took the child willfully with little good reason and no court hearing or order There is no proof of that howeverSullivan meanwhile does say in the story that she has an unnamed source who saw the DSS file The source said that the reports of drug abuse by the mother were based on rumors from a family enemy I have no reason to doubt Sullivans reporting on this but there was a surer route to confirm the truth the investigative team should have asked the parents to sign off on releasing the official file This would have given the anecdote authorityThis leads to a second fundamental weakness in the family account The person making the accusations about how the children were taken about the lack of prior notification and about the lack of information on their whereabouts is the grandmother not the mother Yet it was the mother not the grandmother who dealt directly with the state as the children were taken and afterwards Likewise the states responsibility was to inform the mother not the grandmother We dont know what communication there was between the state and the mother because we never hear from the mother directly or indirectlyIndeed no mothers are interviewed in the entire series All the family anecdotes involve interviews with grandmothers This is not without value given the extended nature of Native American families and the preference under the law for moving foster children into the homes of relatives But when it comes to allegations concerning removals it is parents not grandparents who are the firsthand source Janice Howes account may very well be true but without the official documentation and without corroboration from the mother it is in the end hearsayThere is additionally no response in the story from the state to her account Sullivan onair says social service officials say they cant talk about individual cases Tony Venhuizen of the governors office however insisted to me that all court processes were followed in the Yellow Robe case This much at least should have been reported To be able to respond with more detail Venhuizen said the state needed that signed release of confidential state records by the family He added We welcome Ms Howe the grandmother and the other individuals who spoke to Ms Sullivan to waive the confidentiality of their records Sullivan has not respondedIt is the Howe anecdote that also contributes to the unproven allegation that state social workers in Sullivans words are merely driving on to the reservation and taking a child The obvious insinuation is that they are doing so regularly at will and without a court hearing or order This insinuation caused MalsamRysdon to bristle in her interviews with me There are strict procedures that we have to follow and we dont take any child without a court order she told me Which is why she said she does tell Sullivan onair Of course we think its legal or we wouldnt be doing itWithout proof that state social workers do take Indian children at will Sullivans tone and backhanded statement  presented as a denial  is tendentious and unfair at best Sullivans ensuing onair statement adds to the damage It is gratuitously irrelevant when she says that two South Dakota judges two lawyers and a dozen tribal advocates told NPR a state official cant drive off with an Indian child from Crow Creek any more than a Crow Creek official could drive off with a child from Rapid City To my knowledge no one in the state claims that it can do soMalsamRysdon summarized state policy in two bulletpoints in an email as follows adding her own italics and underliningsChild Protection Services cannot remove children from a home without a court order In an emergency situation only law enforcement can remove the children In no case can CPS remove children without involvement from the courts or law enforcementIn cases where the protected child is Native American and living on a reservation it is tribal law enforcement and tribal courts that are involvedMore on this last point is in Chapter 5 on placement Alert readers might have noted the curious detail that it was an Indian tribal judge  not a state judge  that had the jurisdiction in the Yellow Robe caseFinally the story offers what at first glance might appear to be insider testimony about state abuse It isnt at least not really This is how it transpiresSULLIVAN Sometimes though its not just cultural differences Jolene Abourezk worked for the department for seven years She says taking kids was expectedJOLENE ABOUREZK Its just the norm here that it happens so often people dont question it  like good you are doing a good job for taking more kids in Its just the way its been and it continues to be that waySULLIVAN Now she works for her tribe the Oglala Sioux and reviews every case to help get the kids backWe as listeners reasonably assume that Abourezk recently worked for the state and that the norm she described was current We are assuming wrongly Abourezk left her state job in 2001 10 years before the series aired according to a press release from the governors office That is too long ago for her quotes to be of much use as the major source of inside information about state practices That the series noted that she worked seven years for the state  giving her authority  without noting how dated were her views was a stacking of the deckIn sum from Sullivans reporting I have no reason to doubt that transgressions by state social workers in removing Indian children from their families do happen But there is nothing in the reporting to support the allegation and the whole raison dtre of the series that those transgressions are widespread or systematic The series moreover was unfair in cherrypicking facts to make the worst case possible It failed to provide the crucial socioeconomic programmatic and statistical context that totally changes the complexion of the story and challenges its conclusions about a culturallybiased motive driving courtordered removalsGiven the sparse facts on state abuse a more intellectually honest and complete story would have indeed been exploratory and less accusatory It would have raised questions and tried to come to grips with how often transgressions take place It also would have dealt head on with the many complex social cultural legal and national family policy reasons that contribute to why so many Indian children are taken from their families as well as why so many move in with relatives under voluntary arrangements with and without state support That richer more nuanced story would have better served the suffering being endured by many Native American families todayMeanwhile there is a second motive that the series alleges is driving stateordered removals This one is even more provocative It is money the subject of the Chapter 3Download a

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2013/06/11/190775585/the-many-different-faces-of-marijuana-in-america?ft=3&f=,On Tuesday Vermont moved to decriminalize the possession of marijuana for quantities up to an ounce replacing potential prison time for arrests with fines Peter Shumlin the states governor made a telling distinction between weed and harder drugs when he announced the move This legislation allows our courts and law enforcement to focus their limited resources more effectively to fight highly addictive opiates such as heroin and prescription drugs that are tearing apart families and communities he said The idea that weed isnt that big a deal and that governments need to readjust their priorities is pretty common Theres little vocal antipot government outcry no temperance movement analog for cannabis Recent polls have found that a majority of Americans think marijuana should be legalized Even our mainstream faces of stoner culture are generally silly harmless and amiable Jeff Spicoli Cheech  Chong Harold  Kumar and whatever Snoop is calling himself these days except when theyre revered and saintly read Bob Marley On TV there was Weeds a dramedy about an uppermiddleclass widow who starts selling marijuana to make ends meet Change the drug to something else like heroin or meth drugs with more sinister reputations and it becomes something much darker Youd pretty much have to go all the way back to Reefer Madness to find a widely seen film that portrayed pot as dangerous or threatening And the whole reason we all know about that movie is because the concerns at its center are often mocked as kitschy and histrionic Mona Lynch a professor at the University of California Irvine who studies the criminal justice system says that stereotypes of marijuana usage in popular culture dont come across as very threatening Theres not a lot of uproar around marijuana as a crushing problem she says But this image of weed use as benign recreation or banal nuisance doesnt square with another great fact of American life  the War on Drugs And more and more that War on Drugs means marijuana Ezekiel Edwards the director of the American Civil Liberties Unions Criminal Law Reform Project says that in 2001 years ago marijuana possession arrests made up 34 percent of all drug arrests And now Half of all drug arrests are now marijuanarelated he says  and 9 in 10 of those are for possession The focus of the continuing law enforcement battle on marijuana lands disproportionately on people of color The ACLU crunched some Justice Department numbers on drug arrests and released a muchdiscussed report  last week on their findings The upshot AfricanAmericans are four times as likely to be arrested for possessing marijuana than whites even though blacks and whites consume weed at about the same rate For blacks  and black men in particular  marijuana is a gateway drug into the criminal justice system The thing that was shocking about the report was the pervasiveness that this disparity in arrests is happening everywhere Lynch tells me Its happening in small towns big towns urban and rural Both Edwards and Lynch say that part of the reason marijuana is getting more attention from law enforcement agencies is that police departments are being subsidized with lots of federal dollars to stop drugs but the crack epidemic has since waned Institutions dont like to shrink Lynch says Its actually a reverse kind of pattern  drug arrests are going up even as crime drops At the same time that marijuanas become a more central focus of the War on Drugs there are plenty of business types who are already making their plans for selling marijuana after uh all the smoke clears Theyre trying to give pot an altogether new face as a widely available commercial product backed by big business No one knows what that market might even look like quite yet but it could be incredibly lucrative Might you be able to cop some weed at your supermarket behind the counter with cigarettes Would your favorite coffee shop start selling some extra special lattes What about an overthecounter headache medicine packaged in a box with a little green leaf in the corner Seriously  it might not be that farfetched Diego Pellicer a company that hopes to open marijuana stores in Washington and Colorado is looking for investors Vicente Fox the former president of Mexico was a guest speaker at a Don Pellicer event last week and has said that he would grow marijuana if werent against the law Once its legitimate and legal sure I could do it he told reporters Im a farmer Producers of all types can participate Fox its worth noting used to run CocaCola in Mexico and its sales jumped by 50 percent during his tenure There are already vending machine companies working on cannabisdispensing kiosks for retail stores for the people who dont want the hassle of humoring those talky connoisseur types The way we see it when you walk into a shop you dont need the expert or aficionado to help with selection says the head of one such vending company The people who are using this in the recreational space  they know what they want and they dont want to hear the whole spiel every time And there are all the industrial nonpsychoactive applications Hemp fiber which is especially strong is already used in all sorts of textiles One researcher told writer Doug Fine that a decade after weed became legal a domestic hemp industry would sprout up in the United States to the tune of 50 billion a year  which would outpace the estimates of what smokable reefer would bring in When Americas 100 million cannabis aficionados 17 million regular partakers are freed from dealers some are going to pick up a sixpack of joints at the corner store before heading to a barbecue and others are going to seek out organically grown heirloom strains for their vegetable dip Fine wrote So now we have to reconcile the many different faces of marijuana  a jokey popculture staple a continuing fascination of law enforcement agencies whose attentions fall disproportionately on people of color and the potential cash crop of a bright green

elephants and rhinos walking past his bedroom window He left home to pursue degrees in biology and economics and when he returned in 2011 the park looked and sounded like a pseudo war zone he says Thered be helicopters flying overhead all the time he says I remember one afternoon coming back to my home from a game drive and the bush was crawling with people with assault rifles from the army from the police and from National Parks They were looking for poachers The militarygrade equipment  drones tracking chips thermal scopes  deployed to protect wildlife against poachers hasnt prevented transcontinental cartels from slaughtering rhinos across Africa to supply a black market concentrated in East Asia especially Vietnam where rhino horn is consumed as a traditional medicine for modern ailments Historically prescribed for fever and blood detoxification its now used for hangover and the side effects of chemotherapy Its also a status symbol Its the thing to do What a great gift for your boss or your government official conservationist Douglas Hendrie told NPRs Frank Langfitt in Hanoi Vietnam If unchecked this seemingly insatiable demand for the horn could result in the extinction of wild rhinos within two decades This has led African governments to consider two radical  and contradictory  proposals for saving Africas rhinos Proposal No 1 Legalize The Horn A rhinos horn is composed of the same protein as human fingernails And as with fingernails if you cut off the horn it grows back So Biggs has been arguing African farmers could raise rhinos on private farms and periodically saw off the horns for sale overseas Essentially vets would go in dart the animal and dehorn it Biggs tells me Thereafter the animal gets up again and runs around the bush and continues life as normal and the horn grows back This idea for a legal rhino trade is gaining supporters in the South African government South Africa has 85 percent of the worlds rhinos Theres a push to submit the idea for international vote in 2016 at the triennial meeting of CITES the international conference on endangered species that originally banned rhino horn sales in 1977 This possibility worries conservationists like Ian Craig founder of the Northern Rangelands Trust in Kenya He says ending the ban will lift the stigma  and cause demand to soar He predicts that hornselling kiosks will crop up across Vietnam not unlike cannabis coffee shops in Amsterdam All the economists Ive met say that as soon as you place a value on the animal then people are going to look after it and its going to multiply Craig says Theyre not recognizing that supply could never meet the demand and the demand is whats killing Proposal No 2 Burn It Craig and other conservationists in Kenya still recall a pivotal moment in 1989 when Kenya curbed the appetite for a different poachers trophy On that June day when Kenyas thenPresident Daniel arap Moi set aflame 12 tons of elephant tusks confiscated from poachers ivory had been trading legally at nearly 200 a pound The idea was to send a very strong message to the world that ivory had no value says Winnie Kiiru a trustee of the Kenya Wildlife Service That a Third World country was setting alight all this It made no sense It made absolutely no economic sense It made no economic sense and that was precisely the point broadcast to television screens around the world No one has a right to ivory except elephants After the burn ivory sales slumped Among buyers who were then mostly European and American it became less cool to flaunt ivory belt buckles and cufflinks CITES banned the trade three months later And over the following decade Kenyas elephant population began a slow climb back from the brink of extinction USA Today named the burn one of the conservation milestones of the 1980s up there with scientists finding a hole in the ozone layer Now 24 years later theres an internal memo circulating the halls of Kenyas government proposing to dehorn some of Kenyas rhinos and set those horns ablaze So as South Africa is inching toward a proposal to legalize the trade and provide seller incentives the Kenyans are contemplating a symbolic act intended in essence to shame the buyer Africa as a continent cant go down both paths at once If South Africa is allowed to market  and advertise  its rhino horn Kenya cant succeed in discouraging demand You cant legitimize a trade and at the same time say its wrong Underlying this drugpolicy debate about animals is a philosophical gulf about the best way to influence human behavior Neither side really knows what would happen if you could legally buy a packet of rhino horn in the pharmacy like Tylenol Would the poachers go out of business or would they become more audacious laundering their stolen horn as legitimate Would we ever be able to see a rhino in the wild again If the world at large is happy about rhino sitting in pens and farmed for their horns then the economists are right says Craig the conservationist If the world wants wild freeranging rhino then the economists are wrong There is one more proposal so radical that no government will put its name behind it Proposal No 3 Poison It An organization called the Rhino Rescue Project will for a fee come to your land or conservancy and use a patented process of highdensity infusion to put poison in your rhinos horns It wont harm the animal but will make any person who ingests it seriously ill As a caveat emptor they paint the horn with indelible ink a warning label for any wouldbe poacher or airport security officer alerted to the meaning of its bright pink color Its not surprising that African governments will not support the contamination of horns that people eat however misguidedly as medicine But some private landowners in South Africa and Namibia have poisoned their rhinos horns Theyre willing to let the hazards of poaching trickle down to the consumer Copyright 2014 NPR,"Wed, 15

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2012/12/26/168068305/when-it-comes-to-politics-states-are-barely-united?ft=3&f=,States in this country are becoming like an unhappy couple Theyve always had their differences but their arguments have gotten so chronic that theyre hardly talking to each other Whether the topic is abortion tax policy marijuana or guns Democratic blue states such as California and Illinois are bound to take a different tack than Republican red states such as Georgia and Kansas Were very likely to have legal gay marriage in most of the blue states and some of the purple states before the next presidential election says Whit Ayres a Republican consultant Youll never have gay marriage in Mississippi and Alabama unless a court happens to impose it Ayres argues that states taking not just different but opposite approaches to the most contentious issues of the day is a healthy expression of different attitudes and an indicator of the genius of our federal system Not all political observers are so sanguine Having states moving rapidly apart from one another naturally makes finding consensus in the country far more difficult People in California becoming convinced that those in Tennessee are crazy  and vice versa  has fed polarization not only within states but in Washington where everyone is supposed to get together and work things out Weve seen polarization among political elites for quite some time says Elizabeth TheissMorse who chairs the political science department at the University of Nebraska Its gotten wider at the national level and were seeing it more and more at the state level Deeper Shades Last month states voted mostly according to their usual patterns  only more so At the presidential level Barack Obama carried the exact set of states he won four years ago excepting Indiana and North Carolina which reverted to their usual habit of voting Republican While Obamas margin of victory was less than it was in 2008 the number of states that were decided narrowly by fewer than 5 percentage points actually went down That means more states are voting heavily for one candidate or another The Economist concludes States may have gotten bluer or redder at the presidential level but that was nothing compared with the deep partisan divides in voting for state offices Only three state legislatures  Iowa New Hampshire and Kentucky  are now divided meaning both parties control one chamber each Thats the lowest number since 1928 although the picture has gotten a bit more complicated since the election with bipartisan powersharing arrangements in places such as New York and Washington state In most states not only does one party have control it dominates Fully half the legislative chambers in the country are now held by supermajorities That makes compromise unnecessary  especially since the same party will hold the governorship as well as the legislature in all but a dozen states Rather than a wave moving in one partys favor crosscurrents have moved the states apart This hardly ever happens where the blue states get bluer and the red states redder instead of the whole country going in one direction says Thad Kousser a political scientist at the University of California San Diego Pulling Apart Its the opposite of a collision course With such contrasting political cultures states are bound to move further and further away from one another when it comes to setting policy This was evident almost immediately following the recent school shootings in Newtown Conn Even before the National Rifle Association issued its call to arm school personnel legislators in red states such as Tennessee and Missouri had proposed legislation to require just that In Democratic states such as California however there was talk of tightening restrictions on assaultstyle weapons and ammunition with gun buyback programs hastily arranged at the local level Its magnified in the moment but I expect red states will vote to expand gun rights and the blue states will seek to enact gun control legislation says Scott Melzer an expert on gun politics at Albion College in Michigan Its the same on issue after issue whether its governmentfunded health care climate change or teaching evolution That necessarily moves people further from the notion of compromise says Bill Bishop editor of The Daily Yonder which covers rural issues There are fewer of those crosscutting issues where youre enemies one day and friends the next he says It will further reinforce the movement of people to get in their tribes Still Sorting Bishop wrote about the increasing tendency of Americans to live among people who think politically like themselves in his book The Big Sort In 1976 he says just over a quarter of all Americans lived in what he called landslide counties which either of the presidential candidates carried by margins of at least 20 percent Now more than half reside in landslide counties There are plenty of Republicans living in every blue state of course and the same is true about Democrats living in states dominated by the GOP But increasingly states are voting entirely one way or the other If you look at the map of state control it looks an awful lot like the presidential map with only a few exceptions  notably GOP control of a few Obamasupporting states such as Virginia Florida and parts of the Upper Midwest Open Airing Of Difference Ayres the Republican consultant says thats just fine Alabamas political culture is a lot different from Oregons so its perfectly reasonable for public policy in those states to represent differing attitudes With Washington so mired in argument it might not be entirely a bad thing for states to address marijuana regulation and health care differently says Lara Brown a political scientist at Villanova University Maybe the most productive way out of this current polarization is to stop making it an either or and start making it a both kind of reality she says All our peoples diversity of beliefs may end up better expressed and realized Thats putting things in a positive light But constant disagreement about how to tackle issues may instead make it harder to forge agreement on a national level suggests TheissMorse the Nebraska professor Voters in different states seem increasingly convinced that people who live elsewhere and think differently are not just wrong but unreasonable What we increasingly see in politics and government is that its a zerosum game  that one side wins and the other side loses TheissMorse says Its this view that if the other side gets anything then weve lost Copyright 2014 NPR,"Thu, 27 Dec 2012 14:10:00 -0500",drugs

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/11/24/165776654/legal-pot-has-arrived-now-what?ft=3&f=,On Election Day voters in Colorado and Washington state legalized the use of marijuana for recreational use Whats next No really what happens now Residents in the MileHigh State are already looking to buy says William Breathes a professional pot critic for the Denver alternative weekly Westword By the way thats a pen name for reasons that may be obvious I was in a shop the day after the amendment had passed here and the shop owners were getting calls left and right from people asking if they could just come in and buy marijuana legally Breathes tells NPRs Jacki Lyden People are just expecting to be able to walk into these medical stores right away But they cant  at least not until next year Like Washington Colorado still needs to set up a regulatory framework to handle what is expected to be a big expansion of its marijuana market even though the state already has more medical marijuana dispensaries than it has Starbucks The growth of that industry has been remarkable to watch Breathes has written Three years ago he was hardpressed to find pot more potent than bud from a dedicated grower with a few basement lamps But now you see some really beautiful product in the stores he says Some really wellgrown medicine And also prices have come down from nearly 400 an ounce in 2009 to around 250 today When legalization is fully implemented prices could fall even further Theres a big market for it I think people really want to get out and get to these shops Breathes says Its pretty interesting and really liberating to go into a store and purchase marijuana legally Its just a matter of seeing whos going to step up and open the first recreational shop Thats because it could open the door to a clash between the state and federal government which still classifies pot as an illegal drug With lawmakers in Rhode Island and Maine planning to introduce legalization bills next year Daily Beast reporter Tony Dokoupil says the question of legalized marijuana across the nation is not whether but when 2014 he says Big pot is here Rebounding From Reagan The push toward legalization may seem like a modern movement But Peter Bourne who served as President Jimmy Carters drug czar in the late 70s says its been a long time coming The Carter administrations position basically was that the penalty for marijuana use did infinitely more damage to people and their lives than the drug did he says So Carter asked Congress to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana and suggested states be free to legalize if they chose Prolegalization advocacy groups ran ads on television in support of the president Legalization seemed inevitable Then came the Reagan administration President Reagan famously called pot the most dangerous drug in the United States and by the end of the 80s Nancy Reagans Just Say No campaign had made the issue of legalization far less popular To me Bourne says thats equivalent to telling somebody whos depressed to have a nice day Reagan successfully changed the national conversation around marijuana use Bourne says But before that happened big tobacco companies were poised to get in on the act I was in fairly regular discussion with the tobacco people Bourne says They very clearly had contingency plans that they developed to grow and market marijuana should it be legalized Big Weed And Room To Grow Now that legal pot is here will cigarette companies dust off their old plans for mass commercialization Tony Dokoupil a reporter for Newsweek and The Daily Beast who has written about the changing legal status of marijuana says theyd like to  if history is any indication In the 70s he says there were highlevel conversations about adding marijuana to tobacco creating a line of marijuana cigarettes and being ready to jump in and market this As recently as 1993 when it looked like France was poised to legalize marijuana Philip Morris trademarked the name Marley But when the estate of Bob Marley complained the company claimed it had nothing to do with the reggae singer Philip Morris said No no it could be any kind of Marley  Dokoupil says like Jacob Marley the cheap cantankerous teetotaler from A Christmas Carol Cigarette companies are staying mum on whether customers could see Marleylike products in the US anytime soon But Dokoupil says the regulatory market such products would enter into  once it was created  could look a lot like the forprofit regulatory model in Colorado now Theres a ban on advertising he explains There are cameras that track the marijuana from bloom to endconsumer so the diversion into the black market is limited There are extensive background checks on people who are part of the marketplace  so if you want to open a marijuana shop you have to go through an extensive background check Once that model is in place the consumer side of things might look a lot like Starbucks I think you will have a variety of products at different levels of intensity exactly like Starbucks Dokoupil says You might be able to walk in there and in the case theyll have 12 different strains of cannabis Behind the counter there might be hash There might be edibles like fizzy drinks or brownies There could be a hot dog wheel turning You could put THC in anything And according to Breathes legal weed could even draw tourism to states that offer it I got a lot of emails from people really excited about this  he says Theyre looking forward to visiting Colorado now Copyright 2014 NPR,"Wed,

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/11/13/164981433/legalizing-and-regulating-pot-a-growth-industry?ft=3&f=,When reporter Tony Dokoupil was a teenager he found out that his father had sold marijuana but he just thought his parents were hippies A few years ago while working on a story about his fathers drug dealer past he discovered that actually in the 1970s and 80s his father Anthony Dokoupil had been a bigtime marijuana smugglerHe was arrested in the early 90s on a job selling 17 tons of marijuana Dokoupil tells Fresh Airs Terry Gross which was enough at the time to roll a joint for every college kid in the USDokoupil is now writing a book about the controversial plant and is the author of the recent Newsweek cover story The New Pot Barons about the group of entrepreneurs who are growing medical marijuana in Colorado and hoping to cash in on the plants recent legalization there for recreational use On Election Day Colorado and Washington became the first states to greenlight marijuana for recreational use which is big news for the expanding marijuana industryIf legalization is here to stay Dokoupil says Colorados tightly regulated forprofit medical marijuana market will likely be the basis for the legalized recreational markets in other states as well In Colorado more than 1 million square feet of warehouse space outside of Denver are dedicated to growing marijuana and hundreds of dispensaries sell it To manage this growing business the state has 200plus pages of regulation to explain what is legal and isnt Marijuana grown in the state says Dokoupil is tracked from the time it blooms to final sale  every single ounce is accounted forInterview HighlightsOn the initial Green RushAfter Eric Holder and the Obama administration suggested that they werent going to crack down on medical marijuana everybody and their brother grabbed a trash bag full of weed out of their backyard and were like All right medical marijuana here for sale  Then Colorado was really interesting  because theres a core of young educated politically connected and wellfinanced guys who said Whoa whoa whoa We cant have former black market drug dealers and bikini girls as the face of our industry because the communitys not going to accept itSo they partnered with law enforcement They partnered with state legislators They hired incredibly highlevel political consultants and lobbyists who have worked nationally And they are the inside force that led to the creation of Colorados regulated medical marijuana industry which is unlike any in the country and which will be the basis for the legalized regulated market And so in response to the craziness that we saw in 2009  a movement toward controlled regulated notinyourface nonconfrontational pot culture has begunOn Colorados tightly regulated commercial medical marijuana growing marketSo in Colorado the medical marijuana growers have to have 24hour video of their operations and that video is accessible by the state at any time  they can tap into it And they all have these badges and they had to go through background checks to get these badges So theres an attempt to keep black market money out of it  in Colorado youre unlikely to see a situation where a dispensary is in fact just a front for a Mexican cartel And then they had this additional rule which is pretty revolutionary  its called a 7030 rule where 70 percent of all the marijuana that each store sells they have to grow themselves  That goes a long way to eliminating the introduction of black market weed  Stores arent just buying all their weed from Mexican cartels and marking it up Thats a huge reason why the feds have focused on California California doesnt have tight regulations on who grows marijuana where it comes from So the feds move in and what they claim is that these med marijuana businesses are fronts for what are in fact just oldschool black market drug dealers And theyre not growing medical marijuana in small batches for patients Theyre growing it in Mexico or theyre growing it in the hills and theyre just bringing it in and it suddenly magically becomes legal once it gets in the store But in fact its based on illegality Colorado doesnt have thatOn the commercial potgrowing houses in ColoradoI hope that in the future there are tours of marijuana warehouses in the same way that there are tours of breweries today because its really incredible By law you have to grow indoors in Colorado And to do that these rooms are rigged with lights that mimic the effects of sunlight to grow the plant and different rooms have different seasons And theres a perpetual grow and different plants require different kinds of sunlight So you walk into these warehouses and at first you dont see anything because the actual plants are inside smaller rooms within rooms And all you hear is the buzz of electricity Its damp  you expect a forklift to come in from a side door And you get a little deeper in and you open one of these doors which are about the size of like Winnebagos where the actual plants are and your eyes just recognize Oh my god  its summer sunshine Its like you want lemonadeAnd then you see a field of plants waving gently because theyre stirred by fans and there will be classical music playing or there will be hard rock depending on what the grower says the plant likes And then you go to another room and you open the door and it will have like a honeycoated light and youll be like Oh fall I want a pumpkin latte  how beautiful And there will be workers in there too And the workers are like the Keebler Elves of cannabis They live among the plants They sleep there Theyre caring for the plants constantly Theyre deeply devoutly about the plant and theyre usually shirtless or walking around barefootOn the threat of big marijuana businessWeve seen legalization in two states  thats the first step toward legalization in other states Thats a step toward legalization nationally So you have a third vice industry like tobacco and like alcohol The problem with that is that 80 percent of the profits tobacco companies and alcohol companies make comes from heavy users The business model is based on people consuming more than they should And so theres a strong economic incentive for big marijuana companies to create as much addiction as possible And yeah sure marijuana is less harmful than Jack Daniels but its not the same thing as safe or helpful in the home or helpful in the workplace or goodAnd so the longterm worry is that you have sophisticated marketing programs in place distribution programs in place that create a double or tripling of the current level of marijuana usage And  by the way Americans already use marijuana at triple the global average So were talking about a tripling of a tripling and thats a big deal Its something to think about which is why many people are in favor of  or I believe will become more in favor of as they realize the risks  of severe limitations on the size of marijuana businesses and the advertising that they can undertakeOn the cult of marijuana smugglers like his father in the 70s and 80sThe people who were defying President Reagan and before that Nixon are not typical characters So the golden era of marijuana is considered to be the 70s and early 80s and the swashbuckling hero types who brought in marijuana at a time when the government was trying to crush marijuana culture  those people are not theyre just not normal people They dont have normal egos They dont have normal connections to substances themselves They see themselves as larger than life Theyre entitled to whatever comedowns they should want in exchange for the fantastic good theyve done flooding the market with good marijuanaAnd by the way this is not them just saying that this is how theyre seen This is the way how people in the 70s and 80s saw marijuana smugglers  they saw them as heroes Theres a very very interesting article written by Timothy Leary the aciddropping Harvard professor called The Dope Dealer as Robin Hood and it makes the case that the folk hero of the 70s is the marijuana smuggler  as important as rock stars and underground artists And this was an influential article  it was reprinted in High Times And then even more recently when my article came out I had people write to me and say Oh your father is the Rosa Parks of legalization I was like Oh my God What  Copyright 2014 NPR,"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 14:04:00 -0500",drugs

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/10/31/164054452/drug-sniffing-dogs-take-center-stage-at-high-court?ft=3&f=,The US Supreme Court heard arguments in two cases Wednesday testing what if any limits there are to the police using drugsniffing dogs By the close of two hours of argument it looked very much as though the court would rule against the use of drugsniffing dogs without a warrant in one case but not the other The protagonists in this story are Franky and Aldo Franky a chocolate Labrador had a nearspotless record as a drugdetection dog in MiamiDade County The question is whether his human police partners violated the Fourth Amendments ban on unreasonable searches After police got an anonymous tip they took Franky up to the front porch of a private home and when he alerted to drugs inside the police used that as justification for getting a search warrant Aldo had a less august dogdetection pedigree and the question was whether his qualifications as an expert were sufficient to justify the sniff of a truck Lawyer Gregory Garre represented Florida police prosecutors and the dogs in both cases starting with the one that involved a dog sniff at the front door of a private home Garres argument in defense of Frankys sniff at the home was that Franky was trained only to look for drugs In three prior cases Garre reminded the justices the court has emphasized that a drugdetection dog reveals only the presence of contraband and that nobody has a legitimate expectation of privacy in that But justices of every ideological stripe hammered Garre on that argument Justice Anthony Kennedy said he could not accept as a reasonable argument the premise that if theres contraband all the rules go out the window Justice Sonia Sotomayor added that if you have no expectation of privacy for contraband why bother with a search warrant at all Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg chimed in that if a dog sniff of one home is OK the police could just go down the street with a dog going door to door Garre responded that the police could indeed do that just as they can knock on every door But limited resources he maintained would prevent such dragnet searches For Justice Antonin Scalia the place of the dog sniff mattered because a home is private It isnt sniffing in the abstract he said its sniffing at the front door Garre emphasized that there exists an implied consent for police Girl Scouts or trickortreaters to go up to the front door But Ginsburg interjected saying there is no implied consent for a policeman to come up with a dog when the only purpose of the dog is to detect contraband Justice Stephen Breyer also took issue with Garres argument saying that people do have the expectation that someone can come to the door but not with a large animal who spends five to 15 minutes going back and forth sniffing the premises Finally Justice Elena Kagan observed that the court has repeatedly protected the home from technological surveillance without a warrant To that Garre responded Frankys nose is not technology Kagan pressed the question wondering if a machine were invented to detect drug odors from outside a house would that be permissible without a warrant too No replied Garre Dogs sniffs are different than machines because they involve the dogs Godgiven sense of smell Garres adversary public defender Howard Blumberg representing the accused marijuana grower also got quite a grilling from the court Kennedy called Blumbergs argument that people have a right to keep secret anything they want within their home equally unacceptable to Garres argument Blumberg was more successful with his second argument  that the dog sniff at the front door of a home is a trespass on private property He cited cases as far back as the 1700s that stand for the proposition that a mans home is his castle The Supreme Court has never ruled on dog sniffs at a private home It has said dog sniffs are permissible without a warrant in other spheres  cars stopped on the road for other reasons for instance or luggage at airports But as Wednesdays second argument illustrated even when a search could be legal there is a question as to whether the dog has adequate credentials for police to rely on In this case Aldo a German shepherd sniffed and alerted for drugs in a truck stopped for an expired license plate Police then searched the truck and found chemicals used to make methamphetamines Two week later however when police again stopped the truck the dog again alerted for drugs but this time no drugs were found Aldo had completed 120 hours of basic drugdetection training two years earlier but had not been recertified in 16 months  a defect that lawyer Garre acknowledged was a lapse Public defender Glen Gifford told the justices that since there is no national or state certification standard for drugdetection dogs judges should look among other things to field records of the dogs other searches to determine his reliability The justices however seemed to think that was a step too far Copyright 2014 NPR,"Wed, 31 Oct 2012 18:53:00 -0400",drugs
NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/10/24/163558766/three-ballot-measures-would-ok-pot-beyond-medicine?ft=3&f=,Marijuana legalization is back on the ballot this year California voters defeated a legalization proposal in 2010 but now similar measures have cropped up in three more Western states This time around some of the most intense opposition is coming from the earlier pioneers of legalization  the medical marijuana industry In Colorado Amendment 64 would regulate marijuana much like alcohol says Howard Wooldridge a retired police detective from Texas and a longtime campaigner for marijuana legalization He has come to Greeley Colo to wave a sign for the measure This would free up precious police resources to go after real criminals drunk drivers etc as opposed to wasting time on a green plant he says Colorado already has a big medical marijuana industry but this amendment to the state Constitution takes things further It would allow people older than 21 to possess limited amounts of the drug for recreational use People would be allowed to grow the plant for personal use and the state would be directed to license and tax marijuana stores The amendment is ahead in the polls but that lead is eroding as it gets more pushback from business groups We dont want to become the pot capital of the United States says Roger Sherman who runs the Vote No campaign Thats not the image our economic development leaders want to use to attract businesses and conventions and tourists Luckily for those business groups Colorado has competition in the race to legalize pot Oregon has a similar ballot measure though its not polling well Passage is looking likely though in Washington Initiative 502  On a misty morning near Seattle legalization campaigners pose for a group picture shouting Dismantling prohibition one state at a time for the camera Theyre in a good mood because their initiative  called I502  is polling above 50 percent The initiative would permit the sale of small amounts of pot at stores regulated and taxed by the state Alison Holcomb a criminal defense attorney who has also worked for the ACLU helped to draft the initiative and she now runs the Yes campaign Weve reached a place in our society nationwide where now a majority support marijuana legalization Holcomb says She may be right In a Rasmussen poll earlier this year 56 percent of respondents favored legalizing and regulating marijuana The Washington initiative is getting support from across the political spectrum including two former US attorneys the Seattle city attorney and even the Republican candidate for Senate Michael Baumgartner The most vocal opposition meanwhile is coming from purveyors of medical marijuana Were horrified says Steve Sarich who runs the No On I502 campaign He is also a longtime producer of medical marijuana At his Seattle access point  thats what dispensaries are calling themselves in Washington at the moment  he shows off a display case full of potinfused products  Weve got everything from caramels to peppermint patties to chocolate covered pretzels to Almond Joy Sarich says He even sells marijuana dog biscuits We have dogs that have arthritis and that really really calms them down he says Its not clear how dog treats would be legal under the states medical marijuana law which requires a patient to have a doctors recommendation Sarich says this new world of legal medical marijuana will be in jeopardy if I502 passes Thats because he thinks the initiative is really a Trojan horse One of its provisions sets a maximum THC level in the bloodstream of drivers  essentially a blood alcohol limit for the active ingredient in marijuana The problem is that THC lingers in the blood and Sarich says regular users of medical marijuana would never be legal to drive even when feeling sober I wake up every morning with four times the limit in my blood Sarich says He consumes marijuana to relieve back pain He says hed have to leave the state or find a fulltime driver All they have to do is sit a half a block down the street and wait for me to pull away from the curb and Im going to jail for driving under the influence of drugs Sarich says Sarich says he doesnt believe the initiative is about legalization at all  he scoffs at the idea that the state would really follow through with official statelicensed pot stores  and he says the whole point of the initiative is to use the blood level limit to put the screws on medical marijuana users The initiatives sponsors say they had to include a blood level limit to win over cautious voters Without naming names Holcomb accuses some medical marijuana entrepreneurs of wanting to keep pot in a profitable gray area  unregulated and untaxed Its a concern echoed by King County Sheriff Steve Strachan For the rule of law for a civil society this ambiguity doesnt serve us well Strachan says Strachan calls the current medical marijuana law a twilight zone one that generates cynicism and contempt for law enforcement Weve had some examples since the medical marijuana law came into place of people smoking marijuana in a public place like a bus stop Well its not a place where you could smoke a cigarette and theyll say Well its medical marijuana so I can do that  he says So the sheriff who is also on the ballot this year has come out in support of legalization as has his opponent He hopes it will clarify the status of marijuana under state law even as it creates a potential showdown with the feds As far as that goes he can only hope against hope that national politicians will reconsider

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/07/12/156615024/fake-pot-is-a-real-problem-for-regulators?ft=3&f=,This week President Obama signed a law banning synthetic marijuana and other synthetic drugs Dozens of states and local governments have already tried to outlaw fake marijuana which has been blamed for hundreds of emergency room visits and a handful of fatalities But the bans have proved largely ineffective and there are fears that the federal law wont be any different Synthetic marijuana looks a bit like dried grass clippings Its readily available on the Internet and in convenience stores and smoke shops where its sold as herbal incense or potpourri A StandIn For Marijuana At roughly 20 a gram its unlikely that many buyers are using synthetic marijuana to freshen up the powder room Most are smoking it as a substitute for real marijuana Thats what Aaron Stinson was doing last September This is an actual packet that I found in his belongings in his bedroom says his mother Deirdre Canaday as she holds up a small shiny package The product is called Relaxinol  which the label promises can relieve unwanted state of mind Canaday found the packet in Stinsons apartment last year shortly after he died in his sleep at a friends house in upstate New York He had smoked a spice potpourri product called Mr Nice Guy Relaxinol Canaday says And he went to sleep And in the morning about 930 am his two friends woke up But Aaron  they found him totally unresponsive not breathing no pulse Canaday admits her son had a history of using drugs specifically marijuana But she says Stinson who was 26 was getting his act together He had a good job as a home health care aide Canaday thinks Stinson was using synthetic marijuana that night for the same reason many people do He was worried about passing a drug test for his job and he knew that synthetic marijuana was not likely to show up I think that my son the only thing he did wrong was to be naive Canaday says to believe this stuff thats packaged was all natural and safe and a good alternative to something that was illegal  because its not The pathologist determined the cause of Stinsons death to be acute intoxication due to the combined effects of ethanol from alcohol consumption and Relaxinol No charges were ever filed the company that makes Relaxinol did not respond to requests for an interview Drugs Bring Side Effects And Uncertainty There are no clinical studies about the health effects of synthetic marijuana But anecdotally health care providers report a long list of nasty side effects from agitation and paranoia to intense hallucinations and psychosis Christine Stork the clinical director of the Upstate New York Poison Control Center says that shes seen a steady stream of synthetic marijuana users turn up in emergency rooms over the past few years Theyre expecting a marijuana experience and pretty soon they realize theyre not getting their usual experience she says They can be quite agitated They can be quite paranoid They require drugs to sedate them and may have seizures which are pretty severe Stork says synthetic marijuana can be 20 times as potent as real marijuana But its hard to predict the strength of any particular brand or packet  in part because its remarkably easy for anyone to make and package synthetic marijuana without any oversight or regulation Video Tutorials In Drug Making In a video posted on YouTube an unidentified man shows how its done using damiana a Mexican shrub as the base All you need is some legal plant material and some chemical powders that can be easily ordered from overseas labs Anybody with a working knowledge of chemistry or that can follow a simple set of directions can obtain and mix these substances and create these compounds says James Burns a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration in upstate New York Most states have already moved to ban some synthetic cannabinoids  the chemical compounds that are the key ingredient in synthetic marijuana But Burns says its not that simple You have people that are very good with chemistry that continue to manipulate the molecular structure of these substances he says So that they are creating analogues or substances that are similar to those that have been banned The result is a big game of cat and mouse The government outlaws a certain compound or family of compounds But then producers tweak the chemical formula of their products to skirt the law A 5 Billion Market Despite a slew of federal state and local bans sales in the synthetic drug industry seem to be growing  to roughly 5 billion a year according to Rick Broider president of the North American Herbal Incense Trade Association You cant stop the market he says You know theres no piece of legislation thats going to stop market demand Broider runs a company called Liberty Herbal Incense in New Hampshire which he says recently changed its chemical formulas to keep its products legal He insists his industrys products are not for human consumption though he concedes that some people may be misusing the product by smoking it Were aware that there are a number of people who do choose to misuse our products for their euphoric effect We do not support that at all Broider says If youre going to misuse a product youre basically incurring a large risk to yourself But our question is dont Americans have the right to assume their own personal risk Would Broider allow his children to smoke herbal incense or synthetic marijuana products You know if my children are under 18 years old I would not allow them to do anything that I wouldnt deem appropriate to be doing under 18 years old he says When theyre over 18 years old I would see it no differently than alcohol or tobacco which are two products that have been proven to be addictive and have have proven to have negative health consequences That argument doesnt convince Canaday who blames her sons death on a different brand of synthetic marijuana I would say theyre cowards she says of manufacturers like Broider I would say theyre absolute cowards And worse than the drug dealers on the street that sell illicit drugs A New Federal Law So far law enforcement officials have been mostly stymied in their efforts to treat synthetic drugs makers like conventional drug dealers This week President Obama signed the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 It will mean tougher criminal penalties for selling some firstgeneration synthetic cannabinoids and many newer ones as well The new law should help says Burns of the DEA If we can make the bad guys react to what were doing instead of us reacting to what the bad guys are doing then I think thatll help us get a better handle on this issue he says But others worry that the new federal law is already obsolete Itll help in some regards that these things need to be listed and controlled And therell be no more discussion about I didnt know  says Anthony Tambasco a forensic scientist in Mansfield Ohio But youll have again new compounds coming through the door that well have to deal with As soon as Ohio outlawed a number of synthetic cannabinoids last year Tambasco says he started to see new compounds in local stores And he expects drug makers will react just as quickly to the new federal ban They already are Theyre already out in front of it Theyre already on their next batch he says When we spoke last week Tambaso said there were already three synthetic cannabinoid samples hed never seen before waiting for him in the lab Copyright 2014

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2012/06/18/155278557/laws-of-unintended-consequence-a-warning-to-policy-makers?ft=3&f=,This week Caryn Devins joins 137 regular Stuart Kauffman to consider the role of reductionism in our legal system Devins is a thirdyear law student at Duke University School of LawAn alltoocommon reaction to a given societal ill is to bellow  with righteous indignation of course  that There should be a law against that For drug abuse internet bullying bigotry even rudeness we have become a society conditioned to expect legal solutions to social problemsImplicit in our faith in the legal system however is the assumption that there is a linear relationship between the passage of a law and the consequences enabled by that law This assumption dictates that if we attach a civil or criminal penalty to an undesirable behavior then we should see less of that behavior In the legal world this concept is known as deterrence and since the writings of Jeremy Bentham it has been at the core of criminal justice policyYet it only takes a cursory study of this nations drug prohibition policy particularly the 40 million arrests it has generated since 1970 to acknowledge that the idea of deterrence has little empirical support This is because deterrence along with most core concepts in our modern legal system falls prey to the reductionist fallacyAn intellectual tradition that has captured the world since the invention of Newtonian physics reductionist methodology breaks down systems by studying their component parts Accordingly reductionism assumes that by understanding the parts we can understand the whole Early evolutionary biologists for example believed that macroscale phenomena such as the emergence of a new biological species could be explained by the microscopic process of gene variation and natural selection in individual organisms Now group selection and specieslevel selection are parts of evolutionary biologyIn short recent scientific advances have undermined the reductionist view of change in biological organisms and ecosystems The assumption that isolated genes cause particular phenotypes or physical traits turned out to be wrong Instead scientists realized that genes are not isolated entities like beads on a string one per trait but rather complex interconnected regulatory networksPhysical traits are actually emergent properties arising from the complex interactions within these networks It is rare that they can be understood by looking at any given geneThe legal system is a complex dynamic system akin to a biological ecosystemYet like the original evolutionary theorists who assumed a linear relationship between genes and physical traits mainstream legal analysis is still thoroughly reductionistLegal policy makers largely assume the same linear relationship between individual laws and the behaviors of the legal system and consequently society This assumption is dramatically wrong Each statute each regulation each caselaw precedent serves in the entire web of the law as an adjacent possible niche a tool that enables unprestatable consequences The behaviors enabled by our vast complex network of laws lead to outcomes markedly different than those sought by the policy makers who enacted each individual law You could say this is the law of unintended consequencesThe distinction between reductionism and emergence is far from semanticReductionist thinking ensures policymaking that is as destructive as it is uninformed The passage of many individual laws each seemingly inspired by common sense can in the aggregate unleash unforeseen cruelty There is perhaps no example more poignant than the American fascination with utilizing the force of law to repel people from sin Personal behavioral choices deemed immoral including drug and alcohol use abortion and prostitution have been punished with differing degrees of severity Even attitudes deemed unacceptable such as personally held bigotry have been specially targeted through sentencing enhancements in hatecrimes legislationBut are humans merely Pavlovian dogs ripe for social conditioning Does aberrant behavior disappear once it is criminally proscribed Let us acknowledge the true answer Of course notThese laws do not solve social problems They do trigger a litany of unintended cascading consequences  from black markets and the violent drug cartels they spawn to a prison system that incarcerates 25 percent of the worlds prisoners in a country with only five percent of the worlds population These emergent consequences counsel against using the legislative process to enforce personal moral valuesThe temptation toward formal moral condemnation  known in the legal world as the expressionist function of law  is bipartisan It is fundamentally not an ideological problem but a conceptual one Yet the use of law to force changes in individual behavior often ultimately ushers in deep social pathology that hurts conservatives and liberals alikeA law may be passed with noble intentions but its uses inevitably stray far from its original purpose As the legal system evolves dynamically laws come to serve as adjacent possible niches typically for the benefit of the powerful and to the detriment of the powerless The more numerous the laws and the heavier the sanctions the greater the opportunity for persecution of the innocentAs law professor Grant Gilmore once observed In Heaven there will be no law and the lion will lie down with the lamb  In Hell there will be nothing but law and due process will be meticulously observedWe ignore the emergent consequences of law at our perilNext week we will examine the criminal justice systems most notorious deterrencegonewrong story federal sentences

arguments on the fate of President Obamas health care law A transcript of Tuesdays arguments as prepared by the court followsCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS We will continue argument this morning in Case 11398 the Department of Health and Human Services v FloridaGeneral Verrilli ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B VERRILLI JR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS GENERAL VERRILLI Mr Chief Justice and may it please the CourtThe Affordable Care Act addresses a fundamental and enduring problem in our health care system and our economy Insurance has become the predominant means of paying for health care in this country Insurance has become the predominant means of paying for health care in this countryFor most Americans for more than 80 percent of Americans the insurance system does provide effective access Excuse me But for more than 40 million Americans who do not have access to health insurance either through their employer or through government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid the system does not work Those individuals must resort to the individual market and that market does not provide affordable health insuranceIt does not do so because because the multibillion dollar subsidies that are available for the the employer market are not available in the individual market It does not do so because ERISA and HIPAA regulations that preclude that preclude discrimination against people based on their medical history do not apply in the individual market That is an economic problem And it begets another economic problemJUSTICE SCALIA Why arent those problems that the Federal Government can address directlyGENERAL VERRILLI They can address it directly Justice Scalia and they are addressing it directly through this through this Act by regulating the means by which health care by which health care is purchased That is the way this Act worksUnder the Commerce Clause what what Congress has done is to enact reforms of the insurance market directed at the individual insurance market that preclude that preclude discrimination based on preexisting conditions that require guaranteed issue and community rating and it uses  and the minimum coverage provision is necessary to carry into execution those insurance reformsJUSTICE KENNEDY Can you create commerce in order to regulate itGENERAL VERRILLI Thats not whats going on here Justice Kennedy and we are not seeking to defend the law on that basisIn this case the  what is being regulated is the method of financing health the purchase of health care That itself is economic activity with substantial effects on interstate commerce And JUSTICE SCALIA Any self purchasing Anything I  you know if Im in any market at all my failure to purchase something in that market subjects me to regulationGENERAL VERRILLI No Thats not our position at all Justice Scalia In the health care market the health care market is characterized by the fact that aside from the few groups that Congress chose to exempt from the minimum coverage requirement  those who for religious reasons dont participate those who are incarcerated Indian tribes  virtually everybody else is either in that market or will be in that market and the distinguishing feature of that is that they cannot people cannot generally control when they enter that market or what they need when they enter that marketCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Well the same it seems to me would be true say for the market in emergency services police fire ambulance roadside assistance whatever You dont know when youre going to need it youre not sure that you will But the same is true for health care You dont know if youre going to need a heart transplant or if you ever will So there is a market there To  in some extent we all participate in itSo can the government require you to buy a cell phone because that would facilitate responding when you need emergency services You can just dial 911 no matter where you areGENERAL VERRILLI No Mr Chief Justice think thats different Its  We  I dont think we think of that as a market This is a market This is market regulation And in addition you have a situation in this market not only where people enter involuntarily as to when they enter and wont be able to control what they need when they enter but when they CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS It seems to me thats the same as in my hypothetical You dont know when youre going to need police assistance You cant predict the extent to emergency response that youll need But when you do and the government provides it I thought that was an important part of your argument that when you need health care the government will make sure you get it Well when you need police assistance or fire assistance or ambulance assistance the government is going to make sure to the best extent it can that you get it  get itGENERAL VERRILLI I think the fundamental difference Mr Chief Justice is that thats not an issue of market regulation This is an issue of market regulation and thats how Congress thats how Congress looked at this problem There is a market Insurance is provided through the market system JUSTICE ALITO Do you think there is a a market for burial servicesGENERAL VERRILLI For burial servicesJUSTICE ALITO YesGENERAL VERRILLI Yes Justice Alito I think there isJUSTICE ALITO All right suppose that you and I walked around downtown Washington at lunch hour and we found a couple of healthy young people and we stopped them and we said You know what youre doing You are financing your burial services right now because eventually youre going to die and somebody is going to have to pay for it and if you dont have burial insurance and you havent saved money for it youre going to shift the cost to somebody elseIsnt that a very artificial way of talking about what somebody is doingGENERAL VERRILLI No that JUSTICE ALITO And if thats true why isnt it equally artificial to say that somebody who is doing absolutely nothing about health care is financing health care servicesGENERAL VERRILLI Its I think its completely different The  and the reason is that the the burial example is not  the difference is here we are regulating the method by which you are paying for something else  health care  and the insurance requirement  I think the key thing here is my friends on the other side acknowledge that it is within the authority of Congress under Article I under the commerce power to impose guaranteedissue and community rating forms to end  to impose a minimum coverage provision Their argument is just that it has to occur at the point of sale and JUSTICE ALITO I dont see the difference You can get burial insurance You can get health insurance Most people are going to need health care Almost everybody Everybody is going to be buried or cremated at some point Whats the differenceGENERAL VERRILLI Well one big difference one big difference Justice Alito is the  you dont have the cost shifting to other market participants Here JUSTICE ALITO Sure you do because if you dont have money then the State is going to pay for it Or some GENERAL VERRILLI Thats differentJUSTICE ALITO Or a family member is going to payGENERAL VERRILLI Thats a difference and its a significant difference In this situation one of the economic effects Congress is addressing is that the  there  the many billions of dollars of uncompensated costs are transferred directly to other market participants Its transferred directly to other market participants because health care providers charge higher rates in order to cover the cost of uncompensated care and insurance companies reflect those higher rates in higher premiums which Congress found translates to a thousand dollars per family in additional health insurance costsJUSTICE ALITO But isnt that a very small part of what the mandate is doing You can correct me if these figures are wrong but it appears to me that the CBO has estimated that the average premium for a single insurance policy in the nongroup market would be roughly 5800 in  in 2016Respondents  the economists have supported  the Respondents estimate that a young healthy individual targeted by the mandate on average consumes about 854 in health services each year So the mandate is forcing these people to provide a huge subsidy to the insurance companies for other purposes that the act wishes to serve but isnt  if those figures are right isnt it the case that what this mandate is really doing is not requiring the people who are subject to it to pay for the services that they are going to consume It is requiring them to subsidize services that will be received by somebody elseGENERAL VERRILLI No I think that  I do think thats what the Respondents argue Its just not right I think it  it really gets to a fundamental problem with their argumentJUSTICE GINSBURG If youre going to have insurance thats how insurance worksGENERAL VERRILLI A it is how insurance works but B the problem that they  that they are identifying is not that problem The  the guaranteed issue and community rating reforms do not have the effect of forcing insurance companies to take on lots of additional people who they then cant afford to cover because theyre  they tend to be the sick and that is  in fact the exact opposite is what happens hereThe  when  when you enact Guaranteed Issue and Community Rating Reforms and you do so in the absence of a minimum coverage provision its not that insurance companies take on more and more people and then need a subsidy to cover it its that fewer and fewer people end up with insurance because their rates are not regulated Insurance companies when  when they have to offer Guaranteed Issue and Community Rating they are entitled to make a profit They charge rates sufficient to cover only the sick population because health JUSTICE KENNEDY Could you help  help me with this Assume for the moment  you may disagree Assume for the moment that this is unprecedented this is a step beyond what our cases have allowed the affirmative duty to act to go into commerce If that is so do you not have a heavy burden of justificationI understand that we must presume laws are constitutional but even so when you are changing the relation of the individual to the government in this what we can stipulate is I think a unique way do you not have a heavy burden of justification to show authorization under the ConstitutionGENERAL VERRILLI So two things about that Justice Kennedy First we think this is regulation of peoples participation in the health care market and all  all this minimum coverage provision does is say that instead of requiring insurance at the point of sale that Congress has the authority under the commerce power and the necessary proper power to ensure that people have insurance in advance of the point of sale because of the unique nature of this market because this is a market in which  in which you  although most of the population is in the market most of the time  83 percent visit a physician every year 96 percent over a fiveyear period  so virtually everybody in society is in this market and youve got to pay for the health care you get the predominant way in which its  in which its paid for is insurance and  and the Respondents agree that Congress could require that you have insurance in order to get health care or forbid health care from being provided JUSTICE SCALIA Why do you  why do you define the market that broadly Health care It may well be that everybody needs health care sooner or later but not everybody needs a heart transplant not everybody needs a liver transplant Why GENERAL VERRILLI Thats correct Justice Scalia but you never know whether youre going to be that personJUSTICE SCALIA Could you define the market  everybody has to buy food sooner or later so you define the market as food therefore everybody is in the market therefore you can make people buy broccoliGENERAL VERRILLI No thats quite different Thats quite different The food market while it shares that trait that everybodys in it it is not a market in which your participation is often unpredictable and often involuntary It is not a market in which you often dont know before you go in what you need and it is not a market in which if you go in and  and seek to obtain a product or service you will get it even if you cant pay for it It doesnt JUSTICE SCALIA Is that a principal basis for distinguishing this from other situations I mean you know you can also say well the person subject to this has blue eyes That would indeed distinguish it from other situations Is it a principle basisI mean its  its a basis that explains why the government is doing this but is it  is it a basis which shows that this is not going beyond what  what the  the system of enumerated powers allows the government to doGENERAL VERRILLI Yes for two reasons First this  the test as this Court has articulated it is Is Congress regulating economic activity with a substantial effect on interstate commerceThe way in which this statute satisfies the test is on the basis of the factors that I have identified If JUSTICE GINSBURG Mr Verrilli I thought that your main point is that unlike food or any other market when you made the choice not to buy insurance even though you have every intent in the world to selfinsure to save for it when disaster strikes you may not have the money And the tangible result of it is  we were told there was one brief that Maryland Hospital Care bills 7 percent more because of these uncompensated costs that families pay a thousand dollars more than they would if there were no uncompensated costsI thought what was unique about this is its not my choice whether I want to buy a product to keep me healthy but the cost that I am forcing on other people if I dont buy the product sooner rather than laterGENERAL VERRILLI That is  and that is definitely a difference that distinguishes this market and justifies this as a regulationJUSTICE BREYER All right So if that is your difference  if that is your difference Im somewhat uncertain about your answers to  for example Justice Kennedy asked can you under the Commerce Clause Congress create commerce where previously none existedWell yeah I thought the answer to that was since McCulloch versus Maryland when the Court said Congress could create the Bank of the United States which did not previously exist which job was to create commerce that did not previously exist since that time the answer has been yes I would have thought that your answer  can the government in fact require you to buy cell phones or buy burials that if we propose comparable situations if we have for example a uniform United States system of paying for every burial such as Medicare Burial Medicaid Burial CHIP Burial ERISA Burial and Emergency Burial beside the side of the road and Congress wanted to rationalize that system wouldnt the answer be yes of course they couldGENERAL VERRILLI So JUSTICE BREYER And the same with the computers or the same with the  the cell phones if youre driving by the side of the highway and there is a federal emergency service just as you say you have to buy certain mufflers for your car that dont hurt the environment you could  I mean see doesnt it depend on the situationGENERAL VERRILLI It does Justice Breyer and if Congress were to enact laws like that we JUSTICE BREYER We would be  or GENERAL VERRILLI My responsibility  and I would defend them on a rationale like that but I do think that we are advancing a narrower rationaleJUSTICE KENNEDY Well then your question is whether or not there are any limits on the Commerce Clause Can you identify for us some limits on the Commerce ClauseGENERAL VERRILLI Yes The  the rationale purely under the Commerce Clause that were advocating here would not justify forced purchases of commodities for the purpose of stimulating demand We  the  it would not justify purchases of insurance for the purposes  in situations in which insurance doesnt serve as the method of payment for service JUSTICE KENNEDY But why not If Congress  if Congress says that the interstate commerce is affected isnt according to your view that the end of the analysisGENERAL VERRILLI No The the  we think that in a  when  the difference between those situations and this situation is that in those situations Your Honor Congress would be moving to create commerce Here Congress is regulating existing commerce economic activity that is already going on peoples participation in the health care market and is regulating to deal with existing effects of existing commerceCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS That  that it seems to me its a  its a passage in your reply brief that I didnt quite grasp Its the same point You say health insurance is not purchased for its own sake like a car or broccoli it is a means of financing health care consumption and covering universal risks Well a car or broccoli arent purchased for their own sake either They are purchased for the sake of transportation or in broccoli covering the need for food I  I dont understand that distinctionGENERAL VERRILLI The difference Mr Chief Justice is that health insurance is the means of payment for health care and broccoli is CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Well now thats a significant  Im sorryGENERAL VERRILLI And  and broccoli is not the means of payment for anything else And an automobile is not CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Its the means of satisfying a basic human need just as your insurance is a means of satisfying GENERAL VERRILLI But I do think thats the difference between existing commerce activity in the market already occurring  the people in the health care market purchasing obtaining health care services  and the creation of commerce And the principle that we are advocating here under the Commerce Clause does not take the step of justifying the creation of commerce Its a regulation of the existing commerceJUSTICE GINSBURG General Verrilli can wecan we go back to Justice Breyer asked a question and it kind of interrupted your answer to my question And tell me if Im wrong about this but I thought a major major point of your argument was that the people who dont participate in this market are making it much more expensive for the people who do that is they they will get a good number of them will get services that they cant afford at the point where they need them and the result is that everybody elses premiums get raised So youre not  its not your  your free choice just to do something for yourself What you do is going to affect others affect them in  in a major wayGENERAL VERRILLI That  that absolutely is a justification for Congresss action here That is existing economic activity that Congress is regulating by means of this ruleJUSTICE SCALIA General Verrilli you you could say that about buying a car If  if people dont buy cars the price that those who do buy cars pay will have to be higher So you could say in order to bring the price down you are hurting these other people by not buying a carGENERAL VERRILLI That is not what we are saying Justice ScaliaJUSTICE SCALIA Thats not  thats not what youre sayingGENERAL VERRILLI Thats not  not JUSTICE SCALIA I thought it wasI thought you were saying other people are going to have to pay more for insurance because youre not buying itGENERAL VERRILLI No Its because youre going  in the health care market youre going into the market without the ability to pay for what you get getting the health care service anyway as a result of the social norms that allow  that  to which weve obligated ourselves so that people get health careJUSTICE SCALIA Well dont obligate yourself to that Why  you knowGENERAL VERRILLI Well I cant imagine that that  that the Commerce Clause would would forbid Congress from taking into account this deeply embedded social normJUSTICE SCALIA You  you could do it But  but does that expand your ability to to issue mandates to  to the peopleGENERAL VERRILLI I  I  this is not a purchase mandate This is a  this is a law that regulates the method of paying for a service that the class of people to whom it applies are either consuming JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR General GENERAL VERRILLI  or  or inevitably will consumeJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR General I see or have seen three strands of arguments in your briefs and one of them is echoed today The first strand that I have seen is that Congress can pass any necessary laws to effect those powers within its rights ie because it made a decision that to effect to effect mandatory issuance of insurance that it could also obligate the mandatory purchase of itThe second strand I see is selfinsurance affects the market and so the government can regulate those who selfinsureAnd the third argument  and I see all of them as different  is that what the government is doing and I think its the argument youre making today  that what the  what the government is saying is if you pay for  if you use health services you have to pay with insurance Because only insurance will guarantee that whatever need for health care that you have will be covered Because virtually no one perhaps with the exception of 1 percent of the population can afford the massive cost if the unexpected happensThis third argument seems to be saying what we are regulating is health care and when you go for health services you have to pay for insurance and since insurance wont issue at the moment that you consume the product we can reasonably necessarily tell you to buy it ahead of time because you cant buy it at the moment that you need itIs that  which of these three is your argument Are all of them your argument Im just not sure what the GENERAL VERRILLI So let me try to state it this way The Congress enacted reforms of the insurance market the guaranteedissue and communityrating reforms It did so to deal with a very serious problem that results in 40 million people not being able to get insurance and therefore not access to the health care environment Everybody agrees in this case that those are within Congresss Article I powersThe minimum coverage provision is necessary to carry those provisions into  into execution because without them without those provisions without minimum coverage guaranteed issue and community rating will as the experience in the States showed make matters worse not better There will be fewer people covered it will cost more Now the  so JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR So on that ground youre answering affirmatively to my colleagues that have asked you the question can the government force you into commerceGENERAL VERRILLI So  noJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR And there is no limit to that powerGENERAL VERRILLI No No Because thats  thats the first part of our argumentThe second part of our argument is that the means here that the Congress has chosen the minimum coverage provision is a means that regulates the that regulates economic activity namely your transaction in the health care market with substantial effects on interstate commerce and it is the conjunction of those two that we think provides the particularly secure foundation for this statute under the commerce powerJUSTICE KAGAN General youve talked on a couple of times about other alternatives that Congress might have had other alternatives that the Respondents suggest to deal with this problem in particular the alternative of mandating insurance at the point at which somebody goes to a hospital or an emergency room and asks for careDid Congress consider those alternatives Why did it reject them How should we think about the question of alternative ways of dealing with these problemsGENERAL VERRILLI I do think Justice Kagan that the point of difference between my friends on the other side and the United States is about one of timing They have agreed that Congress has Article I authority to impose an insurance requirement or other or other penalty at the point of sale and they have agreed that Congress has the authority to do that to achieve the same objectives that the minimum coverage provision of the Affordable Care Act is designed to achieve This is a situation if which we are talking about means Congress gets a substantial deference in the choice of means and if one thinks about the difference between the means they say Congress should have chosen and the means Congress did choose I think you can see why it was eminently more sensible for Congress to choose the means that it choseJUSTICE KENNEDY Im not sure which way it cuts If the Congress has alternate means lets assume it can use the tax power to raise revenue and to just have a national health service single payer How does that factor into our analysis In the one sense it can be argued that this is what the government is doing it ought to be honest about the power that its using and use the correct power On the other hand it means that since the Court can do it anyway  Congress can do it anyway we give a certain amount of latitude Im not sure which the way the argument goesGENERAL VERRILLI Let me try to answer that question Justice Kennedy and get back to the question you asked me earlier The the  I do think one striking feature of the argument here that this is a novel exercise of power is that what Congress chose to do was to rely on market mechanisms and efficiency and a method that has more choice than would the traditional MedicareMedicaid type model and so it seems a little ironic to suggest that that counts against itBut beyond that in the sense that its novel this provision is novel in the same way or unprecedented in the same way that the Sherman Act was unprecedented when the Court upheld it in the Northern Securities case or the Packers and Stockyards Act was unprecedented when the Court upheld it or the National Labor Relations Act was unprecedented when the Court upheld it in Jones and Laughlin or the  the dairy price supports in Wrightwood Dairy and Rock Royal JUSTICE SCALIA Oh no its not They all involved commerce There was no doubt that was what regulated was commerce And here youre regulating somebody who isnt coveredBy the way I dont agree with you that the relevant market here is health care Youre not regulating health care Youre regulating insurance Its the insurance market that youre addressing and youre saying that some people who are not in it must be in it and thats  thats difference from regulating in any manner commerce that already exists out thereGENERAL VERRILLI Well to the extent that we are looking at the comprehensive scheme Justice Scalia it is regulating commerce that already exists out there And the means in which that regulation is made effective here the minimum coverage provision is a regulation of the way in which people participate the method of their payment in the health care market That is what it isAnd I do think Justice Kennedy getting back to the question you asked before what  what matters here is whether Congress is choosing a tool thats reasonably adapted to the problem that Congress is confronting And that may mean that the tool is different from a tool that Congress has chosen to use in the past Thats not something that counts against the provision in a Commerce Clause analysisJUSTICE SCALIA Wait Thats  thats its both Necessary and Proper What you just said addresses whats necessary Yes has to be reasonably adapted Necessary does not mean essential just reasonably adapted But in addition to being necessary it has to be proper And weve held in two cases that something that was reasonably adapted was not proper because it violated the sovereignty of the States which was implicit in the constitutional structureThe argument here is that this also is  may be necessary but its not proper because it violates an equally evident principle in the Constitution which is that the Federal Government is not supposed to be a government that has all powers that its supposed to be a government of limited powers And thats what all this questioning has been about What  what is left If the government can do this what what else can it not doGENERAL VERRILLI This does not violate the norm of proper as this Court articulated it in Printz or in New York because it does not interfere with the States as sovereigns This is a regulation that  this is a regulation JUSTICE SCALIA No that wasnt my point That is not the only constitutional principle that existsGENERAL VERRILLI But it JUSTICE SCALIA An equally evident constitutional principle is the principle that the Federal Government is a government of enumerated powers and that the vast majority of powers remain in the States and do not belong to the Federal Government Do you acknowledge that thats a principleGENERAL VERRILLI Of course we do Your HonorJUSTICE SCALIA Okay Thats what we are talking about hereGENERAL VERRILLI And the way in which this Court in its cases has policed the boundary that  of whats in the national sphere and whats in the local sphere is to ask whether Congress is regulating economic activity with a substantial effect on interstate commerce And here I think its really impossible in view of our history to say that Congress is invading the State sphere This is a  this is a market in which 50 percent of the people in this country get their health care through their employer There is a massive Federal tax subsidy of 250 billion a year that makes that much more affordable ERISA and HIPAA regulate that to ensure that the kinds of bans on preexisting condition discrimination and pricing practices that occur in the individual market dont occurJUSTICE SCALIA I dont understand your GENERAL VERRILLI This is in JUSTICE SCALIA Whatever the States have chosen not to do the Federal Government can doGENERAL VERRILLI No not at allJUSTICE SCALIA I mean the Tenth Amendment says the powers not given to the Federal Government are reserved not just to the States but to the States and the people And the argument here is that the people were left to decide whether they want to buy insurance or notGENERAL VERRILLI But this  but Your Honor this is  what the Court has said and I think it would be a very substantial departure from what the Court has said is that when Congress is regulating economic activity with a substantial effect on interstate commerce that will be upheld And that is what is going on here and to embark on  I would submit with all due respect to embark on the kind of analysis that my friends on the other side suggest the Court ought to embark on is to import Lochnerstyle substantive due process CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS The key in Lochner is that we were talking about regulation of the States right and the States are not limited to enumerated powers The Federal Government is And it seems to me its an entirely different question when you ask yourself whether or not there are going to be limits in the Federal power as opposed to limits on the States which was the issue in LochnerGENERAL VERRILLI I agree exceptMr Chief Justice that what the Court has said as I read the Courts cases is that the way in which you ensure that the Federal Government stays in its sphere and the sphere reserved for the States is protected is by policing the boundary Is the national government regulating economic activity with a substantial effect on interstate commerceJUSTICE KENNEDY But the reason the reason this is concerning is because it requires the individual to do an affirmative act In the law of torts our tradition our law has been that you dont have the duty to rescue someone if that person is in danger The blind man is walking in front of a car and you do not have a duty to stop him absent some relation between you And there is some severe moral criticisms of that rule but thats generally the ruleAnd here the government is saying that the Federal Government has a duty to tell the individual citizen that it must act and that is different from what we have in previous cases and that changes the relationship of the Federal Government to the individual in the very fundamental wayGENERAL VERRILLI I dont think so Justice Kennedy because it is predicated on the participation of these individuals in the market for health care services Now it happens to be that this is a market in which aside from the groups that the statute excludes virtually everybody participates But it is a regulation of their participation in that marketCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Well but its critical how you define the market If I understand the law the policies that youre requiring people to purchase involve  must contain provision for maternity and newborn care pediatric services and substance use treatment It seems to me that you cannot say that everybody is going to need substance use treatment substance use treatment or pediatric services and yet that is part of what you require them to purchaseGENERAL VERRILLI Well its part of what the statute requires the insurers to offer And I think the reason is because its trying to define minimum essential coverage because the problem CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS But your theory is that there is a market in which everyone participates because everybody might need a certain range of health care services and yet youre requiring people who are not  never going to need pediatric or maternity services to participate in that marketGENERAL VERRILLI The  with respect to what insurance has to cover Your Honor I think Congress is entitled the latitude of making the judgments of what the appropriate scope of coverage is And the problem here in this market is that for  you may think youre perfectly healthy and you may think that youre not  that youre being forced to subsidize somebody else but this is not a market in which you can say that there is a immutable class of healthy people who are being forced to subsidize the unhealthy This is a market in which you may be healthy one day and you may be a very unhealthy participant in that market the next day and that is a fundamental difference and youre not going to know in which CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS I think youre posing the question I was posing which is that doesnt apply to a lot of what youre requiring people to purchase Pediatric services maternity services You cannot say that everybody is going to participate in the substance use market and yet you require people to purchase insurance coverage for thatGENERAL VERRILLI Congress has got Congress is enacting economic regulation here It has latitude to define essential the attributes of essential coverage That doesnt  that doesnt seem to me to implicate the question of whether Congress is engaging in economic regulation and solving an economic problem here and that is what Congress is doingJUSTICE ALITO Are you denying this If you took the group of people who are subject to the mandate and you calculated the amount of health care services this whole group would consume and figured out the cost of an insurance policy to cover the services that group would consume the cost of that policy would be much much less than the kind of policy that these people are now going to be required to purchase under the Affordable Care ActGENERAL VERRILLI Well while they are young and healthy that would be true But they are not going to be young and healthy forever They are going to be on the other side of that actuarial equation at some point And of course you dont know which among that group is the person whos going to be hit by the bus or get the definitive diagnosis And that JUSTICE ALITO The point is  no you take into account that some people in that group are going to be hit by a bus some people in that group are going to unexpectedly contract or be diagnosed with a disease that  that is very expensive to treat But if you take their costs and you calculate that thats a lot less than the amount that they are going to be required to paySo that you cant just justify this on the basis of their trying to shift their costs off to other people can youGENERAL VERRILLI Well the  the people in that class get benefits too Justice Alito They get the guaranteedissue benefit that they would not otherwise have which is an enormously valuable benefitAnd in terms of the  the subsidy rationale I  I dont think  I think its  it would be unusual to say that its an illegitimate exercise of the commerce power for some people to subsidize others Telephone rates in this country for a century were set via the exercise of the commerce power in a way in which some people paid rates that were much higher than their costs in order to subsidize JUSTICE SCALIA Only if you make phone callsGENERAL VERRILLI Well right But  but everybody  to live in the modern world everybody needs a telephone And the  the same thing with respect to the  you know the dairy price supports that  that the Court upheld in Wrightwood Dairy and Rock Royal You can look at those as disadvantageous contracts as forced transfers that  you know I suppose its theoretically true that you could raise your kids without milk but the reality is youve got to go to the store and buy milk And the commerce power as a result of the exercise of the commerce power youre subsidizing somebody else JUSTICE KAGAN And this is especially true isnt it General GENERAL VERRILLI  because thats the judgment Congress has madeJUSTICE KAGAN  Verrilli because in this context the subsidizers eventually become the subsidizedGENERAL VERRILLI Well that was the point I was trying to make Justice Kagan that youre young and healthy one day but you dont stay that way And the  the system works over time And so I just dont think its a fair characterization of it And it does get back to I think  a problem I think is important to understand JUSTICE SCALIA Were not stupid Theyre going to buy insurance later Theyre young and  and need the money nowGENERAL VERRILLI But thats JUSTICE SCALIA When  when they think they have a substantial risk of incurring high medical bills theyll buy insurance like the rest of usBut GENERAL VERRILLI Thats  thats JUSTICE SCALIA  I dont know why you think that theyre never going to buy itGENERAL VERRILLI Thats the problem Justice Scalia Thats  and thats exactly the experience that the States had that made the imposition of guaranteedissue and community rating not only be ineffectual but be highly counterproductive Rates for example in New Jersey doubled or tripled went from 180000 people covered in this market down to 80000 people covered in this marketIn Kentucky virtually every insurer left the market And the reason for that is because when people have that guarantee of  that they can get insurance theyre going to make that calculation that they wont get it until theyre sick and they need it and so the pool of people in the insurance market gets smaller and smaller The rates you have to charge to cover them get higher and higher It helps fewer and fewer  insurance covers fewer and fewer people until the system endsThis is not a situation in which youre conscripting  youre forcing insurance companies to cover very large numbers of unhealthy people JUSTICE SCALIA You could solve that problem by simply not requiring the insurance company to sell it to somebody who has a  a condition that is going to require medical treatment or at least not not require them to sell it to him at  at a rate that he sells it to healthy peopleBut you dont want to do thatGENERAL VERRILLI But that seems to me to say Justice Scalia that Congress  thats the problem here And that seems to be JUSTICE SCALIA That seems to me a selfcreated problemGENERAL VERRILLI Congress cannot solve the problem through standard economic regulation and that  and  and I do not think that can be the premise of our understanding of the Commerce Clause JUSTICE SCALIA Whatever GENERAL VERRILLI  this is an economic problem JUSTICE SCALIA  whatever problems Congresss economic regulation produces whatever they are I think Congress can do something to counteract them Here requiring somebody to enter  to enter the insurance marketGENERAL VERRILLI This is not a  its not a problem of Congresss creation The problem is that you have 40 million people who cannot get affordable insurance through the means that the rest of us get affordable insurance Congress after a long study and careful deliberation and viewing the experiences of the States and the way they tried to handle this problem adopted a package of reforms Guaranteedissue and community rating and  and subsidies and the minimum coverage provision are a package of reforms that solve that problemI dont  I think its highly artificial to view this as a problem of Congresss own creationCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Is your argument limited to insurance or means of paying for health careGENERAL VERRILLI Yes Its limited to insuranceCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Well now why is that Congress could  once you  once you establish that you have a market for health care I would suppose Congresss power under the Commerce Clause meant they had a broad scope in terms of how they regulate that market And it would be  it would be going back to Lochner if we were put in the position of saying no you can use your commerce power to regulate insurance but you cant use your commerce power to regulate this market in other ways I think that would be a very significant intrusion by the Court into Congresss powerSo I dont see how we can accept your its good for you in this case to say oh its just insurance But once we say that there is a market and Congress can require people to participate in it as some would say  or as you would say that people are already participating in it  it seems to me that we cant say there are limitations on what Congress can do under its commerce power just like in any other area all  given significant deference that we accord to Congress in this area all bets are off and you could regulate that market in any rational wayGENERAL VERRILLI But this is insurance as a method of payment for health care services CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS ExactlyGENERAL VERRILLI And that  and that is CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS And youre worried  thats the area that Congress has chosen to regulate Theres this health care market Everybodys in it So we can regulate it and were going to look at a particular serious problem which is how people pay for it But next year they can decide everybodys in this market were going to look at a different problem now and this is how were going to regulate it And we can compel people to do things  purchase insurance in this case Something else in the next case because youve  weve accepted the argument that this is a market in which everybody participatesGENERAL VERRILLI Mr Chief Justice let me answer that and then if I may Id like to move to the tax power argumentJUSTICE SCALIA Can  can I tell you what the something else is so  while youre answering it The something else is everybody has to exercise because theres no doubt that lack of exercise cause  causes illness and that causes health care costs to go upSo the Federal government says everybody has to  to join a  an exercise club Thats  thats the something elseGENERAL VERRILLI No The  the position were taking here would not justify that rule Justice Scalia because health club membership is not a means of payment for  for consumption of anything in  in a marketCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Right Right Thats  thats exactly right but it doesnt seem responsive to my concern that theres no reason  once we say this is within Congresss commerce power theres no reason other than our own arbitrary judgment to say all they can regulate is the method of payment They can regulate other things that affect this nowconceded interstate market in health care in which everybody participatesGENERAL VERRILLI But I think its common ground between us and the Respondents that this is an interstate market in which everybody participates And they agree that  that Congress could impose the insurance requirement at the point of sale And this is just a question of timing and whether Congresss whether the necessary and proper authority gives Congress because of the particular features of this market the ability to impose the  the insurance the need for insurance the maintenance of insurance before you show up to get health care rather than at the moment you get up to show CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Right No I think GENERAL VERRILLI  show up to get health care And that CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS  unless Im missing something I think youre just repeating the idea that this is the regulation of the method of payment And I understand that argument And it may be  it may be a good one But what Im concerned about is once we accept the principle that everybody is in this market I dont see why Congresss power is limited to regulating the method of payment and doesnt include as it does in any other areaWhat other area have we said Congress can regulate this market but only with respect to prices but only with respect to means of travel No Once youre  once youre in the interstate commerce and can regulate it pretty much all bets are offGENERAL VERRILLI But we agree Congress can regulate this market ERISA regulates this market HIPAA regulates this market The  the market is regulated at the Federal level in very significant ways already So I dont think thats the question Mr Chief Justice The question is is there a limit to the authority that were advocating here under the commerce power and the answer is yes because we are not advocating for a power that would allow Congress to compel purchases JUSTICE ALITO Could you just  before you move on could you express your limiting principle as succinctly as you possibly can Congress can force people to purchase a product where the failure to purchase the product has a substantial effect on interstate commerce  if what If this is part of a larger regulatory scheme Was that it Was there anything moreGENERAL VERRILLI We got two and they are  they are different Let me state them First with respect to the comprehensive scheme When Congress is regulating  is enacting a comprehensive scheme that it has the authority to enact that the Necessary and Proper Clause gives it the authority to include regulation including a regulation of this kind if it is necessary to counteract risks attributable to the scheme itself that people engage in economic activity that would undercut the scheme Its like  its very much like Wickard in that respect very much like Raich in that respectWith respect to the  with respect to the  considering the Commerce Clause alone and not embedded in the comprehensive scheme our position is that Congress can regulate the method of payment by imposing an insurance requirement in advance of the time in which the  the service is consumed when the class to which that requirement applies either is or virtually is most certain to be in that market when the timing of ones entry into that market and what you will need when you enter that market is uncertain and when  when you will get the care in that market whether you can afford to pay for it or not and shift costs to other market participantsSo those  those are our views as to those are the principles we are advocating for and its in fact the conjunction of the two of them here that makes this we think a strong case under the Commerce ClauseJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR General could you turn to the tax clauseGENERAL VERRILLI YesJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR I have to look for a case that involves the issue of whether something denominated by Congress as a penalty was nevertheless treated as a tax except in those situations where the code itself or the statute itself said treat the penalty as a taxDo you know of any case where weve done thatGENERAL VERRILLI Well I think I would point the Court to the License Tax Case where it was was denominated a fee and nontax and the Court upheld it as an exercise of the taxing power in a situation in which the structure of the law was very much the structure of this law in that there was a separate standalone provision that set the predicate and then a separate provision in closing JUSTICE SCALIA But fees you know license fees fees for a hunting license everybody knows those are taxes I mean I dont think there is as much of a difference between a fee and a tax as there is between a penalty and a taxGENERAL VERRILLI And that and  and I think in terms of the tax part I think its useful to separate this into two questions One is a question of characterization Can this be characterized as a tax and second is it a constitutional exercise of the powerWith respect to the question of characterization the  this is  in the Internal Revenue Code it is administered by the IRS it is paid on your Form 1040 on April 15th I think JUSTICE GINSBURG But yesterday you told me  you listed a number of penalties that are enforced through the tax code that are not taxes and they are not penalties related to taxesGENERAL VERRILLI They may still be exercise of the tax  exercises of the taxing power Justice Ginsburg as  as this is and I think there isnt a case in which the Court has to my mind suggested anything that bears this many indicia of a tax cant be considered as an exercise of the taxing power In fact it seems to me the License Tax Cases point you in the opposite direction And beyond that your the  it seems to me the right way to think about this question is whether it is capable of being understood as an exercise of the taxJUSTICE SCALIA The President said it wasnt a tax didnt heGENERAL VERRILLI Well Justice Scalia what the  two things about that first as it seems to me what matters is what power Congress was exercising And they were  and I think its clear that  that the  the  they were exercising the tax power as well as JUSTICE SCALIA Youre making two arguments Number one its a tax and number two even if it isnt a tax its within the taxing power Im just addressing the firstGENERAL VERRILLI If the President said JUSTICE SCALIA Is it a tax or not a tax The President didnt think it wasGENERAL VERRILLI The President said it wasnt a tax increase because it ought to be understood as an incentive to get people to have insuranceI dont think its fair to infer from that anything about whether that is an exercise of the tax power or notJUSTICE GINSBURG A tax is to raise revenue tax is a revenueraising device and the purpose of this exaction is to get people into the health care risk  risk pool before they need medical care and so it will be successful If it doesnt raise any revenue if it gets people to buy the insurance thats  thats what this penalty is  this penalty is designed to affect conductThe conduct is buy health protection buy health insurance before you have a need for medical care Thats what the penalty is designed to do not to raise revenueGENERAL VERRILLI That  that is true Justice Ginsburg This is also true of the marijuana tax that was withheld in Sanchez Thats commonly true of penalties under the Code They do  if they raise revenue they are exercises of the taxing power but their purpose is not to raise revenue Their purpose is to discourage behaviorI mean the  the mortgage deduction works that way When the mortgage deduction is  its clearly an exercise of the taxing power When its successful it raises less revenue for the Federal Government Its still an exercise of the taxing power So I dont JUSTICE KAGAN I suppose though General one question is whether the determined efforts of Congress not to refer to this as a tax make a difference I mean youre suggesting we should just look to the practical operation We shouldnt look at labels And that seems right except that here we have a case in which Congress determinedly said this is not a tax and the question is why should that be irrelevantGENERAL VERRILLI I dont think that thats a fair characterization of the actions of Congress here Justice Kagan On the  December 23rd a point of constitutional order was called to in fact with respect to this law The floor sponsor Senator Baucus defended it as an exercise of the taxing power In his response to the point of order the Senate voted 60 to39 on that propositionThe legislative history is replete with members of Congress explaining that this law is constitutional as an exercise of the taxing power It was attacked as a tax by its opponents So I dont think this is a situation where you can say thatCongress was avoiding any mention of the tax powerIt would be one thing if Congress explicitly disavowed an exercise of the tax power But given that it hasnt done so it seems to me that its  not only is it fair to read this as an exercise of the tax power but this Court has got an obligation to construe it as an exercise of the tax power if it can be upheld on that basisCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Why didnt Congress call it a tax thenGENERAL VERRILLI Well CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Youre telling me they thought of it as a tax they defended it on the tax power Why didnt they say it was a taxGENERAL VERRILLI They might have thought Your Honor that calling it a penalty as they did would make it more effective in accomplishing its objective But it is  in the Internal Revenue Code it is collected by the IRS on April 15th I dont think this is a situation in which you can say CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Well thats the reason They thought it might be more effective if they called it a penaltyGENERAL VERRILLI Well I  you know I dont  there is nothing that I know of that  that illuminates that but certainly JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR General the problem goes back to the limiting principle Is this simply anything that raises revenue that Congress can doGENERAL VERRILLI No There are certain limiting principles under the JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR So there has to be a limiting principle GENERAL VERRILLI  taxing power and they  and I think of course the Constitution imposes some got to be uniform cant be taxed on exports if its a direct tax its got to be apportioned Beyond that the limiting principle as the Court has identified from Drexel Furniture to Kurth Ranch is that it cant be punishment punitive in the guise of a tax And there are three factors of Court has identified to look at thatThe first is the sanction and how disproportionate it is to the conduct the second is whether there is scienter and the third is whether there is an  an  an administrative apparatus out there to enforce the taxNow in  in Bailey v Drexel Furniture for example the tax was 10 percent of the companys profits even if they had only one child laborer for one day There was a scienter requirement and it was enforced by the Department of Labor It wasnt just collected by the Internal Revenue ServiceHere you dont have any of those things This  the  the penalty is calculated to be no more than at most the equivalent of what one would have paid for insurance if you forgone There is no scienter requirement there is no enforcement apparatus out there So certain JUSTICE ALITO Can the  can the mandate be viewed as tax if it does impose a requirement on people who are not subject to the penalty or the taxGENERAL VERRILLI I think it could for the reasons I  I discussed yesterday I dont think it can or should be read that way But if there is any doubt about that Your Honor if there is  if  if it is the view of the Court that it cant be then I think the  the right way to handle this case is by analogy to New York v United States in which the  the Court read the shall provision shall handle the level of radioactive waste as setting the predicate and then the other provisions were merely incentives to get the predicate met andJUSTICE SCALIA Youre saying that all the discussion we had earlier about how this is one big uniform scheme and the Commerce Clause blah blah blah it really doesnt matter This is a tax and the Federal Government could simply have said without all of the rest of this legislation could simply have said everybody who doesnt buy health insurance at a certain age will be taxed so much money rightGENERAL VERRILLI It  it used its powers together to solve the problem of the market not JUSTICE SCALIA Yes but you didnt need thatGENERAL VERRILLI  providing for the JUSTICE SCALIA You didnt need that If its a tax its only  raising money is enoughGENERAL VERRILLI Its justifiable under its tax powerJUSTICE SCALIA ExtraordinaryGENERAL VERRILLI If I may reserve the balance of my timeCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Thank you gentlemen Well take a pause for a minute or so Mr ClementPauseCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Why dont we get started againMr ClementORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D CLEMENTON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS FLORIDA ET ALMR CLEMENT Mr Chief Justice and may it please the Court The mandate represents an unprecedented effort by Congress to compel individuals to enter commerce in order to better regulate commerceThe Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate existing commerce It does not give Congress the far greater power to compel people to enter commerce to create commerce essentially in the first placeNow Congress when it passed the statute did make findings about why it thought it could regulate the commerce here and it justified the mandate as a regulation of the economic decision to forego the purchase of health insurance That is a theory without any limiting principleJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Do you accept your the Generals position that you have conceded that Congress could say if youre going to consume health services you have to pay by way of insuranceMR CLEMENT Thats right Justice Sotomayor We say consistent with 220 years of this Courts jurisprudence that if you regulate the point of sale you regulate commerce thats within Congress commerce powerJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR All right So what do you do with the impossibility of buying insurance at the point of consumption Virtually you force insurance companies to sell it to youMR CLEMENT Well Justice I think there is two points to make on that One is a lot of the discussion this morning so far has proceeded on the assumption that the only thing that is at issue here is emergency room visits and the only thing thats being imposed is catastrophic care coverage but as the Chief Justice indicated earlier a lot of the insurance thats being covered is for ordinary preventive care ordinary office visits and those are the kinds of things that one can predictSo there is a big part of the market thats regulated here that wouldnt pose the problem that youre suggesting but even as to emergency room visits it certainly would be possible to regulate at that point You could simply say through some sort of mandate on the insurance companies you have to provide people that come in  this will be a highrisk pool and maybe you will have to share it amongst yourself or something but people simply have to sign up at that point and that would be regulating at the point of saleJUSTICE KAGAN Well Mr Clement now it seems as though youre just talking about a matter of timing that Congress can regulate the transaction and the question is when does it make best sense to regulate that transactionAnd Congress surely has within its authority to decide rather than at the point of sale given an insurancebased mechanism it makes sense to regulate it earlier Its just a matter of timingMR CLEMENT Well Justice Kagan we dont think its a matter of timing alone and we think it has very substantive effects Because if Congress tried to regulate at the point of sale the one group that it wouldnt capture at all are the people who dont want to purchase health insurance and also have no plans of using health care services in the near term And Congress very much wanted to capture those people I mean those people are essentially the golden geese that pay for the entire lowering of the premiumJUSTICE KENNEDY Was the governments argument this  and maybe I wont state it accurately  it is true that the noninsured young adult is in fact an actuarial reality insofar as our allocation of health services insofar as the way health insurance companies figure risksThat person who is sitting at home in his or her living room doing nothing is an actuarial reality that can and must be measured for health service purposes is that their argumentMR CLEMENT Well I dont know Justice Kennedy but if it is I think there is at least two problems with itOne is as Justice Alitos question suggested earlier I mean somebody who is not in the insurance market is sort of irrelevant as an actuarial risk I mean we could look at the people not in the insurance market and what wed find is that theyre relatively young relatively healthy and they would have a certain pool of actuarial risks that would actually lead to lower premiumsThe people that would be captured by guaranteed rating and community issue  guaranteed issue and community rating would presumably have a higher risk profile and there would be higher premiumsAnd one of the things one of the things Congress sought to accomplish here was to force individuals into the insurance market to subsidize those that are already in it to lower the rates And thats just not my speculation thats Finding I at 43A of the governments brief that  it has the statute And thats one of the clear findingsJUSTICE GINSBURG Mr Clement doesnt that work  that work the way Social Security doesLet me put it this way Congress in the 30s saw a real problem of people needing to have old age and survivors insurance And yes they did it through a tax but they said everybody has got to be in it because if we dont have the healthy in it theres not going to be the money to pay for the ones who become old or disabled or widowed So they required everyone to contributeIt was a big fuss about that in the beginning because a lot of people said  maybe some people still do today  I could do much better if the government left me alone Id go into the private market Id buy an annuity Id make a great investment and theyre forcing me to paying for this Social Security that I dont want but thats constitutionalSo if Congress could see this as a problem when we need to have a group that will subsidize the ones who are going to get the benefits it seems to me you are saying the only way that could be done is if the government does it itself it cant involve the private market it cant involve the private insurers If it wants to do this Social Security is its model The government has to do  has to be government takeover We cant have the insurance industry in it Is that your positionMR CLEMENT No I dont think it is Justice Ginsburg I think there are other options that are availableThe most straightforward one would be to figure out what amount of subsidy to the insurance industry is necessary to pay for guaranteed issue and community rating And once we calculate the amount of that subsidy we could have a tax thats spread generally through everybody to raise the revenue to pay for that subsidy Thats the way we pay for most subsidiesJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Could we have an exemption Could the government say everybody pays a shared health care responsibility payment to offset all the money that we are forced to spend on health care we the government but anybody who has an insurance policy is exempt from that tax Could the government do thatMR CLEMENT The government might be able to do that I think it might raise some issues about whether or not that would be a valid exercise of the taxing powerJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Under what theory wouldnt it beMR CLEMENT Well I do think that JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR We get tax credits for having solarpowered homes We get tax credits for using fuel efficient cars Why couldnt we get a tax credit for having health insurance and saving the government from caring for usMR CLEMENT Well I think it would depend a little bit on how it was formulated but my concern would be  the constitutional concern would be that it would just be a disguised impermissible direct tax And I do think  I mean I dont want to suggest we get to the taxing power to soon but I do think its worth realizing that the taxing power is limited in the ability to impose direct taxesAnd the one thing I think the framers would have clearly identified as a direct tax is a tax on not having somethingI mean the framing generation was divided over whether a tax on carriages was a direct tax or not Hamilton thought that was a indirect tax Madison thought it was a direct tax I have little doubt that both of them would have agreed that a tax on not having a carriage would have clearly been a direct tax I also think they would have thought it clearly wasnt a valid regulation of the market in carriagesAnd you know I mean if you look at Hilton against the United States thats this Courts first direct tax JUSTICE BREYER Let me ask  can I go back for a step because I dont want to get into a discussion of whether this is a good bill or not Some people think its going to save a lot of money Some people think it wontSo Im focusing just on the Commerce Clause not on the Due Process Clause the Commerce Clause And I look back into history and I think if we look back into history we see sometimes Congress can create commerce out of nothing Thats the national bank which was created out of nothing to create other commerce out of nothingI look back into history and I see it seems pretty clear that if there are substantial effects on interstate commerce Congress can actAnd I look at the person whos growing marijuana in her house or I look at the farmer who is growing the wheat for home consumption This seems to have more substantial effectsIs this commerce Well it seems to me more commerce than marijuana I mean is it in fact a regulation Well why not If creating a bank is why isnt thisAnd then you say ah but one thing here out of all those things is different and that is youre making somebody do somethingI say hey cant Congress make people drive faster than 45  40 miles an hour on a road Didnt they make that man growing his own wheat go into the market and buy other wheat for his  for his cows Didnt they make Mrs  if she married somebody who had marijuana in her basement wouldnt she have to go and get rid of it Affirmative actionI mean where does this distinction come from It sounds like sometimes you can and sometimes you cantSo what is argued here is there is a large group of  what about a person that we discover that there are  a disease is sweeping the United States and 40 million people are susceptible of whom 10 million will die cant the Federal Government say all 40 million get inoculationSo here we have a group of 40 million and 57 percent of those people visit emergency care or other care which we are paying for And 22 percent of those pay more than 100000 for that And Congress says they are in the midst of this big thing We just want to rationalize this system they are already inSo there you got the whole argument and I would like you to tell me JUSTICE SCALIA Well get to those questions in inverse orderJUSTICE BREYER Well no its one question Its looking back at that  looking back at that historyThe thing I can see that you say to some people go buy why does that make a difference in terms of the Commerce ClauseMR CLEMENT Well Justice Breyer let me start at the beginning of your question with McCulloch McCulloch was not a commerce power caseJUSTICE BREYER It was bothMR CLEMENT No the bank was not justified and the corporation was not justified as an exercise of commerce power So that is not a case that says that its okay to conjure up the bank as an exercise of the commerce powerWhat of course the Court didnt say and I think the Court would have had a very different reaction to is you know we are not just going to have the bank because that wouldnt be necessary and proper we are going to force the citizenry to put all of their money in the bank because if we do that then we know the Bank of the United States will be secureI think the framers would have identified the difference between those two scenarios and I dont think that the great Chief Justice would have said that forcing people to put their deposits in the Bank of the United States was necessary and properNow if you look through all the cases you mentioned I do not think you will find a case like this And I think its telling that you wont I mean the regulation of the wheat market in Wickard against Filburn all this effort to address the supply side and what producers could do what Congress was trying to do was support the price of wheat It would have been much more efficient to just make everybody in America buy 10 loaves of bread That would have had a much more direct effect on the price of wheat in the prevailing marketBut we didnt do that We didnt say when we had problems in the automobile industry that we are not just going to give you incentives not just cash for clunkers we are going to actually have ever everybody over 100000 has to buy a new car CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Well Mr Clement the key to the governments argument to the contrary is that everybody is in this market Its all right to regulate Wickard  again in Wickard against Filburn because thats a particular market in which the farmer had been participatingEverybody is in this market so that makes it very different than the market for cars or the other hypotheticals that you came up with and all theyre regulating is how you pay for itMR CLEMENT Well with respect Mr Chief Justice I suppose the first thing you have to say is what market are we talking about Because the government  this statute undeniably operates in the health insurance market And the government cant say that everybody is in that market The whole problem is that everybody is not in that market and they want to make everybody get into that marketJUSTICE KAGAN Well doesnt that seem a little bit Mr Clement cutting the bologna thin mean health insurance exists only for the purpose of financing health care The two are inextricably interlinked We dont get insurance so that we can stare at our insurance certificate We get it so that we can go and access health careMR CLEMENT Well Justice Kagan Im not sure thats right I think what health insurance does and what all insurance does is it allows you to diversify risk And so its not just a matter of Im paying now instead Im paying later Thats credit Insurance is different than credit Insurance guarantees you an upfront lockedin payment and you wont have to pay any more than that even if you incur much great expensesAnd in every other market that I know of for insurance we let people basically make the decision whether they are relatively risk averse whether they are relatively nonrisk averse and they can make the judgment based on JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR But we dont in car insurance meaning we tell people buy car  not we the states do although youre going to  Ill ask you the question do you think that if some states decided not to impose an insurance requirement that the Federal Government would be without power to legislate and require every individual to buy car insuranceMR CLEMENT Well Justice Sotomayor let me say this which is to say  youre right in the first point to say that its the states that do it which makes it different right there But its also JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Well that goes back to the substantive due process question Is this a Lochner era argument that only the states can do this even though it affects commerce Cars indisputably affect commerce So are you arguing that because the states have done it all along the Federal Government is no longer permitted to legislate in this areaMR CLEMENT No I think you might make a different argument about cars than you would make about health insurance unless you tried to say  but you know were JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Health insurance  I mean Ive never gotten into an accident thankfully and I hope never The vast majority of people have never gotten into an accident where they have injured others yet we pay for it dutifully every year on the possibility that at some point we might get into that accidentMR CLEMENT But Justice Sotomayor what I think is different is there is lots of people in Manhattan for example that dont have car insurance because they dont have cars And so they have the option of withdrawing from that market Its not a direct imposition from the governmentSo even the car market is difference from this market where there is no way to get outside of the regulatory web And thats I think one of the real problems with this because I mean we take as a given JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR But youre  but the given is that virtually everyone absent some intervention from above meaning that someones life will be cut short in a fatal way virtually everyone will use health careMR CLEMENT At some point thats right but all sorts of people will not say use health care in the next year which is the relevant period for the insuranceJUSTICE BREYER But do you think you can better than the actuaries or better than the members of Congress who worked on it look at the 40 million people who are not insured and say which ones next year will or will not use say emergency careCan you do that any better than if we knew that 40 million people were suffering about to suffer a contagious disease and only 10 million would get sick MR CLEMENT Of course not JUSTICE BREYER  and we dont know whichMR CLEMENT Of course not Justice Breyer but the point is that once Congress decides its going to regulate extant commerce it is going to get all sorts of latitude to make the right judgments about actuarial predictions which actuarial to rely on which one not to rely onThe question thats a proper question for this Court though is whether or not for the first time ever in our history Congress also has the power to compel people into commerce because it turns out that would be a very efficient things for purposes of Congress optimal regulation of that marketJUSTICE KAGAN But Mr Clement this goes back to the Chief Justices question But of course the theory behind not just the governments case but the theory behind this law is that people are in this market right now and they are in this market because people do get sick and because when people get sick we provide them with care without making them payAnd it that would be different you know if you were up here saying I represent a class of Christian scientists Then you might be able to say look you know why are they bothering me But absent that youre in this market Youre an economic actorMR CLEMENT Well Justice Kagan once again it depends on which market were talking about If were talking about the health care insurance market JUSTICE KAGAN Well we are talking about the health insurance market which is designed to access the health care marketMR CLEMENT And with respect to the health insurance market thats designed to have payment in the health care market everybody is not in the market And thats the premise of the statute and thats the problem Congress is trying to solveAnd if it tried to solve it through incentives we wouldnt be here but its trying to solve it in a way that nobody has ever tried to solve an economic problem before which is saying you know it would be so much more efficient if you were just in this market JUSTICE KENNEDY But they are in the market in the sense that they are creating a risk that the market must account forMR CLEMENT Well Justice Kennedy I dont think thats right certainly in any way that distinguishes this from any other context When Im sitting in my house deciding Im not to buy a car I am causing the labor market in Detroit to go south I am causing maybe somebody to lose their job and for everybody to have to pay for it under welfare So the cost shifting that the government tries to uniquely to associate with this market it is everywhereAnd even more to the point the rationale that they think ultimately supports this legislation that look its an economic decision once you make the economic decision we aggregate the decision there is a substantial effect on commerce That argument works here It works in every single industryJUSTICE BREYER Of course we do know that there are a few people more in New York City than there are in Wyoming who never will buy a car But we also know here and we dont like to admit it that because we are human beings we all suffer from the risk of getting sick And we also all know that well get seriously sick And we also know that we cant predict when And we also know that when we do there will be our fellow taxpayers through the Federal Government who will pay for this If we do not buy insurance we will pay nothing And that happens with a large number of people in this group of 40 million none of whom can be picked out in advanceNow thats quite different from a car situation and its different in only this respect It shows there is a national problem and it shows there is a national problem that involves money cost insuranceSo if Congress could do this should there be a disease that strikes the United States and they want every one inoculated even though ten million will be hurt its hard for me to decide why that isnt interstate commerce even more so where we know it affects everybodyMR CLEMENT Well Justice Breyer there are other markets that affect every one transportation food burial services though we dont like to talk about that either There also are situations where there are many economic effects from somebodys failure to purchase a productAnd if I could if I could talk about the difference between the health insurance market and the health care market I mean ultimately I dont want you to leave here with the impression that anything turns on that Because if the government decided tomorrow that they would come up with a great  some of these  some private companies come up with a great new wonder drug that would be great for everybody to take would have huge health benefits for everybody and by the way also if everybody had to buy it it would facilitate economies of scale and the production would be great and the price would be cheaper and force everybody in the health care market the actual health care market to buy the wonder drug Id be up here making the same argument I would be saying thats not a power thats within the commerce power of the Federal Government It is something much greater And it would have been much more controversial Thats why the important things In Federalist 45 Madison says the commerce power Thats a new power but its not one anyone has any apprehension aboutThe reason they didnt have any apprehension about it is because its a power that only operated once people were already in commerce You see that from the text of the clause The first kind of commerce Congress gets to regulate is commerce with foreign nations Did anybody think the fledgling Republic had the power to compel some other nation into commerce with us Of course not And in the same way I think if the framers had understood the commerce power to include the power to compel people to engage in commerce JUSTICE KAGAN Well once again though whos in commerce and what are they in commerceIf the effect of all these uninsured people is to raise everybodys premiums not just when they get sick if they get sick but right now in the aggregate and Wickard and Raich tell us we should look at the aggregate and the aggregate of all these uninsured people are increasing the normal family premium Congress says by a thousand dollars a year Those people are in commerce They are making decisions that are affecting the price that everybody pays for this serviceMR CLEMENT Justice Kagan again with all due respect I dont think thats a limiting principle My unwillingness to buy an electric car is forcing up the price of an electric car If only more people demanded an electric car there would be economies of scale and the price would go downJUSTICE KAGAN Not necessarily Mr Clement And its different because of the nature of the health care service that you are entitled to health care when you go to an emergency room when you go to a doctor even if you cant pay for it So the difference between your hypotheticals and the real case is the problem of uncompensated care which MR CLEMENT Justice Kagan first of all I do think there  this is not the only place where theres uncompensated care If some  if I dont buy a car and somebody goes on welfare Im going to end up paying for that as wellBut let me also say that there is a real disconnect then between that focus on what makes this different and statute that Congresses passed If all we were concerned about is the cost sharing that took place because of uncompensated care in emergency rooms presumably we have before us a statute that only addressed emergency care and catastrophic insurance coverage But it covers everything soup to nuts and all sorts of other thingsAnd that gets at the idea that there is two kinds of cost shifting that are going on here One is the concern about emergency care and that somehow somebody who gets sick is going to shift costs back to other policy areas  holders But there is a much bigger cost shifting going on here and thats the cost shifting that goes on when you force healthy people into an insurance market precisely because they are healthy precisely because they are not likely to go to the emergency room precisely because they are not likely to use the insurance they are forced to buy in the health care insurance That creates a huge windfall It lowers the price of premiumsAnd again this is not just some lawyer up here telling you thats what it does and trying to secondguess the congressional economic decisions This is Congresss findings findings I on page 43 A of the appendix to the governments JUSTICE BREYER All that sounds like youre debating the merits of the bill You ask really for limiting principles so we dont get into a matter that I think has nothing to do with this case broccoli okayAnd the limiting principles youve heard three First the Solicitor General came up with a couple joined very narrow ones Youve seen in Lopez this Court say that we cannot Congress cannot get into purely local affairs particularly where they are noncommercial And of course the greatest limiting principle of all which not too many accept so Im not going to emphasize that is the limiting principle derived from the fact that members of Congress are elected from States and that 95 percent of the law of the United States is State law That is a principle though enforced by the legislatureThe other two are principles one written into Lopez and one you just heard It seems to me all of those eliminate the broccoli possibility and none of them eliminates the possibility that we are trying to take the 40 million people who do have the medical cost who do affect interstate commerce and provide a system that you may like or not likeThats where we are in limiting principlesMR CLEMENT Well Justice Breyer let me take them in turn I would encourage this Court not to Garciaize the Commerce Clause and just simply say its up to Congress to police the Commerce Clause So I dont think that is a limiting principleSecond of all JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Yes but thats exactly what Justice Marshall said in Gibbons He said that it is the power to regulate the power like all others vested in Congress is complete in itself may be exercised to its utmost extent and acknowledges no limitations other than those prescribed in the Constitution But there is no conscription in the set forth in the Constitution with respect to regulating commerceMR CLEMENT I agree 100 percent and I think that was the Chief Justices point which was once you open the door to compelling people into commerce based on the narrow rationales that exist in this industry you are not going to be able to stop that processJUSTICE SCALIA I would like hear you address Justice Breyers other other two principlesMR CLEMENT Well the other two principles are Lopez  and this case really is not  I mean you know Lopez is a limit on the affirmative exercise of people who are already in commerce The question is is there any other limit to people who arent in commerce And so I think this is the case that really asks that questionAnd then the first point which was I take it to be the Solicitor Generals point is with all due respect simply a description of the insurance market Its not a limiting principle because the justification for why this is a valid regulation of commerce is in no way limited to this market It simply says these are economic decisions they have effect on other people my failure to purchase in this market has a direct effect on others who are already in the market Thats true of virtually every other market under the sunCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS And now maybe return to Justice Sotomayors questionMR CLEMENT Id be delighted to which is  I mean I  you are absolutely right Once youre in the commerce power there is not  this Court is not going to police that subject maybe to the Lopez limit And thats exactly why I think its very important for this Court to think seriously about taking an unprecedented step of saying that the commerce power not only includes the power to regulate prescribe the rule by which commerce is governed the rule of Gibbons v Ogden But to go further and say its not just prescribing the rule for commerce that exists but is the power to compel people to enter into commerce in the first placeI would like to say two very brief things about the taxing power if I could There are lots of reasons why this isnt a tax It wasnt denominated a tax Its not structured as a tax If its any tax at all though it is a direct tax Article I Section 9 clause 4 the Framers would have had no doubt that a tax on not having something is not an excise tax but a forbidden direct tax Thats one more reason why this is not proper legislation because it violates thatThe second thing is I would urge you to read the License Tax case which the Solicitor General says is his best case for why you ignore the fact that a tax is denominated into something other Because that is a case where the argument was that because the Federal government had passed a license not a tax that somehow that allowed people to take actions that would have been unlawful under State law that this was some special Federal license to do something that was forbidden by State law This Court looked beyond the label in order to preserve federalism there What the Solicitor General and the government ask you to do here is exactly the opposite which is to look past labels in order to upend our basic federalist system In this JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Would you tell me do you think the States could pass this mandateMR CLEMENT I represent 26 States I do think the States could pass this mandate but I JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Is there any other area of commerce business where we have held that there is a concurrent power between the State and the Federal Government to protect the welfare of commerceMR CLEMENT Well Justice Sotomayor I have to resist your premise because I didnt answer yes the States can do it because it would be a valid regulation of intrastate commerce I said yes the States can do it because they have a police power and that is the fundamental difference between the States on the one hand and the limited enumerated Federal Government on the otherCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Thank you Mr Clement Mr CarvinORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A CARVIN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS NFIB ET AL MR CARVIN Thank you Mr Chief Justice may it please the CourtId like to begin with the Solicitor Generals main premise which is that they can compel the purchase of health insurance in order to promote commerce in the health market because it will reduce uncompensated care If you accept that argument you have to fundamentally alter the text of the Constitution and give Congress plenary powerIt simply doesnt matter whether or not this regulation will promote health care commerce by reducing uncompensated care all that matters is whether the activity actually being regulated by the act negatively affects Congress or negatively affects commerce regulation so that its within the commerce power If you agree with us that this is  exceeds commerce power the law doesnt somehow become redeemed because it has beneficial policy effects in the health care marketIn other words Congress does not have the power to promote commerce Congress has  Congress has the power to regulate commerce And if the power exceeds their permissible regulatory authority then the law is invalidCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Well surely MR CARVIN Im sorryCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Well surely regulation includes the power to promote Since the New Deal weve said that regulation in  there is a market agricultural products Congress has the power to subsidize to limit production all sorts of thingsMR CARVIN Absolutely Chief Justice and thats the distinction Im trying to draw When they are acting within their enumerated power then obviously they are promoting commerce but the Solicitor General wants to turn it into a different power He wants to say we have the power to promote commerce to regulate anything to promote commerce and if they have the power to promote commerce then they have the power to regulate everything right Because CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS I dont  I dont think youre addressing their main point which is that they are not creating commerce in  in health care Its already there and we are all going to need some kind of health care most of us will at some pointMR CARVIN Id  Id like to address that in two ways if I could Mr Chief Justice In the first place they keep playing mix and match with the statistics They say 95 percent of us are in the health care market okay But thats not the relevant statistic even from  as the government frames the issue No one in Congress and the Solicitor General is arguing that going to the doctor and fully paying him creates a problem The problem is uncompensated care and they say the uncompensated care arises if you have some kind of catastrophe  hit by a bus have some prolonged illness Well what is the percentage of the uninsured that have those sorts of catastrophes We know it has got to be a relative small fraction So in other words the relevant CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Yet we dont know who they areMR CARVIN We dont No and we dont know in advance and  and but that doesnt change the basic principle that you are nonetheless forcing people for paternalistic reasons to go into the insurance market to ensure against risk that they have made the voluntary decision that they are not  have decided not to But even JUSTICE GINSBURG But the problem is  the problem is this they are making the reinvent of us pay for it because as much as they say well we are not in the market we dont know when the  the timing when they will beMR CARVIN Which is JUSTICE GINSBURG And the  the figures that how much more families are paying for insurance because people get sick they may have intended to selfinsure they havent been able to meet the bill for  for cancer and the rest of us end up paying because these people are getting costfree health care and the only way to prevent that is to have them pay sooner rather than later pay up frontMR CARVIN Yes but my point is this That with respect Justice Ginsburg conflicts the people who do result in uncompensated care the free riders Those are people who default on their health care payments That is an entirely different group of people an entirely different activity than being uninsuredSo the question is whether or not you can regulate activity because it has a statistical connection to an activity that harms Congress And my basic point to you is this the Constitution only gives Congress the power to regulate things that negatively affect commerce or commerce regulation It doesnt give them the power to regulate things that are statistically connected to things that negatively affect the commerce JUSTICE KAGAN Well Mr Carvin MR CARVIN Because  Im sorryJUSTICE KAGAN PleaseMR CARVIN I was just going to say because if they have that power then they obviously have the power to regulate everything because everything in the aggregate is statistically connected to something that negatively affects commerce and every compelled purchase promotes commerceJUSTICE BREYER In your view right there  in your view right there MR CARVIN Justice Breyer JUSTICE BREYER Can I just MR CARVIN Im sorryJUSTICE BREYER Im just picking on something Id like to just  if it turned out there was some terrible epidemic sweeping the United States and we couldnt say that more than 40 or 50 percent  I can make the number as high as I want  but the  the  youd say the Federal Government doesnt have the power to get people inoculated to require them to be inoculated because thats just statisticalMR CARVIN Well in all candor I think Morrison must have decided that issue right Because people who commit violence against JUSTICE BREYER Is your answer to that yes or noMR CARVIN Oh Im sorry my answer is no they couldnt do it because Morrison JUSTICE BREYER No they could not do itMR CARVIN YesJUSTICE BREYER They cannot require people even if this disease is sweeping the country to be inoculated The Federal Government has no power and if theres  okay fine Go aheadMR CARVIN May JUSTICE BREYER Please turn to Justice KaganMR CARVIN May I just please explain whyJUSTICE BREYER YesMR CARVIN Violence against women obviously creates the same negative impression on fellow citizens as this communicable disease but the and it has huge effects on the health care of our country Congress found that it increased health care costs by JUSTICE BREYER I agree with you that MR CARVIN Well but JUSTICE BREYER  that it had huge negative effects but the majority thought that was a local matterJUSTICE SCALIA I think thats his point LaughterMR CARVIN I  I dont know why having a disease is any more local than  that beating up a woman But  but  my basic point is is that notwithstanding its very profound effect on the health care market this Court said the activity being regulated ie violence against women is outside the Commerce Clause power So regardless of whether it has beneficial downstream effects we must say no Congress doesnt have that power Why not Because everything has downstream effects on commerce and every compelled purchase promotes commerce It by definition helps the sellers of existing JUSTICE ALITO Mr Carvin isnt there this difference between Justice Breyers hypothetical and the law that we have before us here In his hypothetical harm to other people from the communicable disease is the result of the disease It is not the result of something that the government has done whereas here the reason why there is cost shifting is because the government has mandated that It has required hospitals to provide emergency treatment and instead of paying for that through a tax which would be born by everybody it has required  it has set up a system in which the cost is surreptitiously shifted to people who have health insurance and who pay their bills when they go to the hospitalMR CLEMENT Justice Alito that is exactly the governments argument Its an extraordinarily illogical argumentJUSTICE BREYER Fine Then if thats so is  let me just change my example under pressure LaughterJUSTICE BREYER  and say that in fact it turns out that 90 percent of all automobiles driving interstate without certain equipment put up pollution which travels interstate  not 100 percent maybe only 60 percent Does the EPA have the power then to say youve got to have an antipollution device Its statisticalMR CARVIN What they cant do  yes if you have a car they can require you to have an antipollution JUSTICE BREYER Then youre not going on statistics youre going on something else which is what Id like to know what it isMR CARVIN Its this They cant require you to buy a car with an antipollution device Once youve entered the market and made a decision they can regulate the terms and conditions of the car that you do and they can do it for all sorts of reasons What they cant do it compel you to enter the marketJUSTICE BREYER Now we  now youve changed the ground of argument which I accept as  as totally legitimate And then the question is when you are born and you dont have insurance and you will in fact get sick and you will in fact impose costs have you perhaps involuntarily  perhaps simply because you are a human being  entered this particular market which is a market for health careMR CARVIN If being born is entering the market then I cant think of a more plenary power Congress can have because that literally means they can regulate every human activity from cradle to grave thought thats what distinguished the plenary police power from the very limited commerce powerI dont disagree that giving the Congress plenary power to mandate property transfers from A to B would be a very efficient way of helping B and of accomplishing Congresss objectives But the framers JUSTICE BREYER I see the point You can go back to go back to Justice Kagan Dont forget her questionJUSTICE KAGAN Ive forgotten my questionLaughterMR CARVIN I  I was facing the same dilemma Justice KaganJUSTICE GINSBURG Let me  let me ask a question I asked Mr Clement It just seems JUSTICE KAGAN See what it means to be the junior justiceLaughterJUSTICE GINSBURG It just seems very strange to me that theres no question we can have a Social Security system besides all the people who say Im being forced to pay for something I dont want And this it seems to me to try to get care for the ones who need it by having everyone in the pool but is also trying to preserve a role for the private sector for the private insurers Theres something very odd about that that the government can take over the whole thing and we all say oh yes thats fine but if the government wants to get  to preserve private insurers it cant do thatMR CARVIN Well I dont think the test of a laws constitutionality is whether it more adheres to the libertarian principles of the Cato Institute or the statist principles of someone else I think the test of a laws constitutionality is not those policy questions its whether or not the law is regulating things that negatively affect commerce or dontAnd since obviously the failure to purchase an item doesnt create the kind of effects on supply and demand that the market participants in Wickard and Raich did and doesnt in any way interfere with regulation of the insurance companies I dont think it can pass the basic JUSTICE GINSBURG I thought  I thought that Wickard was you must buy we are not going to let you use the homegrown wheat You have got to go out in the market and buy that wheat that you dont wantMR CARVIN Oh but lets be careful about what they were regulating in Wickard Justice Ginsburg What they were regulating was the supply of wheat It didnt in any way imply that they could require every American to go out and buy wheat And yes one of the consequences of regulating local market participants is itll affect the supply and the demand for the product Thats why you can regulate them because those local market participants have the same effect on the interstate market that a black market has on a legal marketBut none of that is true  in other words you can regulate local bootleggers but that doesnt suggest you can regulate teetotalers people who stay out of the liquor market because they dont have any negative effect on the existing market participants or on regulation of those market participantsJUSTICE KAGAN Thats why I suggested Mr Carvin that it might be different if you were raising an asapplied challenge and presenting a class of people whom you could say clearly would not be in the health care market But youre raising a facial challenge and we cant really know which which of the many many people that this law addresses in fact will not participate in the health care market and in fact will not impose costs on all the rest of usSo the question is can Congress respond to those facts that we have no crystal ball that we cant tell who is and isnt going to be in the health insurance market and say most of these people will be and most of these people will thereby impose costs on the rest of us and thats a problem that we can deal with on a classwide basisMR CARVIN No again The people who impose the costs on the rest of us are people who engage in a different activity at a different time which is defaulting on their health care payments Its not the uninsured Under your theory you could regulate anybody if they have got a statistical connection to a problem You could say since we could regulate people who enter into the mortgage market and impose mortgage insurance on them we can simply impose the requirement to buy private mortgage insurance on everybody before they have entered the market because we are doing it in this prophylactic way before it developsCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS No no thats not  I dont think thats fair because not everybody is going to enter the mortgage market The governments position is that almost everybody is going to enter the health care marketMR CARVIN Two points one of which Mr Clements already made which is the health insurance market is different than the health care market But let me take it on fullstride I think everybody is in the milk market I think everybody is in the wheat product market But that doesnt suggest that the government compel you to buy five gallons of meat or five bushels of wheat because they are not regulating commerceWhether youre a market participant or not they are still requiring you to make a purchase that you dont want to do and to get back to your facial example JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR I mean but thats true of almost every productMR CARVIN Ive sorryJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Its true of almost every product directly or indirectly by government regulation The government says borrowing my colleagues example you cant buy a car without emission control I dont want a car with emission control Its less efficient in terms of the horsepower But Im forced to do something I dont want to do by government regulationMR CARVIN You are not forced to buy a product you dont want And I agree with you that since the government regulates all markets there is no limiting principle on their compelled purchase When they put these environmental controls on the JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR They force me to buy MR CARVIN Im sorryJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR They forced me to buy if I need unpasteurized foods goods that dont have certain pesticides but have others There is government compulsion in almost every economic decision because the government regulates so much Its a condition of life that some may rail against but MR CARVIN Lets think about it this way Yes when youve entered the marketplace they can impose all sorts of restrictions on you and they can impose for example all kinds of restrictions on States after they have enacted laws They can wipe out the laws They can condition themBut what cant they do They cant compel States to enact laws They cant compel States to carry out Federal law And I am arguing for precisely the same distinction because everyone intuitively understands that regulating participants after A and B have entered into a contract is fundamentally less intrusive than requiring the contractJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR We let the government regulate the manufacturing process whether or not the goods will enter into interstate commerce merely because they might statistically We  there is all sorts of government regulation of manufacturing plants of agricultural farms of all sorts of activity that will be purely intrastate because it might affect interstate activityMR CARVIN I fully agree with you Justice Sotomayor But I think JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR So how is that different from saying you are selfinsuring today youre foregoing insurance Why isnt that a predecessor to the need that youre eventually going to haveMR CARVIN The cases you referred to I think effectively eliminated the distinction between participants in the intrastate market visvis participants in the interstate market None of those cases suggest that you can regulate people who are outside of the market on both an intrastate and interstate level by compelling them to enter into the market And that JUSTICE BREYER What about  the simplest counterexample for me to suggest is youve undoubtedly read Judge Suttons concurring opinion He has about two pages it seemed to me of examples where everyone accepts the facts that under these kinds of regulations the government can compel people to buy things they dont otherwise want to buyFor example he gives even in that farm case the farmer who was being forced to go out and buy grain to feed to his animals because he couldnt raise it at home You know and he goes through one example after another So what  what is your response to that which youve readMR CARVIN Judge Sutton is wrong in each and every example There was no  there was no compulsion in Raich for him to buy wheat He could have gotten wheat substitutes or he could have not sold wheat which is actually what he was doing There is a huge difference between conditioning regulation ie conditioning access to the health care market and saying you must buy a product and forcing you to buy a product And that that  Im sorryJUSTICE GINSBURG I thought it was common ground that the requirement that the insurers  what was it the communitybased one and they have to insure you despite your health status they cant refuse because of preexisting conditions The government tells us and the Congress determined that those two wont work unless you have a pool that will include the people who are now healthy But so  well first do you agree with your colleague that the communitybased  and whats the name that they give to the otherMR CARVIN The guaranteedissueJUSTICE GINSBURG Yes That that is legitimate Commerce Clause legislationMR CARVIN Oh sure And thats why but we dont in any way impede that sort of regulation These nondiscrimination regulations will apply to every insurance company just as Congress intended whether or not we buy insuranceJUSTICE GINSBURG Well then what about the determination that they cant possibly work if people dont have to buy insurance until they are  their health status is such that the insurance company just dealt with them on its  as it will I wont insure you because youre  youre already sickMR CARVIN It depends what you mean by work Itll work just fine in ensuring that no sick people are discriminated against What  what  but when you do that  Congress JUSTICE GINSBURG But the sick people why would they insure early if they had to be protected if they get insurance lateMR CARVIN Yes Well thats  this is the governments very illogical argument They seem to be saying look we couldnt just force people to buy insurance to lower health insurance premiums That would be no good But we can do it because weve created the problem We Congress have driven up the health insurance premiums and since weve created that problem this somehow gives us authority that we wouldnt otherwise have That cant possibly be right That would JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Do you think that theres  what percentage of the American people who took their son or daughter to an emergency room and that child was turned away because the parent didnt have insurance  do you think theres a large percentage of the American population who would stand for the death of that child MR CARVIN One of the most JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR They had an allergic reaction and a simple shot would have saved the childMR CARVIN One of the more pernicious misleading impressions that the government has made is that we are somehow advocating that people be  could get thrown out of emergency rooms or that this alternative that theyve hypothesized is going to be enforced by throwing people out of emergency rooms This alternative ie conditioned access to health care on buying health insurance is enforced in precisely the same way that the Act does You either buy health insurance or you pay a penalty of 695 You dont have doctors throwing people out on the street And  and so the only JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Im sorry did you say the penaltys okay but not the mandate Im sorry Maybe Ive misheard youMR CARVIN No No I was  they create this strawman that says look the only alternative to doing it the way weve done it if we condition access to health care on buying health insurance the only way you can enforce that is making sick people not get careIm saying no no Theres a perfectly legitimate way they could enforce their alternative ie requiring you to buy health insurance when you access health care which is the same penalty structure thats in the ActThere is no moral dilemma between having people have insurance and denying them emergency service Congress has made a perfectly legitimate value judgment that they want to make sure that people get emergency care Since the founding whenever Congress has imposed that public responsibility on private actors it has subsidized it from the Federal Treasury It has not conscripted a subset of the citizenry and made them subsidize the actors who are being hurt which is what theyre doing hereTheyre making young healthy people subsidize insurance premiums for the cost that the nondiscrimination provisions have put on insurance premiums and insurance companiesJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR So the MR CARVIN  and that  that is the fundamental problem hereJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR So the  I  I want to understand the choices youre saying Congress has Congress can tax everybody and set up a public health care systemMR CARVIN YesJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR That would be okayMR CARVIN Yes Tax power is JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR OkayMR CARVIN I would accept thatJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Congress can  youre taking the same position as your colleague Congress cant say were going to set up a public health system but you can get a tax credit if you have private health insurance because you wont access the public systemAre you taking the same position as your colleagueMR CARVIN There may have been some confusion in prior colloquy I fully agree with my brother Clement that a direct tax would be unconstitutional I dont think he means to suggest nor do I that a tax credit that incentivizes you to buy insurance creates problems Congress incentivizes all kinds of activities If they gave us a tax credit for buying insurance then it would be our choice whether or not that makes economic sense even though JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR So how is this different than this Act which says if a taxpayer fails to meet the requirement of having minimum coverage then they are responsible for paying the shared responsibility paymentMR CARVIN The difference is that the taxpayer is not given a choice Its the difference between banning cigarettes and saying Im going to enforce that legal ban through a 5 a pack penalty and saying look if you want to sell cigarettes fine Im going to charge you a tax of 5 a pack And thats JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR I think  I think thats whats happening isnt itMR CARVIN No Not JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Were paying  I thought that everybody was paying what is it 10 a pack now I dont even know the price Its pretty highMR CARVIN Right And everyone understands JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR I think everybody recognizes that its all taxation for the purposes of dissuading you to buy itMR CARVIN Thats precisely my point And everyone intuitively understands that that system is dramatically different than saying cigarettes tomorrow are illegal It is differentJUSTICE BREYER It is different It is different I agree with that But you pointed out and I agree with you on this that the government set up these emergency room laws The government set up Medicaid The government set up Medicare The government set up CHIP and there are 40 million people who dont have the private insurance In that world the government has set up commerce Its all over the United States And in that world of course the decision by the 40 million not to buy the insurance affects that commerce and substantially soSo I thought the issue here is not whether its a violation of some basic right or something to make people buy things they dont want but simply whether those decisions of that group of 40 million people substantially affect the interstate commerce that has been set up in part through these other programsSo thats the part of your argument Im not hearingMR CARVIN Let me JUSTICE BREYER PleaseMR CARVIN It is clear that the failure to buy health insurance doesnt affect anyone Defaulting on your payments to your health care provider does Congress chose for whatever reason not to regulate the harmful activity of defaulting on your health care provider They used the 20 percent or whoever among the uninsured as a leverage to regulate the 100 percent of the uninsuredJUSTICE KENNEDY I agree  I agree that thats whats happening hereMR CARVIN OkayJUSTICE KENNEDY And the government tells us thats because the insurance market is unique And in the next case itll say the next market is unique But I think it is true that if most questions in life are matters of degree in the insurance and health care world both markets  stipulate two markets  the young person who is uninsured is uniquely proximately very close to affecting the rates of insurance and the costs of providing medical care in a way that is not true in other industriesThats my concern in the caseMR CARVIN And Your  I may be misunderstanding you Justice Kennedy I hope Im notSure It would be perfectly fine if they allowed  you do actuarial risk for young people on the basis of their risk for disease just like you judge flood insurance on the homeowners risk of flood One of the issues here is not only that theyre compelling us to enter into the marketplace theyre not  theyre prohibiting us from buying the only economically sensible product that we would want Catastrophic insuranceEveryone agrees the only potential problem that a 30yearold as he goes from the healthy 70 percent of the population to the unhealthy 5 percent And yet Congress prohibits anyone over 30 from buying any kind of catastrophic health insurance And the reason they do that is because they needed this massive subsidyJustice Alito its not our numbers CBO said that injecting my clients into the risk pool lowers premiums by 15 to 20 percent So Justice Kennedy even if we were going to create exceptions for people that are outside of commerce and inside of commerce surely wed make Congress do a closer nexus and say look were really addressing this problem We want these 30yearolds to get catastrophic health insuranceAnd not only did they  they deprived them of that option And I think that illustrates the dangers of giving Congress these plenary powers because they can always leverage them They can always come up with some public policy rationale that converts the power to regulate commerce into the power to promote commerce which as I was saying before is the one that I think is plenaryJUSTICE KAGAN Mr Carvin a large part of this argument has concerned the question of whether certain kinds of people are active participants in a market or not active participants in a market In your test which is a test that focuses on this activityinactivity distinction would force one to confront that problem all the timeNow if you look over the history of the Commerce Clause what you see is that there were sort of unhappy periods when the Court used tests like this direct versus indirect commerce versus manufacturing I think most people would say that those things didnt really work And the question is why should this test inactive versus active work any betterMR CARVIN The problem you identify is exactly the problem you would create if you bought the governments bogus limiting principles Youd have to draw distinctions between the insurance industry and the car industry and all of thatWe turn you to the Commerce Clause jurisprudence that bedeviled the Court before the 1930s where they were drawing all these kinds of distinctions among industries whereas our test is really very simple Are you buying the product or is Congress compelling you to buy the product I cant think of a brighter lineAnd again if Congress has the power to compel you to buy this product then obviously they have got the power to provide you  to compel you to buy any product because any purchase is going to benefit commerce and this Court is never going to secondguess Congresss policy judgments on how important it is this product versus that productJUSTICE ALITO Do you think they are drawing a line between commerce and everything else that is not commerce is drawing an artificial line drawing a line between Congress and manufacturingMR CARVIN The words inactivity and activity are not in the Constitution The words commerce and noncommerce are And again its a distinction that comes Justice Kagan directly from the text of the ConstitutionThe Framers consciously gave Congress the ability to regulate commerce because thats not a particularly threatening activity that deprives you of individual freedom If you were required if you were authorized to require A to transfer property to B you have as the early cases put it a monster in legislation which is against all reason in justice because everyone intuitively understands that regulating people who voluntarily enter into contracts in setting changing conditions does not create the possibility of Congress compelling wealth transfers among the citizenry And that is precisely why the Framers denied them the power to compel commerce and precisely why they didnt give them plenary powerCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Thank you Mr Carvin General Verrilli you have four minutes remainingREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B VERRILLI JR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS GENERAL VERRILLI Thank you Mr Chief JusticeCongress confronted a grave problem when it enacted the Affordable Care Act The 40 million Americans who cant get health insurance and suffered often very terrible consequences Now we agree I think  everyone arguing this case agrees that Congress could remedy that problem by imposing the insurance requirement at the point of saleThat wont work The reason it wont work is because people will still show up at the hospital or at their physicians office seeking care without insurance causing the cost shifting problem And Mr Clements suggestion that they can be signed up for a high risk pool at that point is utterly unrealisticThink about how much it would cost to get the insurance when you are at the hospital or at the doctor It would be  it would be unfathomably high that will never work Congress understood that It chose a means that will work The means that it saw work in the States and in the State of Massachusetts and that and that it had every reason to think would work on a national basisThat is the kind of choice of means that McCulloch says that the Constitution leaves to the democratically accountable branches of government There is no temporal limitation in the Commerce Clause Everyone subject to this regulation is in or will be in the health care market They are just being regulated in advance Thats exactly the kind of thing that ought to be left to the judgment of Congress and the democratically accountable branches of governmentAnd I think this is actually a paradigm example of the kind of situation that Chief Justice Marshall envisioned in McCulloch itself that the provisions of the Constitution needed to be interpreted in a manner that would allow them to be effective in addressing the great crises of human affairs that the Framers could not even envisionBut if there is any doubt about that under the Commerce Clause then I urge this Court to uphold the minimum coverage provision as an exercise of the taxing powerUnder New York v United States this is precisely a parallel situation If the Court thinks there is any doubt about the ability of Congress to impose the requirement in 5000Aa it can be treated as simply the predicate to which the tax incentive of 5000Ab seeks accomplishment And the Court  as the Court said in New York has a solemn obligation to respect the judgments of the democratically accountable branches of government and because this statute can be construed in a manner that allows it to be upheld in that way I respectfully submit that it is this Courts duty to do soCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Thank you GeneralCounsel well see you tomorrow Copyright 2014 NPR,"Thu, 28 Jun

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/03/20/148538071/do-juvenile-killers-deserve-life-behind-bars?ft=3&f=,The US Supreme Court hears arguments Tuesday in two  homicide cases testing whether it is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual  punishment to sentence a 14yearold to life in prison without the possibility  of parole There are currently 79 of these juvenile killers who  will die in prison  Whats more in many states the penalty is mandatory  meaning neither judge nor jury is allowed to consider the youngsters age or  background in meting out the sentence In cases dealing with punishment for juveniles context  is everything  In 2005 the Supreme Court struck down the death penalty for  juveniles declaring that kids are different from adults The court said that  because of their youth their brains are literally less developed they are more  impulsive more subject to peer pressure and less able to see the consequences  of their acts Two years ago the court used the same rationale when it  struck down the penalty of life without parole for nonhomicide crimes committed  by juveniles  But in Tuesdays cases the court faces the question of life  without parole in homicide cases A case from Arkansas involves a teenager who was not the  triggerman  Fourteenyearold Kuntrell Jackson and two other kids held up a   video rental store  One of the other boys pointed a sawedoff shotgun at  the cashier and when she threatened to call the police shot and killed her   Under Arkansas felonymurder law Jackson was deemed just as  responsible as the triggerman He was tried as an adult for aggravated murder  and under state law received a mandatory sentence of life without parole The other case from Alabama involves Evan Miller a boy so  brutalized as a child that by the time he was arrested for murder at age 14 he  had tried to kill himself six times the first time when he was 5 years old  Miller and a 16yearold friend went nextdoor to the  home of a neighbor who was dealing drugs to Millers mother The neighbor  52yearold Cole Cannon gave the boys liquor and marijuana Miller consumed a  fifth of whiskey as the boys engaged in drinking games with Cannon and planned  to steal his wallet Eventually a fight broke out and the boys severely beat Cannon set fires in the trailer and fled ignoring  Cannons pleas for help  Cannon died of smoke inhalation The  16yearold friend made a deal with prosecutors in exchange for his  testimony and got life with parole eligibility  Fourteenyearold Miller got life without parole Bryan Stevenson the lawyer who represents the boys in both of these cases  will make two basic arguments before the Supreme Court  The first is that a  mandatory punishment of life without parole for a 14yearold is cruel and  unusual punishment because the defendants age and background are irrelevant and  cannot mitigate punishment Judges cant consider it Juries cant consider it No  one can consider it says Stevenson The states counter that the juveniles age has already  been considered by taking the death penalty off the  table If the defendant is not going to get the death penalty  then at the very least the defendant ought to get life without parole to counterbalance the harm he has  inflicted says Alabama Solicitor General John  Neiman But the big question before the Supreme Court on Tuesday is  whether life without the possibility of parole is itself an unconstitutionally  cruel and unusual punishment when it is applied to  juveniles Defense lawyer Stevenson  notes that the American legal system treats minors as both less culpable and  less responsible  Fourteenyearolds for instance are not allowed to drink  to marry to vote to serve on juries or even to drive Were not saying that juvenile offenders who commit  homicide cant be punished severely Stevenson says They may even end up  spending the rest of their lives in prison But its premature excessive and  unfair to say we know  this juvenile will never be rehabilitated Indeed a brief filed by the Council of  Juvenile Correctional Administrators and other juvenile crime experts points to  many amazing cases of rehabilitation Among them is 16yearold Scott  Filippi who shot his mother but after his release joined the Army and became a  member of the Presidential Honor Guard Or there is Raphael Johnson who shot  and killed a classmate when he was 17 but  after his release got bachelors and masters degrees with  honors and started a community policing program in Detroit  Or there is  Lawrence Wu a 15yearold New  York gang member who eventually became the  editorinchief of the Columbia Law Review One of the most famous of those who have changed their  lives is awardwinning actorproducer Charles Dutton By age 12 he had quit  school and was living a life of fights and crime on the streets of Baltimore I liked getting in trouble says Dutton I enjoyed  getting in fights I enjoyed the challenge of  battle By age 17 he was sentenced to prison for  manslaughter Even in prison though he continued his fighting ways assaulting  a guard and getting eight years added to his sentence  A decade or so later he  was on his way to the  hole for solitary confinement when he picked up a book of plays sent to him by a  girlfriend   It ended  up changing his life As he puts it he found what he was born to do Up until that point in time I didnt really  concentrate on the life I had taken he says But only at that moment of  rediscovering my own humanity could I go back and have a very very strong and  sincere heartfelt remorse for taking that life Now four decades later he says he thinks of the man he  killed every day and wonders who he would have been Dutton says he understands the desire to avenge a  terrible crime but theres no sense in destroying a second life if that life  is actually redeemable If theres anyone who still has a modicum of redemption  left in their life its a juvenile The states that have adopted life without parole for  juvenile killers have a very different view The one thing that we dont know is what the potential  of the life would be that was snuffed out in the crime says Arkansas Attorney  General Dustin McDaniel The hypothetical of who might be rehabilitated in  prison is a hard one to analyze but there have to be some circumstances under  which these persons can serve life without parole Indeed Alabama Solicitor General Neiman notes that 38 of the 50 states  authorize life without parole for a 14yearold convicted of murder and the  federal government authorizes it for 15yearolds  Part of the justification  for that he observes is the notion of retribution As a moral matter it is OK for a government to say even if there is a  possibility that someone will rehabilitate themselves if a person commits a  sufficiently egregious crime then they just deserve a very severe sentence  Neiman says Defense lawyer Stevenson counters that in reality only 18 states have imposed life without parole on a 14yearold and only 79  killers who are 14 or younger are currently serving lifewithoutparole  sentences Arkansas Attorney General  McDaniel says that even if those statistics are accurate and he  disputes them it doesnt prove much Its not because society doesnt have the moral stomach  to impose those sentences McDaniel says Its because  realistically 14yearolds dont commit a lot of  murders Finally the states argue that life without parole is a  sufficiently severe sentence that  it  will deter at least some juveniles from committing murder Defense  lawyer Stevenson  dismisses that argument echoing the sentiments of many experts who deal with  violent juveniles Most of my clients had never heard of life imprisonment  without parole and had no capacity to appreciate what it would mean Stevenson  says It takes them years before they even get what it means to be sentenced to  life in prison without parole because theyre just not used to thinking that far  ahead Copyright 2014 NPR,"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 15:18:00 -0400",drugs
NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/03/12/148293470/drones-over-america-what-can-they-see?ft=3&f=,Unmanned aircraft systems or drones have long played a role in military operations But imagine thousands of drones flying over US skies  something we may see in just a few years In February President Obama signed an aviation bill requiring the Federal Aviation Administration to make plans to integrate drones into American airspaceOn Mondays Fresh Air John Villasenor a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a professor of electrical engineering at UCLA explains what these drones will be able to see and how they work He also talks about the privacy and national security concerns raised by using drones for surveillance purposesVillasenor tells Dave Davies that drones which are currently in use over the US border with Mexico have an endless list of nonmilitary uses from providing overhead surveillance for police departments to spotting wildfires and monitoring illegal border crossingsDrones could also be used commercially by real estate firms to get overhead images of a property by surveyors and cinematographers and even by paparazzi trying to fly over celebrity homes says VillasenorThat is going to be certainly some of the tests of what the limits are going to be provided by paparazzi he says The paparazzi will want to use drones if they can and obviously thats going to raise some very significant questionsOne question about drone usage obviously concerns privacy In 1986 the Supreme Court ruled that police officers who used a small singleengine airplane to spot hidden marijuana plants in someones backyard in California did not violate the Fourth Amendment because they were in public navigable airspace in a physically nonintrusive mannerNow if you take that ruling and apply it to a world in which there are hundreds or thousands of drones that obviously gives rise to some very significant concerns says Villasenor If you interpret that ruling by itself as things stand today that would certainly suggest that people would have a fair amount of latitude to make observations using dronesBut several rulings involving what can be observed from outside a property to look inside a property may also apply says Villasenor He points to the 2001 case Kyllo v United States in which the Supreme Court ruled that the use of a thermal imaging device to monitor heat radiated from inside someones home without a search warrant violated the Fourth AmendmentTheres a very interesting piece of language in that ruling that when you map it to drones is really interesting he says It says Where as here the government uses a device that is not in general public use to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion the surveillance is a search One of the interesting phrases in that language is not in general public use If we fastforward two or three years from now when drones are in public use does that change the legal foundation for what you can and cant observe from the outside of a home that would have been previously unknowable without physical intrusionInterview HighlightsOn types of drones There are drones that are powered by jet There are drones that could literally fit in a backpack or the palm of a hand There are drones that are basically like balloons that sit up there in the sky in one place and can observe enormous swaths of territoryOn drones that can stay in the air for weeks at a time These drones arent flying at 400 mph Theyre going very slowly and they have wings which are paper thin which have solar panels which are mounted on the top and they also have batteries that store energy collected during the day so they can continue to turn the propellers and fly at nightOn whether drones can capture audioDrones generate some noise themselves and so I dont think a drone could sit 1000 feet above and hear the conversation of two people sitting at an outside table at a coffee shop I think its mostly imagery and then to a smaller extent wireless signalsOn drones helping traffic patternsFive years from now you can probably imagine that in addition to having helicopters with people in them youll have drones above the ground taking pictures of those thingsOn drones being used by terroristsUnfortunately I think that is a legitimate concern and honestly it keeps me up at night I worry about that It doesnt take too much imagination to understand that a drone is very hard to stop It flies low and it isnt stopped by all of the infrastructure we have in place to make sure people dont go to the places theyre not supposed to go to Fences and walls and gates and barriers it simply goes over those things  As these drones get cheaper more prevalent easier to get attract less attention it raises the risks that they will fall into the wrong hands and be used inappropriatelyOn the FAA and privacy concernsThe FAA I would imagine has more aviation lawyers than Fourth Amendment constitutional lawyers To be fair to the FAA their primary mission  is to provide what they call the safest most efficient aerospace system in the world And frankly I think theyve done an extremely good job of that So their concern as they go through the steps of this aviation bill that was enacted on Feb 14 2012 is first and foremost to integrate drones into the airspace in a safe manner And I think that is the right priority In addition of course there are the privacy concerns But I think it is going to be left to the broader government  obviously with the input of nongovernmental groups  to address those Copyright 2014 NPR,"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 15:18:00 -0400",drugs

wander within themselvesNot all local grooves take flight but triphop most certainly did Over the next two decades it was reimagined as chillout downtempo illbient and lounge music Its subtle tendrils have woven into music round the world  Washington DCs Thievery Corporation with their exotic cosmopolitan edge drifty Brazilian sounds like Ceu whose dulcet lilt earned her maximum market penetration a Starbucks CD Londons Ninja Tunes artists like Bonobo and Berlins technotinged Sonar Kollektiv As music writer Simon Reynolds notes People like Flying Lotus and Gonjasufi on the West Coast are doing trippy hiphop Though its not quite the same thing they probably are the inheritors of the spirit of Massive Attack Tricky Earthling and DJ VadimTo qualify as true triphop music has to share the sense of opiated mystery of Trickys tantalizing mumbles on the classic album 20 years old last year that launched triphop worldwide Massive Attacks Blue Lines Its magical Unfinished Sympathy cast a spell over the worlds clubbers Produced by Nellee Hooper later of Soul II Soul and Bjork among many others the welltimed sound was just one manifestation of a movement taking place in Bristol at that timeScene initiators included Smith  Mighty and the DJ collective The Wild Bunch from which came Massive Attack and Tricky The Pop Groups volatile postpunk added another element to the scene later splitting into the savage free explorations of Float Up CP and hornhappy PigbagBristol fed off its slave port for hundreds of years now its one of Britains blackest cities culturally and socially Its

mindbenders like marijuana  not to mention more macrobiotically sound locallygrown lifeenhancers like scrumpy cider and hallucinogenic mushrooms legal back then grown in the surrounding countryside  that undoubtedly fuelled Bristols music sceneMuch of this musical experimentation took place at a club called The Dug Out As Hooper has said The Dug Out couldnt have had a better location at the top of the hill from St Pauls  the heart of the black music scene  and just down the hill from Clifton and the trendy punkart scene It was  just dangerous enough for trendies to feel edgy music cool and edgy enough to confuse and enthuse the dreads  perfectDisclosure I got a chance to explore Massive Attacks creative process first hand over a few years What follows is a typically incestous Bristolian saga The links between town and gown  the students and the locals  plus the charming citys many liberal artsy types made for a scene with a hectic social creative and romantic dynamicBlue Lines was born in an upstairs bedroom of the terraced West London home of AfroSwedish hiphop diva Neneh Cherry and her producer husband singer Cameron McVey Before her solo hits began with Buffalo Stance Neneh sang with Float Up CP and as her first husband was Bruce Smith drummer for the Pop Group and The Slits with whom Neneh also sang Bristol was yet another home to her The young Massive Attackers Daddy G 3D Mushroom and Tricky became Cherry and McVeys protegs They took over the small side bedroom soon cluttered with reeltoreels and tape machines and a record deck on which they would earnestly sift through possible samples A superb chef my friend Neneh would be in the kitchen concocting feasts in between writing rhymes with Massive Attack wandering in for cups of teaYears later after the band had released Blue Lines and were preparing the album that became Protection I visited Bristol to collaborate with them eventually cowriting the track Sly Samplebased songwriting in those predigital days could be laborious I bought a childs Casio keyboard to help fill the gaps which came in handy for Sly but the process often involved someone getting on their bike and cycling down to the secondhand  record shop to try and locate halfremembered grooves that might be just right to fulfill the elusive conception of a songBring back the bike because the tunes the Massives assembled by hand between cups of tea opened a poetic evocative emotional vein of music which is still connecting hearts today Copyright 2014 NPR,"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 19:39:00 -0500",drugs

kids in Texas to court with misdemeanor charges Some schools have started rethinking the way they punish students for bad behavior after watching many of them drop out or land in prison because of tough disciplinary policies In a downtown Houston municipal court Judge David Fraga has presided over thousands of cases involving students ticketed by school police His docket is still relatively small at the moment with only 45 to 65 cases per night I suspect probably when school is in full bloom probably well have between 125 and 150 Fraga says He isnt referring to cases involving adults ticketed for driving under the influence or suspended licenses but rather young people ticketed by school police for fighting disrupting class or using profanity  all Class C misdemeanors In other words these infractions are the equivalent of crimes like insurance fraud and criminal mischief Erlin Zavala is making his second court appearance for skipping school The gangly 13yearold has jet black hair combed back with gel He listens quietly to questions Fraga asks him with his tiredlooking mom at his side Fraga is a true believer in second chances He wont decide Erlins fate today but he usually recommends community service just to keep kids mistakes from becoming part of their permanent record I mean you gotta show these young people that theres hope Fraga says Winding up in a courtroom for skipping school might seem a bit excessive but beginning in the mid 1990s most states adopted rigid zero tolerance policies in response to school shootings and gang violence Schools in Texas went further by ticketing things like truancy tardiness dress code violations and the use of profanity at school Deborah Fowler legal director for Texas Appleseed a public interest law firm says schools criminalized kids misdeeds no matter how small What we are seeing now are hundreds of thousands of Class C misdemeanor tickets being issued to juveniles in Texas who are being processed for those tickets through what is really an adult criminal justice court system she says This summer an exhaustive study by the Council of State Governments found that by 12th grade more than half of all 14 to 15yearolds in Texas are ticketed expelled or suspended at least once After theyre ticketed sent to court and fined hundreds of dollars students arent always allowed to go back to their home school Instead theyre sent to an alternative school a holding pen of sorts where kids are supposed to learn their lesson Learning Their Lesson Thomesha Turner 18 is a senior in the Waco independent school district She was a good student and had never been in trouble before a verbal altercation with a teacher She says the teacher pointed a finger in her face and called her a little girl I told her to get out of my face cause I wasnt a little girl and I cussed her out I said Miss You get out of my face or Ill beat your bitch ass up Theres a different way I couldve handled it Turner says but I didnt handle it in a more mature way Danielle Delgado 12 is a diminutive girl with a hairtrigger temper Shes at the Waco Alternative School Campus for fighting with another student Delgado recalls She told me I have some big feet I said you got a big face She swung but she missed and so thats when we started fighting in the hallway And security got me and then security took her to the vice principals office Delgado has been suspended three times The first time she was only 8 and in third grade Turmoil In Young Lives At Wacos only alternative school absolute obedience and compliance with the rules is mandatory School uniforms are a must and students cant speak in the hallways Seventy students are referred to this school every day and theyre all expected to change for the better But the more these kids open up the more it becomes apparent that their behavior has a lot to do with the turmoil in their young lives Karen McPhetridge 14 says shes been in foster care since she was 3 I got back with my mom like three years ago and then my dad abandoned me McPhetridge says Ive been angry with him and Ive been angry with my sister because as soon as she graduated she became a stripper and now shes like all strung out on drugs McPhetridge was expelled for smoking marijuana on school grounds Kids like her have gotten in to trouble but until now schools have had no way to deal with the root causes of their bad behavior Neglect abuse and family problems are issues that students like Saul Cornejo 16 bring to school every day Teachers at school they dont understand it he says They just dismiss you put you off instead of like really trying to get to the real problem which most of the time originates at home and stuff Cornejo has been suspended several times for fighting He lives with his older brother but is pretty much on his own His principal says hes really bright but Cornejo is facing felony charges for burglary and wont be allowed to return to his home school Schools give up on kids like Cornejo all too often says John Hudson the director of attendance truancy and dropout recovery in the Waco alternative school Hudson says When you look at the numbers of times students are disciplined in school suspended separated from school placed in disciplinary alternative education placement the unintended consequence is that their education suffers to the point where it puts them farther and farther away from graduating Hudson thinks these unintended consequences prove that the schools disciplinary policies are not working This seems to be the growing consensus in Texas but its going to take a lot of work to undo the damage the harsh disciplinary policies have caused Worth Rescuing For the past two years Waco had the secondhighest suspension and expulsion rates in Texas Today administrators and teachers are trying to turn that around by being less punitive The district has even started a tiny pilot program that teaches parents how to help their kids control their behavior For Delgado Turner and McPhetridge it may be too late They say they feel labeled and stigmatized McPhetridge says This will go on my record and it worries me like what kind of colleges would want to accept someone who was put in alternative school Turner has similar concerns  When they see alternative on your background they look at you different because theyre like alternative Thats for bad kids Already a mother of two with another child on the way Turner is determined to graduate next spring Delgado isnt so sure Im pretty sure Ill do fine she says but then adds in a whisper Ill be back here  Im a bad child The Waco schools superintendent Bonnie Cain took over two years ago She says a few teachers and administrators may still think some kids will always be trouble but from now on the districts disciplinary policy will assume that deep down even the toughest students can change and are worth rescuing Nobody wakes up in the morning and says You know what Im going to make everybody mad today Im going to get expelled  Cain says We need to take that child where they are and work with them to get them on the right track because if we dont do it who will With more state lawmakers now supporting this view school districts in Texas are rethinking their disciplinary policies Researchers hope Texas will be a model for other states to do the same This story was

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/10/19/141427499/justice-stevens-reflects-on-the-court-and-its-chiefs?ft=3&f=,After 35 years serving on the Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens retired last year Appointed by President Gerald Ford in 1975 Stevens was the thirdlongestserving justice in the courts history  Now 91 he spends his days playing tennis lecturing and writing But instead of legal briefs and opinions Stevens is now sharing personal stories from his time on the Supreme CourtHis newly released memoir Five Chiefs A Supreme Court Memoir is about the five Supreme Court chief justices he personally knew Fred Vinson Earl Warren Warren Burger William Rehnquist and John Roberts Stevens clerked during Vinsons appointment practiced law during Warrens tenure and served on the court with Burger Rehnquist and RobertsIn a wideranging conversation with Terry Gross on Wednesdays Fresh Air Stevens discusses his career as well as his views on some of the decisions handed down from the court during his 35 years on the benchIn his final decade on the court some of his best known opinions were his dissenting ones  in Bush v Gore which stopped the Florida recount and in Citizens United v Federal Election Commission which ended restrictions on corporate spending in electionsStevens also wrote the opinion for the court in two cases that successfully challenged the Bush administrations approach to the war on terrorism  Rasul v Bush which said detainees at Guantanamo had the right to challenge their incarceration in American courts and Hamdan v Rumsfeld which ruled against the Bush administrations plan to use military tribunals at Guantanamo  Legal journalist Jeffrey Toobin describes those decisions as the summit of Stevens achievements on the benchInterview HighlightsOn the role of the chief justiceHe has the same role as every other justice in the sense that he does his best to persuade others to share his views and each of the rest of the justices do the same thing If he ends up being one of the five justices in the majority he has the same responsibility that he has if theres a unanimous opinion Namely he assigns the author of the opinion to express the views of the majorityOn becoming more liberal over the course of his time on the Supreme CourtThose terms are a little bit misleading because you have so many issues that you address as a member of the court that on some issues you might be regarded as to use your word as a liberal and on others you might be regarded as a conservative And its difficult to place a simple label on the entire work product of a member of the courtOn his dissenting opinion in the Citizens United rulingAs I explain in the opinion there were narrower grounds that would not have caused any major changes in the law And that could have been used to decide the case And having explained that I then get into a discussion of why I thought that the particular cases that the court overruled in that case had been correctly decided and should not be overruled  The court has held I think incorrectly that the First Amendment protects the right to use money just as though money were speech And of course expenditures for campaigns go for many things other than speech such as travel expenses wardrobe expenses public polls In the Watergate incident some of that campaign money was used for illicit purposes and should not be regarded as protected by the First AmendmentOn the term activistWhenever a court makes decisions that are not necessary in order to dispose of the particular issues of the case the word activist may apply to that work But thats not a criticism of the impartiality of the justices on the courtOn the right to bear armsI think its fairly clear that the framers expected the states to have the last say on what kind of use of the people to keep and bear arms should be authorized They certainly didnt expect in my judgment federal judges to have word on what kinds of firearms states could authorize for themselvesOn the Second AmendmentThe more that you looked at the text and the drafting history of the Second Amendment the more you come to the conclusion that the current courts reading is much broader than what the draftsmen expectedOn his robesThats the one tax deduction that judges have if I can remember If you buy new robes thats a business expense and can be deductedOn the Bush v Gore decision I guess the thing that surprised me the most was the fact that any justice thought there was irreparable injury shown by the petitioners that would justify the action that was takenOn his viewpoints evolving over timeAny judge or justice has views that evolve over time because he  becomes more and more educated and better able to do certain things  Theres been some change in my views about the death penalty but I  think theres more of a change in the jurisprudence of the court that  made me eventually reach the conclusion that the death penalty as it is  presently administered is unconstitutionalOn whether a decision is constitutional vs whether it is a wise policyChief  Justice Burger and Justice Blackmun for example originally voted to  uphold the constitutionality of the death penalty Justice Blackmun  later changed his views on that particular issue But both of them were  very clear in believing that it was not wise policy They both came from  Minnesota which does not have a capital punishment statute and I  think they were not fans of the death penaltyOn being in the position of upholding the constitutionality of a ruling while believing that its not good policyThe example that comes to mind most readily is Gonazales v Raich  a case that we had 78 years ago involving the constitutionality of  federal enforcement against the use of marijuana in California It was after California passed a statute allowing its use for  medical purposes  The women involved in the case who grew marijuana  in their own backyard and had strong medical justification for using the  drug  I thought it was most unwise to prohibit them from doing so but I  think that it was equally clear that the federal constitution did  authorize the federal government to enforce the statutes on the books Copyright 2014 NPR,"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 18:49:00 -0500",drugs

Americans  patriotism  and leave others feeling  cheated From Connecticut to California new regulations to be enacted on  July 1 when most states begin a new fiscal year will change how people live in  ways big  Illinois is repealing its death penalty law  and small  California is mandating carbon monoxide detectors While each state has distinct needs legislation approved  across the nation addresses many of the same issues such as budget shortfalls  immigration voter eligibility health care and workers  rights In this nascent economic recovery  many states found ways to raise revenue without taking the politically suicidal  step of raising taxes So people may not see more money removed from their  paychecks but they will shell out more at the cash register in the form of  higher sales taxes For instance Connecticut residents will be taxed on yoga  sessions manicures and even valet parking Unlike other states Connecticut didnt flinch  in imposing the largest tax increase in state  history The key issue has been money and  budgets Everybody is dealing with that says William Pound executive director of  the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures It has been  through reductions or increases in fees Like raising tuition at higher  education institutions or fees at state parks Were putting more of the cost  of the service on the individual using it rather than on the taxpaying public at  large Immigration was another common  target More than 1500 related bills and resolutions were introduced in state  legislatures this year according to the National Conference of State Legislatures  By the end of March 26 states had enacted 63 laws addressing the education and  employment of illegal immigrants human trafficking or enforcement of existing laws Heres a sampling of new laws taking effect Friday Immigration  Crackdowns And Expansions  Job candidates in  Georgia now face felony charges for  submitting false information and documents to potential employers Thats the only major  provision in the new state law that takes effect Friday The other provisions  which include allowing local police to verify a suspects immigration status and  detain them are under temporary injunction by a federal judge as part of a lawsuit aimed  at overturning the law On Sept 1 a similar law takes  effect in Alabama That states version is regarded as  the strictest in the nation in part because it requires public schools to  determine the immigration status of pupils On the other side of the immigration  divide Illinois will enact its version of the DREAM  Act Development Relief and Education for Alien Minors becoming the first  state to establish a private scholarship fund for the children of illegal immigrants And in Connecticut illegal immigrants who are high school graduates will be eligible for instate tuition at state colleges A  similar law passed in Maryland and was scheduled to take effect  Friday but likely wont because of an ongoing petition drive aimed at forcing a  voter referendum to overturn it Both laws require students to be on a path to  gaining legal status Digital Donts  Gabbing Bullying And Sexting Connecticut raised fines for talking on a cellphone and texting while driving A first offense will cost 125 up from 100 a  second offense between 150 and 250 and future citations could reach 400 Connecticut also banned school bullying both  in person and virtually via the Internet and digital  devices Florida eased punishments for minors caught  sexting the practice of sending lewd photos via text message The law aimed  at protecting children from prosecution for more serious crimes such as child  pornography imposes a 60 fine or eight hours of community service for  firsttime offenders A second violation is a firstdegree  misdemeanor Dead  People Do Vote  Others Must Show  ID In Virginia if you send in  an absentee ballot but die before Election Day your vote still will be  counted In Oklahoma voters

and no jail time In Virginia patrons may be  allowed to bring their own wine to restaurants The law is voluntary leaving  the decision up to the individual restaurant Establishments can also charge a

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/06/15/137202798/planned-texas-execution-has-mexico-up-in-arms?ft=3&f=,A planned execution in Texas has the state at odds with the federal government and the International Court of Justice The dispute involves Humberto Leal Jr a Mexican national who was convicted of murder and sentenced to death When he was arrested Leal was not informed of his right to notify his embassy or consulate Mexico cried foul the International Court of Justice agreed and the US government asked Texas to review the case But the state has refused and plans to execute Leal in three weeks The Case On the night of May 21 1994 16yearold Adria Sauceda attended a party on the south side of San Antonio Witnesses testified that the teenager ingested so much alcohol cocaine and marijuana she became extremely intoxicated A group of eight or nine young men took her into the backyard and took turns sexually assaulting her Anyone who tried to intervene was told to back off Sandra Babcock Leals lawyer and a professor at Northwestern University  Law School says when Leal arrived at the party and learned what happened to Sauceda he became very upset and said that he was going to take her home Leal says that on the ride home Sauceda tried to get out of the car Leal pulled over she got out he tried to get her back in they argued he pushed her and she hit her head But Leal maintains he didnt kidnap her and he didnt rape her And thats the crux of his defense because without those additional crimes Leal would not have faced a capital murder charge and a death penalty conviction So although there was evidence that he was with her before she died  and that he may have had some involvement in her death  the evidence that shows that he committed a sexual assault is reed thin and the evidence that shows that he kidnapped her is even weaker Babcock says Babcock accuses the public defenders assigned to defend Leal of putting on a lazy defense And that particularly galls the government of Mexico All parties agree that Leal a Mexican national in Texas legally should have been told he had a right to notify his consulate in San Antonio The Mexican government says had it known it would have paid for Leal to have topflight legal representation investigators and experts to assist his defense Mexico has a longstanding tradition  internationally recognized tradition  about assisting their nationals says Victor Uribe head of the legal section at the Mexican Embassy in Washington DC Of course due to the opposition of Mexico to the death penalty capital cases are a priority for Mexico Texas Has Been Resistant In Complying Including Leal there are 51 Mexican nationals on death row in the US who were never informed of their rights In frustration Mexico took these cases to the International Court of Justice in The Hague In 2004 the court ruled that the US had violated its treaty obligations and ordered the US to review these cases to see if the violation had prejudiced the mens defenses Its not a favor that we do for foreigners who travel in the United States The United States is a party to this treaty because it protects Americans when we travel abroad says John Bellinger a partner at Arnold  Porter in Washington Bellinger is the former legal adviser at the State Department who handled these cases for the Bush administration To the surprise of both conservatives and liberals President Bush was persuaded by this State Departments argument and ordered states to review their foreign national cases But Texas Gov Rick Perry said no and to the Bush administrations chagrin the Republican governor challenged his predecessor in federal court  and won Texas has been particularly resistant to complying I think Texas and the governor have tended to think this is a question of bowing to pressure from Washington or protecting the sovereignty of Texas from international tribunals in The Hague Bellinger says Although Perry the state attorney generals office and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles all declined to speak to NPR Perrys staff in the past has said The world court has no standing in Texas and Texas is not bound by a ruling or edict from a foreign court Its very important to remember that these individuals are on death row for killing our citizens Texas has already executed two Mexican nationals who werent informed of their rights Now Leal is on deck to be put to death the first week of July Having witnessed the powerlessness of the International Court and the president of the United States to stop these executions Uribe at the Mexican Embassy says theyve appealed to the real power in all this Perry We are respectfully requesting him to exercise his legal power to suspend Mr Leals execution until his conviction and sentence are reviewed and reconsidered according to the decision of the ICJ Uribe says Leals time is running out His best hope probably lies in federal court His lawyer has filed a federal habeas petition asking the court to put Leals execution on hold long enough to give Congress time to consider legislation that would order the states including Texas to comply Democratic Sen Patrick Leahy of Vermont introduced the legislation Tuesday Copyright 2014 NPR,"Wed, 15 Jun 2011 21:52:00 -0400",drugs

night But what happens when its time to relax unwind and even go to sleep Older insomniacs may reach for a glass of wine warm milk or some chamomile tea But the new relaxation rage is soda and brownies Relaxation drinks are sort of the initial backlash to the energy drink craze If Im nervous or if I am having a bad day I can just crack open a Mary Janes instead says Eric Shogren Shogren is the man behind the Californiabased Relaxing Company maker of Mary Janes relaxing soda  The soda is one of a handful of new herbal products aimed at chilling out todays stressedout consumer  If youre hyped up on too much caffeine jetlagged or work has you tense and anxious manufacturers claim their drinks can calm you down or help you fall asleep Herbs That Aim To Take The Edge Off The name Mary Janes he explains is a playful nod toward marijuana but the soda actually contains passion flower extract and kavakava   two legal herbal products the company claims have been shown to relax people and reduce anxiety Our products arent meant to make people tired or sleepy it just kind of takes the edge off a little bit if youre nervous or stressed out says Shogren Soft drinks waters and brownies containing  herbal supplements like passion flower kava valerian root rose hips melatonin and GABA are hitting shelves across the country With catchy phrases like unwind from the grind  slow your roll and tired of being wired these products claim to be the perfect antidote to a hectic lifestyle  In the words of one advertisement its safer than a glass of warm milk and more effective than counting sheep Taking Straight Herbs Vs Drinking Products With Herbs And with cool names like iChill Dream Water and Lazy Cakes  they are becoming increasingly popular  especially among teens and young adults The research on most of these herbal supplements is spotty and inconclusive explains Brent Bauer of the Mayo Clinics Complementary and Integrative Medicine program  Since herbs cant be patented and the FDA doesnt require companies to prove their claims with research or even standardize their ingredients there is no financial or legal incentive for them to do extensive science on their products But even where there is good evidence the herbs themselves do what the companies claim such as in the case of kava explains Bauer thats not necessarily the case once they have been baked or added to a soda So there is no question kava as a drink by itself can work  the question is can we take that information and then take a very small amount of that put it into a drink and see the same benefits  And I think this is where the science gets a little thin Bauer says There is no definitive scientific evidence that any of the products on the market create relaxation or induce sleep but theres no evidence they dont either   And what works for one person may not work for another   or be safe When you look at it very simplistically and think we can just dump things in a drink and then give it to many many different people without respect to their personal condition their own health issues what medications they are taking I think weve made a dangerous jump says Bauer What is perhaps more worrisome than an ineffective product say experts is an effective one  Its important that consumers realize any substance powerful enough to have real effects also carries real risks Caution Around Melatonin Because they are packaged like food some worry that consumers are more likely to treat them like food  not medicine  Ziad Shaman of Metro Health Medical Center in Cleveland says thats certainly the case for melatonin a hormone produced naturally in the body It is a drug  and I am repeating this  it is a drug  Just because it looks like a brownie doesnt mean its just a brownie says Shaman Shaman prescribes melatonin to patients in his sleep clinic and says it can be very effective  But he also cautions that it can have a host of side effects shouldnt be used while driving and can even be dangerous in children Most experts say children should not consume  these products unless a doctor approves them But melatonin and other herbal supplements have been available in pill form for decades so why is adding them to food and drinks suddenly all the rage Shaman says putting the herbs in sodas and brownies automatically targets them at teens and young adults who are more likely to be up late and have poor sleeping habits Bauer says marketing them as natural and healthful alternatives to other drugs adds to the appeal I think there is always this societal interest in trying to find something where we can get it for free In other words we want to find that nice herb that gives us an altered sense of reality but has no consequences and so I think thats where some of this advertising is coming from says Bauer Experts argue that although the drinks may be cool when it comes to your health good nutrition exercise proper sleep habits and stress management techniques are going to be more effective and have longer lasting results than herbal supplements in any form And as for that cup of chamomile tea Feel free to indulge   Its perfectly safe says Shaman who admits he occasionally enjoys a cup himself But theres no scientific evidence it will make you sleepy either Copyright 2014 NPR,"Mon, 06 Jun 2011 15:36:00 -0400",drugs

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/03/25/134850972/town-relies-on-troubled-youth-prison-for-profits?ft=3&f=,First in a twopart series on private prisons Prisons are filled with stress and violence without proper supervision they can revert to primitive places Thats what happened at Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility in Mississippi an NPR news investigation has determined As the nations largest juvenile prison Walnut Grove houses 1200 boys and young men in a sprawling onestory complex ringed by security fences about an hours drive east of Jackson  The State of Mississippi pays a private corrections company to run the prison NPRs investigation found that allegations swirling around the prison raise the fundamental question of whether profits have distorted the mission of rehabilitating young inmates An Environment Of Violence Walnut Grove started out and it was formed to be something good for youth but somewhere down the line it took a turn for the worse said former inmate Clayborne Henderson 27 He spent two years for kidnapping in the Grove as they call it between his 19th and 21st birthdays Now hes working at a car wash and taking community college courses in Jackson trying to straighten out his life He and other former inmates describe an environment of violence inside the youth prison as so pervasive it became entertainment Itd be like setting up a fight deal like you would with two dogs Henderson said I did witness twice while I was at Walnut Grove they actually bet on it It was payday for the guards The Southern Poverty Law Center and the ACLU National Prison Project have filed a classaction lawsuit on behalf of 13 inmates against the prison operator GEO Group the prison administration and state officials The complaint describes rampant contraband brought in by guards sex between female guards and male inmates inadequate medical care prisoners held inhumanely in isolation guards brutalizing inmates and inmateoninmate violence that was so brutal it led to brain damage When we began investigating conditions inside this facility and seeing how these kids were living with the beat downs and the sexual abuse and violence and corruption it became a nobrainer It became something we had to do said Sheila Bedi the lead attorney on the case and deputy legal director for the SPLC Earlier this year the Civil Rights Division of the US Department of Justice launched its own investigation into some of these charges A spokesperson in Washington DC said the probe is ongoing and declined to comment Questionable Prison Guards Several former inmates who spoke to NPR say guards are a big part of the problem Justin Bowling who spent 17 months in the Grove in 2007 and 2008 for marijuana possession says the prison is overrun with gangs whose members include correctional officers A lot of times the guards are in the same gang If the inmates wanted something done they got it If they wanted a cell popped open to handle some business about fighting or something like that it just pretty much happened Bowling said Theres also a problem of too few guards A state audit in 2005 and another one last year noted that staffing at Walnut Grove decreased even as the prisoner population increased According to the audit in 2009 there were three inmate injuries a day In the first six months of 2010 there was more than one fight a day an assault on staff at least every other day and nine attempted suicides The Council of Juvenile Correctional Administrators whose members represent youth facilities in all 50 states reports that a guardtoinmate ratio of 1 officer to 10 or 12 juvenile prisoners is common The state audit of Walnut Grove found the guardtoinmate ratio to be 1 to 60 Salaries are the largest expense of a correctional budget and reducing staffing is typically a way to keep costs down Pablo Paez vice president for corporate relations for GEO Group based in Boca Raton Fla declined repeated requests by NPR to give the companys side of the story He cited the pending lawsuit GEO which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange is the nations second largest prison corporation and had more than 1 billion in revenue last year Mississippi Corrections Commissioner Chris Epps also declined repeated requests for an interview citing the litigation In a brief email in January he wrote If staff  abused inmates they should be punished However I have no knowledge of them abusing inmates He added that the facility has improved since GEO took over last August Two months later his spokesperson confirmed in an email to NPR that the Department of Corrections had hired an independent consultant experienced in fixing troubled lockups to review operations at the Grove Ethel Heard is one of 100  parents who have banded together to pressure the state to make reforms at Walnut Grove Her 21yearold son Tyrone is serving time there for armed robbery We know that our children have made mistakes she said Were not asking that they open the cell doors and let our kids out Were asking for them to have better treatment Creating A Distinct Youth Facility When Walnut Grove opened 10 years ago it was a model youth facility The idea was to get teenaged felons out of the notorious Parchman penitentiary and away from hardened criminals As one young inmate said An old fool has lived his life but a young fool can change But thats not how it has turned out says state representative John Mayo a member of the corrections committee that oversees Walnut Grove and other Mississippi prisons To me in my mind its just a prison he said Its another adult prison Mayo says the Legislature kept raising the age of inmates sent there  from 18 all the way up to 22 He says he voted against the age increases Today Walnut Grove is the only juvenile facility in the country that locks up 22yearolds with 13yearolds Initially it was to be 13 through 18yearolds Mayo said And then quite frankly that did not populate Walnut Grove to what Im going to call a profitable operation Two years ago Walnut Grove added 500 beds to accommodate all the new prisoners According to the 2008 and 2009 annual reports for Cornell Companies the prison operator at the time the expansion created an extra 34 million in revenue GEO acquired Cornell last year George Cole a career educator who served as principal of the prison school for four years was at a legislative hearing held in January to look into alleged abuses at Walnut Grove I thought when I went to Walnut Grove I was going to a place that was really interested in the rehabilitation of our children but I found out quite the opposite And I guess as a private facility they had to make money Cole testified The hearing was heavily attended by inmates parents most of whom are black and all of whom wore bright orange Tshirts that read Friends  Family Of Youth Incarcerated At Walnut Grove Though invited neither GEO nor the state corrections department sent a representative to the hearing Taking Educational Grant Money NPR examined thousands of pages of public records associated with federal grants paid to the Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility Records show that Warden Brick Tripp and his deputy wardens  already paid by GEO  have been receiving checks for 2500 to 5000 as supplemental salaries for administering federal Title 1 education funds The warden and deputy warden had no dealings whatsoever with educating students Cole stated emphatically in a phone interview The warden declined an interview request Jeff Webb the lawyer who represents the fivemember Walnut Grove Correctional Authority which writes the checks says overseeing the grants is part of the wardens job though he did not say why deputy wardens receive paycheck bonuses GEO Groups Paez was also asked why the prison administration was receiving supplementary paychecks from federal education grants which have nothing to do with the civil rights lawsuit or Justice Department investigation He said he had no comment NPR forwarded the paycheck supplements to the US Department of Education and asked if this was normal Chief of Communications Justin Hamilton said the agency is concerned and has referred the matter to its Office of Inspector General for investigation Support For Walnut Grove Despite all the controversy the youth prison has staunch defenders         Dennise JonesPutnam municipal clerk of the town of Walnut Grove says her nephew is in the prison boot camp program He will be one of the first ones to tell you thats the best thing thats ever happened to him Its turned his life totally around she said As to why the kids are frequently placed on lockdown and fight with staff Walnut Grove is not a day care said the Rev Justin Chaney the prison chaplain there from 2007 to 2010 Im afraid a lot of people think it might be just a little detention center Its maximum security So yea you do have those that can be rough Grady Sims mayor of Walnut Grove says he visits the prison frequently and knows the staff well I wouldnt interfere with the way theyre operating it he said Theyve done an excellent job Why The Prison Matters To The Town The town of Walnut Grove is so small theres no stoplight or supermarket In fact inmates outnumber citizens 2 to 1 The prison just about saved this town from extinction The 200 prison jobs helped fill the void when a shirt manufacturer and a glove maker closed and moved overseas several years ago The mayors own vending company has 18 snack machines inside the prison Its been a sweet deal for Walnut Grove Sims said Indeed every month the prison pays the town 15000 in lieu of taxes  which comprises nearly 15 percent of its annual budget For a small town thats a lot of money the mayor said and it helps us maintain a fulltime police department that we wouldnt be able to afford without that income Theres more GEO pays the Walnut Grove Correctional Authority  which sends the prison all of its grant money  4500 a month Webb the authoritys lawyer says the money is kept in escrow and rarely spent Finally theres a fulltime state corrections employee whose job is to monitor how the prison is run His salary is reimbursed by GEO All of this raises the question Is oversight of the Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility negligent because its a golden goose All this community is just making so much money off Walnut Grove that no one wants to upset the applecart Then that means theyre not gonna make their money anymore says State Representative Earle Banks chairman of the state Juvenile Justice Committee He called the recent hearing to investigate Walnut Grove Banks a plaintiffs lawyer is suing the prison for wrongful death of an inmate That handsoff policy might be about to change If theres mistreatment going on at Walnut Grove and the Justice Department finds that it is they ought to sue the hell out of somebody Mayo said I cant understand why we have to be sued to do whats right Aarti Shahani contributed to this NPR News investigation and report Copyright 2014 NPR,"Mon, 28 Mar 2011 09:58:00 -0400",drugs

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/03/01/134132526/u-s-defends-doma-despite-dropping-support?ft=3&f=,The Obama administration says it will continue to deny health care benefits to the samesex legal spouse of a federal court employee despite the fact that it has abandoned its court arguments in support of the Defense of Marriage Act Known as DOMA the 1996 law bars the federal government from recognizing samesex marriage On Monday the administration took the latest in a series of convoluted actions relating to the statute Last week the administration stirred up a tempest in the legal community when it notified Congress that it would no longer defend DOMA as constitutional It was the first time the administration has notified Congress of a refusal to defend a statute in court The administrations approach differed markedly from the way it dealt with the dont ask dont tell law which the administration did defend in court but persuaded Congress to repeal Dealing with DOMA the administration did the opposite It has abandoned the law in court but has not asked Congress to repeal it An Incoherent Switch Until last week the administration had defended DOMA but Walter Dellinger who served as solicitor general in the Clinton administration contends that throwing in the towel was the right course for the administration at this point He notes that the administration for the first time was going to have to articulate whether a law that singles out homosexuals for different treatment should be treated with special skepticism by the courts The Justice Department was going to have to argue that there had been no discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation Dellinger says And given a legislative record replete with comments hostile to homosexuals that is an argument that neither the president nor the attorney general believe Harvard law professor Charles Fried who served as solicitor general in the Reagan administration calls the administrations rationale for switching positions incoherent Although Fried says his personal view is that the law is unconstitutional the Justice Department he maintains is dutybound to defend any federal law as long as some reasonable argument can be made to support it  even though the argument may ultimately be a losing one The reasonable argument is that in terms of tradition and in terms of the view of the majority of the people of the United States marriage is between one man and one woman Fried says Benefits For SameSex Couple In notifying Congress of its decision not to defend DOMA in court the Obama administration said it would continue to enforce the law so that Congress could defend the law if it wishes to in court In other words the administration said it would with one hand enforce the law in order to preserve a legal case for Congress to defend but at the same time the administration would tell the courts it believes the law is unconstitutional Thus in Mondays California case the administration said the federal Office of Personnel Management would continue to deny health care benefits to the legal samesex spouses of federal court employees Last week the administration said the Internal Revenue Service would refuse to recognize the marital status of an 81yearold widow who in 2007 legally married her female partner of 44 years The IRS action means the widow owes 360000 in estate taxes that would not be owed if her spouse were a man Some former Justice Department officials are critical of this twotrack approach contending that if a president really thinks a law is unconstitutional he should not enforce it Shannen Coffin who served in the Bush Justice Department and as counsel to former Vice President Dick Cheney says it seems incongruous to conclude that the administration will continue to enforce a statute that they have found flatly unconstitutional Coffin agrees however that the issue of enforcement is something of a conundrum that forces the president to either take apparently contradictory positions or usurp the power of the legislature by unilaterally refusing to enforce a law George  Washington University law professor Orin Kerr also contends that the administration is in an impossible situation because theyre going to get criticized no matter what they do depending on what political interest is offended by their decision Precedent While the administrations DOMA shift is unusual it is not rare It has happened more than a dozen times since 2004 and many more in the past 60 years including in some very important cases During the Eisenhower Kennedy and Truman administrations the presidents in one form or another refused to defend separatebutequal facilities in schools and hospitals The Ford Justice Department refused to defend the postWatergate campaign finance law much of which was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court The Reagan administration refused to defend the independent counsel law a law subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court by a 7to1 vote It also refused to defend the onehouse legislative veto of many executive actions in that case the administration was more successful winning 72 in the Supreme Court The Clinton administration refused to defend a federal law mandating the dismissal of military personnel who were HIVpositive The George W Bush administration refused to defend a federal law that denied masstransit funds to any transportation system that displayed ads advocating the legalization of marijuana And in the George HW Bush administration the Justice Department refused to defend a federal law providing affirmative action in the awarding of broadcasting licenses  a law subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court by a narrow 54 vote Solicitor General Kenneth Starr was recused in the case so the lead counsel for the

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/01/10/132800776/the-root-reading-the-constitution-is-fundamental?ft=3&f=,Sherrilyn A Ifill who teaches at the law school of the University of Maryland writes about the law for The Root I started carrying around a pocket version of the US Constitution in my purse in 1998 after I visited South   Africa for the first time It was only four years after the first full democratic election in that country When the ANC was voted the ruling party in 1994 and Nelson Mandela was elected president hundreds of thousands of black South Africans stood in lines extending for miles to exercise their franchise for the first time Four years later everyone  from parliamentary officials to the woman selling tea at a makeshift kiosk in the townships outside Cape   Town  carried a small copy of the South African Constitution on their person It was inspiring to see how engaged everyone was with the foundational document of their country So all things being equal I have no objection to the leadership of the newly elected US House of Representatives deciding to open the first session last week with a reading of the Constitution It was also gratifying to see the reading turn into a bipartisan affair Of course as noted by Rep Elijah Cummings DMD the House didnt have the stomach to read the original Constitution along with its amendments Thus the reading excluded some of the framers greatest constitutional hits including Article I Section 2 the counting of slaves as threefifths of all other Persons for representation purposes Nothing like reading an edited and sanitized version of the Constitution to demonstrate respect for it But the deletion of the unpleasant parts of the Constitution is only one of the problems with the constitutional readin that opened the new congressional session Many of us hoped that members of Congress would have read the Constitution before they took the oath of office  in fact before they ran for office so that they would be familiar with the structure of government they hoped to influence But if Republican leaders who hatched this stunt believe that reading the Constitution aloud is the same thing as understanding it then this new Congress is in for a bumpy year Its important for our leaders to understand that a constitution differs from other sources of law Unlike a statute or regulation a constitution sets out the fundamental legal regime by which a nation is organized Constitutions are meant to stand the test of time It was Chief Justice John Marshall who reminded us in 1819 that our Constitution was intended to endure for ages to come  and to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs The framers understood this They provided a means of amending the Constitution but also drafted language that left enough room in the joints of our governing structure so that successive generations could ensure that our government could function The perfect example is the Article I necessary and proper clause which gives Congress the authority to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for executing the powers vested in the legislative branch by the Constitution Determining when a law is necessary and proper to the execution of a constitutionally enumerated power cannot be determined simply by reading the words of Article I Section 8 over and over Likewise determining the extent of Congress power under the commerce clause to regulate commerce  among the several states has been subject to centuries of interpretation by the Supreme Court Thursdays spokenword performance has not revealed the parameter of Congress power in this area Behind the Republican leaders constitutional posturing of course the stage is set for an effort to repeal the newly enacted health care law Challenges to the constitutionality of the law in federal court have centered on the breadth of Congress powers under Article I Section 8 The new health care law seems to fall squarely within Congress power under the commerce clause which has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to authorize Congress to legislate in a variety of areas As long as economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce the court has been inclined to find that Congress may legislate in that area For example the Supreme Court ruled that Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which forbids hotel owners from denying services to clients based on race is an exercise of Congress commerce clause power and ruled that the commerce clause permits Congress to regulate medical marijuana in the states But Judge Henry E Hudson in Virginia v Sebelius offers a cramped analysis of the commerce clause that seems at odds with these cases In striking down the health care law Hudson concedes that Congress can regulate economic activity that affects interstate commerce But Hudson contends Congress cannot regulate inactivity Thus according to Hudson Congress cannot regulate those who seek not to participate in the health care market by having insurance Hudsons decision has been derided by many legal scholars and conflicts with the decisions of other courts that have reviewed challenges to the health care law Hudson has also been criticized for his financial connection with an organization that provides services to a number of Republican elected officials  including Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli who filed the legal challenge to the health care law But simply reading the Constitution without reference to the nearly 200 years of Supreme Court interpretation of its various provisions doesnt help us understand the interplay between the commerce clause the necessary and proper clause and Congress power to levy taxes Nor will it bring the new Tea Partyspooked congressional Republicans any closer to completing the hard work of enacting legislation in a divided Congress Whats even more disturbing are those Tea Party activists and Republicans who position themselves as the only true protectors of the Constitution In fact the whole exercise of reading the Constitution at the start of the new House session was designed to suggest that Republicans will be operating within the confines of the Constitution in contrast with their Democratic counterparts It is ironic therefore that its most often members of the Republican Party who seem most determined to change or overturn provisions of the Constitution  whether its Iowa Rep Steve Kings new proposal to overturn the Constitutions birthrightcitizenship provision or earlier efforts to amend the Constitution to outlaw samesex marriage Other Republican elected officials recently advocated nullification  the refusal by states to comply with federal law  a term most often associated with Southern resistance to school desegregation orders But no matter The Constitution  along with patriotism national security and family values  is fast becoming yet another term coopted as part of the permanent GOP campaign Almost 200 years ago Chief Justice Marshall cautioned against defining Congress power in Article I so narrowly that our foundational document would become merely a splendid bauble Congressional Republicans will need to do more than merely admire the Constitution or parrot its many provisions en masse to fulfill their oath of office Its all well and good to carry a copy of the Constitution in ones pocket  in fact its an excellent habit for the citizens of any country But our nations legislators will need to do more than carry and read the Constitution They will have to do the hard work of enacting legislation to strengthen our nation and to advance the people of this country as the framers empowered them to do Copyright 2014 The Root,"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 08:24:00 -0500",drugs

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2010/09/24/130099092/civil-rights-judicial-bias-surround-texas-drug-case?ft=3&f=,A legal drama has been playing out for almost three years in the Texas town of Clarksville of Red River County During that time two black brothers have seen their lives turned upside down and a white judge was recused from the case after allegations of judicial bias and criticism for pushing a drug case that just about everyone urged him to drop Clarksville Texas Clarksville was one of the first places settled in the state of Texas After 190 years since its founding the town of 3200 retains a slightly dilapidated Southern charm In the town square stands a large statue of a Confederate soldier Col John C Burks Whatsstrange is that the statue is not facing east toward Murfreesboro Tenn where Burks and many other locals lost their lives charging a Union battery Nor is it facing south in honor of Burks beloved Confederacy The Confederate colonel faces northwest as if looking toward Idaho But the way Vergil Richardson sees it the statue is actually keeping an eye on the towns black neighborhood Richardson grew up in Clarksville He led the local high schools basketball team to two state championship games and eventually came back to coach the team He says that since the days of Reconstruction the Confederate officer has been sending a quiet message from Clarksvilles white community to its black community The message is whatever you do Im watching and they are Richardson says  Cops Everywhere  Three blocks south from Clarksvilles town square on South Columbia Street is Richardsons twobedroom house As Thanksgiving approached in 2007 six members of the Richardson family including two brothers  Vergil now 40 and Mark 38  had gathered to celebrate They did not know it but the Richardsons were being watched  not by Col Burks but by Clarksville law enforcement As 1030 pm approached a few family members were playing dominoes and watching TV while others had already gone to bed Suddenly the police burst through the door without knocking They were screaming yelling telling us to get on the floor cursing us out Vergil says The high school coach had never been in trouble hadnt even had a traffic ticket I was very scared didnt know what to do I looked up because I know some of them The prosecutor he was there with a gun in his hand Vergil recalls Meanwhile Vergils brother Mark was sitting in a car outside the house talking to a friend And I looked and said Oh my God Look its cops everywhere And they did not see us And I was like We better get out She was like No lets stay in here  Mark says Mark and his friend did get out of the car and were immediately handcuffed He says law enforcement officers screamed at his friend as she stood there bewildered You know where the drugs are Were going to put you up under the jailhouse Mark recalls the officers yelling at his friend  The Sale Earlier in the day 25yearold Kevin Calloway Vergil and Marks halfbrother had sold a bag of marijuana to a police informant Calloway was a student at nearby Paris Junior College and Vergil was letting him stay in his Clarksville house As Vergil stood handcuffed in the kitchen the sheriff explained the situation The sheriff said Calloways been selling drugs out of your house And I said Well if you had told me that I would have kicked him out  Vergil recounts Vergil asked to see the search warrant The question seemed to take the sheriff by surprise He said Yeah Im going to let you see it And I asked him again you know right after that and he said Im going to let you see it And I said Well OK Please let me see it  Vergil says According to Vergil the sheriff finally pulled out of his front pocket a white piece of paper about the size of a receipt flashed it in his direction and quickly stuffed it back in his pocket He then yelled at the officers Get these guys out of here In a police interrogation room a few hours later Kevin Calloway confessed to the sheriff that he kept a stash of marijuana cocaine and methamphetamine locked in the garden shed in the backyard There was just one key to the lock and Calloway kept it in his pocket On the interrogation room videotape Calloway sits elbows on his knees dejectedly looking at the floor The sheriff asks him again and again Did the others know what you were doing Calloway says eight different times during the interview that the drugs belonged to him and his brothers did not know he was dealing Hiring Lawyers Despite Calloways confession the other five members of the Richardson family present that night were charged with manufacture of a controlled substance intent to distribute and organized crime They all faced life in prison and suffered the consequence of being suspected drug dealers High school head basketball coach Vergil Richardson was fired immediately Although the family was stunned the Richardsons were not penniless They hired wellknown East Texas trial attorney Mark Lesher whose first order of business was to get District Attorney Val Varley off the case Varley was with the police when they broke down the door Not only is he dressed up  hes got a flak jacket on and an assault rifle Hes part of the raid Lesher says Val Varley declined to speak to NPR about the case But his decision to participate in the raid ended up having farreaching consequences By making himself a witness to the arrests and the gathering of evidence Varley eventually had to step aside from prosecuting the case So the judge in Clarksville John Miller asked the state attorney generals office to prosecute it Questions About The Case The state prosecutors quickly became wary of the Clarksville case One problem was that it appeared the search warrant had been issued after the raid  after Vergil Richardson had repeatedly asked the sheriff if he could see it In three different sections in the discovery it stated that the search started at approximately 1030 pm And the search warrant was signed at 1049 pm And the search was conducted before the search warrant was signed Its just illegal period Lesher says The search warrant issue potentially compromised the drug evidence found in the shed Shock Waves Through The Courthouse  Lesher the trail lawyer sent a shock wave through the small Red River County courthouse when on behalf of the Richardson brothers he filed a 2 million civil rights lawsuit against the district attorney the sheriff and the Clarksville police chief all of whom participated in the raid Then the news got even worse for Red River County The attorney generals office told Miller that the prosecutors were going to dismiss the charges against the Richardson family with the exception of Kevin Calloway who had already confessed Prosecutors wrote the judge that they were dismissing the charges in the interest of justice But the judge in the case made it clear to both the prosecutors and the defense lawyers that he had no intention of backing off A judge can sit a case but the judge cant force that case to trial Ive never seen a motion to dismiss signed and executed by the district attorney thats never been signed by the judge Its always just pro forma Lesher says State Judge John Miller refused to accept the attorney generals decision to drop the case The ruling was so unusual that it lifted legal heads around the state But the judge was just getting started He told defense lawyers that he intended to replace the attorney generals office and appoint a new special prosecutor someone who would agree to prosecute all of the members of the Richardson family not just their halfbrother Calloway Outside The Courtroom The judge approached one of Vergil Richardsons defense lawyers and asked him to step into a deserted jury room As Clyde Lee recalls Miller told him that he wanted to cut a deal According to Lee Miller offered a quid pro quo If Vergil would dismiss his civil rights lawsuit then the judge in return would dismiss the criminal charges But Vergil refused and a few weeks later the judge offered a different deal Miller then got real specific in saying that my client should testify against the other codefendants with respect to their drug activity and what he knew had to be true Lee says While it is standard for prosecutors and defense lawyers to negotiate plea deals that is not usually the judges role Miller did not respond to repeated requests by NPR for comment A History Of Not Following The Book The question remains Why would a judge insert himself so provocatively into a case Bill Hankins a reporter for The Paris News in nearby Paris Texas who has been covering the story closely thinks this case is about more than just race You know Red River County is a poor county  and I think  Miller is concerned about the lawsuit eating up funds that they dont have he says As for the repeated overtures from the judge to defense lawyer Lee outside of court Hankins says it has to be understood in the context of a small town Im going to say that it has been done many times before but it is not the proper way to do it And Im going to say that Red River County has a history of doing things probably in ways that dont follow the book Hankins says The Nightmare Ends In Hankins view the Richardsons are actually bit players in their own drama The leading roles go to the two powerful political interests in the white community  the district attorney and judge on one side and the trial lawyers on the other If Hankins theory is true the trial lawyers began to gain the upper hand after Lesher filed a motion to remove Miller from the case alleging bias And in a case of unlikely allies state prosecutors supported the defendants request to recuse the judge No dismissal hearing was held after a new judge was appointed Instead the new judge told the Texas attorney generals office to mail him the motions to dismiss which he signed recently The Richardsons threeyear nightmare was finally over But scars still remain I told my wife that I might need to go see a psychiatrist Mark says because every time a cop gets behind me theyll run my license plate They are going to stop me because those charges will show up Picking Up The Pieces Like his brother Vergil Mark Richardson had never been in trouble with the law He had always thought AfricanAmericans in East Texas exaggerated when they told stories about local law enforcement Hes a different man now Asked if he thinks what happened to him and his brother is related to their being black Mark says yes he thinks so And thats so sad because I didnt really believe that at first Mark says Thats why its so hard for me to say that but its true They dont like blacks It will take time for the Richardsons to get their lives back Vergil hopes to once again coach high school basketball Two years after he was fired his team went on to win the state championship without him As for Mark he would like to sell the house in Clarksville and put his hometown in his rearview mirror The Richardsons civil rights lawsuit against the Red River County district attorney the sheriff and the chief of police begins early next year Copyright 2014 NPR,"Tue, 23 Nov 2010 20:24:00 -0500",drugs

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130832710&ft=3&f=,In California supporters of Proposition 19 liken their cause to the lifting of prohibition on alcohol nearly 80 years ago Making pot legal and regulating it like alcohol they say could raise millions in tax revenues and wipe out the black market along with the social costs associated with it But breaking the underground trade in marijuana might not be so easy This past summer dozens of drug agents in paramilitary gear marched into a remote area of northern California west of the town of Redding As helicopters swirled over the sunbaked hills the agents used machetes to chop down more than 10000 bright green marijuana plants The plants were then lashed into 500pound bundles and airlifted out For Lt Steve Solus of the Shasta County sheriffs office this operation was one of dozens of raids on illegal pots farms this year Theres lots of water The growing temperature is just right The elevations are just right And the big thing here they have too is I5Interstate 5 Solus says All of those conditions make it easy to transport the marijuana out he says Marijuana Fields In Northern California Marijuana seizures are running at record levels in California having more than tripled since 2005 But drug agents say they are getting only a fraction of the total crop And in Californias saturated pot market dealers big and small are moving the drug out of state in ever larger quantities using everything from overnight delivery services to tractortrailers Were seeing more and more of the marijuana cultivated in California being exported where there is a market that will pay more says Bill Ruzzamenti a former special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration who now heads a regional agency that monitors drug trafficking in California Ruzzamenti says the pot cultivation boom in California began soon after voters legalized medical marijuana 14 years ago Now he believes California could be a net exporter of the drug Literally we have had shipments of marijuana from California seized in all 50 states Ruzzamenti says And theyre going to where they can maximize their profits The surging demand for Californiagrown marijuana is good news for some growers and bad news for the drug war But the trend could challenge a key goal of Proposition 19  wiping out the illegal drug trade The Effect On The Black Market A TV ad featuring former San Jose police chief Joe McNamara began airing this week claiming that if passed Proposition 19 will generate billions of dollars for local communities allow police to focus on violent crimes and put drug cartels out of business In an interview McNamara drew parallels to the repeal of alcohol prohibition Al Capone and his bootleg gangsters were shooting up the streets not because they were drunk on booze It was for the vast underworld profits And once alcohol was legalized it put them out of business as bootleggers And thats the goal of Prop 19 that would be achieved very quickly McNamara said But opponents argue the black market will persist because the measure will not change federal law or statutes in other states There are millions of plants being grown illegally says George Mull who heads the California Cannabis Association a medical marijuana group that opposes Proposition 19 A lot of it is being sent out of the state Theres no way to think that if Prop 19 passes those same people are going to register theirmarijuanagrows and then keep all of their plants here in California Mull says even if Proposition 19 passes the black market will continue because prices will stay higher in other states where pot remains illegal leaving in place a premium for smugglers Theres a great deal of incentive to sell your product where you can get a higher price Mull says The Growers Perspective NPR spoke with more than a dozen growers from big illegal players to smallscale cultivators and they agreed that the black market would persist unless marijuana is legalized at a national level One of them is an illegal grower who works in a bunkerlike growing facility located in a rural area north of San Francisco In a large garage retrofitted with vents fans and expensive air filters several rows of squat marijuana plants stand in 20gallon pots with buds about the size of golf balls almost ready for harvest The grower who spoke on the condition of anonymity has grown marijuana illegally for years He has also acted as a broker to major trafficking groups that ship thousands of pounds of pot out of California every six months He says legalization in California would force prices down and probably take street dealers out of business But higher prices for exports would keep other illegal growers and dealers afloat Even a massive crackdown by law enforcement probably would not affect the underground market Where there is demand and big profits to be made there will always be supply the man said But other growers say its not just money that keeps the black market alive The Cowboy Mentality There is a tradition that we come from here that is of the cowboy mentality And that is steeped and it runs very very deep says Gabriel Martin who runs a legal medical marijuana collective in the coastal town of Ft Bragg Calif On a recent evening Martin was busy making a batch of his special hash which requires mixing marijuana stems and leaves with crushed ice and then filtering the concoction through a washing machine Martin says many growers like himself support Proposition 19 because they are willing to trade high profits for a greater sense of security and community But he says that does not mean the underground trade will go away This is what I tell people I mean if youre going to engage in contraband sales  or private sales as we call them  that market is going to consistently exist he says Its anywhere you have finance youre going to haveablack market Parallels Between Alcohol And Marijuana Some California law enforcement officials worry that the black market could grow even stronger with criminal gangs using legalization as a cover for massive smuggling operations But former police chief McNamara says similar arguments were made against the lifting of alcohol prohibition and they proved wrong He says marijuana is no different Commercial growers would be regulated he says They would be controlled They would be subject to law enforcement And if they were illegally exporting the drug that would be against California law as well McNamara says he hopes the push for legalization will spread across the country making it easier to enforce state regulations California voters will decide for themselves on Nov 2 This story was produced as part of a collaboration between member station

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130855252&ft=3&f=,Deron Snyder is a regular contributor to The Root Banning menthol cigarettes which 80 percent of AfricanAmerican smokers prefer wont make folks quit As with virtually every other AfricanAmerican smoker I know the only acceptable brands of cigarettes for me came in greenandwhite packs If you didnt puff Salems  my cancer sticks of choice  you probably consumed Newports or Kools I always found it odd that the top three brands shared the same color scheme It took a few years to realize that menthol was another commonality which Dave Chappelle had fun with on his I Know Black People gameshow sketch on his Comedy Central show He asked contestants why blacks love menthol so much I dont know said a social worker That is correct Chappelle said No one knows for sure Whatever the reason for that preference  shared by an estimated 80 percent of black smokers according to most reports  cigarette manufacturers and antitobacco groups are well aware that we favor menthol But a proposed ban on mentholated cigarettes has caused a rift among forces that advocate on behalf of blacks interests In one corner favoring a ban are the NAACP the National African American Tobacco Prevention Network and the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council In opposition are the Congress of Racial Equality the National Black Chamber of Commerce and the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives The NAACP joined the debate last week just three days after the other groups urged the Food and Drug Administration to reject calls for a ban on menthol flavored cigarettes The issue appears to be a Catch22 You either support blacks access to a dangerousbutlegal product and arguably sustain its usage or you support discrimination against the mostly black consumers of a dangerousbutlegal product and arguably promote growth in the illicit cigarette trade I havent been a smoker for more than 20 years and have no intention of picking up the habit again But if I did and discovered that my Salems were forbidden while those disgusting Marlboros were still on sale Id be livid Why would the government ban the cigarettes that I prefer while the estimated 78 percent of nonLatino white smokers who prefer nonmentholated cigarettes are allowed to keep on puffing Were in dangerous territory when the government functions as Big Brother and the same is true when it operates as Big Daddy Lawmakers shouldnt try to legislate the behavior of grown folks on health choices such as soda fast food or mentholated cigarettes There must a middle ground between paternalism and absolute laissezfaire Im not suggesting the social acceptance of crystal meth and heroin But Prohibition didnt work too well with alcohol and ground is being gained on the legalization of marijuana in some states Cigarettes would never get legal approval if they were hitting the market today But were way past the point where the government can just outlaw them Try as it might the government cant even tax them away as evidenced by the rise of smuggling operations A Department of Justice report states that cigarette smuggling into the United   States is a significant problem that attracts international and domestic criminal groups with the lure of high profits and relatively low risk If a ban is passed the inevitable rise in illicit menthol cigarettes concerns black law officers Jessie Lee Executive Director of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives writes In Canada studies have shown that the size of the contraband market there  caused by substantial tax increases  is so substantial that it represents half of all cigarette smoking in some provinces Its an amazing statistic One of every two cigarettes sold in some areas are illegal As much as we wish that smokers would quit or never get started in the first place we have to accept their existence Weve done our best to make the habit inconvenient and socially unacceptable shunning smokers from public places indoors and outside Weve restricted tobacco manufacturers ability to market their products though cigarettes are still the most heavily advertised drug in America according to the American Academy of Pediatrics But health officials know that tobacco is a powerful adversary and cigarettes offer a persistent appeal to old and young alike A report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found 81 percent of teen smokers preferred the same three brands favored by adults Marlboro Newport and Camel More than threequarters of black high school smokers preferred Newport Banning Newports or other mentholated brands isnt the answer not unless all cigarettes are banned Education and enforcement of underage smoking laws is the best bet Other efforts to reduce cigarette use should be applied evenly across the board with the full realization that many smokers will continue to satisfy their habit  with or without government approval Copyright 2014 The Root,"Wed, 27 Oct 2010 08:29:00 -0400",drugs
NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130755883&ft=3&f=,The debate over the California initiative to legalize marijuana has formed some unlikely alliances On one side some stoners and marijuana growers oppose Proposition 19 while some cops and mothers support legalization Californians will vote whether to make recreational marijuana legal on Nov 2 Currently in the state anyone with a doctors recommendation can use pot as medicine but this initiative would allow local and state government to tax and regulate all marijuana At a garden cafe in Sonoma County Dragonfly de la Luz lights up her glass Hello Kitty pipe filled with primo California weed I get stoned every day she says through clouds of marijuana smoke De la Luz is a marijuana connoisseur for West Coast Cannabis and Skunk magazines and TVs Cannabis Planet She has a monthly column called Getting High with Dragonfly in which she reviews the latest flavors of ganja My favorite strain these days has to be Dr Walkers Daze she says Its a pretty epic mood elevator Youre instantly happy and you stay happy De la Luz says she was excited at first to hear California was trying to legalize pot I thought it was a dream come true she says Then I read it and realized it was a nightmare Shes now actively campaigning with her group Stoners Against Prop 19 She says the initiative would create too many restrictions Californians would be able to legally possess process share or transport only one ounce of pot And they would be able to grow it only in a 25squarefoot area These exotic strains that we know and love are going to quickly become obsolete because a 5by5 space is just not enough space to breed and experiment with all these new strains she says It would be a real shame if we lost all of this variety Big Business Takeover  Proposition 19 allows local governments to license commercial marijuana companies which worries selfprofessed stoners like de la LuzWere kind of like antiWalMart and antiMcDonalds she says So for them to try to sneak in and turn cannabis into a corporation thats disgusting As the election nears de la Luz has been debating opponents and trying to convince other pot smokers Her arguments worked on a man who calls himself Ali Baba whos in California for the marijuana harvest season and stopped by to share a few joints This particular cannabis this Dr Walkers Daze this beautiful frosty sativa bud Im holding did not come from a licensed dispensary de la Luz tells him Under Prop 19 it would be illegal for me to possess and smoke this It looks a lot more like freedom today in California than it would be if Prop 19 were to pass Why would it be illegal Ali Baba asks Because Prop 19 prohibits possession of cannabis that was bought anywhere other than a licensed dispensary she explains Wow he says Theyre really trying to capitalize on this industry You guys better vote no Hallelujah brother says de la Luzs friend Chris Wilson as he highfives Ali Baba Wilson says hes a smalltime grower who ekes out a living cultivating medical marijuana for himself and a collectiveIts borderline legal illegal grayarea stuff he says breeding high strain high quality high medicinal marijuana in a sacred way Wilson says Proposition 19 would put him out of business He wouldnt be able to grow enough to supply himself much lessthe collective And hed have to pay taxes and fees to operate Theyre going to tax the hell out of meWilson says And I barely make it as it is Im just getting by Theyre taxing everybody they can just because California is in debt They see the money can be made like unbelievable taxation enough to push me out of business Another grower named Jay doesnt want to use his last name because part of his crop ends up on the black market He cultivates his plants in his garage like so many others in a cottage industry of momandpop pot growers who fuel the economies of Mendocino Humboldt and Trinity countiesknown as the Emerald Triangle in Northern California Jay worries that legalization will flood the market as people grow their own marijuana and bigger businesses take over Everyones really scared of the prices going down he says We all have invested money here we all live here I have a daughter here my wifes a teacher Everyones scared because we dont know what the prices are going to be Already the prices have gone down and down Its harder to sell it Like many who live off the grid in Mendocino Michael Dork grows his pot outdoors He says he doesnt want to live by anybody elses rules I really dont want to be on the map AndI think it would affect the high I believe more in being free of all that stuff he says Cops Say Yes On the other side Proposition 19 also has some unlikely allies a group of former judges prosecutors and cops are all for legalizing pot No one in the history of marijuana use has ever died of an overdose from marijuana says Stephen Downing a retired deputy chief of the LAPD Downing says marijuana is less harmful than alcohol or tobacco And he says arresting people for possessing marijuana is a waste of time for police he says instead they should be solving violent crimes and targeting those controlling the black market Marijuana provides 95 percent of the cartels profits says Downing citing the hundreds of murders along the USMexico border attributed to the drug cartels And theyre using the hundreds of thousands of gang members to bring about  their distribution their collections their enforcement and their  assassinations We have a major major violence problem and if we take the cartels profits away were going to start drying them up Downing says taxing and regulating marijuana would be a start William Cox is another member of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition or LEAP The former LAPD sergeant and LA county district attorney says officers are more likely to bust young AfricanAmericans and Latinos on marijuana charges The white kids are not swept up in this because they are able to have the resources to get out of it if they are caught Cox says Police officers often will let them off the hook if they catch them with a small amount of marijuana If they are white middleclass and acting respectfully toward the officers theyre told to go home Moms Against Prohibition The push to legalize recreational marijuana has other unlikely supporters moms A small group of mothers gathered at a childrens playground in West  Hollywood last week to advocate for regulation Among them was Skyla Chapman who brought her yearandahalfold daughter Isis to the Yes on 19 event When its regulated then its no longer in the drug dealers hands Its in respectable businesses hands Theyll card or ID you she says Proposition 19 would ban smoking pot on school grounds and around minors Only adults older than 21 could possess cultivate or transport marijuana for personal use Marijuana activist Dale Sky Jones who is eight months pregnant saysher groupis following the lead of mothers in the 1930s who helped end the ban on alcohol Prohibition ended because of moms Jones says They knew the true danger from prohibition violence profits illegality This is an opportunity to end a failed policy Jones says Proposition 19 would put marijuana sales out of the hands of criminals and in the hands of those that will control cannabis away from children If Proposition 19 passes California would make history as the first state to legalize recreational marijuana But with some moms for it and some stoners just saying no its a complicated issue that many voters are still trying

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130185883&ft=3&f=,In Washington theyre arguing about taxing rich people Much like the debate in Congress about extending the socalled Bush tax cuts a ballot initiative in Washington state comes down to the question of whether top earners should pay more in taxes The initiative would create the states first personal income tax since the 1930s It would apply only to individuals who make more than 200000 a year or couples making at least 400000 The initiative has triggered an argument between some of the states wealthiest citizens with Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his father favoring the tax and current Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Amazoncoms Jeff Bezos lined up against it Thats just one of several initiatives related to taxes that are on the Washington state ballot this November Across the country voters will decide on measures regarding union organizing smoking bans and whether they want to block the new federal health care law A Lot About Pot As opposed to recent election cycles theres not one issue that stands out as dominant across numerous states like gay marriage or minimumwage increases in past years But medical marijuana initiatives which have cropped up in many states are on the ballot in Arizona and South Dakota Oregon which has already approved medical marijuana usage will decide whether to create dispensaries as a way to let people buy it Californias Proposition 19 meanwhile would legalize marijuana sales If that measure passes Oregon state Rep Peter Buckley said Monday he would introduce similar legislation in his state next year The motivation for Buckley as with most elected officials in California who are backing Proposition 19 is the possibility of collecting tax revenue from legal regulated sales of pot Its Money That Matters Fiscal questions in fact have emerged as atop issuein ballot measures this year Voters in Massachusetts will decide whether to cut their own sales taxes by more than half to 3 percent They will also decide whether to repeal a tax on alcohol In Missouri voters statewide will decide whether a local income tax imposed by St Louis and Kansas City should be subject to local voter approval Californians will choose not only whether to tax marijuana sales but whether to erect taller hurdles preventing the Legislature from imposing all manner of fees and charges There are efforts to increase revenues and to cut taxes says Jennifer Drage Bowser who tracks ballot measures for the National Conference of State Legislatures There are just a lot of things with big dollar signs associated with them Voters dont automatically embrace the idea of lower taxes Massachusetts voters in 2008 overwhelmingly rejected a measure to abolish the state income tax This past May Arizona voters approved a penny increase in the state sales tax But Bowser points out that the mood may have shifted given the continuing problems in the economy and rise of the Tea Party movement Who Pays The Bill Ballot initiatives have become a big money concern themselves Campaign spending in support of a single initiative can reach into the tens of millions of dollars Most initiatives reach the ballot as the result of paid signature gatherers not volunteer efforts They are often sponsored by people or groups who have a direct financial interest in their outcome  often from out of state Charles and David Koch oil billionaires in Kansas gave 1 million earlier this month to support Proposition 23 which would suspend Californias global warming law that seeks to reduce energy consumption and emissions until the states unemployment rate drops below 55 percent The American Beverage Association has spent more than 14 million seeking to defeat Washingtons initiative to impose beverage and candy taxes Also in Washington retailers and beer distributors are spending millions attacking each others arguments about two separate initiatives that would privatize sales of alcohol Were not shying away from the fact that retailers will certainly find some financial benefit about this says Ashley Bach spokesman for one of the initiative campaigns But he says The no side has received three times the amount of money that we have Letting The Voters Decide In other words ballot measures sometimes amount to interest group warfare by other means The idea that impassioned volunteer citizens are collecting signatures is a romantic notion says Bowser of NCSL The initiative process is owned  lock stock and barrel  by the moneyed interests There are very few exceptions to that Paul Jacob president of Citizens in Charge which promotes the initiative process does not agree There are certainly moneyed interests behind many ballot measures Jacob says but he points out that they dont always win Its still up to the voters This year Jacob notes a number of measures were put there by legislatures themselves Theyve seen that contentious measures that win voter approval can have a lot more impact  and influence in other states  than laws passed by politicians themselves Its this desire to affect the national debate at the state level Jacob says They want voters to be focused on it They want that success at the ballot box not just in the legislature Copyright 2014 NPR,"Fri, 01 Oct 2010 14:56:00 -0400",drugs
NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129930970&ft=3&f=,Marijuana advocates have been arguing for years that pot is not only harmless but has beneficial qualities Such claims are having an effect Fewer than half of Americans think marijuana should be legalized  but just barely half The most recent Gallup and CBS News polls on this topic both show that 44 percent favor legalization Compare that with roughly 25 percent in favor from the late 1970s into the mid1990s The change in attitude toward pot shows up not only in polls but in use A survey released Thursday by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration showed that use of illegal drugs rose last year to the highest levels in nearly a decade Marijuana use was most prevalent but ecstasy and methamphetamine posted gains too Drug policy experts say this reflects changes in the perceived risks of taking drugs  both of being caught and of suffering societal disapproval A California initiative to legalize marijuana this November would amplify this effect if it passes There is such a push on the part of the marijuana lobby to soften up the public says Eric Voth a physician who chairs the Institute on Global Drug Policy an antidrug alliance of physicians scientists and attorneys The perception of harm has dropped You saw this increase in pot first and now youre seeing this increase in ecstasy and meth Taking It To The States Fourteen states and the District of Columbia allow people to use marijuana for medical purposes such as improving the appetite of cancer and AIDS patients What people are responding to is the realization that the government has been lying for decades and that marijuana is less harmful than legal drugs like alcohol and tobacco says Mike Meno communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project which favors legalization Medical marijuana has become big business Americans are spending 25 billion a year on marijuana according to Harvard University economist Jeffrey Miron The number of patients and licensed dispensers has doubled over the past year in Rhode Island alone In July the Oakland City Council approved construction of four industrialsized marijuana factories Last month the Boulder County SWAT team destroyed 7500 marijuana plants  about five football fields worth But medical marijuana remains a growth industry in Colorado Next week doctors dispensers and marketing experts will gather at a downtown Denver hotel for the Plant Medicine Expo  Healthcare Provider Conference Its way beyond legalizing Voth says The medical excuse opened the door What Goes Down Must Come Up Voth and other drug war veterans say theyve seen this all before During the 1970s about a dozen states decriminalized marijuana Eventually the eras spike in drug use  particularly cocaine  prompted harsher laws under the Reagan administration and a parents movement that forced a crackdown Use of marijuana and other illegal drugs reached their peak in the late 1970s In 1979 1 out of every 3 high school seniors was smoking dope on a regular basis according to Herbert Kleber a Columbia University psychiatrist who served as deputy drug czar under President George HW Bush That number dropped markedly during the early 1990s With people witnessing fewer ill effects due to diminished drug use it started to seem safe again to indulge Drug use isstill nowhere near the levels of the 1970s but the latest figures mark a reversal nonetheless Its not so much that the rise is so great as that it contrasts with the long period of decline says Lloyd Johnston a social psychologist at the University of Michigan Clearly that decade of improvement has come to a halt Changes In Attitude Those who oppose recreational use of marijuana blame the wellorganized and funded campaign to normalize it Attitudes for all kinds of reasons have been softening about the risks and dangers of marijuana says John Carnevale an economist and drug policy consultant who has worked on the issue during both Republican and Democratic administrations including those of presidents Clinton and Reagan Drugs that enjoy a patina of medical approval  whether marijuana or prescription drugs such as OxyContin which has seen enormous growth in recreational use  seem safe or at least safer than street drugs If doctors prescribe them how bad can they be The idea that smoking is medicine is an indicator in the minds of young users that this is not harmful Carnevale says Looking To California California voters who approved a pioneering medical marijuana initiative in 1996 will soon decide whether to legalize marijuana altogether Novembers Proposition 19 has not yet attracted the same number of wealthy outofstate backers such as financier George Soros as the earlier initiative But it has garnered support from a number of state and local officials eager for the billions in tax revenues that legalized pot promises to generate On Monday the Service Employees International Unions California State Council  one of the biggest public employee unions in the state  endorsed Proposition 19 Polls indicate the proposition has roughly a 5050 chance of passing Both marijuana advocates and opponents agree that passage would have an enormous impact with other states likely to follow suit and the drug becoming more readily available to young people If California were to pass Proposition 19 it would be revolutionary says Meno the Marijuana Policy Project spokesman People would see that the sky doesnt fall the police will have more resources to fight crimes and there will be more revenues for local budgets Future Growth  Or Backlash Its not clear how the Obama administration which announced last year that it would end the Bush administration policy of routinely raiding medical marijuana dispensaries would react to outright legalization in one state Every former chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration has called on Attorney General Eric Holder to oppose the initiative I dont expect to see us returning to a drug war hysteria under an Obama administration says Miron the Harvard economist But he adds If Proposition 19 passes some Republicans will get energized and demand that theres a federal response The Obama administration will be in a pickle if that happens They dont want to be fighting over that issue but they dont want to be seen as too much in the prodrug camp Robert L DuPont president of the Institute for Behavior and Health says that regardless of the outcome in California marijuana advocates have already won by shifting the terms of debate and increasing acceptance of drug use He predicts that illegal drug use will continue to rise But DuPont who served as a top drug policy official under Presidents Nixon Ford and Carter also predicts that increasing use will in time bring tolerance to an end Im confident these folks have created the reaction that will stop them he says The datas going to get worse in coming years and thats going to recreate the bipartisan opposition to illegal drug use that we saw between 1979 and 1991 Copyright 2014 NPR,"Sat, 18 Sep 2010 07:41:00 -0400",drugs

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129578732&ft=3&f=,Republicans have been tagged as the Party of No  unfairly they argue despite what their Democratic opponents say is persuasive evidence to the contrary But soon the party  which has employed a disciplined manthebarricades strategy in attempts to block White House legislative efforts from a health care overhaul to Wall Street reforms  will unveil a midterm agenda  And in a campaign climate that increasingly favors their party Republican leaders in the House have insisted that the plan will include specific initiatives on how they would tackle the economy spending and of course health care law  or the repeal or rollback of the overhaul advocated by President Obama and his fellow Democrats Whatever we include in this agenda will be something that we will fight to accomplish  a list of deliverables that have the support of the American people says Brendan Buck of the House Republicans legislative initiatives office House Minority Leader John Boehner appearing to position himself as speakerinwaiting in recent highly publicized speeches has begun to prepare the ground for the partys plan knocking White House economic policy and committing to the war in Afghanistan But despite promisingforRepublicans midterm election polls and prognostications the agenda is being written for a party thats in flux and increasingly fragmented  not only buffeted by the Tea Party fiscal conservatives who have helped dump party regulars like incumbent Alaska Sen Lisa Murkowski but also pressured by loyalists alarmed at the partys direction Republicans have been united strongly on what theyre against not what theyre for says Donald Kettl dean of the University of Marylands public policy school and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution Their challenge is to galvanize around an agenda Kettl says a task he characterizes as complicated by the partys emerging and evolving factions And that includes the one represented by the huge crowd of Tea Party activists and others who showed up Saturday for conservative radio and Fox News Channel talk show host Glenn Becks religiousthemed rally on Washingtons National Mall  a gathering that writer Christopher Hitchens suggested reflected white unease in a rapidly changing country  Not Quite Contract With America The Sequel The new GOP agenda is yet unbranded  the party has been collecting suggestions on a website it calls America Speaking Out But please dont call it a newcentury Contract with America the seminal 1994 manifesto issued by thenHouse Minority Whip Newt Gingrich just weeks before Republicans won surprise control of the House  the partys first majority in the chamber in four decades What will come from Republicans in midSeptember when Congress returns from its summer break will be its own document Buck says And it will be one that party leaders say they hope will help galvanize a message and support but very likely wont be as bold as the 94 contract Though politicos continue to debate the Contract with Americas effect on the 1994 midterm election  well be fighting about that forever says Kettl  there is no argument that it provided GOP lawmakers with a legislative blueprint after their unexpected takeover of the House  While the antigovernment sentiment today is similar to that of the mid1990s when Democrat Bill Clinton occupied the White House experts argue that there are more differences in the current political world than similarities to that time Todays economy is in much worse shape and Republican agendawriters face unique and decidedly delicate intraparty issues that didnt exist back then say experts like Kettl and James Gimpel both of whom have written extensively about the original Contract with America The biggest difference between now and then is that in 1994 there were only one or two people who thought that a Republican takeover of the House was even possible says Gimpel a University of Maryland government professor and former Capitol Hill staffer Now polls and other indicators suggest that a takeover by Republicans is possible and maybe even likely says Gimpel author of Legislating Revolution The Contract with America In Its First 100 Days That seems to me to place a little more weight on the agenda He and others have described the original Contract with America as a set of slogans to draw together the GOP caucus  not a document most expected they would have to act on The growing possibility that the party could win the House suggests Gimpel says that the new document might not be as impressive as the Contract with America in terms of its reach and boldness The original contract set out 10 legislative initiatives from balancing the budget and overhauling the welfare system to requiring congressional term limits and placing limits on adjudicated punitive damages The lasting effect of the original contract outside of the welfare overhaul  which Clinton appropriated as his success  is also debatable Though Gingrich as speaker brought all of the contracts issues to votes in his first 100 days most died in the Senate or on the presidents desk Gingrich resigned after the party suffered damaging losses in the 1998 midterms  Kettl coauthor of Fine Print The Contract With America Devolution and the Administrative Realities of American Federalism argues that the contracts biggest legacy may be simply that it happened and served as a rallying cry for Republicans and told the country where the party stood Its most immediate legacy however was the 1996 reelection of Clinton and the resulting fragmentation of politics he says Though its wrong to blame the contract for all of that the ensuing political battles have taken us to a very bad place for government What Will It Say Republican leaders remain circumspect about the precise ambitions of their agenda including whether it will delve into the sensitive social issues of samesex marriage for example or address some Tea Party activists desires including phasing out Social Security and shuttering the Department of Education But it is almost certain to include pledges to reduce the deficit rein in spending create jobs roll back  or repeal  the recent health care overhaul and crack down on illegal immigration That last issue remains a hot button on the campaign trail despite evidence that as the Pew Hispanic Center reported Wednesday the number of illegal immigrants in the US has fallen for the first time in 20 years thanks in large part to increased enforcement along the borders and tough economic times that have made jobs harder to get The economy has given Republicans plenty of fodder The national unemployment rate has remained stubbornly close to 10 percent and the Census Bureau reported this week that federal domestic spending increased by a record 16 percent last year to 32 trillion Much of that the bureau reported was due to aid to the unemployed and the economic stimulus package  California Republican Rep Kevin McCarthy who chairs the America Speaking Out project has used the metaphor of a Washington drunk with power where elites are living the good life while Main Street is choked with fear and anxiety Those themes are expected to run through the Republican agenda Currently that image of America is being promoted by GOP House members in Speaking Out town meetings across the country The No 1 issue that weve been hearing across the country has been the economy  the lack of jobs the uncertainty out there thats hurting investing and hurting job creation and the deficit McCarthy said Wednesday The House GOP agenda he says wont just be triggered to what happens after the election It will also include legislation that leaders plan to introduce before then You will see legislation introduced and pushed that will help create jobs and control spending McCarthy added The blueprint will also include measures McCarthy said that look to the reform of Washington itself including requirements for reading proposed bills Republicans have already said they will push for that Read the Bill legislation which would require that bills be posted online for 72 hours before being submitted for a final vote in the House Democratic leaders have stymied the proposal At the Speaking Out website which has been subject to some online hazing proponents of legalizing marijuana for example have mounted an impressive effort to get that on the GOP agenda turning back the health care overhaul fiscal discipline and deporting illegal immigrants have been common themes New World Anger Democratic pollster and strategist Doug Schoen suggests that Republicans would be welladvised to stick with basic fiscal issues that have driven the Tea Party movement but steer clear of the more controversial positions taken by some of the movements favorites including GOP Senate candidates Rand Paul in Kentucky and Sharron Angle in Nevada What is animating and motivating people are fiscal issues says Schoen who with conservativeleaning pollster Scott Rasmussen has written a new book Mad As Hell How the Tea Party Movement Is Fundamentally Remaking Our TwoParty System The book is scheduled for release Sept 14 Since the Republican Party itself has been largely bereft of ideas the Tea Parties provide it an outline for an agenda if not a program he says From where I sit its critically important to the health of the Republican Party that it adhere to Tea Party fiscal principles as articulated Schoen also scolds Democrats for failing to respond to fiscal issues that motivated Tea Party adherents and for not competing for a segment of those voters  especially during the past year when the unpopularity of the Republican Party as a whole rivaled the disdain heaped on Democrats According to USA TodayGallup survey results released Wednesday more people now trust Republicans when it comes to the economy and jobs Rasmussen the pollster says that if he were giving Republicans advice it would be this Say you will vote to repeal health care but replace it with more popular reforms  people want health care reform Come up with something on jobs and the economy but put it in the context of why increasing government spending is bad for the economy for your children and grandchildren he also advises Anything you talk about that moves away from the economy spending and the deficit dilutes the message Im not saying that this is healthy for the nation Rasmussen says but its a good political strategy Bottom line he says Whatever the agenda says they better be prepared to act on it And as Gingrich discovered and GOP leaders are no doubt learning an agenda can be a very tricky thing indeed Copyright

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128461367&ft=3&f=,Lenny McAllister is a syndicated political commentator and the author of the book Diary of a Mad Black PYC Proud Young Conservative He is featured regularly on outlets including CNN Fox News and XM Radio How can a former constitutional law professor an attorney general and an iconic organization get it so wrong on civil rights When you look at it it is hard to tell if the White House the Department of Justice and the NAACP are merely a collective sign of the times or the reasons why the times are sadly changing Over the course of the past week all three iconic institutions have corrupted the legacy of civil rights activism in America using their efforts to support legal initiatives that pervert the legacy of black civil rights leaders with selfserving and misguided political efforts that if successful will corrupt the definitions of right and wrong in our nation President Barack Obamas initial criticism of Arizonas SB 1070 illegal immigration law has grown from publicly speaking out against the bill himself to allowing Mexicos President Felipe Caldern to rail against the bill from the floor of the US Congress Now President Obamas objection to the law has prompted a lawsuit from the Department of Justice against the Arizona statute The lawsuit alleges that this state law supersedes federal law on illegal immigration which by the way it does not  it merely enforces federal law and charges that the law will discriminate against Spanishspeaking people  including the illegal immigrants that the law targets under conditions Of late rumors have been swirling of presidential amnesty for illegal immigrants US Sen James Inhofe ROkla charged that the president is using the issue of border security as a ploy to win amnesty for undocumented workers currently residing in the United States In the midst of all this the Department of Justice lawsuit comes across to many political conservatives and moderates as a political maneuver to gain support for the Obama administration as it attempts to shape immigration reform in the partisan selfserving fashion that health care and stimulus bills were passed so far This effort has been supported by Obama supporters including Rev Al Sharpton activists who have promised to bring people to Arizona to protest  in the spirit of the Freedom Riders from the civil rights movement This is notably troubling considering that the civil rights of noncitizens of the United States have remained a driving factor in the move to file this lawsuit a move that says as much about the White Houses political motives as it does about the incorrectly fluid definitions of civil rights and human rights within the administration and its supporters on the left The political zeal for this lawsuit against Arizona contrasts suspiciously with the lack of Justice Department action against the New Black Panther Party over voter intimidation tactics used during the 2008 presidential election These acts of intimidation at the polls were documented repeatedly on film activity committed by individuals that had no shame in being recorded while spewing their hatred for white Americans Yet Attorney General Eric Holders department has repeatedly refused to file charges against principal actors from the 2008 events despite continued complaints for some sort of action in the spirit and defense of civil rights for all Americans particularly those in the process of practicing their civil right to vote The departments silence in this instance rings of hollow political expedience and whimsical preconditions of what constitutes civil rights violations in todays America  criteria defined by the powers that be not the power for equality entailed in the Constitution When the Department of Justice is capable of determining that the rights of noncitizens must be championed as it condones American citizens being intimidated and threatened while enacting their right to vote we are approaching a point in America where justice is too subjective to be counted on to provide stability and equality for our citizens on a regular basis Whereas the Obama administration can blame political allegiances on their willingness to blur the criteria needed to defend of civil rights the California chapter of the NAACP is doing so out of activism laziness Instead of taking on the growing issue of drug use and its destructive impact on black America the NAACP has instead called the legalization of marijuana in the Golden State a civil rights issue due to the high rates of arrests of young black men around the possession and distribution of cannabis in a workaround of the problem of black youth criminalization A onceproud organization that championed the rights of poor black people that needed a pathway out of deplorable conditions to a standard of equality now facilitates justice through changing a law that in essence will lower the standard for folks it claims to advocate for The civil rights issue with black criminalization around the drug trade is ultimately not centered on the amount of arrests made in the black community as changing the definition of crime does not change the conditions of these men Instead the civil rights issue missed by the NAACP is centered on the conditions that make the drug life more appealing and available to young black men than education family unity and career advancementall items that the NAACP used to be more focused on than legalizing crime and community decay All three instances exhibit a growing willingness of black leaders within America to leverage the legacy of successes of the civil rights movement and use the historical weight to guide the pursuit of American civil rights away from equality and justice and toward selfprescribed definitions of what is right and wrong based on pop politics and eroding social values The power driving the civil rights movement of the 20th century was its incorruptible view of justice a trait that allowed its leaders to appeal to the conscience of the world while leveraging the timelessness of the Constitution to forge past the injustices black people suffered Today the call to secure civil rights for people has been spread to political and social offshoots that would make our ancestors cringe should they witness the subjectivity of such contemporary mattersall while we miss grand opportunities before us to stand for civil rights and true justice even if the choices to do so are difficult as they were years ago These current decisions to advocate for civil rights only works to corrode the moral authority that black America garnered over the course of history with the abolition movement Reconstruction the Jim Crow Era and the civil rights movement of the 20th century We are in need of a new civil rights movement  in politics social activism and community redevelopment  but not one that pursues civil rights

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127746216&ft=3&f=,Marijuana use is not on the rise At least thats the gist of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health done every year by the US Department of Health and Human Services In 2008  the most recent data available  61 percent of Americans 12 and older admitted using marijuana in the previous month   In absolute terms that number is probably low after all this survey asks people to admit to using illegal drugs  But the real significance of the number is that its steady  its been hovering right around 6 percent since 2002 Drug researchers say the real percentage may be higher but its probably holding steady too And yet during those same years marijuana has been edging toward legitimacy States with medical marijuana laws have made it possible for thousands of people to buy pot over the counter in actual stores Some police departments have started deemphasizing marijuana arrests Critics of liberalization believe this inevitably leads to greater consumption Its axiomatic says John Lovell a lobbyist for California police chiefs Hes also helping to organize the campaign against an initiative in California to make marijuana legal for adults Anytime you take a product  any product  from a less convenient sales forum to a more convenient sales forum use increases Lovell says But cities where marijuana have been liberalized have not seen a spike in consumption so far In 2003 voters in Seattle made marijuana the lowest law enforcement priority for city police Researchers tracked the results  Caleb BantaGreen studies drug use trends at the University of Washingtons Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute He says selfreported consumption and potrelated emergency room visits remained flat before during and after the initiative went into effect BantaGreen says he gets similar reports from drug researchers in other cities   Im not hearing stories on a regular basis that There was liberalization in marijuana policies and soon afterwards usage rates increased dramatically  he says   At the same time says BantaGreen places like Seattle already had high rates of pot consumption before enforcement was relaxed so its not surprising that there was no big increase Teenage Perspective And opponents of liberalization say even if overall consumption stays flat looser enforcement may increase pot smoking among minors They point to places such as Californias Bay Area where medical marijuana is commonplace and enforcement is lax  Teenagers rarely have trouble finding pot Some get it from dispensaries far more just buy it from a friend or classmate I could call 10 people right now and theyd all have a drug dealer says one teenager who declined to give his name As in Seattle Berkeley voters made pot arrests the lowest priority for police but they did it nearly 25 years earlier Still Berkeley school officials were shocked last year when they saw results from the statewide California Healthy Kids survey of student drug use Sixtythree percent of the districts 11th graders reported smoking pot in their lifetime  20 points higher than the state average Another high school boy a selfdescribed stoner who also spoke on the condition his name not be used isnt surprised by that number   You can definitely get it anywhere And that leads kids to smoke more and that leads kids to buy more and that leads other dealers to sell more and cannabis clubs to sell more  So its definitely growing a lot he says But even though the rate of teenage pot smoking in Berkeley is high its also been stable The survey shows it as does the experience of high school teacher Mark Harringer I havent seen a marked increase or decrease either way Harringer says He thinks kids just get the impression consumption is growing because as they grow older theyre more likely to encounter friends using drugs Ive even asked kids before as well What percentage of your class do you think uses marijuana or drinks alcohol or smokes cigarettes  Harringer says And more often than not they inflate the number almost triple than what the actual percentage is Some Statistics May Be Disturbing But even if overall consumption is stable other numbers are increasing At the University of Washington BantaGreen says the Seattle area has seen an increase in the number of people getting treatment for pot addiction That is of the people entering treatment an increasing percentage cite marijuana as their primary addiction Similar increases are being seen in San Francisco and Los Angeles where marijuana dispensaries have boomed in the past couple of years Its not clear what the increase means BantaGreen says it might have something to do with more probation violators being sent to treatment instead of jail when they test positive for pot   When it comes to illegal drugs he says its just hard to get reliable measurements of overall consumption  even in areas where the drug has been liberalized But its not impossible BantaGreen has been part of a project that measures the traces of illegal drugs in sewer water Hes been analyzing the wastewater in 20 cities to get a measure of overall consumption of certain hard drugs  And hed like to start testing that water for pot too if he can get the funding This story includes reporting by Sayre Quevedo of Youth Radio which trains young journalists Copyright 2014

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2010/06/09/127593127/pot-delivery-services-cropping-up-across-california?ft=3&f=,As communities across California crack down on medical marijuana dispensaries a new business model has emerged companies that will deliver pot directly to your doorstep At a oneroom packaging facility east of San Francisco a worker in latex gloves pulls four brilliant green pot buds from a vacuumsealed bag She delicately places them on a small scale as her boss looks on Hes a local real estate developer who publicly uses the assumed name of Matthew Lawrence for his marijuana business He says the pot will be shipped to customers around the state in unmarked packages During the business week any orders placed by 1 pm get there by midday the next day via courier Lawrence says This might seem like an illegal drug den  but so far Californias medical marijuana laws dont cover this type of operation And delivery is booming amid a backlash against storefront dispensaries This week hundreds of medical marijuana dispensaries in Los Angeles face a deadline to close or risk criminal charges And hundreds of other cities and towns in California have banned dispensaries altogether No ones gone as far as Lawrence in trying to build a legal statewide delivery network He says his company  named c420  has signed up 1000 patients since April some are seriously ill others are what he calls the suits They have families kids who know parents who know each other They see each other in the baseball field and they really dont want to be seen going into a dispensary just because they have migraines and they like to smoke a little marijuana once in a while in order to alleviate that condition or whatever the condition might be Lawrence says There are hundreds of potdelivery services now advertising on websites like BudTrader and WeedMaps And not just in California Delivery services are a growing alternative to brickandmortar storefronts in many of the states that have legalized medical marijuana Lawrence says Allen St Pierre with the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws says As these Main Street dispensaries raise the ire of law enforcement and local politicians delivering patienttopatient or businesstopatient would appear to be the trend that is emerging around the United States Lots Of Delivery Services But Few Rules Driving the trend in California is a growing abundance of medical marijuana and a lack of statewide regulations covering how it can be legally distributed So its not surprising that many new delivery services are flourishing in places that have restricted or banned storefront dispensaries like Los Angeles Take Dann Halem and the nonprofit delivery service he founded called Artists Collective Each week Halem logs hundreds of miles on LA freeways to fill phone and Internet orders He says he started Artists Collective because dispensaries were underserving seriously ill patients The people who medical marijuana is truly meant for are not well enough to go into a store to get it Halem says So its absolutely critical for there to be delivery services in some way shape or form He says most of his patients arent on deaths door  and the reality is that just about any adult in California can get a doctors recommendation for medical pot or for that matter go into the delivery business To start a delivery service whether your intentions are good or bad you need a car a cell phone and marijuana Thats not the way we operate but Id say the majority of delivery services at this point are essentially just that And they really are in a lot of respects glorified drug dealers because theres no oversight theres no accreditation theres nothing Halem says In fact for some underground dealers starting medical marijuana delivery services is a way to come out of the shadows Pot Parties For Patients On a recent afternoon at one former pot dealers home in an upscale section of Los Angeles guests nibbled on a buffet of fruit bagels and pastries while others crowded into a backyard studio These are bongs pipes whatever you want help yourself she tells her guests The woman agreed to show us her operation provided we not reveal her name or where she works in Los Angeles To comply with state law she formed a nonprofit patients collective last year  She then started throwing parties like this one to transform her former customers into medicalpot patients She had a physician on hand to evaluate the guests and then sign off on recommendations for medical marijuana  all for 100 each Later the woman made a round of deliveries to these customers turned patients She met up with a man waiting in his car in a Starbucks parking lot And she made another delivery in a nearby office building How much of this is legal is debatable Advocates argue that laws enacted after California voters passed the Compassionate Use Act in 1996 cover transportation and distribution of medical pot though not across state lines But Joseph Esposito of the Los Angeles District Attorneys Office says state law doesnt sanction largescale distribution I dont see anything that suggests that when voters passed the Compassionate Use Act that they envisioned storefronts delivery services Esposito says Dispensary Owners Worry About Safety Some longtime medical marijuana advocates worry that a legal freeforall in delivery services is allowing unsavory elements to enter the trade Weve had a lot of problems with I call it the wingnut crowd who look at this as a moneymaking operation says Lynette Shaw who runs one of the states oldest medical marijuana dispensaries in the Marin County town of Fairfax That town tightly controls Shaws operations but those rules dont cover delivery services based outside the area She says theyre trying to muscle in on her business So shes asking local authorities to allow her storefront to make home deliveries in order to compete I want to make sure my patients are safe  and when you call someone to your home that you have someone whose background is researched that theyre licensed and regulated Shaw says Thats one reason Halem of the Artists Collective in Los Angeles wants city officials to regulate the delivery trade He says hes asked but gotten no response We would welcome oversight because we know that we qualify and we know that we have nothing to be afraid of he says But at this point says Los Angeles City Councilman Dennis Zine the citys new medical marijuana regulations dont address delivery services This was never a factor in our debate Zine says Zine says that the move to restrict dispensaries was driven by complaints from community groups and law enforcement and that so far there havent been many complaints about delivery services Whos going to complain The person whos receiving the marijuana is not going to complain The person whos delivering is not going to complain The neighbor is not going to complain because they dont know whats going on Zine says That could be changing This week at least one Los Angeles City Council member called for an investigation and possible emergency measures against potdelivery services Action by the council is pending This story was coreported by Gary Cohn as part of a collaboration between member station KQED and the Center for Investigative Reportings

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127538267&ft=3&f=,For decades marijuana growers in Northern California have received reports of pending police raids from a local community radio station and citizens wary of the drug war Now police  citing a boom in marijuana production and a possible influx of armed illegal drug traffickers  say the practice needs to stop As summer looms pot growers in the Northern California counties of Humboldt and Mendocino are preparing the ground for another growing season Meanwhile local state and federal agents are poised to deploy helicopters and trucks to raid illegal operations Tracking Law Enforcement  In a radio broadcast like many others in this areas pot war a female announcer recently issued this alert According to a citizens observation at 845 am three helicopters were seen heading from Laytonville to Bell Spring Road Reports like this one alert the stations listeners  which include both legal and illegal pot growers  to the movements of police and drug agents on the ground and in the air Ending the segment the host said To report sightings such as these you can call the civil liberties monitoring project at a local phone number These reports are a staple on KMUD a community radio station based in southern Humboldt County The broadcasts began after the Reagan administration ramped up drug raids in the region known as Californias pot capital KMUD program director Marianne Knorzer says the reports are part of the stations broader commitment to progressive politics government accountability and public safety Were not broadcasting their whole operations Knorzer says Were just giving the public an awareness that there are 10 trucks heading down a very narrow road with onelane portions of it with tight turns Again our reports are quite benign Who Would Have Blood On Their Hands Law enforcement officials have put up with the broadcasts for years  but times are changing As more pot is grown legally under Californias medical marijuana laws theres also been an influx of new marijuana growers to Northern California And some run huge illegal growing operations on federal land Mendocino County Sheriff Tom Allman worries that the radio reports could tip them off  and he wants the broadcasts to end I hope theyre not going to say This is my land dont come here  Allman says But what if that did happen you know And what if somebody did get hurt Either that citizen or a law enforcement officer Well who would have blood on their hands Recently in downtown Garberville Allman met with representatives from both KMUD and the local group that gathers the reports on police operations As a man with a matted beard and wizened face played a violin outside the meeting hall Allman tried to strike a conciliatory note Addressing the group he acknowledged past abuses by police and expressed a wariness at federal drug operations  I dont like Black Hawks in my county I really dont Allman said referring to the helicopters used by federal agents  But if we lost a local state or federal law enforcement officer when it was determined that a local radio station had broadcast they were coming up the driveway I believe were setting ourselves up for something bad Allmans appeal to rethink the broadcasts was met with polite skepticism from the audience which included activist Jared Rossman  I congratulate law enforcement for responding because there were a lot of years of intense fear Rossman said at the meeting He then asked Have any law enforcement  local state or federal  been hurt in these two counties over the past 25 years In response Allman said Last year was the first year in a decade that we actually took rounds during the execution of a search warrant It was a total Mexican grow theres no question about it Were finding notes were getting death threats in ways that we never got before Were seeing a resistance now that we havent seen ever Sheriff Vs Station A Standoff The KMUD office occupies a rambling onestory house just behind a gas station in the tiny hamlet of Redway In some ways the station reflects how the debate over marijuana has shifted with more people accepting the idea of legal medical pot  including Sheriff Allman whos a frequent guest on KMUD I hope I dont come across as a Cheech and Chong sheriff he says But I do say the same things over and over  that the days of cops going in and slashandburning are over And they will never come back The police officers respect for legal pot growers is a big reason KMUDs broadcasts on police operations are now  at least according to Allman  an anachronism Perhaps they were justified years ago he says but not today  Still his concern about the broadcasts doesnt mean the sheriff is threatening legal action Im not talking about going to the FCC and saying take away their license Allman says My intent is to figure out a solution where everybody is satisfied They dont have to be happy but theyre satisfied with the solution But KMUDs Marianne Knorzer says that suspicions about the drug war still run high  and that the station is unlikely to drop the reports I cant ever imagine that happening she says Both sides have agreed to continue the dialogue and assess the situation after major drug eradication operations wrap up this fall This story was produced as part of a

marijuana was legalized  The measure would violate federal drug laws but that hasnt stopped Oakland Calif businessman Richard Lee from spending millions to get the issue passed In a revitalized neighborhood on the north side of downtown Oakland where medical marijuana is king an old storefront throbs with the pulse of rock music The unmistakable scent of ganja fills the air Some call the neighborhood Oaksterdam Amsterdam is our model city When I go there I see tourists and jobs and taxes being created from the cannabis industry and I think we can do that here Lee says  Lee owns a medical marijuana dispensary two coffee shops a gift shop and a cannabis nursery Hes created a multimilliondollar empire built largely on medicinal pot And now he wants to take it a step further by turning marijuana into a totally legal taxable commodity for any Californian 21 or older Were like other businesses you know he says Were here to pay taxes create jobs and improve the community Stephen Tate a computer security analyst says Lee has lots of supporters Everybody knows this guy no matter where you go everybody knows this guy Tate says Its good to have a champion for a social cause thats really good you know and its not just a bunch of potheads taking over No its not Theres legitimate purposes for this In fact I wish liberalization of marijuana laws would have been around when my grandmother was suffering from breast cancer How He Became The Force Behind The Ballot Measure Lee has a personal feeling for the power of marijuana Twenty years ago he was paralyzed in a workrelated fall Now he zips through the neighborhood in a wheelchair After he started having muscle spasms cannabis was his one reliable source of relief  And thats how Lee raised in a family of Goldwater Republicans became the force behind the California ballot measure that would make pot legal for fun and profit I am kind of a conservative and I do see marijuana prohibition as eroding respect for the laws and law enforcement he says I want good police law enforcement I want to work with the police Im the opposite of the guy who says F the police  And when it comes to cops Lee believes they should spend their time chasing bona fide crooks not marijuana smokers He came to that conclusion years ago with a gun pointed at his head Two thugs robbed him at the driveup window of a fast food restaurant What really made me as mad as the carjacking though was the police had a really slow response time he says So I started thinking about if there were less police out there looking for people like me and more going after real sociopaths and predators wed be better off Ulterior Motives Supporters say Lee is a visionary who put his money where his mouth is He bankrolled the expensive petition drive that got marijuana on Californias November ballot But others claim Lee has ulterior motives I think people are going to make a mistake if they vote for this says Dennis Peron known by many as the godfather of the medical marijuana movement If they think theyre voting for legalization theyre not They voted for restriction of marijuana Peron is against the ballot measure Lee is backing because he says the government would still have too much control over pot  and shouldnt be allowed to tax it Plus he thinks Lee is mostly interested in legalizing marijuana so he can get even richer selling it Hes doing this to make money Peron says All that money and power Lee doesnt give a lot of thought to his critics Hes too busy being the Johnny Appleseed of pot Lee teaches people how to grow marijuana and how to run their own medical marijuana dispensary at a small storefront school He calls it Oaksterdam University And on any given night hes the main instructor for a halfdozen attentive students You dont want seeds in your cannabis he says Generally youre going to get rid of the male plants that produce pollen that would fertilize the female plants and thats how you get sinsemilla  or seedless cannabis As many as 10000 students have matriculated through Oaksterdam University And Lee is still growing the business with two other schools like this one A Way To Fix Californias Ailing Budget Steve DeAngelo operator of another medical marijuana dispensary in Oakland calls the university a brilliant idea Hes a big Lee supporter but wonders if California is truly ready to take the next step and legalize cannabis I would have preferred to see the initiative wait for another two years until we went into a general election cycle when our voters are more likely to turn out he says It could come down to whether voters see marijuana as a cure for Californias ailing budget By some estimates making pot legal and taxing it could generate a billion dollars in new revenue I guess its a sign the time is right for laws to change and that society is maturing and looking at this subject in a new way Lee says But Lee is a pragmatist He knows changing decades of prohibition wont be easy So even if he fails this time he says hell keep trying Copyright 2014 NPR,"Mon, 07 Jun 2010 12:37:00 -0400",drugs
NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127012745&ft=3&f=,Fourteen states and the District of Columbia allow people to use marijuana to treat a wide variety of ailments Each law is different  but if you look at them in chronological order a pattern emerges The laws are becoming stricter The states passing laws today include more regulation than the early adopters did  California voters approved the first law in 1996 The language in Proposition 215 was simple  essentially it said allow sick people to use pot  The broadly worded language successfully avoided conflict with federal law under which marijuana possession remains illegal But with almost no restrictions dispensaries flourished In Los Angeles County alone there are more than 100 places to legally buy pot And more than 40000 medical marijuana cards have been issued in California In November California voters will decide whether to go ahead and make this de facto legalization official A proposition on the ballot will ask voters if they want to make pot legal for adults After California passed the law 13 more states and DC also passed medical marijuana laws Some like Washington and Oregon dont allow dispensaries at all But so far none have gone to the lengths New Mexico has to regulate medical pot The Most Restrictive New Mexico New Mexico does allow dispensaries but only nonprofit ones And to date only five have been approved One of them NewMexiCann Natural Medicine is based in an office behind a restaurant in Santa Fe NM Getting a license to grow and distribute marijuana was a sevenmonth process according to Executive Director Len Goodman What there is is a long checklist a twopage singlespaced checklist he says The state wants to know things like Who will grow the plants What is their experience What will the distribution model look like And then there are more mundane matters like what the labeling and invoices will look like Goodman says New Mexico limits Goodman to 95 plants That means demand is always outpacing supply  and thats just how the state wants it If supply increases too much theres a risk legal medical marijuana could be diverted to the illegal recreational market  But that means patients like Dennis Garcia have to go without Hes a broadshouldered Iraq war veteran who uses marijuana to treat symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder  Cannabis was the only thing that was really helping me Garcia says   Just getting approved to use marijuana was difficult for Garcia Both a doctor and a psychiatrist had to sign a state form saying traditional treatments failed They also had to conclude that marijuana would do Garcia more good than harm  When he couldnt find marijuana through dispensaries Garcia started growing his own in his garage To get a license Garcia had to prove that he could keep his crop secure and promise to follow other regulations It cant be within a certain amount of distance from a school It cant be seen or visible from the street or any public property Garcia says  Getting Marijuana Only To The Sick All these restrictions are designed to ensure New Mexicos program is for medical use  not a backdoor way to legalize pot Its the result of the practical experiences of trying to get away from the California model says New Mexico State Sen Cisco McSorley  McSorley says New Mexico has shown that through strict regulation medical marijuana can be made available only to the sick But there is a risk in such active regulation Its possible a federal prosecutor could charge New Mexico regulators with helping people get access to marijuana  My very first goal was that I didnt go to jail and none of my doctors went to jail and nobody in the Department of Health went to jail says Dr Alfredo Vigil secretary of the New Mexico Department of Health  To date theres been no interest from federal prosecutors and New Mexicos law has avoided the California model of dispensaries popping up all over   So far theres really not the kind of money to be made that would underwrite proliferation of those kinds of businesses and Im hoping we can keep it that way says Vigil  The Power Of The States Now New Jersey appears ready to go beyond even New Mexico Under that states program virtually every marijuana bud thats harvested will have been closely monitored by a bureaucrat  In all of this theres an interesting civics lesson says Vanderbilt University law professor Rob Mikos Federal law  in this case the ban on marijuana possession  always is supreme but there are times states can choose to go their own way  What theyre doing is perfectly legitimate Mikos says Its just a passive form of resistance to federal authority  Mikos says states have traditionally prosecuted nearly all of the marijuana possession cases Now in response to their citizens theyre actually embracing medical marijuana and the feds arent doing much about it Mikos says when it comes to using marijuana for medical purposes our culture is changing and the states are leading the way  Copyright 2014 NPR,"Mon, 07 Jun 2010 17:56:00 -0400",drugs

seemed to mark the bands lead singer Roky Erickson for fame and fortune But it didnt work out that way Instead Erickson is mostly famous as a cautionary tale a man who took too many psychedelic drugs then struggled with mental illness Now Erickson has released a new record he made with the help of an indierock band he inspired Okkervil RiverNo matter how far Erickson retreated from the world his fans never forgot about himYou know Id grown up in Texas filmmaker Keven McAlester says And in Texas if youre a music fan Roky Erickson is sort of like the Loch Ness monster There are all these myths about him Youre not sure which was true and which were apocryphalMcAlester spent six years filming Erickson and his family for his documentary Youre Gonna Miss Me By the time McAlester found him Erickson was living in seclusion his mental illness untreated In one scene from the documentary Erickson flips on half a dozen radios and televisions and a Casio keyboard before lying down to sleepWhen McAlester first met him he didnt think Erickson would ever record againHe seemed to have so little interest in even talking about his music or acknowledging that he had done it McAlester says The idea that he could perform again in public and get into a studio and record again  I wouldve said it was impossiblePleading InsanityRoky Ericksons problems date back to the 1960s The 13th Floor Elevators are sometimes credited with inventing the term psychedelic rock And to say that Erickson dabbled in LSD would be putting it lightly Ericksons mental health was already deteriorating in 1969 when he was arrested in Texas for possession of one joint of marijuana Rather than go to jail Erickson pleaded insanity as he told radio interviewer George Gimarc in 1981Erickson I just convinced them that I was insane so I could go to a mental home instead of a prisonGimarc This was on the marijuana charge I guess what was that 69Erickson Yeah I probably wouldve been in prison about four yearsInstead Erickson spent three years at Rusk State Hospital in Texas He started a band with other patients some of whom were incarcerated for rape or murder When he got out he started recording again But his music sounded differentErickson called it horror rock inspired by the scary films and comics hed loved since childhood Some fans read his songs about monsters and demons as metaphors for his mental state But if hed intended them that way he never said so Heres another excerpt from that 1981 interviewGimarc Do you consider yourself a demonic possessed evil personErickson YesGimarc You really doErickson Yes I do Its my religion Music is evil to meEricksons mental health continued to slip He was arrested and briefly institutionalized in 1990 for stealing his neighbors mailMeeting Okkervil RiverIn 2001 a court awarded legal custody of Erickson to his younger brother Now 63 Erickson is on medication for the first time in years Hes reunited with his first wife and son And hes willing to sit down for an interview along with his collaborator Will SheffSheff and Erickson first met two years ago when Sheffs band Okkervil River backed up Erickson at the Austin Music Awards The combination worked and Ericksons manager invited Sheff to produce a new recordI was interested but I didnt want to  I wanted to make sure that I felt like I could make a good record Sheff says It was when I heard those songs that I completely sort of lunged after the projectThe songs on True Love Cast Out All Evil are based on demo recordings Erickson made throughout his career Some were recorded on a reeltoreel tape machine inside Rusk State HospitalFor other songs on the album Sheff added instruments and found sounds Erickson was never one to spend a lot of time in the studio playing the same song over and over again so Sheff took a different approachTheres an aspect of recording thats kind of banging your head against a wall stressful Sheff saysOh I tell yeah Erickson says You have to be careful about that dont youYou do Sheff says And I think that Rokys sort of feeling about keeping things moving and about keeping things fun really kept us on our toesThats right Erickson says Well I appreciate being able to take it easy you know It was really fun It was fun I dont know how much money it cost you knowHeh You dont want to know how much money it cost Sheff says laughingFinding A Weathered VoiceDuring the course of recording Sheff says Erickson seemed to find a new singing voice  one thats a long way from the scream of his youthRoky would settle into this way of doing it that I think of as this very wise weathered voice Sheff says Like a priceless antique thats been passed down thats kind of got its texture to itErickson and Okkervil River are planning to perform songs from their new album on May 24 in Austin followed by shows in Los Angeles San Francisco and New York McAlester says Ericksons unlikely comeback gives the whole story a new twistNow with the release of this record whats completely ironic about his sort of stature as the great lost vocalist or the cautionary tale of the psychedelic era is that hes pretty much the last man standing from that era whos still making relevant records McAlester saysBut then McAlester says that shouldnt be so surprising Music was always Ericksons primary way of communicatingYou know Im really enjoying what

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126806429&ft=3&f=,For decades illegal marijuana cultivation has been an economic lifeblood for three counties in northern California known as the Emerald Triangle  The war on drugs and frequent raids by federal drug agents have helped support the local economy  keeping prices for street sales of pot high and keeping profits rich  But high times are changing Legal pot under the guise of the Californias medical marijuana laws has spurred a rush of new competition As a result the wholesale price of pot grown in these areas is plunging Demand Not Meeting Supply In 1983 the Reagan administration launched a massive air and ground campaign to eradicate pot and lock up growers in northern California Charley Custer a writer and community activist had just arrived to Humboldt County from Chicago With the Reagan crackdown Custer recalls wholesale prices shot up  to as high as 5000 a pound That sudden and ironic windfall for those growers willing to risk prison time transformed the community A lot of people were living on welfare and peanut butter and banana sandwiches for a long time before pot made it possible to be part of the middle class Custer says Nearly 30 years later Custer says that boom may be over Outdoor growers are having a hard time unloading their fall harvest Custer says And this is six months later and when some people do move it they dont get nearly the price they were hoping for That goes for both legal growers who cultivate limited quantities of pot under the medical marijuana laws and illegal operators who often grow larger amounts  Prices are now much less than 2000 a pound according to interviews with more than a dozen growers and dealers Mendocino County Sheriff Tom Allman says some growers cant get rid of their processed pot at any price We arrested a man who had  800 pounds of processed Allman says Eight hundred pounds of processed And we asked him What are you going to do with 800 pounds of processed And he said I dont know Only The Good Ones Make It As recently as last December things were still pretty upbeat At Area 101 an events and healing center near Laytonville local growers gathered to celebrate the Emerald Cup an annual competition for the seasons best pot buds But the events host Tim Blake says the mood has darkened since then Theres a tremendous amount of concern borderlining on fear says the former underground grower who now cultivates medical marijuana  He says the drop in pot prices is in part the result of more growers and a more tolerant legal landscape But he says another factor is quality Indoorgrown marijuana is increasingly favored by dispensaries and consumers for its looks consistence and potency It costs more to produce than pot grown under the sun but commands as much as double the price Thats one reason retail prices havent hit the skids Whats happening is the people that dont have quality product arent selling it Blake says So theyre the ones that are creating this panic So it really comes back down to that just like in every other agricultural industry When you get too many vineyards and too many people growing vines out there then only the good ones make it Matt Cohen is one of those growers who are making it On an organic farm near Ukiah Cohen raises chickens grows vegetables and cultivates highgrade medical pot He has avoided the downturn by distributing marijuana directly to patients But other growers who rely on middlemen and dealers for legal and illegal sales are in financial trouble And I know people and theyre living from credit card to credit card Cohen says Theyre not even making money Its just a lifestyle that theyre in and the alternative is to go do what Instability And Anxiety In recent weeks the upheaval has spurred a series of unprecedented public forums about where things are headed for the marijuana industry especially if Californians vote to legalize pot this fall The displacement of persons deriving supplemental income through clipping gardening and distribution of marijuana dwarfs the number of growers who will lose their income entirely says local activist Anna Hamilton who organized a gathering in Garberville She says the broader community is already feeling the ripple effects of falling pot prices There are business foreclosures storefronts closing Theres a lot of instability and anxiety she says Still amid the turmoil Custer says some locals havent lost their sense of humor He recalls a recent musical revue where three performers in miniskirts sunglasses and spiky heels mocked the plight of local pot growers all to the beat of the 60s hit My Boyfriends Back My dealers back and Im gonna get readyHey now hey now my dealers back Custer sings It was a song of hope in this hopeless situation Itll happen to you Your dealer will come back Or maybe not Californias pot economy is transforming and its starting to resemble a real commodities market where only big players can compete Its a shift that could leave some growers in the dust Produced as part of a collaboration between member station KQED and the Center for Investigative

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123075821&ft=3&f=,Justice John Paul Stevens who announced Friday that he will step down from the Supreme Court when the justices break for the summer started out his time on the nations mightiest bench as something of a maverick But during his 34 years of service which ranks him among the longestserving justices in US history Stevens became a brilliant tactician forging unexpected majorities that established new legal rules on issues ranging from the death penalty to national security  Appointed to the court by President Gerald Ford he became the leader of the courts liberal wing when the courts composition changed and moved increasingly to the right  Today with the court split 54 on many issues Stevens  who is the current courts oldest member  is most often in the minority so the nomination of another liberal in his place would not change the ideological makeup of the court  An Accident Of History Often called a judges judge Stevens was something of a throwback to a less rancorous era when as one writer put it law and politics were a noble pursuit not a blood sport  The quintessential Midwesterner Stevens was born in Chicago and educated at Northwestern and the University of Chicago In the Windy City he earned a reputation as a brilliant lawyer and later appeals court judge  In 1975 Ford appointed him to the US Supreme Court The nomination drew instant praise from Democrats and Republicans alike and Stevens was confirmed in a remarkable three weeks Given Stevens lack of political ties his rise was to some extent a fluke according to his onetime law clerk Clifford Sloan  It was an accident of history Sloan says The stars lined up in a way that could not have been possible before that precise moment and probably could not have been possible after that precise moment A brand new president Gerald Ford suddenly had a Supreme Court vacancy to fill and with the country still reeling from the Watergate scandal the name of the game was to pick someone of unassailable credentials and no political connections Ford assigned his attorney general Edward Levi a man also picked for his lack of political ties to do the screening And Levi the onetime dean of the University of Chicago Law School quickly fixed his eye on Stevens a lifelong Republican with no record of political or judicial activism  Once on the court Stevens quickly earned a reputation for quality work and for independence Unlike other justices he even declined to attend State of the Union addresses In his first decade he was seen as a centerright justice but as the composition of the court grew more and more conservative he found himself referred to as the courts most liberal member a moniker he has never liked according to fellow Chicagoan Abner Mikva who served 15 years as a federal judge himself It bothers him a great deal whenever he hears himself portrayed as a liberal Mikva says When were together he looks at me playfully and says Now Ab you know Im not a liberal And I do No Person Is Above The Law Over the years Stevens authored some 400 majority opinions for the court on almost every issue imaginable from property rights to immigration from abortion to the death penalty from school prayer to campaign finance from term limits to the relationship between the federal and state governments   As former Solicitor General Ted Olson put it the crafty and genial hand of Justice Stevens was everywhere evident The decisions Stevens is likely to be remembered for most though are those he authored on national security and presidential power Stevens wrote the courts 53 decision repudiating President Bushs assertion of unilateral executive power in setting up war crimes tribunals at Guantanamo Bay Cuba   And in 2004 he authorized the courts 63 decision allowing the Guantanamo detainees to challenge their detentions in the US courts Both had profound implications for the limits of presidential power   Bush was not the first president to feel Stevens sting  Stevens also wrote the opinion for a unanimous court in Clinton v Jones the decision refusing to postpone Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton  In summarizing the decision from the bench in 1997 Stevens dismissed the notion that the suit would burden the presidency In the entire history of the republic he said only three sitting presidents have been subjected to suits for their private actions  And as for Clintons case theres nothing in the record to identify any potential harm that might ensue from scheduling the trial promptly  As a former Stevens law clerk put it the justice just thought if the president had time to play golf he had time to defend a lawsuit Critics thought Stevens view naive  the view of a man who knew nothing of the venality of politics or political enemies And indeed as it turned out the Paula Jones case led directly to Clintons impeachment But defenders of the decision see it as an example of the highest value in the American legal system  that no person is above the law Frequent Dissenter Stevens authored some of the courts most complex and important decisions often bringing together under one legal tent justices one might not expect to agree But he also dissented from the courts rulings more frequently than any other justice  When the court struck down a Texas law that punished burning the American flag Stevens the Navy veteran and winner of the Bronze Star objected A countrys flag is a symbol of more than nationhood and national unity  Stevens wrote It also signifies the ideas that characterize the society that has chosen that emblem as well as the special history that has animated the growth and power of those ideas When the court revived the doctrine of states rights he dissented  In 1997 he took the unusual step of announcing his dissent from the bench when the court struck down a key section of the Brady gun control law that imposed a short waiting period on gun buyers to allow local law enforcement officials to run a criminal records check  The basic question is whether Congress acting on behalf of the people of the entire nation has the power to require local law enforcement officers to perform certain duties he said  Since the ultimate issue is one of power we have to consider its implications in times of national emergency as well as the ramifications of preventing national action on matters such as the need for mass inoculation to forestall an epidemic or the threat of terrorism  Stevens ultimate revenge came eight years later when he managed to eke out a 54 majority upholding a federal regulatory scheme under which the federal law making marijuana illegal trumped state laws legalizing it for medical purposes Our case law firmly establishes that Congress has the power to regulate purely local activities when necessary to implement a comprehensive national regulatory program he said   Court Maverick This year though Stevens victories were few as the court grew more and more conservative In January when a fivejustice majority struck down a 100yearold ban on corporate spending in candidate elections Stevens blasted the conservative majority in a 90page dissent   The rule announced today that Congress must treat corporations like human speakers in the political realm represents a radical change in the law he said in a dissent from the bench  The courts decision is at war with the views of generations of Americans It was a dissent as angry as the one he wrote in Bush v Gore Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this years presidential election he wrote in 2000 the identity of the loser is clear It is the nations confidence in the judge as impartial guardian of the rule of law Sloan the onetime law clerk sees the Bush v Gore and Clinton v Jones opinions as flip sides of the same coin He has a very deep respect for the crucible of litigation says Sloan And in both cases what he was strongly objecting to was the suggestion that there be some kind of arbitrary shortcut In the Clinton case the shortcut would have been to delay a trial and the court unanimously rejected that In Bush v Gore the shortcut was to remove the case from the Florida state courts where votecount cases are traditionally resolved and Stevens bitterly objected   Not A Go Along Judge Stevens frequent dissents as well as the separate opinions he often filed to note that his views differed from fellow justices earned him a reputation as a maverick   But as he explained recently his insistence on stating his views stemmed directly from his experience as in effect a special prosecutor more than 30 years ago when he was appointed to investigate charges of misconduct against two sitting Illinois Supreme Court justices  What Stevens found was that the court opinion that had been improperly influenced was not as the public record indicated unanimous  Two justices had in fact dissented but in the name of collegiality had not publicly noted their dissents Its because of this incident Stevens said that when he became a justice on the US Supreme Court he did not go along with colleagues in some cases  The fact that a justice disagrees with his colleagues is a matter of sufficient importance that the public is entitled to know Stevens said  The judicial scandal investigation influenced Stevens in other ways The man who made the initial charges against the two state Supreme Court justices was well known in Chicago as a less than reliable gadfly And yet on the cover of Kenneth Manasters book about the probe there is a picture of the gadfly Sherman Skolnick in his wheelchair with Stevens at his side  Stevens is standing with his head bowed listening very carefully to what this fellow who many consider to be a kook has to say Manaster says  And I really love that picture because it says to me that this is a man who wants to hear even a person who by that time was known to have close to zero credibility but you never know And this was an instance in which Skolnick got it right It is for that reason that Stevens refused to join his Supreme Court colleagues in imposing penalties on people who repeatedly file frivolous appeals with the US Supreme Court  because you never know sometime someone might have a legitimate complaint Influencing The Majority In that way and so many others Stevens for decades marched to the tune of his own drummer The question now is what tune his replacement will march to  Whomever the president chooses it is doubtful that he or she will wield the kind of influence that Stevens did At least not for some time During his more than three decades on the court Stevens became increasingly skilled at molding opinion to reach the magic number of five majority justices  One of his leastknown efforts involved the machine that became ubiquitous in American homes the TV video recorder In the early 1980s Hollywood tried to ban the devices and punish both the manufacturer and the home user with fines for copyright infringement A majority of the court initially agreed with the filmmakers but Stevens proposed dissent turned the court around and he ended up writing the courts 54 opinion declaring that VCRs did not violate copyright laws when used in the home to make a single copy for personal use  A decade later Stevens would play a similarly pivotal role in the courts reconsideration of its abortion ruling Roe v Wade  With the court closely divided three justices  Sandra Day OConnor now retired Anthony Kennedy and David Souter also now retired  circulated an opinion upholding what they called the core of Roe but making it easier for states to regulate abortions The opinion split the court into three separate factions four justices to reverse Roe three to uphold its core and two to uphold it entirely Stevens and Justice Harry Blackmun were the two  But upon receiving the draft of the three middleground justices Stevens suggested a reorganization of their opinion so that he and Blackmun could join most of it and there would be a single opinion that was supported by a court majority  OConnor Kennedy and Souter quickly agreed and the opinion became the law of the land  These are just two examples of how Stevens with the power of his intellect and the firm respectful approach he took toward colleagues moved the court in his direction  Putting together such victories became increasingly difficult after OConnors retirement when the court moved dramatically to the right But Stevens continued to score the occasional unexpected win  using his knowledge of the law his powers of persuasion and logic and the wisdom of a man who will turn 90 on

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125420249&ft=3&f=,In a decision that could affect tens of thousands of people the US Supreme Court has ruled that immigrants living in this country must be told by their lawyers whether pleading guilty to a crime could lead to deportation  Jose Padilla a native of Honduras and a decorated Vietnam War veteran has lived in the United States legally for 40 years A truck driver he was stopped at a weigh station in Kentucky in 2001 and gave a law enforcement officer permission to search his truck  Stowed among his registered cargo were 23 Styrofoam boxes containing a halfton of marijuana Although he was a legal permanent resident he was held erroneously in prison without bond as an illegal alien He refused to plead guilty until the eve of trial and says he only agreed because his lawyer assured him that his guilty plea and a fiveyear prison sentence would not affect his immigration status The lawyer was wrong The guilty plea triggered a mandatory deportation to take effect after the prison term was served  Padilla upon learning that tried to withdraw the plea contending that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel The Kentucky Supreme Court ruled against him concluding that the constitutional right to counsel does not extend to matters that fall outside the criminal case at hand On Wednesday the US Supreme Court disagreed by a 72 vote Majority Opinion Writing for the court majority Justice John Paul Stevens noted that because Congress over the past two decades has made deportation mandatory for a wide variety of crimes the stakes have been dramatically raised for an immigrant noncitizen pleading guilty Although staying in the United States may be more important than any potential jail sentence he said defendants are often not advised that a guilty plea may result in their deportation In a case like this Stevens added where a simple reading of the statute would have told the lawyer her client would face certain deportation failing to provide that information denies the defendant the effective assistance of counsel It is our responsibility said the court to ensure that no criminal defendant is left to the mercies of incompetent counsel and we now hold that counsel must inform her client whether a plea carries the risk of deportation The courts decision sent the Padilla case back to the Kentucky courts for further action Although the justices said they did not believe their decision would result in opening the floodgates for reconsideration of previous guilty pleas immigrantrights advocates clearly saw an opening They said the ruling could affect tens of thousands of both old and new cases I think historic is not an understatement said Benita Jain codirector of the New Yorkbased Immigrants Rights Project Decision Welcomed This is really a watershed decision in the immigration rights area said Stephen Kinnaird who represented Padilla in the Supreme Court Kinnaird noted that with nearly 13 million foreigners living legally in the United States some of whom came here as toddlers it is axiomatic that tens of thousands will have some sort of runin with the law each year And just as US citizens who face similar charges do most agree to plead guilty in exchange for a lighter sentence or no jail time at all That is where the similarity ends said Kinnaird For immigrants when it turns out that the crime results in automatic deportation theyre shocked by it because they had no idea The examples of such cases are legion from the woman who stole a bottle of medicine for her sick child to the Georgia business owner with no criminal record pulled over by police one night and charged with a drug violation after a dollar bill in his pocket was found to have trace amounts of cocaine His guilty plea in exchange for no jail time and a promise to expunge his record did not protect him from deportation proceedings Immigrantrights advocates say that the more minor the crime and the lighter the sentence the greater the shock at the nearcertain deportation that may follow Jain of the Immigrants Rights Project notes that deportation for an immigrant whos been here since childhood can mean being deported to a country where the individual has no family left where he or she may not speak the language and may not know how to get a job a house or even order a meal And for some immigrants granted asylum here deportation may return them to a country where they risk persecution Lawyers Obligation For the most part the Supreme Courts ruling will only help legal residents in the US But for those here illegally there are situations in which a pending application for legal status could be jeopardized by a guilty plea Whatever the situation the Supreme Court has now declared that lawyers cannot remain silent on the effect a guilty plea may have on a defendants immigration status In clear cases a lawyer must advise his or her client that the guilty plea triggers automatic deportation In less clear cases the lawyer must still advise that an immigrants status could be in jeopardy Dissenting from Wednesdays ruling were Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas  Said Scalia In the best of all possible worlds criminal defendants contemplating a guilty plea ought to be advised of all serious collateral consequences of conviction and surely ought not to be misadvised The Constitution however is not an allpurpose tool for judicial construction of a perfect world Copyright 2014 NPR,"Thu, 01 Apr 2010 05:51:00

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124731385&ft=3&f=,Thousands of Mexican troops and hundreds of millions of dollars in US aid have failed to stem the drug wars plaguing Mexicos northern border region Now the killing of Americans last weekend in Ciudad Juarez is likely to escalate the conflict and Washingtons already substantial involvement in the fight analysts say Americans are being targeted which was not the case before That makes it more possible for the Obama administration to get the support to provide more resources says Mauricio Cardenas director of the Latin American initiative at the Brookings Institution Almost 18000 people have been killed across Mexico since President Felipe Calderon launched the military offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006  According to the government most of those dead are rival smugglers But the Security Commission of the Mexican Senate also reports that the dead include at least 620 women 1500 police officers and 87 soldiers Last weekend there were some 50 victims of drug gangrelated violence in Mexico  including an American consular employee and her husband gunned down in their car Their baby was found unharmed in the back seat of the car  Analysts say the deaths of the Americans may put more pressure on the Obama administration to act The tragedy of this weekend just underscores how severe and significant a danger this represents to Mexico to the United States to the hemisphere State Department spokesman PJ Crowley told reporters on Monday In 2007 the Bush administration and its Mexican counterpart signed the Merida Initiative a threeyear 15 billion plan to fight the narcotics trade While the money has been appropriated the spending of it is still in the works  So far US assistance has come in the form of bigticket items like helicopters and speedboats They arrived only late last year though The lag time is substantial because a lot of the equipment is custom built  And the enemy is formidable says Crowley Youre talking about violence fueled by drug use that produces vast sums of money that produces significant capabilities that could rival  the strength of any army US Drug Enforcement Administration officials and the FBI are already helping elite Mexican forces in intelligence gathering collecting evidence for trials and providing training on how to lead investigations that will eventually stand up in court  But Mexican officials say the US must do more to help in the battle against the drug cartels For years Mexican leaders have urged the US to stop the flow of guns south across the border The US Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms reported last year that more than 7700 guns sold in America were traced to Mexico  But experts believe that is just a small fraction of the total More than 2000 guns  from 9 mm handguns to automatic assault rifles  are trafficked from US border states to Mexico every day according research by the Brookings Institution  During the State Department briefing Crowley said there were things the US could do to help in terms of money guns to try to diminish and ultimately defeat these cartels but he didnt say whether authorities would step up security at border crossings While US financial aid is impressive it is a trickle compared with the massive assistance Washington gave Colombia  about 700 million a year for five years    to help fight its drug war Cardenas says About 90 percent of the cocaine and much of the marijuana that enters the US comes through Mexico That is another reason the US government needs to be more involved in Mexicos fight says Shannon ONeil a fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations Our security is intricately tied with Mexicos security and so we should be investing in our relationship with Mexico Its in our own self interest to do so she says O Neil says the US aid to Mexico should focus on strengthening law enforcement institutions cleaning up the court system and providing telephone hot lines and other ways for citizens to get involved  Mexicos police force has long been corrupt and its courts lacking transparency  But that is now changing ONeil says with background checks for police officers and police recruits and reforms in the legal system They do a background check on police recruits to make sure you dont have a lot of money and then they do periodic lie detector tests once youre in since so many are approached years into the job by drug cartels looking to bribe them ONeil says The court system is also changing with an increase in public trials with oral presentations rather than the traditional Mexican system of having a judge review written arguments and make a ruling from his chambers ONeil says that should make the whole system much more open and transparent and make people witness to the judicial system But all of this will take time The fundamental problems that Mexico has are issues of institutional effectiveness and capacity  weeding out corruption ONeil says None of those issues are things that can be solved overnight no matter how much money you throw at them Copyright 2014 NPR,"Tue, 16 Mar

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124687663&ft=3&f=,Ever since Barack Obama lifted his right hand and took his oath of office pledging to serve the United States as its fortyfourth president ordinary people and their leaders around the globe have been celebrating our nations triumph over race Obamas election has been touted as the final nail in the coffin of Jim Crow the bookend placed on the history of racial caste in America  Obamas mere presence in the Oval Office is offered as proof that the land of the free has finally made good on its promise of equality Theres an implicit yet undeniable message embedded in his appearance on the world stage this is what freedom looks like this is what democracy can do for you If you are poor marginalized or relegated to an inferior caste there is hope for you Trust us Trust our rules laws customs and wars You too can get to the promised land  Perhaps greater lies have been told in the past century but they can be counted on one hand Racial caste is alive and well in America  Most people dont like it when I say this It makes them angry In the era of colorblindness theres a nearly fanatical desire to cling to the myth that we as a nation have moved beyond race Here are a few facts that run counter to that triumphant racial narrative   There are more AfricanAmericans under correctional control today  in prison or jail on probation or parole  than were enslaved in 1850 a decade before the Civil War began   As of 2004 more AfricanAmerican men were disenfranchised due to felon disenfranchisement laws than in 1870 the year the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified prohibiting laws that explicitly deny the right to vote on the basis of race   A black child born today is less likely to be raised by both parents than a black child born during slavery The recent disintegration of the AfricanAmerican family is due in large part to the mass imprisonment of black fathers   If you take into account prisoners a large majority of AfricanAmerican men in some urban areas have been labeled felons for life In the Chicago area the figure is nearly 80 percent These men are part of a growing undercaste  not class caste  permanently relegated by law to a secondclass status They can be denied the right to vote automatically excluded from juries and legally discriminated against in employment housing access to education and public benefits much as their grandparents and greatgrandparents were during the Jim Crow era  Excuses for the Lockdown  There is of course a colorblind explanation for all this crime rates Our prison population has exploded from about 300000 to more than 2 million in a few short decades it is said because of rampant crime Were told that the reason so many black and brown men find themselves behind bars and ushered into a permanent secondclass status is because they happen to be the bad guys  The uncomfortable truth however is that crime rates do not explain the sudden and dramatic mass incarceration of AfricanAmericans during the past thirty years Crime rates have fluctuated over the last few decades  they are currently at historical lows but imprisonment rates have consistently soared Quintupled in fact And the vast majority of that increase is due to the War on Drugs Drug offenses alone account for about twothirds of the increase in the federal inmate population and more than half of the increase in the state prison population  The drug war has been brutal  complete with SWAT teams tanks bazookas grenade launchers and sweeps of entire neighborhoods  but those who live in white communities have little clue to the devastation wrought This war has been waged almost exclusively in poor communities of color even though studies consistently show that people of all colors use and sell illegal drugs at remarkably similar rates In fact some studies indicate that white youth are significantly more likely to engage in illegal drug dealing than black youth Any notion that drug use among AfricanAmericans is more severe or dangerous is belied by the data White youth for example have about three times the number of drugrelated visits to the emergency room as their AfricanAmerican counterparts  That is not what you would guess though when entering our nations prisons and jails overflowing as they are with black and brown drug offenders In some states AfricanAmericans comprise 80 percent90 percent of all drug offenders sent to prison  This is the point at which I am typically interrupted and reminded that black men have higher rates of violent crime Thats why the drug war is waged in poor communities of color and not middleclass suburbs Drug warriors are trying to get rid of those drug kingpins and violent offenders who make ghetto communities a living hell It has nothing to do with race its all about violent crime  Again not so President Ronald Reagan officially declared the current drug war in 1982 when drug crime was declining not rising From the outset the war had little to do with drug crime and nearly everything to do with racial politics The drug war was part of a grand and highly successful Republican Party strategy of using racially coded political appeals on issues of crime and welfare to attract poor and working class white voters who were resentful of and threatened by desegregation busing and affirmative action In the words of HR Haldeman President Richard Nixons White House chief of staff The whole problem is really the blacks The key is to devise a system that recognizes this while not appearing to  A few years after the drug war was announced crack cocaine hit the streets of innercity communities The Reagan administration seized on this development with glee hiring staff who were to be responsible for publicizing innercity crack babies crack mothers crack whores and drugrelated violence The goal was to make innercity crack abuse and violence a media sensation bolstering public support for the drug war which it was hoped would lead Congress to devote millions of dollars in additional funding to it  The plan worked like a charm For more than a decade black drug dealers and users would be regulars in newspaper stories and would saturate the evening TV news Congress and state legislatures nationwide would devote billions of dollars to the drug war and pass harsh mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes  sentences longer than murderers receive in many countries  Democrats began competing with Republicans to prove that they could be even tougher on the darkskinned pariahs In President Bill Clintons boastful words I can be nicked a lot but no one can say Im soft on crime The facts bear him out Clintons tough on crime policies resulted in the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history But Clinton was not satisfied with exploding prison populations He and the New Democrats championed legislation banning drug felons from public housing no matter how minor the offense and denying them basic public benefits including food stamps for life Discrimination in virtually every aspect of political economic and social life is now perfectly legal if youve been labeled a felon  Facing Facts  But what about all those violent criminals and drug kingpins Isnt the drug war waged in ghetto communities because thats where the violent offenders can be found The answer is yes in madeforTV movies In real life the answer is no  The drug war has never been focused on rooting out drug kingpins or violent offenders Federal funding flows to those agencies that increase dramatically the volume of drug arrests not the agencies most successful in bringing down the bosses What gets rewarded in this war is sheer numbers of drug arrests To make matters worse federal drug forfeiture laws allow state and local law enforcement agencies to keep for their own use 80 percent of the cash cars and homes seized from drug suspects thus granting law enforcement a direct monetary interest in the profitability of the drug market  The results have been predictable people of color rounded up en masse for relatively minor nonviolent drug offenses In 2005 four out of five drug arrests were for possession only one out of five for sales Most people in state prison have no history of violence or even of significant selling activity In fact during the 1990sthe period of the most dramatic expansion of the drug warnearly 80 percent of the increase in drug arrests was for marijuana possession a drug generally considered less harmful than alcohol or tobacco and at least as prevalent in middleclass white communities as in the inner city  In this way a new racial undercaste has been created in an astonishingly short period of time  a new Jim Crow system Millions of people of color are now saddled with criminal records and legally denied the very rights that their parents and grandparents fought for and in some cases died for  Affirmative action though has put a happy face on this racial reality Seeing black people graduate from Harvard and Yale and become CEOs or corporate lawyers  not to mention president of the United States  causes us all to marvel at what a long way weve come  Recent data shows though that much of black progress is a myth In many respects AfricanAmericans are doing no better than they were when Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated and uprisings swept inner cities across America Nearly a quarter of AfricanAmericans live below the poverty line today approximately the same percentage as in 1968 The black child poverty rate is actually higher now than it was then Unemployment rates in black communities rival those in Third World countries And thats with affirmative action  When we pull back the curtain and take a look at what our colorblind society creates without affirmative action we see a familiar social political and economic structurethe

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123964512&ft=3&f=,Whats worse declaring war against a social problem or calling for a Marshall Plan to solve it Both are enduring and popular metaphors Unfortunately both lead to bad government decisions Public policies shaped by such thinking more often than not result in waste blind spots and Manichaean mindsets that limit the search for more effective approaches Think of the longrunning wars on drugs terrorism and cancer The results all too predictably have been more confusing than the problems  In fact no imitation of the Marshall Plan has ever worked and no war on a big social problem has ever ended in defeat for the enemy save perhaps cigarettes But the allure of these spurious comparisons remains as strong as ever Without any apparent effect Marshall Plans have been proposed to help Africa the Middle East New Orleans Iraq and even Wallonia Belgiums least prosperous region Bill Gates wants a Marshall Plan to broaden access to technology French President Nicolas Sarkozy urges one for his countrys poor suburbs and the AFLCIO thinks the US auto industry deserves its own Marshall Plan  Advocates of war against big problems are just as plentiful We have been asked to go to war against poverty drunk driving email spam and teen pregnancy just to name a few In the United States liberals denounce the Bushera war on science while conservatives each year mobilize against the war on Christmas And of course theres the favorite war of the global chattering class  the war against global warming This is World War III Barbara Young then head of Britains Environment Agency declared in 2007 This is the biggest challenge to face the globe for many many years We need the sorts of concerted fast integrated and above all huge efforts that went into many actions in times of war  There are many good reasons why declaring war on a social problem or launching a Marshall Plan to help a country or region are such attractive metaphors for politicians Wars unite countries and stifle internal dissent Wag the Dog is not just the title of a movie in which a war is manufactured to rally support for a government but also an ageold political tactic The war metaphor is also attractive because real wars  those between nationstates as opposed to those against concepts or bad socioeconomic trends  are finite University of Notre Dame scholar Daniel Lindley has found that the average length of a war is 308 days when the country that starts it wins and 660 days when initiators lose No surprise then that the war metaphor keeps getting deployed It boosts expectations that in a few years a major scourge  cancer terrorism poverty  will be eliminated War also holds the seductive promise of an open checkbook for the politicians who so liberally apply the term after all budgetary constraints tend to disappear during war along with all those pesky rules Wars are for heroes not for accountants who limit the resources needed for victory  The Marshall Plan metaphor has been similarly irresistible with its implications of massive funding and unquestioning public support But the original Marshall Plan launched by the United States to help Europe after World War II was neither as financially sizable nor as uncontroversial as proponents commonly assume Economist Tyler Cowen estimated US aid which peaked at around 90 billion in todays dollars was no more than 5 percent of the gross national product of the recipient nations Still the plan has come to epitomize a bold massive  and successful  governmental mobilization  Alas these good metaphors yield bad policies The war on drugs for example has been more successful in spawning immense bureaucracies and winning big budgets and partisan political fights than in ending drug use Decriminalizing marijuana for medical purposes is becoming a popular reform in the United States and 14 states have already adopted it with more sure to follow But do we know if marijuana does indeed have the medical benefits claimed by reformers No As a result of the mindset  and the policies  nurtured by the war on drugs medical researchers have been blocked from access to marijuana and unable to scientifically test the claims Only now after four painful and futile decades is the war on drugs losing support  The same perils apply to the war on terror As former US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski famously noted The damage these three words have done  a classic selfinflicted wound  is infinitely greater than any wild dreams entertained by the fanatical perpetrators of the 911 attacks when they were plotting against us in distant Afghan caves The phrase itself is meaningless It defines neither a geographic context nor our presumed enemies Terrorism is not an enemy but a technique of warfare Indeed the war on terror was even more spectacularly successful than the war on drugs in securing political legal military and financial blank checks for those waging it But that too is changing as antiterrorism efforts are now more carefully scrutinized checks are written with more strings attached and alternative approaches are tested Recognizing that language is power US President Barack Obama took a key first step in banning the bad metaphor At his insistence the Pentagon was forced to lose its precious GWOT global war on terror acronym and the GWOT mentality that went with it But as many of his predecessors learned Obama is finding that wars are hard to exit Once a war against poverty crime or terrorism is launched announcing a unilateral truce is usually political suicide Instead presidents get boxed into absolutist policies in which compromise is impossible and victory is the only acceptable outcome  But no matter the complications these wars arent going away  theyre just too politically convenient It took only a few hours after Haitis terrible Jan 12 earthquake for pundits to call for a Marshall Plan One thing by now is certain however Although aid will materialize a Marshall Plan will not As we all know but the metaphor users routinely and conveniently ignore the Marshall Plans success was driven by the hardtoreplicate conditions in Europe after World War II with its highly educated populations welldeveloped private sector and relatively efficient public bureaucracies  So Beware the metaphor All these wars and Marshall Plans are getting the world nowhere But their frequent use does have a silver lining At least youll know that whenever they are proposed bad policies will soon follow

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123385312&ft=3&f=,Confidential informants  people who pose as criminals so they can provide information to the police or some government agency  have helped crack some major US casesThey are part of the shadowy side of law enforcement and operate in a secret and largely unregulated world And sometimes things go terribly wrong I Was Doing Something GoodA decade ago at 2 am a Mexican drug runner walked over the international bridge that links El Paso Texas with Ciudad Juarez Mexico and asked to speak with a US agent Raul Bencomo then an agent with US Customs assigned code No 913 to the runner Guillermo Eduardo Ramirez Peyro who went by the nickname Lalo Bencomo says Lalo was different from other informants He was well dressed and always respectful  and anxious to talk about the Mexican drug lords he worked for He had a lot of information and the type of information that he started providing was at a high level Bencomo says  Lalos information was on the mark He tipped Bencomo to a corrupt US immigration agent who was taking bribes from drug gangs He also helped crack a major international cigarette smuggling ring  He kept us so busy  we were so behind on reports that we told him to go take a vacation just to let us catch up on reports Bencomo says Lalo wasnt looking to make a deal And he didnt need the money  he was already making plenty in Juarezs drug trade But he had his reasons for informing on the drug gang  I was doing something good something positive Lalo said to an attorney during an interview that was videotaped four years ago During several phone conversations with NPR last fall Lalo insisted on speaking only Spanish But in either language his story is the same I believe in some kind of justice and I think I was doing something good he said On the tape Lalo looks more like a victim than a drug thug Hes cleancut and clearly educatedI really was doing something good he said The ICE Target Heriberto SantillanThe feds paid Lalo well nearly 250000 over four years His handlers did well too  The El Paso Customs office Customs later became Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE had never gotten much recognition Now with Lalo on board agents set their sights on a Juarez kingpin known as the Engineer Heriberto Santillan Tabares  Bencomo says the agents were told that Santillan was the No 3 man in the Juarez cartelBut as that investigation started ICEs prized snitch came under suspicion At a Border Patrol checkpoint Lalo got caught smuggling more than 100 pounds of marijuana stuffed into the wheels of his pickup The Drug Enforcement Administration blacklisted him ICE kept Lalo on its payroll and even worked with a federal prosecutor to get his drug charges dropped In hindsight Bencomo says the pot in the pickup should have been a warning sign    That was the first incident that I ever came across that he was working both sides Bencomo saysDrug smuggling turned out to be the least of Lalos exploits He was climbing the ranks of the drug cartel and was becoming a trusted ally to Juarezs third in command   Killings Caught On Tape In the fall of 2003 Santillan and a band of crooked Mexican police officers went on an eightmonth crime spree  killing kidnapping and torturing drug rivals in Juarez And Lalo was with themAccording to documents obtained by NPR Lalo kept his ICE handlers informed of the murders piling up in Juarez  In fact Lalo secretly recorded the first murder  and admitted that he held the victims legs while the man was being brutally strangled suffocated and beaten with a shovel Former agent Bencomo remembers listening to the tape It just made me sick he says I had to go to the restroom and throw up I took the recording and I told my supervisor that I didnt wish to be part of the caseBut Bencomo stayed on and so did Lalo Bencomo says his supervisors told him just to make sure Lalo didnt participate in any more killings  Today Lalo insists he never killed anyone though court documents show he admitted being present during several murders he even acknowledged driving two victims to a Juarez house where he knew theyd be killed Lalo said his actions were necessary to maintain his cover When you infiltrate a cartel everyone knows you have to go like what  like a criminal he said And you have to act like a criminalEvery Federal Rule Was BrokenBut former DEA Special Agent Phil Jordan says in Lalos case every federal rule and regulation was broken Even if the man was John Gotti in his prime you do not allow an informant to run the investigation you do not let the informant commit felonies to commit murder he says In my mind he was given a license to killJordan says on top of all that ICE knew who was doing the killing and where the bodies were buried but didnt share any of that information with Mexican authorities Jordan was an expert witness in a civil suit filed against ICE by relatives of people killed by the Mexican drug cartel Among the victims were two US residents Attorney Raul Loya who represented them said the federal agents handling Lalo were a joke Are you kidding me These guys are El Pasos version of the Keystone Kops Loya says They are poorly trained they have limited education which is fine but they had no business being involved in a crossborder covert operation involving drugs and murderThe killings in Juarez took place more than six years ago Until now ICE has always refused to talk on the record about what happened there and why Lalo was kept on the US governments payroll while he was involved in torture and murder In an interview with NPR Kumar Kibble a top ICE official and a former director of criminal investigations for the agency says I want to emphasize that our primary obligation is to protect life and limb He says that the agencys guidelines for using confidential informants are sound But in Lalos case he says rogue agents didnt properly follow them Had management been fully informed we could have implemented strategies and taken a different tack that would have ultimately safeguarded more lives he says This is not an appropriate case to comment on because the procedures that we implemented werent followedThe House Of DeathBut those familiar with the case wonder how ICE could not have known about Lalos exploits in Mexico  the majority of which took place at a house in a middleclass neighborhood in Juarez  It has been dubbed the House of Death Today no one goes to the metal gate at the house where cartel murderers brought their victims and ultimately buried them in the tiny backyard NPR went there with veteran Juarez crime reporter Carlos Huerta He says Lalo was the keeper of the keys There were these code words that the bosses would say to Lalo Huerta says He would say Were going to have a barbecue That meant Lalo was to go and get the house ready because someone was going to be brought there and be killedAccording to a document obtained by NPR Lalo admitted to Mexican authorities in Dallas that on his way to the house he stopped at a local hardware store and bought duct tape and quicklime  essential items for binding murder victims and dissolving their remains Eventually US officials told Mexican authorities about the bodies buried at the House of Death Lorenza Magana who works with victims of violence in Juarez sat vigil with relatives of missing family members outside the house the night that Mexican authorities began unearthing the remains We stayed there all night and watched as they pulled out bodies Magana says It was so horrible With every new body the smell would hit us  it was horrible We came back night after night to see how many they dug up  In all there were 12 victims Magana says she couldnt believe it when she found out that Lalo the gatekeeper of the death house was a US government informant It hit me like cold water in the face it just feels terrible Here in Mexico there is no justice only impunity Magana says So where are we going to find any help if we cant trust the USBut it wasnt just the people of Juarez who were outraged When the El Paso DEA office got wind of what was happening the agent in charge was stunned I was shocked I couldnt believe it says the DEAs Sandalio Gonzalez He got involved after two DEA operatives in Mexico were targeted by the Juarez drug gang that Lalo worked for Gonzalez says when he tried to question the informant ICE circled its wagons around LaloWe have threats against the lives of DEA agents we have dead bodies and you dont want to let us talk to this guy he says What is wrong with this pictureThis Is An Isolated IncidentGonzalez lodged a complaint against ICE He also tried to get Congress to investigate but that went nowhereICEs Kumar Kibble insists that his agency has already thoroughly investigated the matter We have thousands of informants that are active that we are managing on a daily basis he says This is an isolated incident where in fact the person was held accountable when they didnt follow our proceduresICE says the fault lies with former agent Bencomo Lalos handler Specifically ICE officials say Bencomo was terminated because he didnt tell supervisors that Lalo was still involved with murder and torture in Juarez Bencomo was the only one fired as a result of the Lalo fiasco Two ICE employees were forced to take early retirement but others received light reprimands and are still on the job This is the first time that Bencomo has talked publicly He views himself as a scapegoat and says his bosses at ICE and their bosses in Washington knew all along what Lalo was doing He would report a murder and either we heard it on a phone nobody told us to stop doing the case Bencomo says We were told to continue so for them to say that they didnt know about it that is a total lieIm Just Fighting For My LifeWhether or not the top brass knew about all of Lalos exploits there is no denying they used him to nab a Juarez drug lord and lock him away Once the case was done ICE was also done with Lalo The agency began deportation proceedings with the intention of sending him back to Mexico      Lalo has been in solitary confinement for more than five years Hes in jail not for any of the crimes he allegedly committed in Mexico but because ICE says he no longer has a legal right to be in the US  Right now Im just fighting for my life Lalo said For now he said jail is better than the fate he faces in MexicoI dont know if they are going to keep me here for the rest of my life he said Right now Im just trying to say Dont put me in the hands of the people who are going to try and kill me Thats all Im doing right nowICE says it learned some lessons dealing with Lalo NPR obtained an internal agency memo written in May 2004 that clearly prohibits using informants who commit crimes The memo stated that those rules would be part of a new policy handbook But during our interview ICE said that handbook still isnt

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121056866&ft=3&f=,Note The footnotes from this excerpt have been removed Prologue On a raised dais at Washingtons luxurious Mayflower Hotel the Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia is in high performance mode His comic timing is precise Laughter and applause ripple on cue from the five hundred lawyers packed into the ballroom Gone in an eyeblink is most of his scheduled hour The moderator announces that there will be one final question Make it easy Scalia jokes standing at the lectern in especially fine spirits on this blustery November afternoon You can make it like Senator Strom Thurmonds first question to me when I was up for my confirmation The South Carolina Republican had presided over the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings for Scalia in 1986 when he was nominated by President Reagan for elevation from a federal appeals court Thurmond had opened with a question that played right into Scalias view that judges were wrongly going beyond the letter of the law to solve societys larger problems whether they related to school busing prison crowding or environmental catastrophes These were conflicts Scalia believed should be left in the domain of elected lawmakers  Now Judge Scalia  Scalia says mimicking the slow patois of Senator Thurmond  what do you think of judicial activism  Scalia turns sideways at the lectern and puts his hands together as if at the plate and ready to swing a baseball bat The sleeves of his dark suit yank up flashing his thick white shirt cuffs Im ready for that pitch he says The Scalia illuminated by camera lights at this closing session of the 2008 annual conference of the Federalist Society is heavier than the man America first saw at the witness table in 1986 on nationwide television His jowls are thicker his waist wider His dark black hair has thinned Yet his eyes are lit as always Into his seventies Scalia still exudes energy and passion His gestures are operatic He points his fingers and waves his arms for emphasis His audiences at these public occasions irrespective of whether they are conservative or liberal continue to be large and are nearly always captivated When Scalia enters a room cameras still flash This afternoon at the conservative legal societys convention his audience is standing room only and hanging on his every word and gesture With his biting humor Scalia has been advancing the legal theory known as originalism  insisting that judges should render constitutional decisions based on the eighteenthcentury understanding of the text Its a fight worth making he says in remarks that are part battle cry part assertion of victory I used to be able to say with a good deal of truth that you could fire a cannon loaded with grapeshot into the faculty lounge of any law school in the country and not strike an originalist Scalia says referring to those of the view that the Constitution has a constant meaning one that does not change to fit the needs of a changing society That no longer is true Originalism  which once was orthodoxy  at least now has been returned to the status of respectability He says that until contemporary times  the last fifty years or so  judges interpreted the Constitution to mean what it meant when it was adopted Whether the originalist view remained orthodoxy into the twentieth century is debatable but it was barely in evidence by the late 1950s as such judges as Chief Justice Earl Warren interpreted the Constitution to contain broad principles that could be applied to modern circumstances These judges did not feel constrained by the framers understanding of what they had forbidden or allowed Gripping the sides of the lectern with his large square hands Scalia has been recounting how his view of a static Constitution has been faring better among federal judges these days He refers with satisfaction to a recent landmark of his own Supreme Court that declared that the Second Amendment protects an individuals right to bear arms The ruling the previous June written by Scalia overturned decades of decisions by lower court judges who had held that the Second Amendment applied only to state militias such as state national guards It was the first time the Supreme Court found that any law violated the Second Amendment and it was a significant reversal of settled lower court law Especially striking was Scalias authorship of the opinion His nocompromise style had made him a hero on law school campuses but usually cost him votes among the justices On the incendiary subject of gun rights however he was able to gain and keep the majority helped by the youthful new chief justice John Roberts and the newest associate justice Samuel Alito The case requiring interpretation of the Second Amendments text and history was the perfect match for Scalias focus on the original intention of the men who drafted and ratified the Constitution Maybe the original meaning of the Constitution is back Scalia tells the Federalist Society Were not all back there yet but maybe were on the way A quarter century into his judicial odyssey Scalia may be at the apex of his influence Roberts and Alito who had both worked in the Reagan administration have long admired Scalia and the way he wages the good conservative fight On the Court since 2005 and 2006 respectively they have been voting with Scalia more than did William Rehnquist the previous chief justice and Sandra Day OConnor Alitos predecessor whose moderate consensusseeking approach constantly thwarted Scalia Liberals such as Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg regard Scalias ideas as perilous They fear that if they were ever fully accepted by the nations judges the emphasis on individual rights established in the last half century  for the poor the disenfranchised  would be lost Today in the chandeliered ballroom however Scalia is among the faithful with his own In 1982 when the Federalist Society was founded by students at Yale University and the University of Chicago to counter the liberalism of academia Scalia was present He was teaching at Chicago and became the faculty adviser to the founding students there He helped the group raise money and attract prominent speakers As the Federalist Society began to flourish gaining wealth and adding members Scalia was an Alist invitee for annual conferences Now the society boasts up to forty thousand members and a record of influence with three Republican presidents and their lifetenured appointments to federal courts Two years before this occasion at the Mayflower the Federalist Society celebrated Scalia at a blacktie dinner for his twenty years on the Supreme Court Over the last twenty years Justice Scalia has done for the Court what President Reagan did for the presidency and the country declared the Northwestern University law professor Steven Calabresi one of the founding students at Yale He has by the force and clarity of his opinions become a defining figure in American constitutional law of the last two decades Scalia had marched up to the stage joined by his wife Maureen and all nine of their children They smiled brightly all grownups yet jostling one another goodnaturedly like children who had just emerged from a long trip in the family van I really do much better at responding to criticism than at responding to praise the man of the hour had said If you accept it as though its really due youre being conceited If you reject it you are being supposedly insincere or at least ungrateful My favorite response has been one Lyndon Johnson used  I wish my parents could have been here My father would have been proud and my mother would have believed it  Scalia grew up an only child the son of Salvatore Eugene Scalia and the former Catherine Panaro Remarkably he was also the only offspring of his generation from the entire Scalia and Panaro families None of his mothers six siblings had a child Neither did his fathers only sibling a sister So Nino as he was called became the center of attention for two tightknit striving Italian immigrant families His father had come to America knowing little English had earned a PhD at Columbia University and had spent three decades teaching Romance languages at Brooklyn College The son did not let him down He was valedictorian at New Yorks Xavier High School first in his class at Georgetown University and a magna cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School A man of pride and ambition Scalia advanced quickly through jobs in the Nixon and Ford administrations before ending up at the University of Chicago and then on the federal appeals court in Washington DC Onstage that night in 2006 Scalia saluted the next generation of his family He motioned to his nine children  one a priest wearing his collar another an army officer in uniform  and his wife Maureen the Radcliffe coed whom he had met while at Harvard and married in 1960 The justice called her the product of the best decision I ever made the mother of the nine children you see the woman responsible for raising them with very little assistance from me  And theres not a dullard in the bunch That was his moment in 2006 Now in 2008 the jurist who is a combination of Felix Frankfurter and Luciano Pavarotti entering the third act of his judicial career is enjoying an encore The Federalist Society is celebrating him as it does nearly every year in some way this late Saturday afternoon theres less glitter than at the societys famously sumptuous dinners but no less gusto Scalias visage bigger than life is projected on a large screen to his right as he speaks at the Mayflower Hotel lectern The moderator Leonard Leo the executive vice president of the Federalist Society and an old Scalia friend has been reading questions for the justice that have been penciled on small white cards and handed up from the audience Someone asks whether the originalism approach has any theoretical flaws Scalia pauses at first seemingly struggling to find any shortcomings Then in response he says that it is difficult for todays judges to know how the Constitutions drafters would respond to contemporary phenomena such as the Internet He cautions that originalism is not perfect yet adds But whatever our problems are they pale next to the problems of the idea of the Living Constitution  Another questioner notes that Scalia has called himself a fainthearted originalist Oh that was so long ago the justice responds referring to a 1989 law review article he wrote Scalia explains that he had used fainthearted because he did not see how he or any other judge could vote to uphold say ear notching of criminals as was allowed in the eighteenth century If he were a true originalist Scalia says he would have to find ear notching today perfectly constitutional despite the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment Then he quips to the Federalist Society home crowd that maybe he could be a complete originalist these days Ive gotten older and crankier The audience laughs heartily A law student sends up a question asking what a Federalist Society member should do in the face of militant or intolerant law professors or peers Although the conservative legal group has developed legions of members across campuses in law firms and at government institutions liberalism still dominates in law schools Equally significant national politics has shifted dramatically away from conservatism Just three weeks before the conference on November 4 2008 Barack Obama was elected president of the United States This was a milestone foremost because Obama became the first African American president but also because his election was widely seen as the end of an era of conservatism In spite of that this Federalist Society occasion is not solemn or melancholy It is a celebration of the judicial victories that still can be claimed Supreme Court justices reside in their own realm At the taproot of the American legal system the conservative legacy of three Republican presidents is still dominant and Scalia is its central figure It could be years before President Obamas judicial appointees are able to change the tenor of the law Scalia also knows how to make headway against prevailing winds He boasts that one of my charms is that I tell people what they dont like to hear Comfortable with tension and relishing debate his rhetorical style is combative But he does not enter every fight He rebuffs criticism that his decisions are inconsistent or driven by a desire to achieve conservative goals I often come to decisions I dont like he insists He mentions that as a policy matter he has endorsed deregulation of markets but as a judge he has voted to uphold regulation when federal law required it Scalia often reminds audiences that he voted to strike down laws banning flag burning as political protest although personally I dont like scruffy bearded sandalwearing people who go around burning the United States flag In response to the question about how to fight a disapproving professor Scalia a Roman Catholic first jokes My mother used to say Offer it up  Then he tells the audience Most of the professors I know  would welcome someone from the other side  who can serve as a foil  because they think they can beat you Thats why they publish my dissents in their casebooks The harder question is What do I do when it comes to writing the exam Do I give him the answer he taught me to be the right answer  Scalia pauses for effect Yeah he said As his audience chortles Scalia adds that it is best to save real protest for another day Wily as a serpent he advises with a sly smile Now Scalia takes that final question the one he is waiting to knock out of the park Reading from a white card Leonard Leo asks Scalia how he reconciles his differing opinions in two wellknown disputes the 1995 United States v Lopez and 2005 Gonzales v Raich cases Scalia voted in 1995 to overturn a federal law that regulated guns near schools because it trampled on state authority Ten years later he voted to uphold a federal drug law that voided a California policy allowing marijuana use for medical purposes over dissenting justices protests that the federal policy infringed on the states The 2005 case had been brought by two seriously ill women who had cultivated marijuana under Californias Compassionate Use Act For the three years since legal analysts had been buzzing over whether Scalia abandoned his abhorrence of federal intervention simply because he opposed the legalization of marijuana At the Court in 2005 Justice OConnor had declared the two Scalia positions  forbidding the federal government to displace state choices about handgun regulation but letting it override state choices about drug laws  irreconcilable Justice Clarence Thomas Scalias usual soul mate on the law had been equally critical of the notion that Congress could interfere with a carefully restricted marijuana law providing relief to the seriously ill He had scoffed The federal government may now regulate quilting bees clothes drives and potluck suppers throughout the 50 states The question on the little white card goes to the heart of Scalias legacy Is his brand of originalism simply a way to achieve conservative results Does he talk a good game until his method fails to get him what he wants as a policy matter This afternoon Scalia is not going to engage such inquiry Oh no he says grimacing Get another question It has the ring of Get over it That is Scalias stock answer when someone in an audience wants him to address Bush v Gore the decision that stopped the presidential ballot recounts in Florida and gave George W Bush the White House over Vice President Al Gore in 2000 The decision remained a political thorn in the side of the nation through Bushs two terms and particularly for Scalias critics offered evidence of his willingness to abandon principle when it does not get him the outcome he desires At the Mayflower the audience laughs when he says get another question It is a friendly laugh To them there is nothing wrong with his ducking a hardball Leonard Leo sets aside the offending card and asks Scalia Whats your favorite opera Oh says Scalia there are so many works all so different He throws out some personal favorites Strausss comic opera Der Rosenkavalier Puccinis tragic Madama Butterfly Verdis popular La Traviata Then Scalia adds And I like country music too As people leap to their feet and clap he waves big and strides off Excerpted from American Original by Joan Biskupic Copyright  2009 by Joan Biskupic Published this month by Sarah Crichton Books  Farrar Straus and Giroux LLC All

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121751626&ft=3&f=,The number of businesses that sell marijuana has increased greatly in Colorado where use of pot for medical reasons has been allowed since 2000 A mix of confusing regulations and court rulings had kept its distribution in check  until earlier this year Now pot stores are showing up in many neighborhoods  and there are calls for more regulation  A Lack Of Regulations Just outside downtown Denver in a neighborhood that has become known as Little Amsterdam theres a cluster of three marijuana dispensaries Pierre Werner moved there from Las Vegas to open one called DrReefercom The laws here in Colorado are a lot more liberal than in conservative Nevada Werner says The state of Colorado gave me a business license and told me to pay my taxes The state of Nevada put me in prison Werner says he has three felony convictions for selling marijuana But in Colorado there is no regulation against felons opening a dispensary  There was one problem for Werner though His store in Little Amsterdam was near a church and a school There are no rules against that either but he didnt want to upset the neighbors So he moved his business to a spot that could be even more lucrative  right across the street from the University of Colorado in Boulder Werner says the lack of regulations encouraged him to open shop And he says the White House helped move things along  Thanks to President Obama and US Attorney General Eric Holder for getting the feds off our back and allowing the states to implement their laws Werner says The Obama administration has said that busting medical marijuana operations will be low on its priority list  Status Quo Gives Way To Heated Debate Nobody knows how many dispensaries there are in Colorado the best guess is about 150 In the past nine years there have been efforts to regulate Colorados medical marijuana industry The state health department wanted to limit the number of patients using medical pot that a vendor could supply And it planned to adopt a rule stating that a vendor must do more than just sell pot The rule imagined them also performing caregiving services like accompanying patients to the doctor But nearly all of those efforts have been unsuccessful Its not surprising at all that the socalled dispensaries are popping up everywhere says Colorado Attorney General John Suthers As the states top Republican elected official and a law enforcer Suthers was never fond of the medical marijuana concept When folks complain to him about the number of dispensaries he tells them there is almost nothing prosecutors can do  That may be about to change because there is strong interest among some state lawmakers to regulate this fastgrowing industry But the next legislative session doesnt begin until January I think the combination of whats going on right now and this  if youll excuse the expression  legal haze that were in I think its going to cause things to be somewhat status quo until the legislature convenes Suthers says Then I think youre going to have some very heated debate  Stricter Limits Coming Already law enforcement officials and district attorneys are lobbying for stricter limits on dispensaries And the marijuana businesses have formed their own lobbying group which is growing larger all the time as more dispensaries open   In Little Amsterdam Nicholas Paul runs a marijuana dispensary called Walking Raven He says the new competition doesnt worry him much I believe theres enough people out there that need the medicine Paul says Were only going to have 500 patients that we take care off Were almost full and ready to close our doors which will leave room for another dispensary Paul says his business expects to pay about 80000 in sales taxes each year He hopes lawmakers will consider that as they debate tighter regulations on marijuana businesses Copyright 2014 NPR,"Mon, 28 Dec 2009 12:15:00 -0500",drugs
NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121164499&ft=3&f=,Chapter One I have a farm on a deadend street in the ghetto My back stairs are dotted with chicken turds Bales of straw come undone in the parking area next to my apartment I harvest lettuce in an abandoned lot I awake in the mornings to the sounds of farm animals mingled with my neighbors blaring car alarm I didnt always call this place a farm That didnt happen until the spring of 2005 when a very special package was delivered to my apartment and changed everything I remember standing on my deck waiting for it While scanning the horizon for the postal jeep I checked the health of my bee colony Honeybees buzzed in and out of the hive their hind legs loaded down with yellow pollen I caught a whiff of their honeymaking on the breeze mixed with the exhaust from the nearby freeway I could see the highway heavy with traffic from the deck I noticed that three bees had fallen into a watering can As their wings sent out desperate ripples along the water I broke off a twig from a potted star jasmine and offered it to the drowning insects One bee clambered onto the stick and clung to it as I transported her to the top of the hive The next bee did the same  she held fast to the twig like a passenger gone overboard clutching a lifesaver Safe atop the hive the two soggy bees opened their wings to the morning sunlight Once dry and warm they would be able to fly again Just to see what would happen I lifted the final rescuee to the entrance of the hive instead of the top A guard bee stomped out from the dark recesses of the brood box Theres always one on vigil for disturbances armed and ready to sting As the guard bee got closer to the wet one I braced myself for a brutal natural history lesson The waterlogged bee started to right herself as she waved a soggy antenna Another guard bee joined the first and together they probed the wet bee She couldnt have smelled of their hive anymore which is how most bees recognize one another Nonetheless the guards began to lick her dry Hey Hey a voice yelled I peered down to the end of our deadend street A new car a silver Toyota Corolla had arrived on 28th Street the night before probably the victim of a joyride  Corollas are notoriously easy to start without a key Local teenagers steal them and drive around until they run out of gas Already the car had lost one wheel By nightfall I predicted it would be stripped completely Amid the jumble of abandoned cars and trash and the shiny Toyota Corolla I made out the figure of the man who was yelling He waved vigorously Bobby Morning sir I called and saluted him He saluted back Bobby lived in an immobilized car He switched on his television which was mounted on top of one of the other abandoned cars An orange extension cord snaked from a tealcolored house at the end of the block The perky noise of Regis and Kathie Lee joined the sound of the nearby traffic and the clattering trundle of the San Francisco Bay Areas subway BART which runs aboveground next to the highway Just then a monk came out of the Buddhist monastery across the street from my house and brought Bobby a snack The monks will feed anyone who is hungry Next to the fountain in their courtyard theres a giant alabaster statue of a placidfaced lady riding a dragon Kuan Yin the goddess of compassion My bees loved to drink from the lotusflowerfilled fountain I often watched their golden bodies zoom across 28th Street at the same height as the power lines then swoop down behind the temples red iron gates The monk who handed Bobby a container of rice and vegetables was female dressed in pale purple robes her head shaved Bobby took the food and shoved it into a microwave plugged in next to the television set Nuked his breakfast I heard the clattering sound of a shopping cart A can scrounger Wearing a giant Chinese wicker hat and rubber gloves and carrying a pair of tongs she opened our recycling bin and started fishing around for cans She muttered to herself in Chinese Ayya I watched as Bobby jogged over to her I had never seen him run before Get out of here he growled His territory She shook her head as if to say she didnt understand and continued fishing Bobby butted her with his belly I said get he yelled She scurried away pulling her cart after her Bobby watched her retreat Then when she was almost around the corner as if he felt bad Bobby put his hands to his mouth and yelled Ill see you at the recycling center Just a few blocks away the center paid cash by the pound for metal Chuckling to himself Bobby glanced up at me on the deck and flashed me a mostly toothless smile This place this ghetto of Oakland California brings out the best and the worst in us Bored of waiting around outside I headed back inside my apartment A fly strip dangled from the ceiling and ripped feed bags piled up near the door A black velour couch my boyfriend and I found in the street sagged in the corner I guess the neighborhood brings out the best and worst in me too Sure my chickens lay eggs  but the flock has spawned an occasional rooster that crowed loudly and often starting at 4 am Bees do result in honey and wax and better pollination  but they have also stung people from time to time The garden verdant cornucopia on one hand rodentattracting breeding ground on the other I flopped onto the couch and read the chalkboard tally that hung near the door 4 chickens 30000 bees approximately 59 flies 2 monkeys me and my boyfriend Bill That tally was about to change  A longdebunked scientific theory states that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny Basically that means that the order of development in an embryo indicates its evolutionary development  for example a human embryo first looks like a fish because we evolved from fish When Bill and I first moved from Seattle to Oakland I was reminded of that theory because somehow we ended up recreating our old life in the exact same order as we had created it in Seattle The first year in Oakland we built the garden the second year we got the honeybees and then the chickens In this our third year of development it was time to evolve to the next level Out of the corner of my eye I watched through the window as the postal jeep turned down our street and pulled to a stop in front of our house A man dressed in wool shorts hopped out holding an airholeriddled box in his arms I bounded downstairs My neighbor Mr Nguyen who lived one floor below me was sitting outside on the porch smoke and steam from his morning cigarette and Vietnamese coffee wafting up together in the crisp spring air In his sixties Mr Nguyen dyed his graying hair black wore buttondown dress shirts and was surprisingly sprightly He set down his coffee stubbed out his cigarette and walked into the street with me to receive the package The postal worker made me sign an officiallooking piece of paper before he would hand me the box It peeped when I opened it It was filled with puff balls Fuzzy yellow ducklings called out desperately with their orange bills Longnecked goslings squawked and fluffy multicolored chicks peeped Three oddlooking chicks with an unattractive pimple of skin atop their heads gazed up quietly from the box The delivery guy shook his head in disbelief I could tell he had questions Were we not in the city Wasnt downtown Oakland only ten blocks away Who is this insane woman Is this even legal But years of working for the government had perhaps deadened his curiosity He didnt look me in the eye He didnt make a sound He just jumped back into his postal jeep and drove away Mr Nguyen giggled For the last few years he had happily observed  and participated in  my ruralurban experiments He knew poultry when he saw it he had been a farmer in Vietnam before enlisting to help the Americans during the war Oh yes baby chicks he said Ducks He pointed a cigarettestained finger at each species Goose His finger paused at the pimpled heads He looked at me for a hint Baby turkeys I guessed I had never seen a baby turkey either Mr Nguyen raised his eyebrows Gobblegobble Thanksgiving Oh yes he said remembering with a smile Then he grimaced My wife make one time Was it good I asked I knew that his wife Lee was a vegetarian she must have made an exception for Thanksgiving Mr Nguyen shook his head vigorously No tough Too tough Very bad I thought he might spit I closed the lid and the peeping stopped Mr Nguyen went back into his apartment returning to the blare of a Vietnameselanguage television show In the middle of 28th Street I held the box of poultry and waterfowl The abandoned ghetto where we lived had a distinct Wild West vibe  gunfights in the middle of the day a general state of lawlessness and now this livestock I glanced at the invoice connected to the box Murray McMurray Hatchery it read 1 Homesteaders Delight I didnt think about it at the time but looking back on it I realize that Homesteaders Delight does have a rather ominous ring to it  Every secondrate city has an identity complex Oakland is no different Its always trying to be more arty more hightech more clean than it is able OTown is surrounded by overachievers The famously liberal and plush Berkeley lies to the north The hightech mecca of Silicon Valley glimmers to the south Just eight miles west via the Bay Bridge is San Francisco  so close but the polar opposite of Oakland SF is filled with successful polished people Oakland is scruffy loud unkempt Ive always chosen uncool places to live I guess its because I was born in Idaho rivaling only Ohio as the most disregarded state in the union Then I lived in a logging town in Washington State whose big claim to fame was a satanic cult By the time I moved to Seattle living in the boring Beacon Hill neighborhood the uncool the unsavory had become my niche When I went traveling and someone warned me  speaking in low tones a snarl to her lips  not to go to Croatia or Chiapas or Brooklyn I tended to add the place to my itinerary immediately Whatever you do dont go to Oakland a stockingcapclad guy at a Seattle barbecue told me when I confessed that I was going to check out the Bay Area on a long road tripquest to find a new place to live I made a mental note to check it out Bill and I took three months to explore the candidates At his insistence we brought our cat Bills a toughlooking guy with shaggy hair and a strut like hes got two watermelons under his arms His voice is Tom Waits gravel from years of smoking He might resemble a Hells Angel but hes really just a love sponge who spends a great deal of time cuddling with our cat We hit all the cities we thought we might like to live in Portland too perfect Austin too in the middle of Texas New Orleans too hot Brooklyn too little recycling Philly and Chicago too cold But Oakland  Oakland was just right The weather was lovely a neverending spring There was recycling and a music scene But what really drove me and Bill away from the clean and orderly Seattle and into the arms of Oakland was its downandout qualities The faded art deco buildings The dive bars Its citizenry who drove cars as old and beatup as ours Because of  inexperience and a housing shortage Bill and I wound up sharing a ramshackle house in the Oakland hills with a pack of straightedge vegan anarchists They wore brownblack clothes had earth names like Rotten and liked to play violent computer games in large groups in the common room Sober At first I thought it was cute that anarchists had rules No alcohol No dairy products No meat Then the paradox started to chafe Forced by the strict house regulations Bill and I would have to rendezvous in our travelworn van in order to take nips off a contraband bottle of wine gorge ourselves on banned cheese products and remember the good old days when we oppressed chickens in our backyard in Seattle And we plotted our uprising One night I unearthed an apartment listing on Craigslist that would set us free I found it during video game night at the house surrounded by a pack of anarchists in our living room While they fired imaginary guns on their computer screens I clandestinely scanned the ad for the apartment It was reasonably priced and in downtown Oakland Feeling subversive we went for a tour the next day The first thing we noticed when we came down from the verdant hills into the flatlands  also known as the lower bottoms  was the dearth of trees Gray predominated Bill drove his coffee brown eyes nervously scanning the scene We passed one green space huddled under a network of connecting onramps A basketball court some shrubs It was called Marcus Garvey Park No one was there even on an early summer day What was happening was liquor stores Captain Liquor Brothers Market S and N One after another The surrounding restaurants were mostly fastfood chains a Taco Bell Carls Jr Churchs Chicken One variety store caught my eye Its handmade sign used no words just images a pair of dice socks eggs toilet paper Lifes necessities It reminded me of the little roadside tiendas in Mexico It was the third world embedded in the first The houses though dilapidated had clearly once been lovely homes elaborate Victorians next to Spanish Mission bungalows Craftsman cottages and vintage brick apartment buildings They were chipped charred unpainted crumbling Beautiful neglect As we cruised the neighborhood we took stock of our potential neighbors A man wearing a head scarf was singing as he swept garbage out of the gutter in front of his liquor store A group of old men sat in lawn chairs in front of their apartment building A blond woman with scabs on her face limped along the street pausing to ask for spare change from the young black kids on the corner The kids wore enormous white Tshirts and saggy pants they counted their bills and stood in the middle of traffic waving small plastic bags at prospective customers Clearly a rough crowd All these people out on the street  they were characters I had never met in Seattle or in our more suburban house in the Oakland hills I was curious and yet I had to admit it they scared me Could I really live here Walk around the streets without worrying about getting mugged The place was a postcard of urban decay I thought as we turned down 28th Street Cheetos bags somersaulted across the road An eightstory brick building on the corner was entirely abandoned and tattooed with graffiti Living here would definitely mean getting out of my comfort zone We came to a stop in front of a gray 1905 Queen Anne Like almost every other house in the Bay Area it had been divided into apartments The place for rent was the upstairs portion of the duplex Bill and I surveyed the house The paint was peeling a bougainvillea sagged in the side yard It was a deadend street stopping at what was once the grass playground of an elementary school Bill pointed out that a deadend street is a quiet street He had once lived on one in Orlando and got to know all his neighbors It made things intimate he said Just then a dazzling woman with cropped platinum hair and platform boots peeked out of her metal warehouse door and beckoned us over to her end of the street My names Lana she said Anal spelled backward Bill and I exchanged looks She stood behind her chainlink fence a 155pound mastiff at her side A robed Buddhist monk emerged from the house next door He and Lana waved He disarmed his car alarm  the danger of the hood trumps even karma  and drove away Lana gazed at the retreating car and said The old monk used to make me bittermelon soup when I was sick Lana told us in her high funny voice that she had lived on the 28 for fifteen years Its not bad now she assured us A few years ago though I had people running over my roof firing machine guns Now its like Sesame Street She shook her head Lana then pointed at each of the houses and described its inhabitants a white family she called the Hillbillies in the teal house a black mom with two kids in the stucco duplex an apartment house filled with Vietnamese families who wanted to live near the temple An abandoned building with a sometime squatter An empty warehouse that no one knew much about As we took leave of Lana she invited us to Blue Wednesday a salon for artists and performers she held every week She seems interesting I said as we walked back to get our tour of the apartment Our landlords had arrived in their gold BMW We should move in Bill said running his fingers through his shaggy dark hair He didnt even need to see the apartment Our soontobe landlords were an African couple with socialist tendencies They led us upstairs for a tour of the bright little apartment Hardwood floors A tilelined fireplace A backyard A living room with a view of a 4500squarefoot lot filled with fourfoottall weeds The landlords didnt know who owned the lot but they guessed that whoever they were they wouldnt mind if we gardened there We gaped at the enormous space It had an aspect that would guarantee full sun all day In Seattle we tended what we thought was a big backyard vegetable garden but this lot  it was massive by our standards It sealed the deal Bill and I grinned on our way back to our hovel in the hills with the vegan anarchists still giddy from too much California sunshine and the prospect of a new home A few weeks later when we moved into our new apartment we discovered that our neighborhood was called GhostTown for all its longabandoned businesses condemned houses and overgrown lots The empty lot next to our house was not rare there was one sometimes two on every block And through the vacant streets rolled GhostTown tumbleweeds the lost hairpieces of prostitutes Tumbleweaves The day we moved into GhostTown a man was shot and killed outside a Carls Jr restaurant a few blocks away We drove past the crime scene  yellow caution tape a white sheet with a pair of bare feet poking out We heard on the radio that Oakland had been named number one  it had the highest murder rate in the country When we drove by later the body was gone and the business of selling hamburgers and soda had resumed That night the notsodistant crack of gunfire kept me up Because of the violence the neighborhood had a whiff of anarchy  real anarchy not the theoretical world of my former roommates In the flatlands whole neighborhoods were left with the task of sorting out their problems Except in the case of murder the Oakland police rarely got involved In this laissezfaire environment I would discover as I spent more time in GhostTown anything went Spanishspeaking soccer players hosted ad hoc tournaments in the abandoned playfield Teenagers sold bags of marijuana on the corners The Buddhist monks made enormous vats of rice on the city sidewalk Bill eventually began to convert our friends cars to run on vegetable oil And I started squat gardening on land I didnt own  As I fiddled with the door to our apartment the new box of fowl tucked under my arm I recognized that I was descending deeper into the realm of the underground economy Now that I had been in California for a few years I felt ready for what seemed like the next logical progression something I had never dared in the soggy Northwest Meat birds I felt a bit nuts yes but I also felt great People move to California to reinvent themselves They give themselves new names They go to yoga Pretty soon they take up surfing Or Thai kickboxing Or astral healing Or witch camp Its true what they say California the land of fruits and nuts In Northern California one is encouraged to raise his freak flag proudly and often In Seattle my mostly hidden freak flag had been being a backyard chicken owner beekeeper and vegetable gardener I got off on raising my own food Not only was it more delicious and fresh it was also essentially free Now I was taking it to the next level Some might say I had been swept up by the Bay Areas mantra repeated ad nauseam to eat fresh local freerange critters At farmers markets here  and there is one every day  it isnt uncommon to overhear farmers chatting with consumers about how the steer from which their steaks were harvested had been fed where their stewing hens ranged and the view from the sheep pen that housed the lamb that was now ground up and laid out on a table decorated with nasturtium blossoms Prices correspond with the quality of the meat and Alice Waters assures us that only the best ingredients will make the best meals But as a poor scrounger with three lowpaying jobs and no health insurance I usually couldnt afford the good stuff Since I liked eating quality meat and have always had more skill than money I decided to take matters into my own hands One night after living in our GhostTown apartment for a few years I clicked my mouse over various meatbird packages offered by the Murray McMurray Hatchery Web site Murray McMurray sold dayold ducks quail pheasants turkeys and geese through the mail They also sold bargainpriced combinations the Barnyard Combo the Fancy Duck Package the Turkey Assortment These packages I had thought might offer a way to eat quality meat without breaking the bank But I had never killed anything before Blithely ignoring this minor detail I settled on the Homesteaders Delight two turkeys ten chickens two geese and two ducks for 42 I bought my poultry package with a click of the mouse and paid for it with a credit card It was only after the post office delivered the box that I realized one cant just buy a farm animal like a book or CD What I now held in my hands was going to involve a hell of a lot of hard work My first task was to install the birds in a brooder a warm place where they could live without fear of catching cold or encountering predators I carried the box o birds upstairs and set it next to the brooder I had hastily built the night before Built might be a strong word  my brooder was a cardboard box lined with shredded paper with a heat lamp suspended above it and a homemade waterer inside The hatchery advised that the chicks would be thirsty from their twentyfourhour journey in a box So the first order of the day was to dip the birds beaks into a dish of water and teach them to drink on their own I picked up my first victim a little yellow chick covered in a soft downy fuzz and held her tiny pink beak up to the homemade waterer It consisted of a mason jar with tiny holes drilled into the lid when the jar was turned upside down into a shallow dish capillary action allowed only a bit of water to dribble out and pool in the dish Amazingly the chick knew just what to do She sipped up a beakful of water then tilted her head back to swallow The masonjar waterer glugged and more water seeped out I released her into the cardboardbox brooder and she wandered over for another sip of water Then she realized she was alone She peeped and stumbled around the shredded newspaper looking for her companions The fowl still in the postal box strangely silent since Id placed it on the living room floor suddenly went wild when they heard her peeps So I reached into the box for another chick and worked quickly Without fail each victim peeped in distress The others then chirped in solidarity All ten finally installed the chicks quieted down Exhausted from their journey and my manhandling they mounded into a fluffy pile under the circle of warm light and took a nap Bill stumbled out of our bedroom wearing his boxer shorts his hair mussed Not a morning person he glanced at the baby birds like they were a dream then headed for the bathroom While the chicks slept I had to educate the dim little turkey poults They looked like the chicks but with bigger bones and that strange pucker of skin on top of their heads which I later learned would develop into a turkey part called the snood Their demeanor was reminiscent of chicks that had done too much acid It took the first turkey poult three firm dunkings before it got the hang of drinking water The poult resisted when I put its beak into the dish craning its head away struggling in my hand like a hellcat Finally exhausted from struggling its head went lax and drooped until it dropped into the water dish where it discovered  surprise  water and drank greedily The other two the hatchery had sent me an extra poult and an extra duckling probably as insurance against death by mail were no different After I released them the poults poked around the brooder gentle and cautious Eventually they waddled over and joined the puff pile of chicks The downy almost weightless ducklings and goslings drank deeply using their bills to slurp up large amounts of water When I set them into the brooder they waded their big orange feet into the water dish and splashed around Water hit the side of the box and splattered the sleeping chicks who awoke and began to peep in protest Sensing that this might be a disastrous species intersection I lugged out an aluminum washtub and set up a separate brooder with extra water a towel and a bright warm light for the waterfowl The baby birds were home warm and safe The chicks scratched at their yellow feed just like our big chickens out back did Sometimes they would stop midscratch and feeling the warmth of the brooder light fall asleep standing up The puffy gray goslings curled their necks around the yellow sleeping ducklings A Hallmark card had exploded in my living room I called my mom A brooder box full of fowl was something that woman could appreciate She had once been a hippie homesteader in Idaho Listen to this I said and held the phone near the brooder box A hundred little peeps Oh my god she said Three turkeys three ducks two geese and ten chickens I crowed I watched the chicks and poults moving around the brooder  pooping scratching pooping pecking pooping Turkeys Do you remember Tommy Turkey she said I didnt but the photo in our family album had stuck with me my older sister Riana in a saggy cloth diaper being chased by the advancing figure of a giant white turkey Tommy My mom told us about Tommy every time we got out the old photo album from the ranch days Well he was mean as hell and he would chase you guys   I looked out the window while my mom described the smokehouse she and my dad had built Bill had made it downstairs where he was out front tinkering with our car His legs peeked out from underneath our dilapidated Mercedes as he rolled around amid the streets numerous Swisher Sweet cigar butts I had warned him about my meatbird purchase and he had been excited about the prospect of homegrown meat but now that he saw the baby birds  fragile tiny  he seemed a bit skeptical N Tommy grew to be an enormous size my mom said and as backtotheland hippies she and my dad had been very pleased They didnt encounter any predator problems that year and butchering him was a cinch But disaster did hit the smokehouse burned to the ground while they were smoking the turkey Oh no I groaned Life was like that she said glumly I felt sorry for her My moms stories usually involve some heroic hippie farm action I hadnt heard this part of the story before but I knew bad things had happened My parents marriage had dissolved on the ranch in Idaho after all  my dad too much the mountain man an uncompromising nonconformist my mom isolated and bored Her voice brightened Even though the smokehouse burned down we did manage to salvage the turkey What do you mean I asked We dug through the charred wood and there it was a perfectly cooked turkey I brushed off all the cinders and served him for dinner She paused and smacked her lips a noise that was repellent to me as a teenager but now filled me with hope It was the best turkey Ive ever had she declared We said our goodbyes and I hung up the phone I glanced into the cozy chick brooder The chicks slept on their mattress of shredded pages from the New York Times Their fuzzy bodies slumbered on snatches of color ads for watches a stern oped about pollution in China the eyebrows of a politician I had to remind myself that though they were cute these baby birds would eventually become my dinner Thanksgiving in particular was going to be intense I imagined the killing scene a butcher block an ax three giant Tommy turkeys I had known since poulthood I wasnt sure if I could bring myself to do it But the conversation with my mom left me emboldened for my foray into killing and eating animals I had raised myself  this urge was clearly part of my cultural DNA I wondered if this would prove that I could have it both ways to sop up the cultural delights of the city while simultaneously raising my own food In retrospect though I wonder why I thought my experience would be any less disastrous than my parents  The next day following the suggestions of a homesteading book from the 1970s I swabbed the baby birds butts with Qtips The long flight in a box can cause digestion problems for the chicks  namely pasted vents Which is a fancy way of saying blocked buttholes So I dutifully wetted them down plucked dried matter from their bottoms and felt terrible when I had to tug off whole chunks of downy feathers I wasnt satisfied until all their parts looked pink and healthy After morning chickenbutt detail I sat in my kitchen and surveyed our squat garden All the eastfacing windows of our apartment overlook the lot which after the past few years had been transformed into a vegetable and fruittree garden I could see that the collards were getting large and that the springs lettuce harvest promised to be a good one Even from inside I could see some mildew forming on the pea vines It was going to be a remarkable year I could sense it If my life in Oakland was a developing embryo with this meatbird addition it was as if a fishlike creature had suddenly sprouted wings From Farm City The

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120983848&ft=3&f=,These days medical marijuana clinics are popping up like weeds in California Los Angeles alone has nearly 1000 places where with a doctors note you can legally buy potBut the illegal side of marijuana is also thriving Authorities say its partly because all those pot clinics have boosted the demand That means the state spends millions of dollars trying to wipe out a plant thats already sanctionedThe Eyes Are WatchingFor decades a task force of lawmen has been parachuting into some of the most rugged sections of California For a week at a time they search for and destroy as much pot as they can find They call it the Campaign Against Marijuana Planting or CAMP On a recent day NPR joined CAMP in a helicopter to hunt for cannabis in Humboldt County in Northern CaliforniaIt takes a trained eye to see the plants because theyre hidden in the trees Circling over a dense stand of redwood trees we spot some Then we head for the landing zoneRetired Humboldt County Sheriffs Lt Steve Cobine says cultivating cannabis is now a big business in state forests and private timberlands It has a distinctive color  emerald green says Cobine You cant miss itWe hike to one of the places we spotted from the air clearing a path along the way with machetes Every few feet theres a marijuana plant There are rat traps set and poison to keep away any rodents from eating the plants And there are long drip lines  irrigation lines that water these plantsCobine says pot growers will camp out at illegal sites like this for months to secretly cultivate and harvest marijuana Sometimes they try to scare people away with mannequins or scarecrows wearing clothing It wakes you up says Cobine You never think youre alone At least I know I dontEyes could be watching at all times he says The growers run off and hide in the brush  though they cant get far But Cobine says CAMP rarely catches anyone in the act The growers are often armed and have been known to shoot at anyone who comes near Were always finding guns he says We found three last week in a garden One was a Beretta 9mm one was a government 45 automatic pistolAll Races Creeds ColorsMany of these illegal marijuana fields are the work of major drug cartels says Jack Nelsen a special agent with Californias Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement Its all races creeds colors he says Everyones growing Weve got it all going onNelsen says Asian drug trafficking organizations grow marijuana in national forests and Hispanic operations grow mostly on private lands Others grow marijuana in illegal indoor greenhousesWe used to call them guerrilla grows the white boy grows Nelsen says Those are generally smaller very highquality large plants  not thousands of plants like the Hispanic drug operationsAccording to Nelsen the socalled Hispanic drug cartels have upward of 100000 plants at any given grow Hispanic grows sometimes look like cornfields he says But the Asian drug trafficking organizations tend to plant on very very steep areasNelsen says the marijuana business exploded after California voters passed Proposition 215 The state now allows people to use medical marijuana with a doctors recommendation known as a 215 card Everyones got a medical recommendation in Humboldt County he says half joking Its the Humboldt County insurance policy You can carry 3 pounds in your car with a recommendation They thinkThe local and state legalities are quite confusing Nelsen says Because of the loopholes and especially in this county how liberal the view is on how many plants you can have and how much marijuana you can have in your house weve become an area many outofstaters flock to I call it the green rushLimited Police ResourcesLocal police say they dont have time or resources to arrest every smalltime marijuana grower in Humboldt District Attorney Paul Gallegos says hed rather go after the bigger growersOur priority is business people he says from his office in Eureka Calif If youre growing for yourself really thats against the law But why am I interested in that I still have to enforce the laws but youre low priority for meHumboldt County Sheriff Gary Philp says its difficult to track down the larger growers the cartels What are we gonna do if we arrest two or three people that are out there tending a garden that really arent the kingpins of it he asks Theyre just stuck there They dont know whose garden it really isDespite Humboldt being one of the biggest marijuana suppliers in the country Philp says he can only afford to assign one fulltime deputy in charge of drug enforcement With the limited resources were doing the best we can Philp says But a county such as ours were 3500 square miles  some very remote rugged areas  and were not under any misconception that were just out there getting all that stuff  I mean were making a dent but yeah its difficultPart Of Me Wants Marijuana LegalizedAs authorities try to crack down on illegal marijuana growers the demand for pot continues especially since medical marijuana is now legal in California But buying and selling is still illegal even at the pot dispensariesAnd the federally funded eradication continues This year CAMP hauled in 45 million plants from around California But Cobine admits thats a tiny percentage of whats really out thereWere just keeping a lid on it so it doesnt go crazy Cobine saysInstead of burning the confiscated plants like they used to do Sheriffs Sgt Wayne Hanson says they bury them in undisclosed locations Basically a marijuana plants 90 percent water he says So we dig a hole 10 feet down throw a bunch of soil on it and its basically destroyed then just by the compression of the earth As they haul off a truckload of confiscated plants Hanson makes a somewhat surprising admission Part of me wants marijuana legalized he says cause it would take away the wealth and the greed and the violenceBut he says it would have to be legalized in all of the US not just California Cause if it gets legalized in California youd have all the riffraff coming to California to make money to sell to the other 49 states he says Napa Valley Of PotBack in town some envision the day when Humboldt County becomes the center for weed connoisseurs a sort of Napa Valley of pot  College student Lydia Katz says he looks at the yearly CAMP eradication and thinks What a wasteWhen I see people that are just chopping it down and destroying marijuana I cry deep down inside Katz says outside a pot dispensary in Humboldt County I wish they understood exactly how much of a benefit this plant could bring to them to their loved ones and to the rest of the world Legalization would fix our economy in a secondKatz and others say its

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120957840&ft=3&f=,These are boom times for the marijuana trade especially in Northern Californias Humboldt County Humboldt pot is sold throughout the country including some of the many medical marijuana dispensaries in Los Angeles Decades after backtotheland hippies first moved to the rural area it remains a mecca for marijuana  At the plaza in downtown Arcata there are still wandering tiedyed souls playing guitar and bartering for handmade bongs They openly buy sell and trade small bags of primo weed Nick Larson and his buddy hitchhiked to town to see if the streets truly are paved with pot Weve heard stories all the way down Dude get down to Humboldt You gotta try their weed its amazing  he says So we get down here and people are like tossing handouts and were just like Oh my god Like whether it be trim or just straight buds its just amazing In Eureka the town next door a long line stretches outside the Humboldt Patient Resource Center  The pot dispensary is marked with the familiar green leaf logo and a Tibetan prayer flag Truth is that Humboldt County is one of the best growers and distributors of marijuana in the world says Lydia Katz whos 22 He came to stock up on what he calls his medicine People here understand how much a part of the lifes blood it is Truly without weed this county would go belly up Our economy depends on it Retired Sheriffs Lt Steve Cobine recalls that when logging and fishing jobs dried up in the late 1960s hippies moved in and bought the cheap leftover land  Youd see people living in tepees and tents and dead school buses and whatnot he says  Today he says the local counterculture pastime of growing marijuana has become a thriving business And now those people that were living in school buses own a nice big house and ski in Telluride every year GetRichQuick Economy Marijuana is now infused in almost every aspect of the regions economy In Humboldt County you see a glut of hydroponics stores selling fertilizer and grow lights for cultivating cannabis At the food coop you can order hemp milk and hemp butter Cafe Brio owner Serge Scherbatskoy says many transactions in town are made in cash We see a lot of hundreddollar bills in the cash register he says Theres a lot of money around so its good for a lot of businesses Scherbatskoy cant say that all the money comes from the marijuana trade  But he claims its the only job here that anyone really wants cause its real easy for somebody to make thousands and thousands of dollars and why would they want to work for 10 or 12 or 14 an hour College student Tara Devlin earns money to help pay her tuition She trims marijuana buds for medical marijuana collectives and illegal growers Ill work a couple months for a good amount of money she says Its always cash Humboldt County has lots of pot entrepreneurs One of them calls himself Bucky Buck He gets paid to convert homes into indoor marijuana operations or grows  It used to be like the Grateful Deadstyle hippie thing everyones peace and chill he says But now its more like these aggressive just transient kind of lifestyles Its not like the whole peace love and granola thing anymore Bucky Buck says Proposition 215 Californias medical marijuana law spawned a flurry of getrichquick businesses here And now he says its like you get people who arent here for the beauty and the love in the area Theyre just here to reap the profit  Our Neighborhoods Are Being Taken Over Walking down her street in Arcata Robin Hashem points out all the homes on her block that are now outfitted to grow marijuana  Theres a lot of electrical energy being used by grow houses she says So if you go by and look at the meter it will be spinning rapidly There are other telltale signs she says Windows covered with plastic people coming and going at all hours the smell of marijuana  If you look at this house theres mildew on the curtains she says pointing across the street Youre not gonna be having a house full of mildew and be there all the time You know theyre just not there on a regular basis They have the kids bikes out there all the time Its just making it really Oh were normal Nothing going on here Hashem says she believes in the compassionate use of marijuana She voted for Proposition 215 But shes had it with the grow houses that surround her Shes been lobbying the city to curb the spread a campaign she calls Nip It in the Bud Our neighborhoods are being taken over by illegal grows she says and we need to do something to stop it Mark Wheetley the mayor of Arcata says the grow houses are a menace With juryrigged electrical wires and toxic chemicals they sometimes catch fire And theyre easy targets for robbers Theyre either drug deals gone wrong or people trying to come in and either steal cash or marijuana from people Wheetley says A lot of it has been people from outside the community that have come in and see this as a quick way to make money So its kind of a Wild West mentality that we had to get out in front of and rope back in So why doesnt somebody pull the plug on the pot business That wouldnt be so easy in a place where marijuana is such an accepted part of life Authorities admit that the county has a lenient interpretation of whats legal under the states medical marijuana law          Anyone with a doctors order for marijuana  called a recommendation  can grow as much pot as they want in a 100squarefoot area But California narcotics special agent Jack Nelsen says some of the locals have gotten carried away They have anywhere from 10 to 100 to 200 plants and they think thats OK he says Because weve got 15 recommendations around the house for my dog my cat my cousin and my brother I Grow As Much As I Can Consume Surrounded by his pet ducks and boa constrictors a pot grower introduces himself as Mr Green He shows off the house he shares with his teenage daughter Past bouquets of marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120314967&ft=3&f=,Note The footnotes from this excerpt have been removed Prologue On a raised dais at Washingtons luxurious Mayflower Hotel the Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia is in high performance mode His comic timing is precise Laughter and applause ripple on cue from the five hundred lawyers packed into the ballroom Gone in an eyeblink is most of his scheduled hour The moderator announces that there will be one final question Make it easy Scalia jokes standing at the lectern in especially fine spirits on this blustery November afternoon You can make it like Senator Strom Thurmonds first question to me when I was up for my confirmation The South Carolina Republican had presided over the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings for Scalia in 1986 when he was nominated by President Reagan for elevation from a federal appeals court Thurmond had opened with a question that played right into Scalias view that judges were wrongly going beyond the letter of the law to solve societys larger problems whether they related to school busing prison crowding or environmental catastrophes These were conflicts Scalia believed should be left in the domain of elected lawmakers  Now Judge Scalia  Scalia says mimicking the slow patois of Senator Thurmond  what do you think of judicial activism  Scalia turns sideways at the lectern and puts his hands together as if at the plate and ready to swing a baseball bat The sleeves of his dark suit yank up flashing his thick white shirt cuffs Im ready for that pitch he says The Scalia illuminated by camera lights at this closing session of the 2008 annual conference of the Federalist Society is heavier than the man America first saw at the witness table in 1986 on nationwide television His jowls are thicker his waist wider His dark black hair has thinned Yet his eyes are lit as always Into his seventies Scalia still exudes energy and passion His gestures are operatic He points his fingers and waves his arms for emphasis His audiences at these public occasions irrespective of whether they are conservative or liberal continue to be large and are nearly always captivated When Scalia enters a room cameras still flash This afternoon at the conservative legal societys convention his audience is standing room only and hanging on his every word and gesture With his biting humor Scalia has been advancing the legal theory known as originalism  insisting that judges should render constitutional decisions based on the eighteenthcentury understanding of the text Its a fight worth making he says in remarks that are part battle cry part assertion of victory I used to be able to say with a good deal of truth that you could fire a cannon loaded with grapeshot into the faculty lounge of any law school in the country and not strike an originalist Scalia says referring to those of the view that the Constitution has a constant meaning one that does not change to fit the needs of a changing society That no longer is true Originalism  which once was orthodoxy  at least now has been returned to the status of respectability He says that until contemporary times  the last fifty years or so  judges interpreted the Constitution to mean what it meant when it was adopted Whether the originalist view remained orthodoxy into the twentieth century is debatable but it was barely in evidence by the late 1950s as such judges as Chief Justice Earl Warren interpreted the Constitution to contain broad principles that could be applied to modern circumstances These judges did not feel constrained by the framers understanding of what they had forbidden or allowed Gripping the sides of the lectern with his large square hands Scalia has been recounting how his view of a static Constitution has been faring better among federal judges these days He refers with satisfaction to a recent landmark of his own Supreme Court that declared that the Second Amendment protects an individuals right to bear arms The ruling the previous June written by Scalia overturned decades of decisions by lower court judges who had held that the Second Amendment applied only to state militias such as state national guards It was the first time the Supreme Court found that any law violated the Second Amendment and it was a significant reversal of settled lower court law Especially striking was Scalias authorship of the opinion His nocompromise style had made him a hero on law school campuses but usually cost him votes among the justices On the incendiary subject of gun rights however he was able to gain and keep the majority helped by the youthful new chief justice John Roberts and the newest associate justice Samuel Alito The case requiring interpretation of the Second Amendments text and history was the perfect match for Scalias focus on the original intention of the men who drafted and ratified the Constitution Maybe the original meaning of the Constitution is back Scalia tells the Federalist Society Were not all back there yet but maybe were on the way A quarter century into his judicial odyssey Scalia may be at the apex of his influence Roberts and Alito who had both worked in the Reagan administration have long admired Scalia and the way he wages the good conservative fight On the Court since 2005 and 2006 respectively they have been voting with Scalia more than did William Rehnquist the previous chief justice and Sandra Day OConnor Alitos predecessor whose moderate consensusseeking approach constantly thwarted Scalia Liberals such as Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg regard Scalias ideas as perilous They fear that if they were ever fully accepted by the nations judges the emphasis on individual rights established in the last half century  for the poor the disenfranchised  would be lost Today in the chandeliered ballroom however Scalia is among the faithful with his own In 1982 when the Federalist Society was founded by students at Yale University and the University of Chicago to counter the liberalism of academia Scalia was present He was teaching at Chicago and became the faculty adviser to the founding students there He helped the group raise money and attract prominent speakers As the Federalist Society began to flourish gaining wealth and adding members Scalia was an Alist invitee for annual conferences Now the society boasts up to forty thousand members and a record of influence with three Republican presidents and their lifetenured appointments to federal courts Two years before this occasion at the Mayflower the Federalist Society celebrated Scalia at a blacktie dinner for his twenty years on the Supreme Court Over the last twenty years Justice Scalia has done for the Court what President Reagan did for the presidency and the country declared the Northwestern University law professor Steven Calabresi one of the founding students at Yale He has by the force and clarity of his opinions become a defining figure in American constitutional law of the last two decades Scalia had marched up to the stage joined by his wife Maureen and all nine of their children They smiled brightly all grownups yet jostling one another goodnaturedly like children who had just emerged from a long trip in the family van I really do much better at responding to criticism than at responding to praise the man of the hour had said If you accept it as though its really due youre being conceited If you reject it you are being supposedly insincere or at least ungrateful My favorite response has been one Lyndon Johnson used  I wish my parents could have been here My father would have been proud and my mother would have believed it  Scalia grew up an only child the son of Salvatore Eugene Scalia and the former Catherine Panaro Remarkably he was also the only offspring of his generation from the entire Scalia and Panaro families None of his mothers six siblings had a child Neither did his fathers only sibling a sister So Nino as he was called became the center of attention for two tightknit striving Italian immigrant families His father had come to America knowing little English had earned a PhD at Columbia University and had spent three decades teaching Romance languages at Brooklyn College The son did not let him down He was valedictorian at New Yorks Xavier High School first in his class at Georgetown University and a magna cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School A man of pride and ambition Scalia advanced quickly through jobs in the Nixon and Ford administrations before ending up at the University of Chicago and then on the federal appeals court in Washington DC Onstage that night in 2006 Scalia saluted the next generation of his family He motioned to his nine children  one a priest wearing his collar another an army officer in uniform  and his wife Maureen the Radcliffe coed whom he had met while at Harvard and married in 1960 The justice called her the product of the best decision I ever made the mother of the nine children you see the woman responsible for raising them with very little assistance from me  And theres not a dullard in the bunch That was his moment in 2006 Now in 2008 the jurist who is a combination of Felix Frankfurter and Luciano Pavarotti entering the third act of his judicial career is enjoying an encore The Federalist Society is celebrating him as it does nearly every year in some way this late Saturday afternoon theres less glitter than at the societys famously sumptuous dinners but no less gusto Scalias visage bigger than life is projected on a large screen to his right as he speaks at the Mayflower Hotel lectern The moderator Leonard Leo the executive vice president of the Federalist Society and an old Scalia friend has been reading questions for the justice that have been penciled on small white cards and handed up from the audience Someone asks whether the originalism approach has any theoretical flaws Scalia pauses at first seemingly struggling to find any shortcomings Then in response he says that it is difficult for todays judges to know how the Constitutions drafters would respond to contemporary phenomena such as the Internet He cautions that originalism is not perfect yet adds But whatever our problems are they pale next to the problems of the idea of the Living Constitution  Another questioner notes that Scalia has called himself a fainthearted originalist Oh that was so long ago the justice responds referring to a 1989 law review article he wrote Scalia explains that he had used fainthearted because he did not see how he or any other judge could vote to uphold say ear notching of criminals as was allowed in the eighteenth century If he were a true originalist Scalia says he would have to find ear notching today perfectly constitutional despite the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment Then he quips to the Federalist Society home crowd that maybe he could be a complete originalist these days Ive gotten older and crankier The audience laughs heartily A law student sends up a question asking what a Federalist Society member should do in the face of militant or intolerant law professors or peers Although the conservative legal group has developed legions of members across campuses in law firms and at government institutions liberalism still dominates in law schools Equally significant national politics has shifted dramatically away from conservatism Just three weeks before the conference on November 4 2008 Barack Obama was elected president of the United States This was a milestone foremost because Obama became the first African American president but also because his election was widely seen as the end of an era of conservatism In spite of that this Federalist Society occasion is not solemn or melancholy It is a celebration of the judicial victories that still can be claimed Supreme Court justices reside in their own realm At the taproot of the American legal system the conservative legacy of three Republican presidents is still dominant and Scalia is its central figure It could be years before President Obamas judicial appointees are able to change the tenor of the law Scalia also knows how to make headway against prevailing winds He boasts that one of my charms is that I tell people what they dont like to hear Comfortable with tension and relishing debate his rhetorical style is combative But he does not enter every fight He rebuffs criticism that his decisions are inconsistent or driven by a desire to achieve conservative goals I often come to decisions I dont like he insists He mentions that as a policy matter he has endorsed deregulation of markets but as a judge he has voted to uphold regulation when federal law required it Scalia often reminds audiences that he voted to strike down laws banning flag burning as political protest although personally I dont like scruffy bearded sandalwearing people who go around burning the United States flag In response to the question about how to fight a disapproving professor Scalia a Roman Catholic first jokes My mother used to say Offer it up  Then he tells the audience Most of the professors I know  would welcome someone from the other side  who can serve as a foil  because they think they can beat you Thats why they publish my dissents in their casebooks The harder question is What do I do when it comes to writing the exam Do I give him the answer he taught me to be the right answer  Scalia pauses for effect Yeah he said As his audience chortles Scalia adds that it is best to save real protest for another day Wily as a serpent he advises with a sly smile Now Scalia takes that final question the one he is waiting to knock out of the park Reading from a white card Leonard Leo asks Scalia how he reconciles his differing opinions in two wellknown disputes the 1995 United States v Lopez and 2005 Gonzales v Raich cases Scalia voted in 1995 to overturn a federal law that regulated guns near schools because it trampled on state authority Ten years later he voted to uphold a federal drug law that voided a California policy allowing marijuana use for medical purposes over dissenting justices protests that the federal policy infringed on the states The 2005 case had been brought by two seriously ill women who had cultivated marijuana under Californias Compassionate Use Act For the three years since legal analysts had been buzzing over whether Scalia abandoned his abhorrence of federal intervention simply because he opposed the legalization of marijuana At the Court in 2005 Justice OConnor had declared the two Scalia positions  forbidding the federal government to displace state choices about handgun regulation but letting it override state choices about drug laws  irreconcilable Justice Clarence Thomas Scalias usual soul mate on the law had been equally critical of the notion that Congress could interfere with a carefully restricted marijuana law providing relief to the seriously ill He had scoffed The federal government may now regulate quilting bees clothes drives and potluck suppers throughout the 50 states The question on the little white card goes to the heart of Scalias legacy Is his brand of originalism simply a way to achieve conservative results Does he talk a good game until his method fails to get him what he wants as a policy matter This afternoon Scalia is not going to engage such inquiry Oh no he says grimacing Get another question It has the ring of Get over it That is Scalias stock answer when someone in an audience wants him to address Bush v Gore the decision that stopped the presidential ballot recounts in Florida and gave George W Bush the White House over Vice President Al Gore in 2000 The decision remained a political thorn in the side of the nation through Bushs two terms and particularly for Scalias critics offered evidence of his willingness to abandon principle when it does not get him the outcome he desires At the Mayflower the audience laughs when he says get another question It is a friendly laugh To them there is nothing wrong with his ducking a hardball Leonard Leo sets aside the offending card and asks Scalia Whats your favorite opera Oh says Scalia there are so many works all so different He throws out some personal favorites Strausss comic opera Der Rosenkavalier Puccinis tragic Madama Butterfly Verdis popular La Traviata Then Scalia adds And I like country music too As people leap to their feet and

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113959834&ft=3&f=,During the 2008 campaign one of candidate Barack Obamas best applause lines was a promise to restore respect for science when it came to federal policy making  On Monday President Obama kept a piece of that promise when his Department of Justice issued a directive ordering agency lawyers not to prosecute individuals who use or prescribe medical marijuana in states that have legalized the drug for that purpose  It will not be a priority to use federal resources to prosecute patients with serious illnesses or their caregivers who are complying with state laws on medical marijuana but we will not tolerate drug traffickers who hide behind claims of compliance with state law to mask activities that are clearly illegal explained Attorney General Eric Holder This balanced policy formalizes a sensible approach that the Department has been following since January effectively focus our resources on serious drug traffickers while taking into account state and local laws  In the overall scheme of the drugpolicy debate this is a relatively small  and cautious  step  But for medicalmarijuana advocates the administrations formal embrace of a more responsible approach represents a major breakthrough  This is a huge victory for medicalmarijuana patients says Steph Sherer executive director of Americans for Safe Access a medicalmarijuana advocacy group This indicates that President Obama intends to keep his promise  and represents a significant departure from the policies of the Bush administration  The jury is in on medical marijuana and the evidence argues for removing barriers  federal state and local  to its use by patients seeking relief from pain and nausea associated with cancer AIDS and multiple sclerosis and other debilitating illnesses and conditions  The Obama administrations move respects that evidence As such it represents a clearer embrace of science with regard to drugs and drug policy by a White House than we have seen since the days when Jimmy Carter explored enlightened approaches  As New York Congressman Maurice Hinchey said Monday Today common sense won out over ideological stubbornness as our nations law enforcement agency formally adopted a new and wellbalanced policy on medical marijuana use Across the country individual states have enacted laws that allow individuals who are sick and suffering to use medical marijuana with a doctors prescription only to have DOJ officials arrest and prosecute them anyway This was a policy that was misguided and wrong from the start and Im very pleased that the Obama administrations Justice Department under the leadership of Attorney General Holder has put an end to it  Hinchey has for many years advocated for a shift in federal policies with regard to medical marijuana Among other things the New York Democrat has sought to amend Department of Justice appropriation bills in order to prevent the DOJ from using funds to prosecute individuals who use medical marijuana in compliance with state law  Earlier this year Hinchey secured House support for a requirement that the DOJ report to Congress about the administrations position on medical marijuana  That wont be necessary now as the DOJ order clarifies the issue  and sets a sounder policy regarding the lawful use of marijuana for medical purposes  Today says Hinchey those patients no longer have to worry that the medicine theyve been legally using in their states will result in them being thrown in jail Our Justice Department will now let these patients use medical marijuana in accordance with state law and federal prosecutors will instead focus their attention on more pressing legal matters that warrant their time and attention  The next step should be to codify the DOJ directive by passing Massachusetts Congressman Barney Franks Medical Marijuana Patient Protection Act HR 2835 which would formally reschedule cannabis as a Schedule II drug and eliminate federal authority to prosecute medical marijuana patients or providers in states where it is legal for medical use  Even before that happens however the DOJ directive opens the way for states to enact laws permitting the use of medical marijuana Legislative bills and referendums have already been proposed in a number of states Americans for Safe Access tracks the progress which should accelerate considerably now that Obamas Department of Justice has abandoned the backward and punitive policies of past administrations Copyright 2014 The Nation,"Tue, 20 Oct 2009 07:47:00 -0400",drugs

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111783991&ft=3&f=,Its been more than a dozen years since California became the first state in the nation to legalize marijuana for medical use In some California cities cannabis dispensaries are springing up like well weeds But in more conservative communities patients have a harder time finding legal marijuana That difficulty has led a group of senior citizens in Orange County to start setting up a pot collective in their luxury retirement community Identifying A New Need For decades Leisure Worlds resort lifestyle has attracted retirees to its swimming pools and golf greens tennis courts and dance halls Resident Margo Bouers passion is synchronized swimming  The waters magnificent Bouer said Im me in the water This is what keeps me alive Bouer 73 is one of the younger members of the Aquadettes a synchronized swimming group in Laguna Woods Calif A retired nurse she moved to Leisure World  also known as Laguna Woods Village  16 years ago For Bouer water is more than fun  it means relief from multiple sclerosis In the water she doesnt shake or lose her balance need a walker or worry about a new symptom that began last year Suddenly Id have a wave of nausea she said And from that wave Id vomit and Id vomit from the tip of my toes all the way up And I had no clue as to what was going on In April a physician neighbor encouraged Bouer to go to a meeting about medical marijuana She says it was a stretch for her  a former psychiatric nurse whose generation considered cannabis little more than a gateway to harder drugs But she went and then she experimented  That night Im sitting out on my balcony she recalled That wave of nausea came I lit that pipe and I just held it in my mouth afraid to even inhale But I held it in my mouth blew it out like that she said inhaling and exhaling I was so preoccupied Now whats happened she remembers thinking Well what happened is that nothing happened except that I wasnt nauseated Medical Background Dr Bill Schwied 88 is the neighbor who encouraged Bouer to find out about cannabis The only risk involved is the legal risk which is very frightening to many doctors and patients Schwied said There have not been enough studies conducted to evaluate the full medical risks of marijuana especially on the elderly There is risk of developing dependence on the drug Both the American Medical Association and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society say there is a need for more research in the field Meanwhile 13 states now approve the medical use of marijuana But the federal government still classifies the plant as an illegal Schedule I controlled substance with no accepted medical use  a category it shares with cocaine and heroin  But Schwied sees that marijuana has obvious benefits  I dont think it cures everything but its one approach in medicine that the medical profession has kind of ignored he says The retired doctor and nurse have become vocal advocates for elderly use of medical marijuana Since the spring theyve appeared publicly at community meetings Spreading The Word Speaking at a recent forum Margo described her own experience For the first time the nausea dissipated she said I sat there and waited for it and I felt relaxed and I thought Well itll probably return during the night But guess what I slept like a log More than 200 seniors turned out for the panel discussion on medical marijuana at the retirement community this past June No one spoke against it  These days getting a doctors recommendation for medial marijuana is easy Its getting the cannabis that can be a problem for the seniors Laguna Woods passed an ordinance allowing dispensaries a year ago but so far retail property owners have refused to lease to any marijuana businesses  So the retirees are forming their own nonprofit medical marijuana collective A small group of them has been meeting to study their options under the law  At a recent session one man suggested that the group distribute not merely doses of medical marijuana but the plants themselves We could give them these little plants that they could put on their balcony that wont take much room at all he said and they would be able to have medicine available in like 60 days The Question How Legal Is Legal While some dispensaries charge 20 a gram or 600 an ounce the seniors say they want their collective to charge only enough to cover their costs The Orange County District Attorneys office wouldnt comment on the legality of marijuana collectives  The Laguna Woods collective is getting legal advice But even if they follow the letter of Californias law  which permits doctorrecommended use of cannabis and allows patients to legally buy it or grow their own  the retirees are still taking a risk according to Don Duncan California director for Americans for Safe Access  The federal government typically doesnt target medical cannabis patients Duncan said But if one or more of these patients want to join together into a collective or cooperative there is a substantial legal risk in providing that service to the community Duncan said that although he sees the risk as being lower under the Obama administration until the federal law changes theres always a chance that somebody could be arrested or indicted That possibility doesnt deter Margo Bouer Ill be a test case she said What are they going to do throw me in jail A 73yearold person with MS If that happens Bouer is likely to have a lot of elderly supporters Her group recently held a community meeting to announce

congress debated legalizing cannabis as a way to undermine cartel income And when President Obama held his online town hall last month he was swamped with the question Why not legalize pot as a way to help the economy NPR came up with a hypothetical scenario and asked experts to play along commenting on their imagined outcomes The scenario Marijuana has been legal for two years throughout the US It is treated in the eyes of the law similar to alcohol It is taxed and regulated and users must be 21 or older Pot smokers can buy it by the gram at licensed dispensaries Predictably the law change would make some people very happy  and others deeply concerned    Imagine if you turned on the radio and heard this From NPR News in Washington Im Carl Kasell After 70 years of prohibition marijuana becomes legal today for personal consumption throughout the United States for persons 21 and older  How would the world change if cannabis finally came out of the closet if it were fully legal to possess sell and cultivate Willie Nelson the 76yearold iconic balladeer and cannabis connoisseur says there are pros and cons  We dont worry about going to jail anymore for smoking it he says But a lot of our old friends who dealt it are out of work In Austin Texas the legal cannabis created a surge in business at head shops such as Oat Willies  Theres the most popular one the Volcano says Doug Brown the stores longtime general manager pointing to a conical device that is supposed to provide a milder smoking experience Its very expensive  575  and theyre hard to get hold of  In the two years since legalization Brown has noticed new customers many of whom are older  More affluent people more fun people  people that have never done it before but have decided to try it since its now legalized he says   One of the new marijuana epicures is Sarah Bird a middleaged novelist in Austin and columnist for Texas Monthly Magazine She says she hadnt smoked marijuana much since her college days  Its been a godsend for the temperamentally tense such as myself Bird says And its really been a boon to getting me off my addiction to Ambien and Yellowtail Merlot  Whats not to like Bird asks Its lowcalorie she doesnt wake up hung over its great for the libido and its popular at dinner parties baked into Belgian chocolate brownies  But most of all she adds You know youre not contributing to the Sinaloa Cartel and youre not destabilizing Mexico And in my case as a parent Im not modeling criminal behavior for my child  Recreational And Medicinal Uses At the University of Texas at Austin Kevin Prince coordinator of UTs alcohol and drug program says hes seen a spike in pot smoking since it became legal This is troubling to him because national studies show that sustained marijuana use directly affects academic achievement One of the main issues is theres still a mystique when it comes to marijuana use Prince says A lot of people still dont know that marijuana use is addictive If youre spending more time smoking weed than going to class or going to work thats a problem  Not everyone uses it recreationally The end of cannabis prohibition has been a blessing for Marsha a medical marijuana user with multiple sclerosis Sitting in a wheelchair in a friends backyard in Houston Marsha says she smokes weed to escape from my body and the chronic pain caused by nerve damage  Oh what a relief it is not to be home alone wondering if this minorleague marijuana user if the cops were gonna come bust me down she says Its nice to feel free  The Cartels Stay Strong Free at last to smoke marijuana Since the prohibition on cannabis ended has it delivered the results its supporters claimed it would  With the spiraling drug mayhem in Mexico some Latin American leaders looked at legalizing marijuana as a way to deny the murderous cartels a portion of their profits When it was banned marijuana was the greatest source of income for Mexican traffickers Now that its cultivated domestically and sold legally surely that has crippled the cartels These are crooks Youre not gonna take em out of the criminal activity business says Robert Almonte who worked narcotics for 25 years with the El Paso Police Department just across the river from the ruthless Juarez Cartel Because drugs are legalized theyre not gonna say Lets go back to school and get an honest job   Almonte director of the Texas Narcotic Officers Association says all cannabis legalization has done is force the drug mafias to improvise  As far as marijuana is concerned they have been selling it less expensive than what it can sell for here in the United States Almonte says But more importantly were seeing a more potent marijuana And with that were seeing  an increase in the emergency room admissions  A similar observation comes from William Martin a drug policy expert and senior fellow at the James A Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston  Just as after the repeal of prohibition organized crime got into many other kinds of activities  protection money control of the laundry business  so the drug cartels are quite flexible Martin says Theyve diversified into kidnapping human trafficking protection other crime And theyre still selling cocaine heroin and meth which are highly profitable So unfortunately it has not hurt them as much as wed hoped  Fewer Criminal Cases Records Supporters of legalization say one of the undeniable benefits has been the reduction in criminal cases that have clogged courts  I used to represent a lot of marijuana smokers and dope dealers says Gerry Goldstein a prominent criminal defense lawyer in San Antonio  Though he is not billing as many hourly fees these days he believes thats a good thing for the criminal justice system  Back in  2006 to 2008 45 percent of all drug arrests in this country for the most part were marijuana offenses Goldstein says Thats a staggering waste of resources of our law enforcement   And it left young people scarred with criminal records for something that is arguably less dangerous than alcohol Bill Martin says If they were convicted they could lose employment child custody student aid voting privileges some welfare benefits They could even forfeit assets like cars or houses The new regime has eliminated that Problem users are now being treated as a public health matter and not as a criminal issue and thats appropriate he says  It Wouldnt Fill Government Coffers  Since marijuana became legal farmers around the country  illicit and formerly illicit  have scrambled to put Cannabis sativa seeds into the ground Under the law they pay 1000 for a state license whether their crop is hydroponic or soilgrown The marijuana crops been going really good  Just wait till the last frost just start puttin the plants in the ground and add a little nitrogen fertilizer to give you a lotta leaf and after that it just grows like a weed which is what it is says Larry Butler He stands among the crop rows at his Boggy Creek Farm a 5acre certified organic urban farm in Austin Texas His wife Carol Ann Sayle says theyve been a bit disappointed by their newest cash crop and are nervous about losing the farms family ambiance The retailer takes a big hit off the bong so to speak and then the government comes in with their taxes Sayle says So whats left for the farmer After all that work and  trying to ease peoples fears that were gonna be giving it to children So whats left for the farmer Stems and seeds is about all thats left      Jeffrey Miron a Harvard economist who has modeled and written on the economics of the marijuana market figures state and federal taxes on cannabis sales add up to 67 billion annually  And he calculates the savings from not having to enforce state and federal marijuana laws  in arrests prosecution and incarceration  at 129 billion a year Excluding additional expenses such as the public health cost of marijuana or the cost of administering the new law Miron figures that legal pot creates almost a 20 billion bonus Miron adds however that the people who thought the taxation of marijuana would create a windfall for government coffers will be disappointed Compared to the size of most federal government agencies compared to the tax revenue from things like alcohol and tobacco and certainly compared to the size of deficits that we have this is just not a major issue it is not a panacea it is not curing any of our significant ills he says There may be good reasons to do it but the budgetary part is not a crucial reason to do it  There Are More People Smoking It Now that marijuana is legal to possess use process transfer transport retail wholesale and cultivate has the United States become a nation of potheads The Dutch experiment offers an interesting case study After marijuana was decriminalized there in 1976 pot smoking didnt jump in Holland and it remained well below US levels But it rose sharply after coffee shops opened in the 1980s and began openly selling cannabis The US already has a huge appetite for drugs Its the largest illegal narcotics market in the world Half of all highschool seniors have used pot  Drug policy analysts interviewed for this report believe that now that marijuana is legal and socially acceptable in the US there are more people smoking it And some of them are kids Theyll start using it sooner now because it looks like its more OK seems less harmful because they see their parents doing it says Rosalie Pacula codirector of the Drug Policy Research Center at the RAND Corp Do we know how to keep kids from drinking alcohol No we dont So why would we expect wed be any better at it with marijuana   And the reason we should care is because of the effect that marijuana can have on the development of adolescent brains says Dr Vicki Nejtek a research doctor who works on drug abuse at the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth  We know that marijuana use and chronic use as it is now in an adolescent population can cause extreme developmental delay Nejtek says We know the myelin sheath around our brain cells acts like an insulator to an electric cord When thats stripped away it can cause memory loss it reduces our ability to concentrate and a reduction in brain cell activity In 2007 144 million Americans ages 12 and older admitted to surveytakers that they had used pot in the past month Rice Universitys Bill Martin believes now that its legal about onethird more people are using marijuana  maybe 19 million Americans Martin believes legal pot  which is after all an intoxicant  has been good for society but bad for young people I have nine grandchildren he says I would prefer that none of them use marijuana to any significant extent I have seen students Ive seen friends become less interesting  NPRs fictitious scenario of legalized marijuana is not likely to come true anytime soon Most states are still fighting to legalize medical marijuana and decriminalize marijuana penalties much less seriously considering legalization President Obama is on record opposing legalizing pot as a way to

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102128241&ft=3&f=,For years the lawyers who represent poor people have complained that their offices are overworked and underfunded Now some states are starting to believe that the solution is not to throw more money at the system  Instead theyre talking about putting fewer people in jail  Theres this long New Hampshire tradition of tough on crime but theres a huge New Hampshire tradition of being pretty darn stingy says Chris Keating executive director of New Hampshires public defender program  But being tough on crime can be expensive and Keating says in New Hampshire the tradition of stinginess is starting to win out  The insider term is decriminalization New Hampshires state Legislature is considering measures that would take away the threat of jail time for some offenses and in the US the government only has to pay for a defense lawyer when poor defendants face incarceration So taking away the threat of jail saves money and Keating believes New Hampshire is trying to distinguish between people society is mad at and people society is afraid of I think they want to reserve the resources and the court time and their attention for the people were afraid of he says  And the people were just sort of temporarily mad at  I dont think the court system wants these people to get appointed counsel and show up for two or three preliminary hearings and then a trial and then a sentencing hearing I think they want to move these people and cases through the system because they realize theyve got finite resources and these cases are just bogging them down The movement has support from some unexpected places  William Wren the commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Corrections says tough budget prospects are forcing him to look at closing a whole prison and laying off 97 positions  For that reason Wren wants fewer people sent to prison and he is asking lawmakers to examine which crimes really deserve time behind bars  Ill give you a good example  our theft statutes the threshold dollar amount for going from a misdemeanor to a felony crime is 500 That was set 31 years ago What 500 was 31 years ago is a lot different from what it would equate to today he says   These kinds of conversations are happening across the country  In Washington and in many other states suspendeddriverlicense crimes constitute as much as one third of the total misdemeanor caseload says Bob Boruchowitz a visiting law professor at Seattle University  More than 100000 people are prosecuted every year for driving with a suspended license in Washington and a broad justice coalition in Seattle has recommended changing the law Now its before the Washington Legislature  If you were able to remove from the system the suspended driver license cases for instance you would reduce dramatically the burden on everybody from police to prosecutors to courts to defenders to jails Boruchowitz says adding that people were never motivated to address these problems before and the bad economy has provided the opportunity  But there are dissenters  If you start to save money at the expense of public safety you might as well close down your government says David Capeless president of the Massachusetts District Attorneys Association  Last fall voters in his state passed a law decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana  Now Massachusetts is considering further decriminalization measures  They can wash with too broad a stroke Capeless says  Even what might be a seemingly minor crime in the context of a particular case is not so minor depending on the prior record specific circumstances whether its the underpinning for other charges  so thats something that needs to be dealt with on a casebycase basis But the chief public defender for Massachusetts Bill Leahy says cuts have to come from somewhere  Weve got a 3 12 billiondollar deficiency in Massachusetts this year all kinds of worthy programs are being cut and were continuing to waste money on prosecuting crimes that are criminal only by statute Leahy says   And for people who have spent their lives advocating for public defenders this is a new chapter  I think its a major shift says David Carroll the director of research for the National Legal Aid and Defender Association  Weve had a hangover on the toughoncrime movement and realize that to keep going down that path were only escalating costs at ever greater rates and so we need to stop and think of new ways to produce efficiencies at the same time as guaranteeing public safety Liberals are often pigeonholed as being soft on crime with conservatives portrayed as tough on crime so it might also come as a surprise to hear that one of the strongest voices for decriminalization at the federal level comes from someone who works at a conservative think tank  Criminal punishment is the greatest power that government regularly uses against its own citizens So from a conservative standpoint any great power needs to have very clear limitations on it says Brian Walsh a senior legal research fellow at the Heritage Foundation  Walsh recently wrote a paper called Enacting Principled Nonpartisan Criminal Law Reform The idea that more criminal law is always better harsher sentences are always better  thats not a conservative principle he says Walsh wants a bipartisan group to reevaluate the federal criminal code and look at what doesnt need to be there and he already has supporters from both parties on

Rosario says his job often comes down to a footrace  Many of the migrants scatter when the Border Patrol descends on them Tonight fortunately that hasnt been the case he says  There was one group  Actually this group  ran from us initially up further north  But the scope trucks were able to stay on them and we were able to pick them up further south here   The men Rosario just caught had been in the desert for three days  The first thing they asked for as they were being loaded into the back of the Border Patrol truck was water Testing The Agents We have about 22 cameras that we use and they are all equipped also to see in the dark says Esmeralda Marroquin a supervisor with the Border Patrol at Nogales Station  She is standing in what looks like a war room as two radio dispatchers sit in front of a bank of video monitors  The cameras are trained on various parts of the Nogales border   Some of the screens show the rusty old fence that cuts a swath between residential neighborhoods in Nogales Ariz and Nogales Sonora in Mexico  Other screens show the new fence on the outskirts of town and vehicle barriers in the desert Across the border hundreds maybe even thousands of people get ready to test the Tucson sector agents  Carlos Gonzales is one of them  He was recently deported and is preparing to head right back in Me and my friend  we are going to come back tonight Gonzales says  We going to start walking around 1100 when immigration moves That time immigration moves  We get the chance to walk we going to walk about two nights in the desert Gonzales 28 has lived half his life in the United States  He says he expects to die in New York City  But if hes not careful he could die here in the desert  Last year at least 183 migrants lost their lives trying to cross this part of the Arizona border Gonzales says he is not worried about all the Border Patrols fancy new technology  If he gets caught he says hell just try again The terrain between Nogales Sonora and Nogales Ariz is such that rainwater flows north  One problem for the Border Patrol is that a massive flood control system runs from the Mexican side into the US Marroquin is standing in a tunnel thats big enough to drive a truck through Unfortunately people do cross and a lot of people dont understand the dangers of these tunnels and how quickly they can flood and how quickly they can lose their life she says  Once it starts raining its a matter of minutes to get someone out of there before it flash floods and then rescue efforts begin further north The Border Patrol has installed cameras in the tunnel and nozzles that can fill the cavern with pepper spray if anyone tries to sneak through   You Name It Weve Seen It In addition to the drainage tunnels the Border Patrol also discovered last year alone 14 homemade tunnels crossing under the boundary  The tunnels are used for both migrants and drugs   Agents also seized more than 400 tons of marijuana last year as well as huge shipments of cocaine methamphetamines and heroin that smugglers were trying to get into the US Weve seen it inside baby diapers  Weve seen it inside prosthetic limbs  You name it weve seen it says Brian Levin with US Customs and Border Protection from the Nogales port of entry Levin says some 45000 people enter the US through this port every day and his officers process 18 billion worth of cargo each year We are the busiest port of entry for winter produce coming in from Mexico heading to North America he says Under the reorganized Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection is in charge of securing the legal ports of entry  the customs and immigration checkpoints to enter the US   Border Patrol administers the parts of the border that arent at official crossings and Levin says at the port of entry agents have to search for illegal migrants narcotics and other contraband while still allowing legitimate traffic to flow We have to be able to balance our enforcement mission with our facilitation mission Levin says  We cannot sacrifice the safety and security of the United States for facilitation but we are not going to ignore that  And it comes down to balancing the two Levin says new technology is helping to speed traffic and secure the border  Scanners can read chips in passports and IDs even before the drivers gets to the customs booth radiation detectors can screen for a dirty bomb and computers link his agents to criminal databases in Washington DC   Crossing The Open Desert Yet despite all this technology at the port smugglers still regularly cross the border in the open desert About three miles outside of Nogales Marroquin has just found a spot where vehicles have been driving over a small ridge to get around a new Border Patrol fence This is a drive through Marroquin says  Theyve actually brought a car up and over and are getting around the fencing here As soon as areas like this are discovered theyre immediately addressed and more fencing is put up to control it Marroquin describes her work as a Border Patrol agent as an art that mixes tracking with technology and intuition  Agents regularly pursue groups of migrants just following footprints in the sand   The awkward hand gesture of a driver she says can tip you off that the trunk is full of drugs or illegal immigrants The additional personnel the new fences and the added technology are all making the Arizona border a lot harder to cross but ultimately she says its the agents  who are out there every day chasing people through the thorns and the rugged grasslands  who have changed this frontier Copyright 2014 NPR,"Thu, 04 Dec 2008 14:19:00 -0500",drugs

address last night She writes in part It is Michelles blackness that has deeply disturbed many Americans and much of the press and it is that same blackness that has endeared her to many but not all black Americans Read and respondBy the time Michelle Obama  the woman who many hope will be Americas next First Lady  took center stage the Pepsi Stadium was electric with anticipation Wed just watched a wellproduced video South Side Girl documenting her American storyIt was followed by her brothers loving introduction Watching her resplendent in teal perfectly made up and coifed I wondered What will it take for Americans to love this woman Surrounded by tall placards with her name in bold white print I thought What will the pundits make of her performance I had no doubt she would be elegant beautiful intelligent and graceful She always is I wasnt concerned that she might slip up and speak a basic truth about our deeply flawed nation She has learned her lesson and there are now handlers to assure that she makes no such slipsIt is Michelles blackness that has deeply disturbed many Americans and much of the press and it is that same blackness that has endeared her to many but not all black Americans For those of us who share her race gender and generation the negative reaction she has inspired is stunning As with Michelle we are the daughters of hard working even struggling parentsWe are the daughters who were constantly told that we mustnt ever fit the stereotypes they have of us We were raised to take advantage of the opportunities created for us by the Civil Rights Movement and though rarely acknowledged by the Feminist Movement as well We grew up in black communities that were proud of usAnd when we went off to predominantly white elite colleges and universities it was with the reminder that we must do better than well and that we dare not forget those we left behind Why are black women like Michelle Obama black women who have been educated alongside and worked with white Americans as equals so unfamiliar to so many AmericansUnlike Oprah a billionaire media mogul who serves as a spiritual mother to millions of American women Michelle is mother only to her own precious daughters An accomplished professional a devoted mother sister wife daughter and friend Michelle Obama is like countless other American women and yet many white Americans have found it impossible to see themselves or their aspirations in herMaybe it is because they cannot imagine her as First Lady Lady is not a designation easily bestowed upon black women In fact it is an identity that we have had to fiercely fight for In an effort to leave behind a legacy of forced labor and forced sex formerly enslaved women valued ladylike behavior and instilled it in their daughters as if that alone would save the raceHowever in both legal and popular discourses the privileges of ladyhood were reserved for white females Many white Americans are comfortable with fictions of welfare and quota queens Unfortunately a younger generation encouraged by irresponsible artists and greedy corporate conglomerates have also grown comfortable with video hoes But are Americans ready to bestow that designation  Lady First Lady  on a black woman And at what priceLast night Michelle Obama was all that one would have expected of her She was articulate and empathetic She was patriotic and visionary She stressed the importance of education without emphasizing her own educational pedigree She was elegantly dressed replete with portrait collar and flattering 34length sleeves Her hair was appropriately straight She acknowledged her debt to past struggles for social justice both those for racial equality and gender equality She was magnanimous towards Hilary Clinton She was not threatening or loud She did not raise an eyebrow She painted a vision of a glowing future led by her husband And she gave Americans a picture of themselves as a people striving together toward a better tomorrow She gave no specific policy points Americans tend not to like that in their first ladies nor did she acknowledge any ongoing racial tensions She was soft and feminineBy the end of her speech when she was joined on stage by her daughters and the stadium erupted in thunderous applause my heart was full but my mind was still aflutter with questionsDid she successfully do what the campaign wanted her to do Will working class white Americans feel any closer to her and by extension to her husband Will middleclass white professional women and stayat home moms see themselves in her Will self conscious and a few selfhating black Americans think she represented the race wellI can almost say with certainty that elderly black women the church and neighborhood mothers were indeed proud And the rest of us who have loved her from day one can only pray for her protection her safety and her sanity on this mad journey Copyright 2014 NPR,"Tue, 26 Aug 2008

your average blunt far surpassing a Frappucino  and no federal tax on weed income  one could see how the seed of a getrichquick scheme could plant itself in a passerbys head   Oaksterdam University the United States only marijuana trade school is the place where these pipe dreams are cultivated  and imploded   Univeristy President Richard Lee often begins classes by warning People who think they can make a quick buck and get out of paying taxes they go to jail   At Oaksterdam students learn how to cultivate sell and use medical marijuana the safe way Because these activities are legal under California state law but illegal under federal law the safe way essentially means learning to swim through a big gray swamp   Not Your Average Stoner  Located in downtown Oakland Calif in the heart of the medical marijuana district Oaksterdams main campus is really just a massive classroom with a small grow lab attached The university also runs Blue Sky Coffee Shop one of four marijuana dispensaries in the city another coffee shop where one can legally smoke but not buy weed a gift shop and a sort of marijuana DMV where one can get an official medical marijuana ID card Theres also a smaller satellite campus in Los Angeles   Since the university was founded a little over a year ago the weekend workshops 250 as well as the semester class 400 have all sold out according to Ilia Gvozdenovic Oaksterdams chancellor Lately to meet demand the school has been adding more advanced cannabis business and dispensarymanagement classes he says  At the end students take a test and get a certificate   It shows that one is more interested in and serious about medical marijuana than your average stoner Gvozdenovic says That can be helpful for getting jobs in the industry  Indeed on a recent Saturday the freshman class doesnt fit the halfbaked slacker image painted by some initial reports about the school The 60 or so students range in age from 20s to 70s Theres a handful of

the focus  You have to know this stuff says 21yearold Andrew Macdonald of Sacramento between sips of green juice I simply wanted to educate myself  In March his friend and medical marijuana doctor Marion Mollie Fry was sentenced to five years in federal prison for conspiring to grow and distribute marijuana The case was unusual because with just 100 plants Frys operation was relatively small compared to others that the feds have targeted   They set her up Macdonald insists Indeed local law enforcement officials had told Fry it was OK to grow a small garden a fact that was inadmissible in federal court along with other references to the statedefined concept of medical marijuana   Think Like A Laywer Act Like A Drug Dealer  Throughout the day a variety of marijuana experts take the stage breaking down the history legal hurdles and growing techniques while offering both inspiring and cautionary tales    Ultimately the lesson seems to be that to successfully navigate the medical marijuana world one must think like a lawyer while taking the precautions of a drug dealer  You control the facts that could end up in court criminal defense lawyer Omar Figueroa tells the class    Facts that wouldnt be problematic for a doctor who prescribes a federally recognized medication such as Prozac for example could be problematic for medical marijuana Call the cops in Berkeley or Humboldt to report stolen medical marijuana and they may help you get it back explains Figueroa Call the cops in a more conservative county and a police officer may take out a search warrant on your home   Though state law generally protects medical marijuana in the home and in the dispensary it doesnt really account for transportation Some cultivators choose to transport marijuana via bus or bicycle for this reason Oaksterdam recently started a bike cab service around Oakland  Figueroa offers some basic guidelines  Dont hire a felon to work in your dispensary because the feds may pressure him or her to become a snitch  Though an armed guard may be a tempting way to ward off robberies a firearm turns marijuana sales into a more serious crime under federal law    Keep marijuana far out of reach of children  Valerie of San Cruz who did not want to give her last name because her family is still dealing with legal issues backs Figueroa up on this one during the break When she got pregnant she let her recommendation expire Her son was arrested for an unrelated reason The cops found a photo of a marijuana plant on his phone got a search warrant for her home found her medical marijuana stash charged her with contributing to the delinquency of a minor and threatened to take away all of her kids    I didnt even get to smoke it she says  Thanks to a good lawyer the charge was eventually dropped Undeterred shes got a fresh recommendation and plans to grow her own medical marijuana plants Riches Or Legalization After lunch its time for the legendary Dennis Peron Introduced as the father of the medical marijuana movement Peron once ran for California governor on a mandatory marijuana platform   as a Republican  and coauthored Prop 215 known as the Compassionate Use Act of 1996  Before the term medical marijuana even existed in the 1990s Peron was running a huge medical marijuana club for AIDS and cancer patients Hes been to jail on marijuana charges dozens of times Each time left him more passionate about his work he says In one year year I had 51 million running through my hands I never touched it he says  Like many in the medical marijuana community his dream has little to do with money Marijuana will be legal in my lifetime  I feel hopeful that Obama will reschedule marijuana he says referring to the fact that marijuana is currently a Schedule I drug under federal law the most tightly restricted category  Indeed Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has said that he favors decriminalizing though not legalizing marijuana The details of his plan are hazy but Peron insists that reclassifying medical marijuana to a lower schedule along the lines of Codeine and Tylenol is going to happen in the next year His fellow professors are far less convinced Ironically most growers dont want to see marijuana rescheduled Peron confesses after class Prices would plummet meaning that as the dream of truly legal weed would become reality the promise

diagnosis for anxiety It seemed too good to be true and given the way he abruptly disappeared one day I think it actually wasI have to confess that these encounters left me a bit cynical about how the states medical marijuana system functions In my circle of nonCalifornian friends the popular perspective on these statutes tends to be aligned with Federal law enforcements the prescription is a get out of jail free for drug use Dont get me wrong I personally cant think of a bigger waste of limited government resources than the relentless pursuit of stoners I also know that for every quasilegal

chronically and terminally ill medical marijuana usersAlso Larry Davids fictional misadventures aside its relatively easy to get marijuana in most major metropolitan areas A healthy ablebodied person eager to toke is to my mind at least more likely to just go find their local dealer than expose themselves to the privacy risks and insurance complications that can be caused by having a medical marijuana prescription in their increasingly centralized and digitized medical recordsThese insurance concerns are real Im not shy about writing that Ive been in therapy my dad had just died and its requirement of working in the media especially in Manhattan and one of the first conversations I ever had with a shrink was a convo about privacy my therapist advising me to be aware of what he termed the longterm consequences of having even the mildest mental health diagnosisadjustment disorderin my files His suggestion was that I pay out of pocket to protect my anonymity he would charge me on a sliding scale but seeing how I was fully insured at the time cheap and had no ambitions to run for president this was preObama it just didnt seem possible I figured Id let my insurance cover it Years later when I became selfemployed and started paying for my own health coverage that one year of therapy combined with sinusitis and high cholesterol to make me uninsurable When I got the letter from a company informing me that I was being rejected due to high risk preexisting conditions I thought I had mislaid a cancer diagnosis during my move west I was fortunately able to get coverage at a premium under Californias Managed Risk Medical Insurance Program but I can only imagine what how much worse my profile would have looked with pot prescription thrown into the mix no matter how legitimateThose suffering from serious and chronic illnesses face the same insurance and employment concerns Just earlier this year the State Supreme Court found that companies can legally fire employees who use marijuana legally under the state programEmployers can fire workers found to have used medical marijuana even if it was legally prescribed the California Supreme Court ruled ThursdayThe high court upheld a small Sacramento telecommunications companys firing of a man who flunked a companyordered drug test Gary Ross held a medical marijuana card authorizing him to use the drug to treat a back injury sustained while serving in the Air ForceThe company Ragingwire Inc argued that it rightfully fired Ross because all marijuana use is illegal under federal law which does not recognize the medical marijuana laws in California and 11 other statesThe justices upheld that argument in a 52 decisionNo state law could completely legalize marijuana for medical purposes because the drug remains illegal under federal law Justice Kathryn Werdegar wrote for the majority full storyObviously the terminally ill have more important things to worry about than their files but one imagines that chronically ill as opposed to terminal patients who might get relief from marijuana staying out of the system due to a healthy dose of nonpotinduced privacy paranoiaBut what say you

its shaking down innocent motorists  You dont want to take the money from any John Doe Escamilla says If you cant prove that its been a criminal activity reasonably suspicious probable cause you dont want to take it cause itll look bad in court  And thats what happened in the case of Javier Gonzalez  it looked bad in court Did I Just Get Robbed On Oct 20 2005 Gonzalez says he was driving south on US Highway 281 from Austin to Brownsville to look at a car and buy a gravestone for his dying aunt Gonzalez who owns a car lot was carrying 10032 in a briefcase  As I was driving south I noticed a dark bluish unmarked car that was taking radar He basically got behind me followed me for a while he says About 90 miles north of the Mexican border two sheriffs deputies of the Jim Wells County Task Force pulled him over for driving without a front license plate He asked me to get out of the car I did Gonzalez says He asked me for my drivers license and insurance I gave it to him He asked me if I had weapons drugs or large amounts of money I told him I did  The police video shows Gonzalez with a shaved head wearing baggy shorts standing beside a Mazda The incident report states the deputies grew suspicious when Gonzalez and his passenger both appeared nervous and a drugsniffing dog signaled the presence of drugs The deputies took them in for questioning and searched the car They found no drugs or weapons Though Gonzalez said he was a businessman and showed them a credit card printed with the name of his car lot the officers didnt believe him  He suspected we were using the money to go south and buy drugs he says The deputies handed Gonzalez a waiver If he signed over the money and did not claim the currency he could walk away free If he did not sign the waiver he would be arrested for moneylaundering Gonzalez signed the waiver and gave up rights to his money  So at that time we got in our car and we left still trying to figure out what just happened We got officers that took our cash We got officers that told us we cant get an attorney So Im thinking are these guys officers of law Did I just get robbed of my money  Gonzalez hired an attorney who filed a federal civil rights lawsuit The county fought it and lost In April the county returned his 10032 and paid him 110000 in damages plus attorneys fees A Preponderance of Evidence Ron Barroso a longtime criminal defense attorney in nearby Corpus Christi who was not associated with the case says I believe a lot of these stops are fishing expeditions nothing more They figure they stop enough people out there that they can profile for whatever reason sooner or later they are going to hit on something  Civil forfeiture is different from criminal forfeiture In criminal forfeiture the taking of property is usually carried out after the owner is convicted of a crime In civil forfeiture the government seizes the property  in this case the currency  without ever charging the person with a crime The government must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the money is dirty then its up to the owner to prove that his cash is clean  San Antonio attorney Michael McCrum a former federal prosecutor and police officer says he believes the system is tilted against the property owner The laws are made now such that anybody that has cash seized from em the burden of proof shifts over to the person whose money is seized to prove that its legitimate money And frankly a lot of people dont want to declare they have a lot of cash for other reasons not related to drug trafficking McCrum says  Which leads us to the second case  Christopher Hunt a 28yearold African American who owns an autodetailing business in Atlanta  It Looked Like Drug Money Here the facts are more complicated than the Gonzalez case On Sept 2 2007 Hunt says he was driving south on I75 through central Georgia on the way to see his mother in his hometown of Dublin Hunt was wearing his hair in braids and driving a friends orange Dodge Charger when two Lamar County sheriffs deputies pulled him over for speeding  The police video shows the deputies and Hunt standing beside the interstate arguing The incident report states they became suspicious when they saw that Hunt had a licensed handgun lying on the console and that he had bloodshot eyes his hands trembled and he and his passenger gave evasive answers when questioned But what really got their attention was the 5581 Hunt had stuffed in his pockets which he said was the weekend profits from his cardetailing business  In the police video one deputy says Look man heres the deal Were gon take this money into our possession OK Hunt responds angrily Oh no Im not giving you authority for you to take that money into your possession The deputy emphatically Im taking the money and he informs Hunt theyll take it back to the department to count it again They just told me it looked like drug money that was all Hunt says The deputies found no drugs or alcohol in the car Hunt was not arrested for any offense nor was he written up for a traffic violation The US attorneys office in Macon Ga has now initiated proceedings to keep Hunts money based on probable cause that it is proceeds traceable to a controlled substance Among their strongest evidence                                  The deputy smelled burned marijuana                                   The deputy observed an untestable amount of what appeared to be marijuana on the floorboard                                    Drug dogs detected drug residue on the currency when it was brought back to the station    Hunt has not been charged with any crime as a result of the traffic stop So the question arises Why is the government trying to take his 5581 The federal prosecutor refused to comment because the case is pending He has offered to return half of Hunts money But Hunts attorney David Crawford says they want all of it back and that theyre considering a civil rights lawsuit  Its an abuse of power and were not gonna let them hide behind their police powers and the legal system Were gonna keep pursuing this until we get justice says Crawford Hunt concludes It was my hardearned cash They had guns and badges and they just took it If I would have been a drug dealer I would have just left them and let them have the money  NPR showed this case to attorney David Smith of Alexandria Va a former deputy of the asset forfeiture section in the Justice Department and an author of two volumes on forfeiture law I can tell you I never see a complaint like this filed in the Eastern District of Virginia In fact even if they had loads of evidence theyd probably hesitate to file a complaint against 5000 just because its a waste of time But to file it when theres so little evidence as in this case is really striking Smith says  NPR examined 14 other federal currency forfeiture cases from Lamar County Ga over the past four years In some of the cases the drivers had prior felony convictions for narcotics But there are other cases similar to Hunts in which the government confiscates the money because the car smelled like marijuana the deputy said they acted nervous they were carrying a wad of cash and a drug dog alerted on it  Something is rotten down there I can tell you that Smith concludes Government Says Safeguards in Place  Forfeiture abuse is nothing new In the 1990s the media reported stories of police running roughshod over the rights of innocent property owners It led to the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 or CAFRA which was supposed to raise the governments burden of proof before it could seize a persons property The government maintains those reforms worked that safeguards are in place and individuals can challenge a seizure  just as Gonzalez and Hunt did I think a lot of people thought after passage of federal reform law that most if not all problems with civil forfeiture were solved And I simply dont think thats the case says Scott Bullock senior attorney at the Institute for Justice a public interest libertarian law firm in Washington  Smith who helped write the CAFRA reforms a decade ago adds Theres still a lot of abuse There are large parts of the country where prosecutors can get away with bringing bad cases because judges tolerate them  The reason you dont hear about more abuses he says is that a person has to hire an attorney to challenge a forfeiture and a lawyer often charges more than the amount of the seized cash Under CAFRA reforms if the government loses a civil forfeiture challenge it must reimburse the lawyer but many individuals may be unaware of this fact when they decide not to pursue their money  Richard Weber chief of the asset forfeiture section of the Justice Department was asked if he found these cases troubling Theyre insignificant he said compared with the thousands of traffic stops where major drug money couriers are busted  Whats troubling to you Weber asks That a drug trafficker whos bringing money from the US to Mexico whos carrying hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars in cash in their pickup truck who just sold dope and crack and cocaine to children in your playgrounds and his money is being taken away That troubles you  This series was produced for broadcast by Marisa Penaloza Copyright 2014 NPR,"Mon, 16 Jun 2008 21:47:00 -0400",drugs

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17312200&ft=3&f=,At a high school in Colorado a dispute over text messages is sparking a debate about the line between discipline and privacy   It all began when a student at Monarch High School in suburban Denver was hauled into the principals office on suspicion of smoking cigarettes on school grounds  The principal searched the students backpack and pockets but did not come up with any evidence of improper activity says Mark Silverstein legal director at ACLU Colorado Its the next step that went too far After administrators found nothing in the backpack found nothing in the pockets they took the students cell phone and began reading the text messages Silverstein says   After finding mentions of marijuana the administrators confiscated the cell phones of several of the students friends as well Some of the information obtained from the texts landed in the students discipline files   School officials wont confirm or deny this version of events The situation has infuriated many students one even opted to destroy her phone rather than share its contents says Matt Menezes a Monarch sophomore She knew that that had been happening to a lot of her friends so she smashed it rather than give it up he says Its not like they have any justification for it at all  Id probably break my phone too Other students say that while the principal may have had good intentions the ends did not justify the means If he had seen some sort of security threat or had some issue he wanted resolved he could have read the text messages but I feel he just took the whole issue too far says Andrew Locke a junior at the school  Exactly how far is appropriate for schools to go in such matters is murky terrain A landmark Supreme Court ruling in 1985 established that schools have more latitude to search students than police officers do  But can the schools go so far as to search text messages Boulder Valley School District spokesman Briggs Gamblin says yes We believe reasonable suspicion existed to seize the cell phone and to transcribe the information in the cell phone he says  University of Colorado law professor Paul Ohm sees it differently Schools cant look in backpacks or purses based on completely a lack of suspicion and nor will a court say they can look in a cell phone with no suspicion Ohm says If the case were to go to court Ohm says the school district would have to explain thoroughly why it did what it did  If it was a frivolous search he says the ACLU has a case  Colorado has a history of taking privacy matters seriously State law prohibits the recording of electronic communication without the consent of the sender  At the very least the search violates state law the ACLU says Youngsters today treat cell phones as personal diaries the organization says and thereby the administrators overstepped the line Theres just so much more potential when searching a cell phone or an email archive to uncover information that has no relevance to the object of the search but yet could reveal many private and personal matters Silverstein says The ACLU is demanding that the school adopt a policy that prohibits administrators from searching cell phone text messages Both sides say they want to avoid going to court  but some privacy advocates say they hope thats exactly where the case is headed   I think its a very good issue for a court to consider and I think its important to draw some lines with new technology says Mark Rottenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington DC  Whether or not it is sued the district will likely adopt a definitive policy governing cell phones Gamblin says  You know five six years ago with cell phones we were simply worried about conversations going on when kids should be listening in class phones ringing and disturbing the teacher while they were trying to teach but we werent worried about pictures we werent worried about text messages he says  Some schools have banned phones but he says he doubts Boulder Valleys new policy will go that far Kirk Siegler reports for member station KUNC Copyright 2014 NPR,"Mon, 17 Dec 2007 11:04:00 -0500",drugs

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16628918&ft=3&f=,Drug enforcement officials are seeing a spike in a lucrative cottage industry indoor marijuana crops  This years National Drug Threat Assessment released by the Justice Department in October says vigorous outdoor cannabis eradication efforts have caused many marijuana producers particularly Caucasian groups to relocate indoors The grow houses as theyre called can be found in neighborhoods around the country but theyre becoming especially common in the Pacific Northwest  particularly in the suburbs of Seattle Local police and federal investigators have raided at least 50 houses in the past two years alone Authorities say theyre just starting to get a handle on how widespread the practice is becoming Largely Run by Vietnamese Immigrants Peter Truong is a community service officer for the sheriffs department in Seattle He speaks Chinese and Vietnamese  also spoken by most of the people busted in grow houses around Seattle Truong is constantly being called in by local police departments for help questioning the people arrested in the grow houses A couple of weeks ago I turn my cell phone off my home phone off because I got so tired Truong says Truong immigrated to the United States in 1975 and has worked with the sheriffs department for 20 years  He says the people who live in grow houses tend to come from Vietnamese communities in other places  often Massachusetts and Vancouver Canada Theyre recruited by the grow operation owners to tend the plants and theyre told to keep a low profile in the suburban neighborhoods where the houses are located They live normal life Troung says adding Really polite You never know what inside Truong says the only telltale sign hes noticed is the rash that people get when they tend the plants He guesses its caused by the chemicals or some other side effect of living in close quarters with hundreds of marijuana plants   Tucked Amid Suburbia The marijuana is grown in the middle of some very respectable Seattle suburbs such as Renton DEA special agent Clark Leininger has spent many long hours on stakeouts in quiet cul de sacs outside splitlevel homes that might sell for more than 400000 He says he often has good evidence that a house is stuffed with pot plants but he holds off making arrests so he can find the larger network Most of these people who are orchestrating these operations have multiple houses Some investigators say the minimum is three some say five The largest number that Ive run into is 12 Leininger says referring to a case he investigated right there in Renton Leininger says the growers prefer to own their houses because it eliminates the risk of a nosy landlord And he says growers  or their intermediaries  have little trouble getting the loans to buy the houses they need He said the man who bought 12 houses was a typical case Many of the loans were zerodown nodocument loans he says He did not have any employment and if I remember correctly he was able to purchase about 6 million worth of property  and he didnt have a job Backed by Crooked Mortgage Deals Its a business model imported from British Columbia where the grow house industry is far more advanced In one notorious case a mortgage broker named Danh Victor Van Nguyen was convicted of writing hundreds of fraudulent mortgages  many of which were found to have paid for houses containing marijuana grow operations Ken Frasier is with Financial Institutions Commission a British Columbia agency that investigates among other things crooked mortgage deals He says mortgage brokers there just arent looking closely enough at whos borrowing Theyll simply pass paper so that they will get an application from an individual they wont check it out theyll simply forward it on Frasier says Federal prosecutors say theyre now finding the same patterns in Seattle After Sept 11 2001 security on the Canadian border was tightened making it harder to smuggle marijuana grown in the Vancouver suburbs  the wellknown BC Bud  So Vancouverstyle grow houses started appearing in Seattle often with Canadian ties  In fact Danh Van Nguyens name  or those of his family  has shown up on deeds for Seattlearea homes that were raided as alleged grow houses Nguyen and several other people with VietnameseCanadian ties have been indicted by the US government Nguyen himself is still a fugitive living in Canada Federal prosecutor Sarah Vogel says its clear to her that lenders in the Seattle area have not been asking enough questions of prospective borrowers   Loose Lending Standards It seems like in some cases applications didnt have true information on them or perhaps in other cases nobody bothered to call she says Perhaps in other cases people just pay a higher interest rate in order to not have somebody check up on them The extent of background checking is a private matter between lender and customer But King County records show that several of the houses raided for marijuana production around Seattle were bought with variable interestrate loans or with small down payments    Steve Heaney the president of the chapter of the Washington Association of Mortgage Brokers which covers the suburbs where many of these houses are being found says standards could be tighter  a process he says is already well under way He says the fallout from the subprime mortgage meltdown has already made it much harder for someone without a clear source of steady legal income to take out a mortgage But he also warns against tightening things up too much   I dont think anybody in my industry  other than the bad guys and I believe theyre a very small percentage  really want to facilitate the drug dealers But if we eliminate completely loans with alternative documentation theres cretainly a lot of legitimate Americans who arent going to be able to buy a home Heaney says And legality aside its hard to argue with the marijuana growers investment instincts Typically raising three crops a year in bedrooms and basements of their suburban greenhouses they rarely have trouble meeting their mortgage payments And the houses once theyre raided usually sell for more than the growers paid for them  one even went for twice the price Copyright 2014 NPR,"Mon, 26 Nov 2007 15:38:00 -0500",drugs

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15416961&ft=3&f=,My name is Mike Engleby and Im in my second year at an ancient university My college was founded in 1662 which means its viewed here as modern Its chapel was designed by Hawksmoor or possibly Wren its gardens were laid out by someone else whose name is familiar The choir stalls were carved by the only woodcarver youve ever heard of The captain of the Boat Club won a gold medal at an international games last year I think hes studying physical education The captain of cricket has played for Pakistan though he talks like the Prince of Wales The teachers or dons include three university professors one of whom was on the radio recently talking about lizards Hes known as the Iguanodon Tonight I wont study in my room because theres the weekly meeting of the Folk Club Almost all the boys in my college go to this not for the music though its normally quite good but because lots of girl students come here for the evening The only boys who dont go are those with a work compulsion or the ones who think folk music died when Bob Dylan went electric  Theres someone Ive seen a few times called Jennifer Arkland I discovered her name because she stood for election to the committee of a society On the posters the candidates had small pictures of themselves and under their names and colleges a few personal details Hers said Secondyear History exhibitioner Previously educated at Lymington High School and Sorbonne Hobbies music dance filmmaking cooking Would like to make the society more democratic with more women members and have more outings Id seen her in the tea room of the University Library where she was usually with two other girls from her college a fat one called Molly and a severe dark one whose name I hadnt caught There was often Steve from Christs or Dave from Jesus sniffing round them I think Ill join this society of hers It doesnt matter what its for because theyre all the same Theyre all called something Soc short for Society Lab Soc Lit Soc Geog Soc Theres probably a knitting group called Sock Soc Ill find out about Jen Soc then go along so I can get to know her better I won a prize to come to my college and it pays my fees my familys poor I took a train from school one day after Id sat the exams and had been called for interview I must have stayed in London on the way but I have no memory of it My memorys odd like that Im big on detail but there are holes in the fabric I do remember that I took a bus from the station though I didnt know then what my college looked like I went round the whole city and ended up back at the station having made the round trip Then I took a taxi and had to borrow some money from the porter to pay for it I still had a pound note in my wallet for emergencies They gave me a key to a bedroom it was in a courtyard that I reached by a tunnel under the road I imagined what kind of student lived there normally I pictured someone called Tony with a beard and a duffel coat I tried really hard to like the room and the college that was going to be mine I imagined bicycling off to lectures in the early morning with my books balanced on a rack over the back wheel Id be shouting out to the other guys See you there Id probably smoke a pipe Id also probably have a girlfriend  some quite stern grammar school girl with glasses who wouldnt be to everyones taste In fact I didnt like the room I was in that night It was damp it was small and it felt as though too many people had been through it It didnt seem old enough it didnt seem 17th century or modern it was more like 1955 Also there was no bathroom I found one up the stairs It was very cold and I had to stay dressed until the bath was run The water itself was very hot Everything in the room and on the stairs smelled slightly of gas and lino I slept fine but I didnt want to have breakfast in the dining hall because of having to talk to the other candidates I went along the street and found a cafe and had weak coffee and a sausage roll which I paid for from my spare pound I reentered the college by the main gate The porter was sullen in his damp lodge with a paraffin heater G12 Dr Woodrows rooms he said I found it all right and there was another boy waiting outside He looked clever Eventually the door opened and it was my turn There were two of them in there a big schoolmasterly man who showed me to a chair then sat down at a desk and a younger thin man with a beard who didnt get up from his armchair Teachers at my school didnt have beards You wrote well on Shakespeare Do you visit the theatre a good deal This was the big one talking It sounded too much like an ordinary conversation to be an interview I suspected a trap I told him there wasnt a theatre where we lived in Reading I was watching him all the time How grand to be a Doctor of whatever and to weigh up and decide peoples future Id once seen a set of table mats in a shop which had pictures of men in different academic gowns Doctor of Divinity Master of Arts and so on But this was the first real one Id seen He asked me a few more things none of them interesting the poetry of Eliot Would you care to make a comparison between Eliot and Lawrence This was the younger one and it was his first contribution I thought he must be joking An American banker interested in the rhythms of the Anglican liturgy and a pitmans son who wanted to escape from Nottingham maybe via sex or by his crude paintings Compare them I looked at him carefully but he showed no sign of humour so I gave an answer about their use of verse forms trying to make it sound as though it had been a reasonable question He nodded a few times and looked relieved He didnt follow it up The big one leafed through my papers again Your personal report he said at last from your teacher  Did you have difficulties with him I hadnt been aware of any I said Is there anything that youd like to ask us about life in college We try to make everyone feel welcome It seemed wrong not to ask something it might look as though I didnt care But I couldnt ask any of the things I really wanted to know In the silence we heard the college clock chime the halfhour I felt them both looking at me Then I felt a trickle of sweat on my spine I hardly ever sweat normally and it gave me an idea Whats the thing with laundry What said the big one gruffly Do you have  Well like washing machines Is it done centrally or do I take it somewhere or what Gerald Im not quite sure said the younger one Each undergraduate is assigned a moral tutor said the schoolmasterly one A Fellow of the college who can help you with all your personal and health questions So hed be the one to ask Yes Yes I imagine so I thought that now Id broken the ice it might be good to ask another question What about money I said What How much money will I need I imagine your local authority will provide a grant Its up to you how you spend it Do you have questions about the work No I read the prospectus Do you find the idea of Chaucer daunting  No I like Chaucer Yes yes I can see that from your paper Well Mr Engle    er   Engleby Englebury You can go now unless  Gerald No no Good So well look forward to seeing you next autumn I didnt see how they could let me go without telling me how it had gone Have I won a prize I said We shall be writing to your school in due course When weve completed the interview process Its an exceptional year I shook his offered hand waved at the seated one and went out down the oak stairs What a pair of frauds In the evening I tear a ticket from a book and take it to the college dining hall which was designed by Robert Adam You have to buy a book of thirtyfive every term you dont actually have to use them but the cash you pay in advance keeps the kitchen going Im wearing a long black gown over my jeans and sweater and there are candles in sconces on the painted plaster walls We stand up when a door behind the top table opens and the Fellows of the college come in to dine The Master is an oceanographer who once drew maps of undersea mountain ranges He knows how Australia was once attached to China or how Ghana sweated in the foothills of the Andes I think he imagines that New Zealand once broke free from Germany The crystal glasses glitter in the candlelight They drink wine We drink water though you are allowed to ask for beer if you like Stellings is the only man to do this A pint of ale please Robinson he says to the stooping butler Beer for you Mike I shake my head Stellings brews his own beer in a plastic barrel He calls it SG short for students gin drunk for a penny dead drunk for twopence and once forced me to drink it even though it made me sick with its powerful taste of malt and raw alcohol which he achieves by doubling the sugar input recommended on the side of the kit There is no bathroom near his room so I had to vomit into a plastic watering can on the landing I sometimes dont take dinner in the dining hall Ive found some places I like better One of them is a pub a walk of ten or fifteen minutes away over a green there are a lot of greens or pieces as they call them here down a side street up a back street The beer there tastes much better than Stellingss homebrew Its made by a brewery called Greene King One of the King family they say is a famous novelist The lights here are low the floor is made of wooden boards the other people are not from the university They are what are called ordinary people though each person is really too specific to be ordinary Its quite dark and people talk softly Although the barman knows me he doesnt intrude I often have a baked potato or a cheese and ham pie which is messy to eat because the melted cheese is stringy and theres so much of it between the layers of filo pastry I also drink gin and vermouth mixed I like red vermouth better than white When Ive drunk two or three of these I feel I understand the world better At least I dont mind so much that I dont understand it I can be tolerant of my ignorance After three or four I feel that my ignorance is not only tolerable but possibly in some way noble Other times I go into the middle of the town Theres a bright Greek restaurant there where its embarrassing to be seen alone  but I like the food they bring moussaka with rice and with chips and with Greek salad and pitta bread with olives and hummus so if youre hungry its a good place to go Sometimes I dont eat for two or three days so I need to load up With this Greek food I drink white wine that tastes of toilet cleaner and they go together well I also take drugs Ive tried most things My favourite is opium though Ive had it only once Its really hard to get hold of and involves a palaver with a flame and a pipe I bought it from a boy who got it from a Modern History Fellow in Corpus Christi who had recently been to the Far East The thing about opium is that it makes pain or difficulty unimaginable If while you were under its influence someone were to tell you about Zyklon B and your parents dying and life in a dementia ward or Passchendaele you might be able to understand what they meant  but only in a hypothetical sense You might be interested by this idea of pain but in a donnish way I mean Im  interested  in the special theory of relativity the idea that theres a dimension in which space rolls up and time distorts and you come back from a journey younger than you left is certainly intriguing but it doesnt have an impact on me day by day Thats what opium does to suffering makes it of hypothetical interest only I mostly smoke marijuana which I buy from a boy called Glynn Powers I dont know where Glynn buys it but he has several kilos of it in the builtin bedside locker in his tiny room in the new Queen Elizabeth block a short walk beyond Fellows Pieces ie grass area reserved to dons The block was opened by a princess only three years ago and in the entrance hall of the building next to the commemorative plaque theres a picture of her standing in one of the little cells smiling at the president with the bedside locker in view behind them The brickwork of the wall is exposed because they discovered when the building was completed that the size of each room was smaller than the minimum required for single human habitation by the Department of Housing By removing the plasterboard they were able to add just enough volume to go legal In his bedside locker Glynn keeps polished scales and brass imperial weights Mene mene tekel upharsin you have been weighed in the scale balanced and found wanting Not that Id argue with Glynn Powers or tell him he was wanting in any way at all He wears a leather jacket with a thin fringe of tassels halfway down the back he has a thick trimmed beard and a motorbike I have neither He is studying Engineering He doesnt smoke himself which I find sinister

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7207847&ft=3&f=,President Bush on Monday released what will surely be the most scrutinized budget of his presidency to date a 29 trillion package that includes big increases for defense spending corresponding cuts in popular domestic programs and an assumption that tax revenues will continue to growThe presidents budget director Rob Portman said he and the president were proud to present a balanced budget with no tax increases But the budget they have offered  if adopted  would not break even until 2012 and then only without any substantial costs of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan after 2009  The costs of those two wars are grabbing the headlines  The president is asking for nearly a quarter trillion dollars over the next 20 months  This is on top of a regular Pentagon budget of nearly half a trillion for fiscal 2008Portman said the budget projection for fiscal 2009 would include a 50 billion allowance for these two wars given the uncertainty of the situation  President Bush was quick to say this smaller amount  and the absence of Iraq costs from the budget projections after 2009  did not imply a timetable for US withdrawal from the conflictBut some reversal of the warcost trend appeared integral to the strategy for reaching a balanced budget by 2012  The presidents budget plan projects a fiscal year 2007 deficit of 244 billion and a nearly identical figure for 2008 Three years after the end of Mr Bushs second term his budget projects a surplus of 61 billionReaching balance would also require an uninterrupted stream of good news on the economic front where strong tax collections have recently helped reduce what had been recordhigh annual deficitsThe other element in the presidents drive toward a surplus is spending restraint which many conservatives have maintained was missing in the first six years of the Bush regime  even with Republican majorities in Congress  But the targets for cutting will find staunch defenders in Congress  The Bush budget would change reimbursement formulas and other policies to limit growth in Medicare Medicaid and other entitlement spending over the next five years to save nearly 100 billion  with about twothirds of that amount coming from MedicareThe vast majority of the numbers and policies embodied in the presidents budget are routine nondiscretionary and automatic if not necessarily noncontroversial  But the remaining details will bring months of conflict between the president and Congress which is now under full Democratic control for the first time in the Bush presidencyAfghanistan and IraqBy Jackie NorthamFor the current fiscal year President Bush will request an additional 100 billion in supplemental funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan 70 billion has already been approved For fiscal year 2008 which begins in October the president will ask for an additional 145 billion for the wars However White House spokesman Tony Fratto warned that the projection for 2008 was like to change The presidents budget also includes 50 billion for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars in 2009 and no money after that year  The war costs are only part of the Pentagons budget request The president is asking for an additional 481 billion to be used for the Defense Departments base budget Officials say this is to ensure that the US military maintains its combat readiness and will help support service members and their families  It also goes toward weaponry and the 2008 budget  which represents an 113 percent increase from the 2007 budget  includes no cancellations of major weapons programs  This defense budget request signals a change in how the administration is funding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan Until now most of the funding came through supplemental or emergency spending bills which dont provide precise details of where or how the money is being spent  Many Democrats and others have long protested this type of funding  Now the administration says it will be transparent and provide more details about the defense budget  EducationBy Larry AbramsonThe education budget viewed from the Bush administrations point of view is essentially flat 56 billion the same amount that was appropriated last year  The president has focused on shoring up his administrations landmark No Child Left Behind Act which is due to be reauthorized by Congress as soon as this year The White House wants to devote an additional 12 billion to Title I the part of the education budget that is aimed at improving the performance of lowincome children This comes in response to complaints from educators that No Child Left Behind has demanded better performance from lowincome kids without providing the resources to achieve that goal The president also wants to devote 500 million to School Improvement Grants which would allow the lowestperforming schools to develop turnaround strategies And in a move certain to spark an outcry in Congress the president is proposing 300 million in vouchers that would allow families in failing public schools to move to private schools or to public schools in other districtsFor higher education the administration is responding to years of stagnant support for grants to lowerincome college students with a major increase in Pell Grants which go to the neediest students Under the proposed budget the maximum Pell Grant would jump from the current 4050 to 4600 in fiscal year 2008 climbing to 5400 by 2012 The change follows criticism of the Republicans decision to freeze Pell Grants for the past five years  Colleges and universities have long pushed for a boost in Pell Grants but they are disappointed in the presidents proposal Educators note that while the White House 2008 budget would raise Pell Grants it would also eliminate 770 million for Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants which serve a similar need Critics also note that the increase in Pell Grants is not so dramatic once you consider that the new Democratic leadership in Congress has already agreed to raise these grants to 4300  The Democratic leadership in Congress took issue first with the size of the education budget Democrats say that the presidents 56 billion proposal amounts to a cut in funding since the new Congress is currently in the process of approving a continuing resolution that would devote 575 billion to education for fiscal year 2007   Democratic leaders also say that the additional funding for No Child Left Behind falls far short of what is needed to support schools struggling to comply with the law Educators note that the 12 billion increase in Title I funding is focused on expanding the No Child law to high schools the law currently concentrates on mandating higher standards in lower grades Critics say that means that K8 schools will continue to face an unfunded mandate as they try to administer testing required by the law Energy DepartmentBy Christopher JoyceThe Department of Energy would see an overall increase of about 3 percent in its budget under President Bushs proposal  Given that Congress is usually deeply divided on energy issues much of what the president is proposing will get run through the washandrinse cycle before Congress approves any of it The president wants a lot of new money for research into building new kinds of nuclear power plants and reprocessing spent nuclear fuel so it can be reused  Theres also a 37 percent increase in funding for developing cleaner ways to burn coalTrue to his StateoftheUnion promise the president would spend more on turning corn and other forms of biomass into fuel to replace gasoline  the new budget asks for 20 percent more funding  Solar power spending stays flat however  Spending on new kinds of hydrogenfueled cars and power sources gets a 10 percent boostOil and gas research gets zeroed out although the president wants the government to buy a lot of oil to increase the size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  One form of alternative energy the president would zero out geothermal power which generates energy from steam created by the heat in the Earths interior The words climate change or global warming do not appear in the DOE budget documents although reference is made to limiting greenhouse gases the major cause of climate warming  And there is new spending on learning how to strip carbon dioxide the main greenhouse gas out of coal and bury it underground to keep it out of the atmosphereEnvironmental Protection and ParksBy Elizabeth Shogren The presidents proposed budget has no new major initiatives for the Environmental Protection Agency EPA But it would cut the agencys funding by about 500 million primarily by cutting funding to state and local governments for drinkingwater and sewerinfrastructure programs      The president wants to increase funding to 35 million for EPA programs to clean up diesel engines up from 7 million in 2006 He also would provide 29 million to help clean up the Chesapeake Bay watershed and 35 million to help clean up harmful industrial pollutants in the sediments of the Great Lakes      Over at the Interior Department the White House is proposing to boost spending on National Parks President Bush is challenging the public to donate 100 million to support the parks and promises to provide dollarfordollar matching funds He also would increase funding for general operations of the parks by 250 million which will provide money for all sorts of improvements including an additional 3000 seasonal rangers to parks around the countryFaithBased ProgramsBy Rachel MartinSince 2001 President Bush has been touting his faithbased initiative and related programs in very public ways and he has typically made some reference to at least one faithbased program in his State of the Union address Not so this year Some experts speculate that the war in Iraq and other foreign policy issues have so dominated the presidents agenda in the past year that faithbased programs have fallen off the radar or at least off the political platform Other former administration officials say the president has stopped pushing the faithbased initiative to avoid rocking the boat with a new Democratic majority in control of Congress His proposed 2008 budget reflects a similar note of caution Some programs will see a budgetary boost others a cut Overall experts say its about funding programs that have proven effective and reducing funding for those that havent Here are the proposed 2008 budget allocations for a few of the core programs191 million for abstinence education Thats an increase of 28 million over last year The money would be used to make additional awards to communitybased programs that teach and encourage abstinence among adolescents ages 12 to 18 Of all the faithbased grant programs this could be the most controversial75 million for the Compassion Capital Fund which provides training and technical assistance for grassroots faithbased and communitybased organizations Thats a reduction of 25 million from the 2007 budget50 million restored for Mentoring Children of Prisoners Last year that program was budgeted at 40 million98 million to fund grants that expand access to treatment and recoverysupport servicesThe above core programs fall under the Health and Human Services budget But the presidents faithbased initiative incorporates programs from a crosssection of government agencies notably the Department of Housing and Urban Development  In the proposed 08 HUD budget the administration has tagged 575 million dollars for a program to help elderly people secure housing  an increase of 30 million from last year Under the program funding is awarded on a competitive basis to nonprofit organizations many of them faithbasedFood and Drug AdministrationBy Joanne SilbernerThe president is calling for nearly 21 billion for the Food and Drug Administration Thats just a bit more than the 2 billion the agency is expected to go through this year The budget includes an increase of 11 million for work on drugsafety issues a category that has brought the agency a lot of criticism lately And it assumes that Congress will approve several new user fees Already manufacturers of brandname drugs have to pay to get the agency to consider their products If Congress goes along with the new budget manufacturers of generic drugs would also have to pay And companies that fail a routine FDA inspection would have to pay for a reinspectionIf the president gets his wishes the FDA would bring in a total of 444 million of its 21 billion proposed budget from the companies that it regulates  Health CareBy Julie RovnerPresident Bushs fiscal 2008 budget seeks balance in much the same way that Willie Sutton sought his wealth by going where the money is In this case much of the money  nearly 600 billion in fiscal 2008  is going to Medicare and Medicaid the huge healthcare entitlement programs for the elderly and disabled and the poor respectivelyBut the presidents proposal to reduce Medicare and Medicaid spending by a combined 102 billion over the next five years has already provoked outrage from groups representing healthcare patients and providers alike The plan would reduce annual inflation increases for hospitals nursing homes hospices and other healthcare providers while boosting premiums for more beneficiaries with higher incomesThe budget does propose additional money for the State Childrens Health Insurance Program which is up for renewal this year But the 5 billion in new money is well short of the 13 billion analysts say is needed to maintain the current 66 million children now on the rolls The budget also says the president wants to refocus SCHIP on lowincome uninsured children below 200 percent of the federal poverty level even though at least 16 states cover roughly a halfmillion children above that income levelMost of the cuts to other health programs are ones the president has proposed in the past  and even Republicanled Congresses have refused to make They include deep reductions in programs to train doctors and other health professionals subsidies to childrens hospitals for the cost of graduate medical education and elimination of a block grant that funds a variety of preventive healthcare servicesThe National Institutes of Health would get a small increase under the presidents budget  232 million  but that was still not enough to prevent research groups from complaining that scientific research was being shortchanged  Homeland SecurityBy Pam FesslerPresident Bush has requested an 8 percent increase in the Department of Homeland Securitys budget for a total of more than 46 billion  Much of the additional money would pay for tighter security at the border see immigration summary But the president would also like to see large increases for the Coast Guard and transportation security The Coast Guard budget would get an additional 788 million as the latest installment in its 24 billion plan to upgrade its entire fleet of ships and planes The money would allow the agency to complete its acquisition of four large cutters according to the administration  But lawmakers are upset by the programs spiraling costs and design flaws and the request is certain to get intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill   The Transportation Security Administration would get an additional 224 million to upgrade its screening operations including taking over the verification of passengers identities something now handled by the airlines  However privacy concerns continue to dog the program called Secure Flight and its unclear how much progress TSA will be able to make in the coming year   The Federal Emergency Management Agency would get a reduction next year But most of that is due to the big increase it received earlier to deal with the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita  The administration says an additional 100 million would be available to help the agency reorganize so that its better equipped to handle future disastersFunding for grants to state and local governments would be about a billion dollars less than the amount provided this year But an additional billion dollars would be available through another grant program to help first responders upgrade their communications equipmentThe budget does not reflect changes Congress might approve this year as part of a bill to implement the remaining recommendations of the commission that investigated the Sept 11 attacks These include a requirement for more screening of cargo on airplanes and shipsImmigrationBy Jennifer LuddenAs in recent years the presidents budget includes increased funding for interior and border enforcement against illegal immigration This budget designates 778 million to hire 3000 new Border Patrol agents it is part of a plan to double the number of agents to 18000 by the end of Mr Bushs term  Theres also more money specifically for investigating smuggling for prosecuting and deporting foreigners involved in gang activities and for a voluntary computer program that lets employers check new employees legal status      New money will expand immigration enforcement to local communities  26 million will go toward training 250 state and local law enforcement officers to arrest and detain suspects on immigration charges something normally only federal officers can do      While more and more towns are signing up for such programs the concept is controversial Some immigrant advocates and even police departments worry that such local enforcement will undermine their efforts at community policing  Less controversially a 29 million increase in the budget will help screen foreignborn detainees in prison facilities  local state and federal  and deport those with criminal records    The budget allocates 1 billion for border fencing and virtual barriers part of the sweeping hitech Secure Border Initiative DHS announced a year ago  This seems to confirm the administration has no intention of building a moresolid border wall which is what many in the last Congress say they had in mind when they approved a border barrier  Money is allocated for 950 extra detention beds bringing the total to 28540 such beds across the country in which to keep illegal immigrants who are arrested by DHS  For years thousands of detained immigrants have been let go because there is simply no place to keep them  The Bush administration has made it a priority to increase detention space and so end this practice which is known as catch and release But the number of available beds is still a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants arrested each yearFinally the budget assumes that a dramatic increase in fees just requested by US Citizenship and Immigration Services will be approved For the past five years the agency has had an extra 100 million a year to help it reduce a staggering backlog of applications  That money runs out in 2008 at which point the agency will be forced to operate nearly exclusively on user fees                                                                                                                                    Justice DepartmentBy Ari ShapiroState and local lawenforcement groups complain that the proposed budget cuts their funding by 75 percent  The Justice Department retorts that the president has requested the same amount of money as last year  In a way theyre both right  The budget eliminates funding lines for a wide variety of lawenforcement programs drug courts prison rape prevention cannabis eradication mentallyill offender programs and so on  The Justice Department says those programs and others will now all compete for one big bucket of money  But lawenforcement officials complain that the bucket is far too small for all the programs that are supposed to compete for it under the new budget  One of the cutbacks that has upset lawmakers most affects a program called COPSCommunityOriented Policing Services  At its peak in the 1990s COPS had a 15 billion budget   Last year the budget was stripped down to 500 million  This year the president has asked for only 32 million for the program  Justice Department officials say the program achieved its mission so money should now go to other projects  Lawenforcement groups say crime is rising across the country which makes this a bad time to cut money for police officers on the streets  Labor DepartmentBy Frank LangfittThe Bush administration wants to increase the Department of Labors budget by about 8 percent 37 billion But as part of his proposal the president also wants to eliminate a total of 1 billion in funding for jobtraining programsLabor Secretary Elaine L Chao says her agency would consolidate spending and put 34 billion into what she calls Career Advancement Accounts These personalspending accounts would provide workers with up to 3000 a year money which they could use to pay for things such as training in new skills at a community college Labor officials say the accounts could extend to 600000 workersBut Ross Eisenbrey vicepresident of the Economic Policy Institute a prolabor Washington think tank says hes pretty amazed that the administration wants to cut training dollars at a time when workers are struggling with pressure from globalization and rapidly changing technologyThe budget proposal does call for some spending increases It includes more money for safety inspectors following one of the deadliest years for coal miners It would also increase spending for the inspector generals office to crack down on labor racketeeringPoverty ProgramsBy Rachel Jones Some advocates of the poor say the presidents proposed 2008 budget manages to be both more and less of the same thing more cuts and less funding that isLowincome housing and antihomelessness groups say major cuts to the Community Development Block Grant program and the Public Housing Capital Grant will only exacerbate Americas affordablehousing crisis The United States Conference of Mayors strongly objects to the administrations proposal to cut the CDBG budget by almost 1 billion Public housing would get about  a halfbillion dollars less and funding for the Section 8 housing voucher program for the poor would remain the sameThough the administration is touting an increase in targeted federal spending on homelessness housing advocates say the proposed cuts could negate any progress in that area Antihunger activists are up in arms about proposed changes to the Farm Bill which includes the five federal nutrition programs They say the budget would change the way food stamps are administered which could cut eligibility for more than 300000 people in lowincome working families Another proposal eliminates the Commodity Supplemental Food Program which provides food for more than 450000 lowincome seniors The WIC nutrition program for poor mothers and children would also take a hit The budget proposal would limit automatic WIC eligibility for Medicaid recipients and reduce funding for nutrition education and other WIC services It would also cut the Community Services Block Grant program which covers the Community Food and Nutrition Program That program helps fund antihunger and nutrition advocacy groups at the local state and national levelSpace ExplorationBy Nell BoyceThe moon and Mars remain White House priorities in space NASA would get 173 billion under the presidents requesta 3 percent increase over the agencys 2007 request The agencys current budget is still under discussion in Congress so its hard to know if the new request would be a raise or a cutThe request includes 951 million to develop the nextgeneration Orion space vehicle and 12 billion to develop the rocket that will launch it Orion is supposed to start its first flight tests in 2014 four years after the space shuttle is retiredFunding for science at NASA would stay relatively flat under the proposed budget NASA is requesting just 1 percent more than last year for a total of about 55 billion Most of the cash would go to science projects such as the Phoenix Mars Mission a robotic craft that will launch this August to study the history of water on Mars and the Dawn Mission which will launch this summer to go study two asteroids Ceres and Vesta TaxesBy Ron ElvingIn foreseeing a balanced budget the presidents document assumes tax collections will be robust enough to cover the effects of extending the tax breaks Congress approved in 2001 and 2003 These breaks were to expire in 2010 and 2011 but the president wants them made permanent and his budget assumes Congress will go along  The Congressional Budget Office has projected the costs of making these cuts permanent at 16 trillion over a decadeStill another revenue issue finessed in the budget is the problem posed by the Alternative Minimum Tax  Intended as a backup tax on millionaires using exotic means to avoid taxation the AMT has been affecting the returns of more and more taxpayers  particularly those of twoearner families with large mortgages in hightax states  Democrats have vowed to keep the AMT from hitting more middleclass families and if they do so it will affect the revenue stream The budget released Monday includes only a oneyear patch to limit the bite of the AMT through 2008Transportation DepartmentBy Kathy SchalchThe Department of Transportation has requested 67 billion for easing congestion both on the roads and in the skies Most of the money about 42 billion will go towards highway construction and associated safety programs DOT wants 94 billion for masstransit projects with 13 billion of that specifically for commuter rails or similar projects in urban areas  The DOT budget proposal creates a new 175 million highway congestion initiative It would channel money to local governments willing to take innovative steps to curb congestion Demonstration projects might include mass transit new flexibly priced toll roads Web updates for commuters flexible work schedules or other initiatives  DOTs budget also takes aim at growing demands on crowded airports The FAA wants to modernize the airtraffic control system and will soon announce details of its proposal Its budget would provide almost 175 million for a new satellite navigation system and more than 900 million for additional capital projects that will support the modernization program  DOT wants to revamp the system that funds airtraffic control as well charging users according to what it actually costs the Federal Aviation Administration to provide airtraffic control and other services  The presidents call for new fueleconomy standards is also reflected in this years budget request The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA is requesting an additional 600000 for its CAFE corporate average fuel economy program bringing its total budget to 19 million  It will soon ask Congress for the authority to change the program setting fueleconomy targets for individual types of vehicles according to their size  rather than focusing on average fuel economy  Airquality programs would continue to receive just over 1 billion per year This amount pays for projects designed to help meet air standards for ozone carbon monoxide and particulate matterVeterans AffairsBy Joseph ShapiroThe presidents budget requests nearly 87 billion in fiscal year 2008 for the Department of Veterans Affairs Most of the money would go to health care and disability compensation The White House said that represents an increase of 77 percent over the VAs budget when Bush took officeBut some veterans groups said the increase is not as big as it looks  and not enough to care for troops returning from Iraq The president asked for almost 3 billion more than last year to fund medical care for veterans The White House proposes increasing the copayment for medications from 8 to 15 per monthly prescriptionAnd there would be a new enrollment fee It would cost 250750 a year to get care in the VA system That enrollment fee would apply only to those whose disability is not a result of military serviceIts not the first time the Bush administration has proposed such a fee which is unpopular with veterans Such fees have been rejected in the past by Republicancontrolled Congresses and the Democratic Congress is expected to do the sameVeterans groups say that even with the fees the VA would be about 2 billion short of what it needs to provide current levels of health care to veterans Copyright 2014 NPR,"Mon, 05 Feb 2007 16:00:00 -0500",drugs

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5187390&ft=3&f=,Okay so maybe it wasnt Clay beating Liston or Villanova topping Georgetown  Nonetheless the victory of Ohio Republican Congressman John Boehner  over Majority Whip Roy Blunt RMO to succeed Tom DeLay as House majority leader was a shocker And yet given Blunts particularly close relationship with DeLay  who was forced to give up his post after an indictment in Texas and who might yet get caught up in the Jack Abramoff scandal  it shouldnt have been  It seemed that Blunt was perfectly situated to move up the leadership ladder  When DeLay became whip after the 1998 elections he named Blunt as his chief deputy  When DeLay ascended to leader Blunt advanced to whip And when DeLay ceded his title Dennis Hastert  who himself became speaker thanks to DeLay  named Blunt as acting majority leader  In that capacity Blunt was in a position to work closely with and do favors for the Republicans in the House  Personally he was popular within the conference eager to bridge differences among the members with none of the hard edges that DeLay was universally known for   But if DeLay was thuggish and vindictive at times he was also an extremely effective leader  He knew how to cajole and twist arms and he knew how to count  Blunt was no DeLay  Part of it wasnt entirely his fault as President Bush and support for his policies sank in the polls the fate of the Republicans in Congress fell along with him  An unpopular war an unsteady response to the Katrina tragedy and a growing ethics problem on Capitol Hill put the GOP on the defensive and more and more vulnerable lawmakers found it necessary to plot independent courses   But Blunt didnt lose because of any shortcomings in his job performance  He was hampered by a serious appearance problem  His power existed because of Tom DeLay  Thats all well and good when DeLay was the toast of the town  But by now with the uncertainty over his Texas legal problems and Abramoff connections he had become an albatross for Blunt  Plus the feeling was if lobbyists became the new dirty word in Washington then why reward Blunt who is in bed with lobbyists  Or at least one of them  his wife Abigail Perlman is a lobbyist for Philip Morris Boehner had his vulnerabilities too  He also has strong connections to K Street  Many recall the time when he went onto the House floor and literally gave out checks from the tobacco industry to lawmakers  Immediately after his election as leader the Democratic National Committee headlined a release with this  A Fresh Start  House GOP Replaces DeLay With Lobbyist Lap Dog   Boehner was actually drummed out of the leadership back in 98 along with thenSpeaker Newt Gingrich who resigned after his party suffered a backlash stemming from the impeachment by the GOP Congress of President Clinton over laffaire Lewinsky  But Boehner has worked his way back into the graces of his fellow Republicans through hard work reaching out to Democrats to pass the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001 an act which it should be added was not a favorite of smallgovernment conservatives  And the fact that he was long at odds with DeLay helped especially at a time when Republicans were desperate to shed the culture of corruption label bestowed upon them by the Democrats   Its interesting how things work in Washington in that Boehner in Congress since 1991 longer than Blunt or the third candidate in the leadership race Arizonas John Shadegg came across as a fresh face  And with a Democratic takeover of the House in November at the least a possibility electing a DeLay foe as majority leader instead of a DeLay ally should have been a nobrainer  As it turned out it was  The election it should be pointed out came on Ground Hog Day  And the unmistakable message was thus  Republicans didnt want to vote for a new majority leader and see Tom DeLays shadow Box Score  What made Boehners secondballot win that more astounding was the tally after the first ballot  Blunt 110 Boehner 79 Shadegg 40 with two votes going to Kansas Jim Ryun  Blunt needed to pick up only seven more votes on the second ballot to win But the second ballot became a battle of Blunt vs Not Blunt  Thus apparently every one of Shadeggs supporters switched to Boehner  Blunt even lost one of his own backers in the process   so much for his skill at counting votes  The final vote was Boehner 122 Blunt 109 Enough Already  For the seven of you out there who cant get enough of this stuff the drama in this years race for House majority leader ranks up there with the Republican race for House minority whip in the spring of 1989 and the Democratic race for House majority leader in December of 1976  The 89 GOP race came about because of two events  first the election of House Republican Whip Trent Lott to the Senate in 1988 and then the decision by the first President Bush to appoint his successor as whip Wyomings Dick Cheney as Secretary of Defense in early 1989  Republican rank and file distress over having spent decades in the minority led to Newt Gingrich of Georgia a party firebrand who was pushing the ethics investigation of Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright winning the whipship in an upset over Edward Madigan of Illinois a legislative tactician backed by the party establishment by a vote of 8785  It was a sign of things to come when the GOP captured the House in 1994 Gingrich became speaker The 1976 race on the Democratic side was caused by the retirement of Speaker Carl Albert and the ascension of Majority Leader Tip ONeill to replace him  That left open the majority leader post which was sought by four men  Richard Bolling MO the secondranking Democrat on the Rules Committee Phillip Burton CA the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus John McFall CA the majority whip and Jim Wright TX a deputy whip and the choice of conservative Dems  Burton was considered the clear frontrunner in the race  But he had a miserable working relationship with ONeill and a famous reputation for arrogance and hunger for power  On the first ballot the tally was Burton 106 Bolling 81 Wright 77 and McFall 31  The second ballot with McFall gone was Burton 107 Wright 95 and Bolling 93  With Bolling out for the third ballot Wright became the anybody but Burton candidate and with the quiet support of ONeill he defeated Burton by the count of 148147     Boy those were the days huh On to the questions  Q  Replacing Justice Sandra Day OConnor with Samuel Alito is to me a radical and extreme step  Can you think of any other time when a Supreme Court nominee replaced a far more moderate justice  William Elliott San Francisco A  Yes from both sides of the political spectrum  In 1993 President Clinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg who at one point had been the legal counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union to succeed Justice Byron White a moderate conservative who was one of two dissenters in the 1973 Roe v Wade decision that legalized the right to an abortion  In 1967 President Johnson named Thurgood Marshall a former head of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund and the chief counsel in the 1954 Brown v Board of Education decision that outlawed segregation in public schools to succeed Justice Tom Clark a Truman appointee who had become a strong conservative in his later years  A radical switcheroo in the opposite direction came in 1991 when Marshall an unabashed liberal was replaced by Clarence Thomas a strong conservative      Q  I see that Pete McCloskey is trying to return to Congress in California  I remember when he challenged President Nixon in the 72 primaries  If McCloskey wins this year will the amount of time in between his congressional terms be a record  Christine Sweeney Madison Wis A  I dont see McCloskey who is 78 years old having much of a chance in the June 6 GOP primary against Rep Richard Pombo R11th even if there are some ethics concerns about the incumbent  McCloskey gave up his House seat in 1982 for an illfated bid for the GOP Senate nomination and hasnt been on a ballot since  The 11th District isnt even the same area McCloskey represented when he was in Congress 196782  Still if he somehow managed to oust Pombo and win in November it would be a return after 24 years  Im not sure if this would be a record but it would be longer than the 22 years between the first 191718 and second 194142 terms for Montana Republican Jeannette Rankin who happened to be the only person to vote against both world wars while in Congress  I dont know anyone else who returned to Congress after that long of an exodus Q  John Spencer who portrays Democratic vice presidential nominee Leo McGarry on The West Wing died in December  In real life how many times has a vice presidential nominee died during a presidential campaign  I can only think of one Vice President James Sherman in 1912  Mark Bernkopf Arlington Va A Thats the only one I can think of as well  Vice President Sherman died on Oct 30 1912 six days before the election that would vote the TaftSherman administration out of office  The Republican National Committee named Nicholas Murray Butler the president of Columbia University as Shermans replacement in order for the GOP ticket to receive the electoral votes of the few states it carried  Q My husband and I recently saw the film Good Night And Good Luck which got us to wondering whatever happened to Tierney McCarthy  Joe McCarthys wife adopted the girl in the hopes that being a father would help him recover from his chronic alcoholism and give him new direction after being drummed out of the Senate  Kayne Doumani San Francisco A Ive had your question for nearly four months now and have still been unable to find the answer to this  Ordinarily I dont like running questions to which I cant supply an answer but Im intrigued by this one  Does anyone know Ms McCarthys whereabouts Q I was wondering why no one is asking who the defense contractors are who bribed now former Congressman Duke Cunningham RCA  Why isnt the press demanding that the contractors be named and the companies and individuals involved punished  Yvonne Martinez Calif  A The names of the defense contractors have never been a secret  They are Mitchell Wade the former president of MZM Inc a defense intelligence firm and Brent Wilkes of defense contractor ADCS Inc  Wade was the person who bought Cunninghams San Diego house for 167 million in 2003 and sold it at a 700000 loss a year later  Wade and Wilkes continue to be part of the investigation currently underway by the Justice Department along with Tom Kontogiannis a New York real estate developer  Cunningham who resigned from the House last November is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb 27  Q My husband listens to no other station than KUHF and he is an avid political junkie  I had hoped to find books on politics listed among the NPR Holiday Books list but alas there were none  Do you have any recommendations  Mary Kanz Galveston Texas  A  I apologize that I couldnt squeeze this question into my column before Christmas but Ive always said theres nothing like a good political book that makes Valentines Day a special occasion  Truth be told I have never said that     There are three political books from 2005 that I can heartily recommend  The first is Restless Giant  The United States from Watergate to Bush V Gore by James Patterson Oxford University Press  Restless Giant is not merely a political book its a keen observation of social and cultural changes that America experienced since 1974   Lewis Goulds The Most Exclusive Club  A History of the Modern United States Senate Basic Books is a wonderful compilation of some of the giants and lesser types who roamed the corridors of the Senate in its long history The third is Ethan Raricks splendid biography of former California Governor Edmund G Pat Brown entitled California Rising University of California Press  It details Browns rise along with that of his Democratic Party at a time when California was solidly Republican and it chronicles Browns relationship with some of the states fascinating figures everyone from Sam Yorty to Richard Nixon to Ronald Reagan One book I frankly have not read but one that has been strongly recommended to me is The Assassins Gate America in Iraq by George Packer Farrar Straus Giroux  It has been described as a mustread study at the US decision to invade Iraq and depose the regime of Saddam Hussein      This day in political history  The Senate confirms Federal Appeals Court Judge Anthony Kennedy to the US Supreme Court by a vote of 970  Kennedy is President Reagans third choice to succeed retiring Justice Lewis Powell Jr

Hijacking the Global Economy In it Naim describes an international black market in which illegal arms drugs and knockoff goods trade across the globe  Previously Naim served as Venezuelas minister of trade and industry where he helped institute reforms in the early 1990s He also has worked with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the World Bank Read the First Chapter of  Illicit Chapter 1 THE WARS WE ARE LOSING The famous former United States president for eight years the most powerful man on earth was born in a small country town blessed with very good feng shui As an adolescent struggling to excel in spite of his modest rural circumstances he admired the ambition of Gu Yanwu who said we should walk 10000 miles and read 10000 books Often during his political career he sought wisdom and guidance in the sayings of Chairman Mao As for the starstruck young intern with whom he had an affair that nearly destroyed his presidency he had this to say She was very fat The Chinese version of Bill Clintons autobiography My Life that hit the streets in July 2004 months before the official licensed translation was obviously a grotesque forgery Its appearance served as a welcome of sorts introducing the former president to one of the more dubious honors of modern writerly fame In Colombia for instance an entire cottage industry specializes in unlicensed copies of the works of the countrys great novelist Gabriel Garca Mrquez In 2004 a master copy of the Nobel Prize winners first novel in ten years vanished without a trace from the printing press Days later a pirate edition could be found on Bogot sidewalks its text accurate but for the final revisions that Garca Mrquez a perfectionist had been waiting until the last moment to turn in Laughable as they may seem little separates these scams from others with far more dire consequences The same knockoff markets sell not only bootleg books and DVDs but pirated Microsoft and Adobe software not only faux Gucci and Chanel accessories but bogus brandname machinery made with substandard parts that can cause industrial accidents not only placebo Viagra for gullible mailorder shoppers but also expired or adulterated medicines that dont cure but kill In defiance of regulations and taxes treaties and laws virtually anything of value is offered for sale in todays global marketplace  including illegal drugs endangered species human chattel for sex slavery and sweatshops human cadavers and live organs for transplant machine guns and rocket launchers and centrifuges and precursor chemicals used in nuclear weapons development This trade is illicit trade It is trade that breaks the rules  the laws regulations licenses taxes embargos and all the procedures that nations employ to organize commerce protect their citizens raise revenues and enforce moral codes It includes purchases and sales that are strictly illegal everywhere and others that may be illegal in some countries and accepted in others Illicit trade is highly disruptive of course to legitimate businesses  except when it isnt For as we shall see there is an enormous gray area between legal and illegal transactions a gray area that the illicit traders have turned to great advantage The marketing and distribution channels that transport all this contraband  and the financial circuits that move the hundreds of billions of dollars that it generates every year  arent exactly hidden from view Some of the physical marketplaces can even be looked up in tourist guides to the worlds great cities Silk Alley in Beijing Charoen Krung Road in Bangkok Canal Street in New York City Others like the arms and drugs bazaar town of Dara Adam Khel in northwest Pakistan or the multiproduct trafficking and moneylaundering center of Ciudad del Este in Paraguay serving the Argentine and Brazilian markets arent exactly leisure spots but are no less widely known Factories in the Philippines or China that produce licensed manufactured goods may run unauthorized second shifts with shoddy components Shipments of methamphetamine and bootleg videos and nightvision military goggles often travel in the same containers and cargo holds as loads of semiconductors and frozen fish and grapefruit The proceeds of illicit trade merge with the greatest of ease into the vast daily flow of interbank settlements and Western Union money transfers And the Internet not only boosts the speed and efficiency of all of these trades but expands the possibilities by for instance hosting online markets for prostitutes from Moldova and Ukraine destined for shipment to markets in Britain France Germany Japan and the United States Neither are those who benefit from illicit trade always careful to hide in the shadows Many exercise their trade in the open daring authorities to crack down on them  or inviting them to collude In Thailand a massage parlor operator ran for public office in 2003 on a platform of criticizing the police  in effect running to defend his own interests in the trade in human beings while tapping into broader public discontent In neighboring Cambodia the national police are partners with international watchdogs in cracking down on the traffic in children for sex but the local units collect payment envelopes from known traffickers in full public view Illicit traders may have forsaken grand hubristic gestures  Pablo Escobar Gaviria the famed drug kingpin in his heyday offered to pay up Colombias entire national debt  but they have grown sophisticated in forming front companies with complex financial structures spanning numerous countries blurring their traces so well that they can safely operate in the open Which means that not only is illicit trade on the rise but its interplay with social crisis  conflict corruption exploitation  is more complex than it has been since the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade THREE ILLUSIONS Yet in the face of all the evidence at least three grand illusions persist in the way we  the public and the politicians in whom we place our trust  address global illicit trade First is the illusion that there is nothing new Illicit trade is ageold a continuous facet and side effect of market economies or of commerce in general Illicit trades ancestor smuggling traces back to ancient times and many a thieves market survives in the worlds commercial hubs Therefore skeptics would argue that since smuggling has always been more a nuisance than a scourge it is a threat we can learn to live with as we have always done But this skepticism ignores the important transformations of the 1990s Changes in political and economic life along with revolutionary technologies in the hands of civilians have dissolved the sealants that governments traditionally relied on to secure their national borders At the same time the marketoriented economic reforms that swept the world in the 1990s boosted incentives to break through these sealants  legally or otherwise Not only did the hold of governments on borders weaken but the reforms amplified the rewards awaiting those who were prepared to break the rules Technology enlarged the market not just geographically by lowering transport costs but also by making possible the trade in a whole range of goods that didnt exist before such as pirated software or genetically modified marijuana New technologies also made it possible to trade internationally products that in the past were hard or impossible to transport or hold in inventory  human kidneys for instance Markets of course were also enlarged when governments deregulated previously closed or tightly controlled economies and allowed foreigners to visit trade and invest more freely The massive transfer of goods and equipment once under the exclusive control of national armies into private hands released into the market products ranging from rocket launchers to SCUD missiles and nuclear designs and machinery Moreover governments also boosted illicit trade by criminalizing new activities File sharing through the internet for example is a newly illegal activity that has added millions to the ranks of illicit traders A clue to the explosion of illicit trade is the relentless rise of money laundering Eventually every illicit line of business generates money that needs to be laundered And there is ample evidence that despite all the precautions and enforcement measures now in place there is more and more dirty money floating in the international financial system now than ever before Yet until now with the exception of narcotics illicit trade has simply not been a priority in international law and treaty making or in international police work and cooperative law enforcement The United Nations devised common language to describe it only in the year 2000 and most countries have a long way to go in adapting their laws to international standards let alone enforcing them It took the advent of software piracy and the birth of intellectual property crime to add a fillip to international efforts against counterfeiting And trafficking in persons  the most morally outrageous of all the forms of illicit trade  was defined in the 1990s only by academics and activists and made the subject of a specific comprehensive law in the United States in 2000 Only seventeen other countries have done the same The second illusion is that illicit trade is just about crime It is true that criminal activities surged and became global in the 1990s But thinking about international illicit trade as just another manifestation of criminal behavior misses a larger more consequential point Global criminal activities are transforming the international system upending the rules creating new players and reconfiguring power in international politics and economics The United States attacked Iraq because it feared that Saddam Hussein had acquired weapons of mass destruction But during the same time a stealthy network led by A Q Khan a Pakistani engineer was profiting by selling nuclear bombmaking technology to whoever could pay for it Throughout the twentieth century to the extent that governments paid attention to illicit trade at all they framed it  to their public and to themselves  as the work of criminal organizations Consciously or not investigators around the world took the model of the American and Sicilian Mafia as their blueprint Propelled by this mindset the search for traffickers  almost always in drugs  led to what investigators thought could be only corporatelike organizations structured disciplined and hierarchical The Colombian cartels Chinese tongs Hong Kong triads Japanese yakuza and eventually after 1989 the Russian mafiya were all approached this way first as criminal organizations only later as traders In most countries the laws employed to prosecute illicit traders remain those born of the fight against organized crime like the racketeering and corrupt organizations RICO statutes in the United States Only recently has this mindset began to shift Thanks to alQaeda the world now knows what a network of highly motivated individuals owing allegiance to no nation and empowered by globalization can do The problem is that the world still thinks of these networks mostly in terms of terrorism Yet as the pages ahead show profit can be as powerful a motivator as God Networks of stateless traders in illicit goods are changing the world as much as terrorists are  probably more But a world obsessed with terrorists has not yet taken notice The third illusion is the idea that illicit trade is an underground phenomenon Even accepting that trafficking has grown in volume and complexity many  not least politicians  seek to relegate it to a different world than that of ordinary honest citizens and constituents The language we use to describe illicit trade and to frame our efforts to contain it betrays the enduring power of this illusion The word offshore  as in offshore finance  vividly captures this sense that illicit trade takes place somewhere else So does black market or the supposedly clearly distinct clean and dirty money All signify a clarity an ability to draw moral and economic lines and patrol their boundaries that is confounded in practice This is the most dangerous of all these illusions because it treads on moral grounds and arguably lulls citizens  and hence public opinion  into a sense of heightened righteousness and false security This point is not about moral relativism A thief is a thief But how do you describe a woman who manages to provide some material wellbeing to her destitute family in Albania or Nigeria by entering another country illegally and working the streets as a prostitute or as a peddler of counterfeited goods What about bankers in Manhattan or London who take home big yearend bonuses as a reward for having stocked their banks vaults with the deposits of highnet worth individuals whose only known job has been with a government in another country Many American highschoolers can procure a joint of marijuana more easily than they can purchase a bottle of vodka or a pack of cigarettes and they know they dont really run any major risk in doing so Meanwhile honest Colombian judges or police officers are routinely gunned down in a war on drugs that the US government funds to the tune of 40 billion a year These are not just infuriating contradictions unfair double standards or interesting paradoxes They are powerful clues about how ageold human mores have acquired new hues ELUSIVE AND POWERFUL Since the early 1990s global illicit trade has embarked on a great mutation It is the same mutation as that of international terrorist organizations like alQaeda or Islamic Jihad  or for that matter of activists for the global good like the environmental movement or the World Social Forum All have moved away from fixed hierarchies and toward decentralized networks away from controlling leaders and toward multiple loosely linked dispersed agents and cells away from rigid lines of control and exchange and toward constantly shifting transactions as opportunities dictate It is a mutation that governments in the 1990s barely recognized and could not in any case hope to emulate The worlds first unmistakable glimpse of this transformation came on September 11 2001 Politicians would later say that on that day the world changed It might be more apt to say that on that day something about the world was revealed  at the very least the incredible power now residing in the hands of an entirely new kind of international entity inherently stateless and deeply elusive As subsequent events demonstrated even experts disagreed as to what they were observing and what it might have to do with specific states and regimes Left unchecked illicit trade can only pursue its already well advanced mutation There is ample evidence that it offers terrorists and other miscreants means of survival and methods of financial transfer and exchange Its effect on geopolitics will go further In developing countries and those in transition from communism criminal networks often constitute the most powerful vested interests confronting the government In some countries their resources and capabilities even surpass those of their governments These capabilities often translate into political clout Traffickers and their associates control political parties own significant media operations or are the major philanthropists behind nongovernmental organizations This is a natural outcome in countries where no economic activity can match illicit trade in size or profits and therefore traffickers become the nations big business And once their business becomes large and stable trafficking networks do as big businesses are prone to do everywhere else diversify into other businesses and invest in politics After all gaining access and influence and seeking government protection has always been part and parcel of big business Therefore not only are illicit networks tightly intertwined with licit private sector activities but they are also deeply embedded within the public sector and the political system And once they have spread into licit private corporations political parties parliaments local governments media groups the courts the military and the nonprofit sector trafficking networks assume a powerful  and in some countries unrivalled  influence on matters of state  Excerpted from  Illicit by Moises Naim Copyright  2005 by Moises Naim Excerpted by

repeatedly called the Casey decision a precedent entitled to respect but he resisted persistent efforts by Democrats to go further Republican senators said they were satisfied with the noncommittal stance In the second day of an expected weeklong confirmation hearing Roberts withstood eight hours of questions from 16 of the committees 18 members in generally good spirits He raised his voice only a few times  when Democrats pressed him on memos written while working as a lawyer in the Reagan administration in the 1980s Nominated to be the 17th chief justice of the United States Roberts summarized Supreme Court decisions nearly flawlessly while also declining to give his personal opinion of most of the more recent cases Supporters praised his performance Judge Roberts did a very good job today said Leonard Leo executive director of the Federalist Society who has played a key role in promoting Roberts among conservative groups Liberal interest groups were more critical Ralph Neas president of People for the American Way which opposes the nomination said Roberts had been totally evasive on the standA Right to PrivacyRoberts repeatedly expressed his view that Americans have a right to privacy He indicated that he agrees with Supreme Court precedents dating from the 1920s that recognize a right to privacy even though the phrase is not found in the Constitution And he specifically agreed with the result in a landmark 1965 decision Griswold v Connecticut The decision struck down a law banning the use of contraception by married couples and later formed a basis for the Roe v Wade decision The right to privacy is protected in the Constitution in various ways Roberts said Summarizing Supreme Court decisions over the past 80 years Roberts said they recognize that personal privacy is a component of liberty protected under the Due Process ClauseSo as to leave no doubt when Sen Dianne Feinstein DCA described privacy as an implied right under the Constitution Roberts signaled a stronger view I do not regard it necessarily as an implied right Roberts said The privacy issue had been one of the major lines of criticism by groups opposing President Bushs nomination of Roberts as chief justice After Roberts testimony on Tuesday one of the Democratic senators who had been most critical of Roberts  New Yorks Charles Schumer  said he was pleasantly surprised by his answersBut the issue may not go away entirely Roberts declined to answer Feinsteins question on how to apply the right to beginning of life or end of life decisions saying those were issues that are coming before the Court in both respectsA Question of Precedent Roberts was also less than clearcut in answering questions about the Supreme Courts abortion rights precedents He repeatedly acknowledged the importance of respecting past rulings  the legal doctrine known by the Latin phrase stare decisis  without directly answering whether he might vote to overrule either abortion decisionAfter noting that Casey had reaffirmed Roes central holding Roberts said the ruling is a precedent of the court that is entitled to respect under the principles of stare decisisWhile acknowledging that precedents are sometimes overturned Roberts added It is a jolt to the legal system to overrule a precedent But to Democratic senators Roberts refused to go further And he agreed with Republican senators who suggested he had made no commitment one way or another I tried as scrupulously as possible to avoid making any commitment about any case that may come before the court he saidA Question of FaithSpecter used the abortion issue to touch gingerly on the issue of religion by asking Roberts a practicing Roman Catholic whether your faith would affect opinions on the bench There is nothing in my personal view based on faith or other sources that would prevent me from applying the precedents of the court faithfully in accord with the principles of stare decisis Roberts saidRoberts was later more emphatic in denying any role for religion in deciding cases My faith and my religious beliefs do not play a role in my judging Roberts said I look to the law he continued I do not look to the Bible or other religious booksTorture and Civil RightsThe committees ranking Democrat Patrick Leahy of Vermont focused his opening questions on a recent Bush administration memo claiming the presidents power to authorize use of torture if national security required Roberts distanced himself from the policyI believe that no one is above the law under our system and that includes the president Roberts said The president is fully bound by the lawRoberts also distanced himself from a passage in a book by Rehnquist suggesting a relaxed attitude toward civil liberties during wartime The Bill of Rights remains the same Roberts said The obligation of the court to protect those liberties in time of peace in time of war in times of stress in time of calm is not changedIn subsequent questioning by Sen Edward M Kennedy DMA Roberts avoided any criticism of civil rights legislation passed by Congress in the 1980s but he defended his role in the Reagan administration in arguing for narrower measures It was my job to articulate the views of the administration he saidRoberts also spoke out strongly against gender discrimination while minimizing the significance of an earlier memo referring to the issue as a perceived problem Of course gender discrimination is a particular problem Roberts told Sen Joseph Biden DDE Its a particular concern of mine and always has been After noting that his three sisters and his wife all work outside the home Roberts added I have a young daughter who I hope will have all the opportunities open to her without regard to gender discriminationInternational Law at IssueRoberts took the conservative side in an ongoing debate among the justices  and between opposing interest groups  on the use of foreign and international law in interpreting provisions of the US Constitution Justice Antonin Scalia has strongly criticized the practice which a majority of justices have endorsed in recent decisions that prohibited executing juveniles and struck down laws banning gay sexRoberts cited a couple of things that give me concern about the practice First he said as a matter of democratic theory it is questionable to rely on a decision by a foreign judge because no president accountable to the people appointed that judge no Senate accountable to the people confirmed that judgeSecond Roberts said looking to foreign law expands the discretion of a judge Relying on foreign precedents doesnt confine judges Roberts said In foreign law you can find anything you wantPressing The Commerce Clause and Court TVSenators on both sides of the aisle pressed Roberts for his view of Rehnquist Court decisions limiting Congresss powers over interstate commerce In two decisions authored by Rehnquist the court struck down a law banning guns near schools and a separate statute allowing victims of gendermotivated violence to sue their assailants in federal courtsSchumer pressed Roberts to endorse an earlier court decision Wickard v Filburn 1942 that took a broader view of Congresss commerce powers Roberts declined noting that the validity of the decision had been argued during the courts recent term in a case involving Californias medical marijuana law But he also said later Rehnquist Court decisions had been more deferential to Congresss powersOn other issues Roberts said he had no settled view on televising Supreme Court proceedings but he acknowledged that some of the justices have particular views on the subject Several justices are strongly opposed to allowing cameras in the courtAt The End of the DayRoberts also showed traces of humor at times When asked how he would like to be remembered by history he said I would like for them to start by saying He was confirmed He then added I would like to be remembered as a good judgeRoberts resisted ideological labels saying he prefers to be known as a modest judge Specifically asked whether he would be in the mold of Rehnquist Roberts said I will be my own man I hesitate to be put in anyones mold Copyright 2014 NPR,"Thu, 15 Sep 2005 15:59:00 -0400",drugs
NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4529632&ft=3&f=,Chief Justice William H Rehnquist who served on the Supreme Court for 33 years 18 of them as Chief Justice died Saturday at his home He was 80 and had suffered from thyroid cancerAt the end of 1971 Rehnquist was thrust into the national spotlight when President Richard Nixon appointed him to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan II Despite strong objections from liberal and labor leaders over his civil rights record he joined the Court on January 7 1972 When the Chief Justice Warren Burger announced his resignation in 1986 President Ronald Reagan nominated Rehnquist to replace him Once again liberal politicians such as Edward M Kennedy strongly opposed his nomination and criticized his record on race and civil rights Despite the objections the Senate confirmed Rehnquist as Chief Jusice on September 26 1986 The lifelong conservative then set about charting a new course for the former Warren Court  William Hubbs Rehnquist was born on October 1 1924 into a welltodo Republican family in Milwaukee Wisc He grew up in the affluent suburb of Shorewood attending public schools there His father William Benjamin was a paper salesman and a firstgeneration American of Swedish descent His mother Margery Peck spoke five languages and graduated from the University of Wisconsin His parents held great respect for Republican leaders such as President Herbert Hoover and their conservative views had a lasting impact on their son  When the United States entered World War II Rehnquist was attending Kenyon College in Ohio on a scholarship He left college and joined the Army Air Corps serving as a weather observer in North Africa from 1943 to 1946 After the war he resumed his studies earning four degrees in quick succession With assistance from the GI Bill he attended Stanford University graduating in 1948 with a bachelor of arts Phi Beta Kappa and a masters degree in political science He earned a second masters degree from Harvard University Rehnquist then enrolled at Stanford Law School where he was well known among his professors and classmates as brilliant and staunchly conservative He graduated first in his class in 1952 His classmate Sandra Day OConnor graduated third After a Supreme Court clerkship with justice Robert Jackson he married Natalie Cornell a fellow Stanford student in 1953 They settled in Phoenix Arizona and had three children  James Janet and Nancy In Arizona Rehnquist began practicing law and associating himself with conservative and Republican causes His Republican party connections led him to Washington in 1969 where he joined the Nixon White House as assistant attorney general for the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel  From there he quickly ascended to the nations highest courtDuring his early years on the Court Rehnquist was often the lone conservative dissenter He dissented in religious cases states rights cases womens rights cases civil rights cases and death penalty cases  So frequently was he the lone dissenter that his law clerks once presented him with a small Lone Ranger dollLater as Chief Justice he became the architect of conservative consensus Nowhere is his impact more apparent than in the area of federal versus state power  In the 1970s and early 1980s Rehnquist repeatedly failed to persuade other justices that state sovereignty could trump federal congressional power  By the 1990s however he had a fivejustice majority that regularly struck down federal laws for stepping on states rights His conservative majority struck down more federal laws than any court in memory and liberals came to level the same criticism that conservative critics used to direct the liberal Warren court  the criticism of judicial activismIn a number of areas Rehnquist a Lutheran achieved by court decision what conservatives were not able to achieve in Congress  He led a movement to speed the death penalty He managed to cut back dramatically on affirmative action though he lost the battle on college admissions  He also chipped away significantly at the rigid wall of separation between church and state erected by earlier liberal courts Although he did not succeed in overturning Roe v Wade which he had opposed in 1973 he managed to make it easier for states to erect hurdles to abortion Rehnquist presided over several pivotal historic cases namely President Bill Clintons 1999 impeachment and the high courts decisive ruling in the disputed 2000 presidential election between George W Bush and then Vice President Al Gore For a time the fivetofour decision tarnished the reputation of the Court as an apolitical institution In response Rehnquist who cast the tiebreaking vote and some of his fellow justices went out of their way in rare public remarks to portray the decision as based on the law and unaffected by politicsRehnquist was credited with being a highly effective manager of the Court who used humor to build good working relationships among the Justices He was an enthusiastic fan of Gilbert and Sullivans musicals In 1994 he added gold stripes to his traditional black robe after seeing a production of their operetta Iolanthe see NPR related story link He was a student of history particularly of the Supreme Court and wrote several books about it For many years he left Washington and spent his summers in Vermont Chief Justice Rehnquist made his last official public appearance on January 20 2005 when he swore in President George W Bush to his second term as president Prior to that he had been absent from the Court since late October 2004 when his cancer was diagnosed Rehnquist is survived by his three children Copyright 2014 NPR,"Thu, 15 Sep 2005 15:59:00
