recreational marijuana named Space Needle at Sea of Green Farms in Seattle Workers at the grower the first business licensed to grow recreational marijuana in Washington state worked all weekend to have supplies ready for stores that were expected to be granted sale licenses on Monday the day before the first day of legal recreational pot sales in Washington stateAP SEATTLE  Washington state issued its first retail marijuana licenses Monday with a middleofthenight email alerting blearyeyed potshop proprietors that theyll finally be able to open for business Were pretty stoked said John Evich an investor in Bellinghams Top Shelf Cannabis in a 230 am Pacific time interview with The Associated Press We havent had any sleep in a long time but were excited for the next step     Randy Simmons the state Liquor Control Boards project manager for legal marijuana said Sunday night that the first two dozen stores were being notified so early to give them an extra few hours to get cannabis on their shelves before they are allowed to open their doors at 8 am Tuesday The store openings are expected to be accompanied by high prices shortages and celebration The state licensed 14 stores in western Washington and 10 in eastern Washington Spokane has three stores Vancouver Tacoma and Bellingham each have two Seattle and the other cities on the list have one each The issuance of the retail licenses marked a major step thats been 20 months in the making Washington and Colorado stunned much of the world by voting in November 2012 to legalize marijuana for adults over 21 and to create statelicensed systems for growing selling and taxing the pot Sales began in Colorado on Jan 1 It remained unclear how many of the potshops being licensed in Washington planned to open on Tuesday Officials eventually expect to have more than 300 recreational pot shops across the state At Cannabis City which will be the first and for now only recreational marijuana shop in Seattle owner James Lathrop worked into the night Sunday placing noparking signs in front of his building hoisting a grandopening banner and hanging artwork before he turned his attention to his email  and the official notification that he was a licensed marijuana dealer Ive had a long day It really hasnt sunk in yet he said early Monday He planned to hold off on opening his store until noon on Tuesday Know your audience Were talking stoners here he said Id be mean to say they need to get up at 5 am to get in line With the emailed notifications in hand the shops immediately worked to place their orders with some of the states first licensed growers As soon as the orders were received via stateapproved software for tracking the barcoded pot the growers could place the product in a required 24hour quarantine before shipping it early Tuesday morning The final days before sales have been frenetic for growers and retailers alike Lathrop and his team hired an events company to provide crowd control arranged for a food truck and free water for those who might spend hours waiting outside and rented a portable toilet to keep his customers from burdening nearby businesses with requests to use the restrooms At Nine Point Growth Industries a marijuana grower in Bremerton owner Gregory Stewart said he and his director celebrated after they worked through some glitches in the pottracking software early Monday and officially learned theyd be able to transport their weed 24 hours later at 222 am Tuesday Its the middle of the night and were standing here doing highfives and our version of a happy dance he said Its huge for us Pot prices were expected to reach 25 a gram or higher on the first day of sales  twice what people pay in the states unregulated medical marijuana dispensaries That was largely due to the short supply of legally produced pot in the state Although more than 2600 people applied to become licensed growers fewer than 100 have been approved  and only about a dozen were ready to harvest by early this month Nevertheless Evich said his shop in Bellingham wanted to thank the states residents for voting for the law by offering 10 grams of one cannabis strain to the first 50 or 100 customers The other strains would be priced between 12 and 25 he said The store will be open at 8 am Tuesday he said but work remained trimming the bathroom door cleaning the floors wiping dust off the walls and of course stocking the shelves In Seattle among those who planned to buy some of the first pot at Cannabis City was Alison Holcomb the lawyer who drafted Washingtons law She said it was a good opportunity to remind people of the bigpicture arguments for ending nearly a century of prohibition and displacing the black market including keeping nonviolent adult marijuana users out of jail redirecting profits away from criminal groups and ending racial disparities in who gets busted No one thought legalization could happen in our lifetime she said I think this is going to be a little overwhelming for me,2014-07-07T18:04-04:00,drugs

San Miguel de Allende a city in the central state of Guanajuato that is a popular enclave for artists and foreigners AP Photo Mexicos Attorney Generals Office MEXICO CITY  Military special forces grabbed alleged cartel leader Hector Beltran Leyva during a lightning raid at a restaurant Wednesday the latest in a string of highprofile drug arrests in the country Officials said the purported head of the Beltran Leyva drug gang was captured inside a seafood eatery in the city of San Miguel de Allende a popular enclave for foreigners and artists in the central state of Guanajuato     No shots were fired in the brief operation which culminated an 11month investigation federal criminal investigations chief Tomas Zeron said at an evening news conference The arrest comes just months after the capture of Joaquin El Chapo Guzman the elusive boss of the Sinaloa cartel which is considered the most powerful drug gang in Mexico He was caught in February after more than a decade on the run following his escape from prison Mexican authorities say Hector Beltran Leyva 49 assumed leadership of the Beltran Leyva cartel after his brother Arturo was killed by Mexican troops in a shootout in late 2009 Two other brothers are behind bars for their involvement in the cartel The gang terrorized parts of central Mexico for years including Morelos state to the south of Mexico City although it declined somewhat after the brothers arrests and killing Last November the US Treasury Department said the cartel appeared to be reorganizing and regaining some power Obviously this is not the Beltran Leyvas organization in its strongest moment  but it continues to be a criminal organization capable of generating localized violence in some states Mexican security expert Jorge Chabat said Zeron said Beltran Leyva had adopted a moderate profile after becoming head of the cartel to avoid detection The investigation determined he had made his home in the central state of Queretaro where he passed himself off as a businessman selling art and real estate He was tracked to San Miguel de Allende and taken into custody along with a man suspected of being involved of the cartels finances Two federal officials told The Associated Press earlier that Beltran Leyva was believed to have been caught but DNA tests were being done to confirm it Zeron said those results were still forthcoming but said it was clear the man was Beltran Leyva He did not take questions This action proves the effectiveness of the public policy of security and law enforcement to achieve the Mexico at peace that we desire President Enrique Pena Nietos verified Twitter account said late Wednesday Zeron said the investigation was carried out jointly by various security agencies but the arrest was made by the army an institution that has come under criticism recently for the June killing of 22 suspected gang members in a town south of Mexico City According to the US State Department Beltran Leyva alias The H and The Engineer was born Feb 16 1965 in the northern Mexican state of Sinaloa a cradle of drug trafficking He has been indicted in courts in the District of Columbia and New York US authorities have offered a reward of up to 5 million for information leading to his capture and Mexico had offered its own bounty of 30 million pesos about 37 million US and Mexican authorities say the Beltran Leyva gang is responsible for trafficking drugs to the United States and Europe including cocaine marijuana heroin and methamphetamine It was originally part of Guzmans Sinaloa cartel but broke with that group in 2008 In August 2012 a US diplomatic car carrying two CIA officials and a Mexican navy captain was attacked by gunmen in Morelos state and one line of investigation was possible involvement by the Beltran Leyva cartel Federal Police officers were ultimately found responsible for the attack and officials recently said there was no evidence they were acting on orders of a criminal gang At least nine top Mexican cartel figures have been captured or killed since 2009 including Guzman who was nabbed in the Pacific Coast resort of Mazatlan In 2013 authorities in northern Mexico arrested Miguel Angel Trevino Morales alias Z40 leader of the brutal Zetas cartel Fellow Zetas leader and founder Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano alias El Lazca was killed by marines the previous year Andrew Selee a Mexico expert at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington said the Beltran Leyva cartel established a pattern of extreme brutality that has since become the hallmark of other gangs such as the Zetas Its a huge deal to get Hector Beltran Leyva who took over the most bloodthirsty cartel in Mexico The Beltran Leyva organization was known for corrupting the upper ranks of government and terrorizing communities Selee said Following on the capture of El Chapo Guzman and Miguel Trevino this is probably the most elusive figure who has still been at large,2014-10-02T03:00-04:00,drugs

With a difficult Senate map a weak field of candidates and an unpopular president 2014 was never going to be fun for Democrats But having to make their closing argument amid an Ebola outbreak and terror attacks Thats just a disaster It didnt have to be so but as this weeks Pew poll shows the two parties have reverted to their traditional roles in the minds of the electorate Republicans as the party of hard power and Democrats as the party of soft power And the timing couldnt be worse for the blue team

Always Election Day Early voting beginsSaturday in Florida

Same as it ever was  We saw signs of this in 2012 when exit polls showed Republican nominee Mitt Romney beating President Obama on key issues including handling of the economy But in those days Democrats still had the edge on national security questions No more While Democrats are viewed more positively than Republicans in the Pew survey and other polls Republicans win on the issues including terrorism foreign policy and  whoa  immigration Dems take the lead as they traditionally have on issues like womens health education and health care Sounds like the return of the mommy party and the daddy party

Showbiz  Noonan Everyone said expectations were too high in 08 with all the charisma and Greek columns Maybe the real story is that more than anyone else more than his supporters the president believed his own showbiz

Koch for Romney  The goal for Democrats this cycle was to localize the battle for control of the Senate by decoupling individual races from the national discussion Knowing that voters would be in a mood to hem in the president after an unhappy start to his second term Democrats did not work to make a case for why they should retain the Senate Instead they focused on why individual Republicans were not acceptable candidates mostly by dint of the fact that industrialist brothers Charles and David Koch supported their candidacies Obama beat Romney by making him the villain Democrats planned to do the same thing via the Kochs suppress potential proGOP turnout by focusing on cronyism and corruption in attack ads Meanwhile Democrats have been focused on juicing base turnout with threats of impeachment and worse And it has worked in some races especially Georgia and North Carolina But it has failed in general mainly because the rest of the world has not cooperated with the plan

Obamas determined detachment conveys the feeling that nobodys home No one leading Not even from behind  Charles Krauthammer in his weekly syndicated column

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/08/19/why-is-new-york-times-pushing-pot/," The legalizepot bandwagon has a new conductor With the singlemindedness of Hillary Clinton seeking the Oval Office the New York Times is pushing for legalization of marijuana The paper has published no fewer than eight editorials or opeds approving speedy decriminalization of pot in just the past few weeks Whats it all about

Let us dismiss conjecture that the Times is gunning for a Public Service Pulitzer which they have not won for a decade Instead two thoughts occur  First the Times may view decriminalizing marijuana as the next great progressive wave following on the heels of samesex marriage and in earlier years abortion rights A smaller wave to be sure but one that liberals and libertarians can ride with enthusiasm     A second reason may be more compelling  the Times needs to build its online circulation to survive What better way than to embrace a cause especially popular with Millenials the prime readers of news online and not a group especially excited about the Grey Lady The Times enthusiasm for legal pot knows no bounds and entertains few doubts Except in their own organization which reportedly drugtests job applicants and rejects those testing positive for pot Which is remarkable since most people well versed in the subject acknowledge serious risks associated with habitual ingestion of marijuana In fact a coalition of groups opposed to legalization  including The American Society of Addiction Medicine The National Association of Drug Court Professionals and the National Families in Action  ran a fullpage ad in the Times countering the papers position That might give them pause but no The Times has trampled most objections with breezy assertions unbecoming a serious news organization For instance We believe that the evidence is overwhelming that addiction and dependence are relatively minor problems And yet the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health reports that of the 73 million persons aged 12 or older classified with illicit drug dependence or abuse in 2012 43 million persons had marijuana dependence or abuse So not so minor after all Claims that marijuana is a gateway to more dangerous drugs are as fanciful as the Reefer Madness images of murder rape and suicide The Foundation for a Drugfree World notes on their website The vast majority of cocaine users 999 began by first using a gateway drug like marijuana cigarettes or alcohol Larry Kudlow who has successfully battled drug addiction for over a decade reports that I hear time and again from young people coming into the rooms to get sober how pot smoking led to harder drugs such as cocaine and heroin There are legitimate concerns about marijuana on the development of adolescent brains For that reason we advocate the prohibition of sales to people under 21 Yes there are now numerous studies indicating that regular ingestion of marijuana by young people leads to an irreversible reduction in IQ as well as memory problems and possible serious brain disorders like schizophrenia According to the American Medical Association Heavy cannabis use in adolescence causes persistent impairments in neurocognitive performance and IQ and use is associated with increased rates of anxiety mood and psychotic thought disorders Even proweed zealots would have a hard time arguing that legalizing pot will not increase its use by young people even if it is still illegal for minors The National Survey of Drug Use and Health the source of most druguse data in the US notes One factor that can influence whether youths will use tobacco alcohol or illicit drugs is the extent to which they believe these substances might cause them harm If Mom is smoking a joint while watching TV after dinner what kind of message does that send For the Times pot legalization is also worthy since enforcement of our laws is racist falling disproportionately on young black men ruining their lives and creating new generations of career criminals  The paper maintains leaning on a report prepared by the ACLU that blacks and whites use pot at the same rate but that blacks are 37 times more likely than whites to be arrested for possession But the Times admits that only about one percent of the people behind bars in our country are there for charges relating to possessing or selling marijuana  As other have noted if todays sentencing guidelines need to be changed lets do so Altering how we enforce the laws is a different debate than whether the law should be eliminated Why is the New York Times putting themselves in the midst of this debate Because like many other newspapers the Times is in trouble  Recent results have been depressed by large investments in strategic initiatives like its struggle to build its online presence CEO Mark Thompson commenting on the last quarter said We also know that longterm digital revenue growth depends on the reach and depth of engagement of our digital audience Who is that audience Certainly not Boomers who still read papers Its the 77 million Millenials about the same number as Boomers who catch up on current events via iPhone or iPad  and not typically from the New York Times They migrate to sites like Vice Mashable and BuzzFeed or explainer sites like Vox and FiveThirtyEight There are also aggregators attempting to make news more fun to read  like theSkimm and those offering a crowdsourced component like Mic Some of these specifically target Millenials and have upended conventional thinking about news gathering The Grey Lady a nickname they may want to ditch is struggling to compete BuzzFeed for instance is now valued at 850 million or about half the market cap of the New York Times has 550 employees is expanding overseas and has been adding aggressively to their news staff No one can know who the winners will be in the tumultuous media shakeup thats underway but the Times for sure needs to broaden its readership and needs Millenials Jumping into the middle of an issue this group cares about  like pot  makes sense According to Pew 69 of Millenials support legalizing weed  more than any other age group Another reason the Times may be positioning themselves to curry favor with Millenials is this those age 18 to 33 tend liberal on social issues but are fiscally conservative and not wedded to the Democrat brand Some 50 of that group considers themselves independents while only 39 of GenX 3449 and 37 of Boomers describe themselves that way  In other words they think for themselves Thats a

NEW POLL DEMS FARING WORSE THAN 2010
Whats the point of generic ballot poll questions After all there are no generic candidates And thats precisely how candidates win in difficult environments in this age of nationalized elections They define their opponents as out of the mainstream and themselves as independent of their own parties But in the closing days of an election such as this one there may be no metric more valuable since it is one of the only insights we have into how latebreaking voters will cast their ballots in close contests If candidates havent succeeded in defining those terms by now especially given the surge in early voting it is unlikely they will be able to And if the late breakers go as the new WaPoABC News poll suggests Democrats will be headed to bed early on Nov 4 while Republicans are uncorking the celebratory champagne The 6point advantage for the GOP among likely voters would be enough to flip several tossup races to Republican candidates and might even be enough to shoo a couple of more elephants into the barn including Scott Brown in New Hampshire

WaPo With multiple crises confronting the country  a majority now says the governments ability to deal with big problems has declined in the past few years Among those who say this more  by 3 to 1  blame President Obama and the Democrats rather than Republicans in Congress

Double double toil and trouble  Struggling with female voters and young voters Democrats fare worse in the latest WaPoABC poll than they did at the same point ahead of the disastrous 2010 election and at the same level as the punishing 1994 midterm elections that cost them both houses of Congress Without any significant increase in Democratic intensity since the previous polling cycle the auguries are getting dire for the presidents party

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/09/15/will-more-states-legalize-marijuana-in-november/, Even more states could vote to legalize marijuana this year as propot advocates look to capitalize on changing voter attitudes to replicate their recent successes in Colorado and Washington state The legalization question is coming before voters in very different areas of the country both politically and geographically  Alaska Oregon and the District of Columbia     But polling indicates the measure stands at least a chance of passing in otherwise conservative Alaska while the ballot initiatives appear to enjoy popular support  at least for now  in Oregon and DC I think they are all going to pass declared Mason Tvert communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project which has contributed over 566000 in funds and services to the effort in Alaska according to state campaign finance records Public support for ending marijuana prohibition is at an alltime high and people can sense that change is inevitable he said Meanwhile Florida voters are also set to weigh in on a measure that would approve medical marijuana But opponents say the proweed forces are just blowing smoke They say practical arguments against legalization are gaining traction and will ultimately keep other states from going the way of Colorado and Washington I think voters are going to be very skeptical with these initiatives said Kevin Sabet cofounder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana SAM which opposes legalization I dont think its going to be the walk in the park prolegalization advocates thought it would be initially Critics say pot in Colorado which went legal in January has not been the panacea proponents want to paint They say tax revenues are lagging in comparison to projections and that theres been plenty of confusion and unanticipated trouble with socalled marijuana edibles and drivers under the influence of pot I think its all leaving a bitter taste in peoples mouths Sabet said Legalization in theory is a lot more pretty than legalization in practice Still an overall change in voters attitudes toward recreational marijuana  58 percent nationwide said they would support a measure legalizing regulating and taxing pot like alcohol in their state in a September Civic Science poll  is making it easier to gather support for new initiatives Proponents point to figures that show teen use of marijuana down albeit slightly since its been legalized in Colorado Recent statistics show that violent crime is down there too There is no buyers remorse Tvert said There is absolutely no evidence that any of the problems that our opponents have predicted have occurred Heres a look at the measures hitting the ballots in November Alaska Measure 2 in Alaska would allow adults over 21 to possess up to an ounce of marijuana and up to six plants The Alcoholic Beverage Control board would be in charge of regulating and taxing it much like in Colorado Observers expect the vote in November to be a squeaker Recent polls have shown the yes and no campaigns trading the lead At the beginning I would have said this wouldve passed in a heartbeat  in Alaska were pretty independent said Kathie Wasserman executive director of the Alaska Conference of Mayors which has passed a resolution opposing it citing concerns with substance abuse But right now the no vote is gaining some traction Oregon The marijuana question first came before voters in 2012 butit failed 5346 percent But Anthony Johnson coauthor of Measure 91 says the new proposal is stronger incorporating aspects of the Colorado and Washington measures including practical restrictions the 2012 initiative did not have This one has a great chance for victory we arent taking anything for granted he said citing poll numbers in favor of legalization at 54 percent a June SurveyUSA poll showed voters favoring the measure by 5141 percent Measure 91 would allow adults 21 and older to possess up to eight ounces and four plants per household The Oregon Liquor Control Commission would regulate its commerce Johnson says a big selling point is what they will do with the tax revenues 40 percent of revenue goes to schools with 35 percent to state and local police and 25 percent to drug addiction services DC Adam Eidinger chairman of the DC Cannabis Campaign said that despite the potential pushback from Capitol Hill which has ultimate say over the Districts governance Measure 71 has great prospects for passing Unlike the others its not a regulatingandtaxing law but it would allow adults over 21 to possess up to two ounces of marijuana and six plants But like the others Eidinger hopes that legalization would help reprioritize law enforcement resources toward more violent crime in the city For too long prosecution of smalltime marijuana possession has targeted mostly minorities he said Why should anyone be harassed at all I dont even think the police like doing it  they have better things to do Both top mayoral candidates  independent David Catania and Democrat Muriel Bowser  have said they support legalization A recent Washington Post poll finds that 63 percent of Washingtonians favor it too FULL MIDTERM COVERAGE,2014-09-15T08:05-04:00,drugs

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/04/23/safety-concerns-about-legal-marijuana-edibles/, Two recent deaths and increased emergency room visits in Colorado have highlighted concerns about the safety of legal marijuana edibles Dr George Sam Wang of Childrens Hospital Colorado says part of the problem is that the effects of edible marijuana begin more slowly than smokeable pot though they tend to last longer     One of the dangers that weve been seeing with adult recreational retail use is theyll take the recommended dose wait feel no effects and then continue to stack doses Then before they know it they have a pretty large amount in their system and then they get potentially pretty severe effects he said Investigators say that appears to be what happened to Levy Thamba a college student from the Republic of Congo who had never tried marijuana before Friends say he ate the recommended dose of onesixth of a marijuanainfused cookie on March 11 When he felt no effects he ate the entire cookie six times the recommended dose He later became irrational and jumped off a hotel balcony to his death In an autopsy report the Denver medical examiner concluded that Thambas death was an accident and listed marijuana intoxication as a contributing factor The edibles industry is huge points out Colorado state representative Jonathan Singer About 40 percent of the marijuana industry is in edibles Edibles are a huge part of our business agrees Jamie Perino owner of Euflora situated on Denvers 16th Street Mall and a popular tourist destination Because theres no place for visitors to come and enjoy smoking recreational marijuana  its illegal to smoke pot in public or in hotels  edibles are probably at least 50 if not on some days 70 percent our sales Edibles range from marijuanainfused mints to candies baked goods and beverages Their popularity seems to have taken everyone  lawmakers health officials and the industry itself by surprise State law requires the products be sold in childproof packaging and labels show the amount of the psychoactive ingredient THC they contain Child resistant packaging has been proven to work Dr Wang says But if you take them out of the child resistant packagingobviously a child isnt going to know the difference between a marijuana containing product and a nonmarijuana containing product and they often dont taste any different Wang says that in 2009 2010 and 2011 combined Childrens Hospital had 14 children come to their ER for marijuana intoxication Last year alone that number rose to eight cases and they have had eight more cases in just the first few months of this year Six of those required admission to critical care Most of the kids are toddlers and symptoms vary depending on the size of the child and the amount of marijuana in their system Symptoms range from sleepiness to where weve had kids actually getting breathing tubes to help them breathe and put on a ventilator Singer is cosponsor of a bill that would require pot edibles to be instantly recognizable even when out of the packaging Whether its a stamp or a symbol or a shape or a universal color there should be something thats easily recognizable to both parents and kids so everyone knows what theyre putting in their mouth Perino and many others in the industry think that is going too far I mean it really is a strong industry and has many strong points and to have it over regulated and have things shut down before its even started would be a sad thing to see he said Perino believes parents need to be responsible for keeping these products away from their kids She also believes much of the concern is overblown due to recent media attention on cases like that of Kristine Kirk who was shot and killed by her husband Richard on April 14 At the time of the shooting Kristine Kirk was on the phone with a 911 operator she had called to report her husband was totally hallucinating Police say Richard Kirk had purchased marijuanainfused candy earlier in the day al he was also taking prescription medication Kirk faces a firstdegree murder charge and the case is still under investigation Its really unfortunate two people have lost their lives Perino says But I think that people have been waiting for something to happen so they can say Oh look how bad marijuana is But lets look at the alcohol related deaths since January 1 in Colorado when recreational marijuana became legal How does that stack up Perino says she and her employees take very seriously the task of educating customers about the effects of marijuana especially the edible kind We recommend ten milligrams to start especially if theyve never done them before We tell them to wait at least 45 minutes if not an hour to see how its going to affect them before they ingest any more Singer one of only two state legislators to publicly endorse legalizing marijuana says education is critical but more needs to be done When you have edibles that are shaped like gummy bears or lollypops or lemon drops we need to make sure there is something clear on there that clearly identifies it as not for child consumption he said He maintains his bill which passed the Colorado House unanimously and is now in the hands of the Senate is also good for the industry If the bill becomes law the states Marijuana Enforcement Division of the Department of Revenue will be tasked with deciding exactly how marijuana edibles will be required to look to make them instantly distinguishable from the products they mimic,2014-04-23T17:11-04:00,drugs

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/10/22/official-michael-brown-autopsy-reportedly-reveals-teen-was-shot-at-close-range/, Michael Brown the 18yearold black man whose fatal shooting by a white police officer in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson in August touched off weeks of raciallycharged rioting had marijuana in his system was initially shot at close range and does not appear to have been killed while running away according to experts who reviewed the official autopsy and toxicology report The documents obtained by the St Louis PostDispatch and analyzed by two experts not directly involved in the case appears to contradict witness accounts that claimed Brown was running away from Police Officer Darren Wilson 28 when he was killed on Aug 9 The new information comes on the heels of reports that Wilson told authorities Brown had reached inside Wilsons police SUV and struggled for his gun resulting in Wilson firing twice hitting Brown once in the hand Moments later and outside of the vehicle Wilson fired the fatal bullets that sparked a national controversy     The newspaper had St Louis medical examiner Dr Michael Graham who is not part of the official investigation review the autopsy report and he determined that it does support that there was a significant altercation at the car including a shot that hit Browns right hand Dr Judy Melinek a forensic pathologist in San Francisco who also reviewed the documents concurred that the autopsy supports the fact that this guy is reaching for the gun and that it did not support claims Brown was shot while running away from Wilson or with his hands up The toxicology test also obtained by the newspaper and performed by a St Louis University laboratory revealed marijuana in Browns blood and urine Alfred Staubus a consultant in forensic toxicology at The Ohio State University College of Pharmacy told the newspaper THC could impair judgment or slow reaction times but that there was no reliable measurement to make those conclusions The detection of THC in the postmortem blood of Michael Brown really indicates his recent use of marijuana within a few hours and that he may or may not have been impaired at the time of his death Staubus said The shots fired outside of the vehicle hit Brown in the forehead upper right arm and twice in the chest Melinek said The fatal shot to the top of Browns head indicates he was falling forward or in a lunging position toward the shooter she said The fact that a sixth shot hit his forearm and traveled from the back of the arm to the inner arm shows Browns palms could not have been facing Wilson as some witnesses have said Melinek said The findings could be at odds with those of a private autopsy arranged by Browns family conducted by former New York City Chief Medical Examiner Michael Baden and made public Aug 18 Baden said none of Browns wounds appeared to have been from shots fired at close range noting a lack of stippling or pattern of tiny blood spatters However Graham told the PostDispatch Sometimes when its really close such as within an inch or so there is no stipple just smoke A third autopsy has been ordered by federal officials as part of their investigation into whether Browns civil rights were violated Results of that one have not been revealed The New York Times citing government officials briefed on the federal civil rights investigation into the matter that while the federal investigation was continuing the evidence so far did not support civil rights charges against Wilson The officials told the Times the forensic evidence supported Wilsons version of events which was that he was trying to leave his vehicle when Brown pushed him back in and sparked the struggle for the gun Surveillance video from a nearby store allegedly showed the 6foot 4inch Brown committing a strongarm robbery minutes before the confrontation stealing a box of cigars from a shopkeeper who he pushed out of his way The PostDispatch citing sources close to the investigation reported that Wilson claims he saw Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson walking down the middle of the street and told them to move to the sidewalk When he noticed Brown holding cigars in his hand Wilson said he realized the pair matched a radio alert about a the robbery moments earlier Wilson claims he put his vehicle in park and tried to get out but Brown slammed the door shut and punched Wilson in the through the open window sparking the struggle for the gun the source told the paper A grand jury has been hearing testimony in the case since Aug 20 but has not yet returned an indictment or a nobill against Wilson If the police officer is not indicted supporters of Brown have vowed to resume demonstrations that began immediately after the shooting and became violent with looting arrests and the imposition of a curfew President Obama consoled Browns family in the immediate aftermath and US Attorney General Eric Holder went to Ferguson and announced a separate federal investigation Click for more from the St Louis PostDispatch,2014-10-22T03:02-04:00,drugs

iconic Wailers reggae group with late superstars Bob Marley and Peter Tosh and fellow Rastafarians have long called for legalization of the drug that they smoke as part of their spiritual worship Now

oddball even dangerous drugaddled cultists AP PhotoDavid McFaddenThe Associated Press KINGSTON Jamaica  Taking a deep draw on a pipe that glows with burning marijuana reggae luminary Bunny Wailer gives a satisfied grin through a haze of aromatic smoke in his concrete yard painted in the red green gold and black colors identified with his Rastafarian faith These days the baritone singer from the legendary Wailers the group he formed in 1963 with late superstars Bob Marley and Peter Tosh has reason to feel good  There is unprecedented traction building in Jamaica to decriminalize pot meaning the dreadlocked Wailer and other adherents of Rastafari   a homegrown spiritual movement that considers the drug divine    may soon be able to smoke without fear of arrest     Rastas have treated marijuana as something legal all along even though we have been sent to prison for using the herb in our prayer But this is the time for all these pressures to stop The world is catching up now the 67yearold threetime Grammy winner said at his modest Kingston home Jamaica is known internationally for its marijuana The hardy plant grows easily on the tropical Caribbean island where its use is culturally entrenched despite being legally banned for 100 years Cultivation is kept hidden with small patches tucked into mountainsides in swamps and between rows of other crops Wailer himself was convicted of possession in 1967 and did more than a year of hard labor Previous moves to decriminalize the drug failed to advance mainly because officials feared they would violate international treaties and bring sanctions from Washington But now with a number of US states relaxing their marijuana laws    Colorado and Washington even allow recreational use    Jamaica is rethinking its position Justice Minister Mark Golding says Jamaicas Cabinet has approved a plan to decriminalize marijuana including for religious purposes and legislators are expected to authorize it before the end of the year Freedom to use marijuana for religious worship is one of various amendments to Jamaicas Dangerous Drugs Act supported by Prime Minister Portia Simpson Millers administration Her ministers also have proposed unclogging courts by decriminalizing small amounts of weed for personal use making possession of 2 ounces or less a ticketable offense The main hope is that a regulated medical marijuana and scientific research sector could help draw investments to the cashstrapped island which is laboring under its latest loan program with the International Monetary Fund Ganja as marijuana is known locally has a long history on the island It was introduced to Jamaica in the 19th century by Indian indentured servants and it gained popularity as a medicinal herb Use spread among the poor in the 1930s with the founding of Rastafari a spiritual movement that melds Old Testament teachings and PanAfricanism and whose followers worship the late Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie Rasta adherents say use of the holy herb induces a meditative state that brings them closer to the divine The faithful smoke it as a sacrament in chalice pipes or cigarettes called spliffs add it to vegetarian stews and place it in fires as a burnt offering For years Rastafarians were treated as secondclass citizens and looked down upon by many Jamaicans as oddball even dangerous drugaddled cultists Police shooting ranges once had images of dreadlocked Rastas as targets The spiritual movement attracts only a small percentage of the countrys mostly Christian population of 27 million It wasnt until the 1970s when the Wailers and other Rasta musicians popularized the Rastafarian culture among betteroff Jamaicans that marijuanas popularity began to filter through the islands rigid class structure and gain a wider acceptance Marleys worldwide popularity has made him Jamaicas most famous and revered son While Rastafari followers tend to disdain government initiatives for many Jamaicas decriminalization plans signal a crucial victory after decades of struggle The momentum building presents a major step forward for the recognition of the religious rights and expression of Rastafari said Anta Anthony Merritt a Rastafarian priest who is a faculty member at San Diego State University Even if the current proposals fall short of the full legalization Rastas long have sought they are welcomed by many said Priest Dermot Fagan leader of a small sect in an isolated commune in the Blue Mountains that tower over Kingston We are thankful for the coming changes and yes some of the pressures will be eased But we cant forget the destruction the mayhem that has been caused by the persecution of this divine herb said Fagan waving his hands for emphasis on a balcony overlooking the School of Vision retreat a place where Rasta mysticism brushes against the realities of modern life Researchers who study the movement are curious about how decriminalization for Rastafari will play out For now there are a lot of unanswered questions Ennis Edmonds an associate professor of religious studies at Ohios Kenyon College whose publications focus on Rastafari said determining what is religious use in Jamaica will not be easy Theres essentially no formal church organized conversion process and few places of communal gathering An individual Rastas personal relationship with Jah or God is considered central to the faith Most ritual smoking does not take place in official places of worship but in peoples yards and on street corners Can a single Rasta smoking a spliff in any location claim religious use privileges Edmonds asked But for Wailer the time is clearly ripe for change in Babylon the unflattering Rasta term for the Western world Rastas have gone through a lot of hassles for years getting criminalized and locked up for using the herb But things are changing because ganja is what the world needs now Wailer said before taking another appreciative toke from his

legalization of marijuana but officials insist theres no drug connection Applications to the University of Colorado are up 30 percent since Amendment 64 made recreational pot legal according to Director of Admissions Kevin MacLennan But while several marijuana advocates told FoxNewscom it is hardly surprising that the Centennial State would become a mecca for collegebound tokers MacLennan disagrees     We arent getting a lot of questions about this MacLennan said referring to the new law He said a better explanation for the rise in applications is increased recruitment at high schools across the country and abroad and the universitys adoption of the Common Application which facilitates students ability to apply to multiple schools around the nation using a single form  Kate Brickley University of Colorado senior from Oakland Calif Colorado College has also seen a rise in applications but Mark Hatch vice president for enrollment said it is part of a longerterm trend This year is no different so there is no evidence that our increase is tied to Amendment 64 Hatch told FoxNewscom in an email Hatch fears the new pot law could actually be a drag on applications as outofstate parents reject the idea of their tuition money going up in smoke But both students and marijuana advocates say graduates looking to experience Rocky Mountain high is not such a bad thing I dont know that students would apply here solely because of the new law but if they were choosing between two comparable schools I could see them choosing University of Colorado because of that said Kathryn Krempasky a 21yearold senior from Denver Kate Brickley a 22yearold senior at University of Colorado from Oakland California agreed Some of the kids Ive talked to back home think its a big deal like Oh my god you can smoke legally she said Parents dont like to admit it but students going off to college to party is hardly new Rachel Gillette executive director of the Colorado chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws NORML said smoking pot in college has an appeal for students similar to drinking I can see how Amendment 64 could be an incentive for some prospective students to apply to college in the State of Colorado Gillette said From a college students perspective we can analogize it to alcohol Young people do appreciate freedom But incoming freshman would be wise to read up on the state law which went into full effect Jan 1 2014 and to learn campus rules as well The law forbids marijuana possession by anyone under 21 and all colleges and universities in the state have policies forbidding use or possession on campus And many localities  including Colorado Springs where Colorado College is located  have banned the sale of marijuana for recreational use In addition to their own codes of conduct Colorado schools are citing the Controlled Substances Act the DrugFree Workplace Act and the DrugFree Schools and Communities Act as federal statutes that prohibit marijuanas use on their campuses In a frequently asked questions section of its website Colorado College also notes that a federal drugrelated conviction could render students ineligible for federal financial aid I have a hard time believing that someone is going to make that kind of significant decision about investing in their education based on whether they can smoke marijuana in the state said Mike Hooker spokesman for Colorado State University located in Fort Collins There may be some water cooler talk about what effect Amendment 64 might have but we believe there are more significant factors that drive enrollment decisions University of Denver has seen an 81 percent increase in the number of applicants over the past five years according to spokesman Will Jones He rejected the idea that the new law played a role but acknowledged the school has gotten calls from parents outside the state who have asked about its pot policy He tells them marijuana is just as forbidden on campus now as it was a year ago Even with passage of Amendment 64 there will be no change in policy Jones said Its not clear what concerns those parents could be expressing however Clearly many parents dont want their kids smoking pot but others may be resigned to it said NORML Executive Director Allen St Pierre In a Hobsons choicetype way parents might be chagrined by their childs marijuana use but still prefer that the child go to school in a state where it is legal as opposed to a state where the child will be punished and face the entire loss of their investment in a college education he said There can be a really cogent argument that it could be an incentive to apply to schools where marijuana use is legal and students are not considered criminals,2014-03-13T08:00-04:00,drugs

up seven Senate seats in Tuesdays elections decidedly shifting the balance of power in Congress to the GOP Republicans are poised to replace Democrats in North Carolina Iowa Montana Colorado Arkansas South Dakota and West Virgina according to Fox News projections Polls suggested Republicans could gain control of the Senate by winning six elections to gain a majority of 51 seats The seventh seat adds emphasis to the GOP victories And there could be another depending on the outcome of a runoff in Louisiana next month Since the GOP was widely expected to maintain its majority in the House of Representatives  and did  the shift in the Senate will leave President Barack Obama  and all of his highest priorities  isolated by a Congress ruled by Republicans in both chambers The question is whether a Republicancontrolled Congress facing off against a secondterm Democratic president will break the political gridlock that has all but stalled important policy decisions in Washington for years leaving much of the electorate deeply frustrated cynical and increasingly disillusioned Peter Cardillo chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital Management said a Republican victory could lead to less gridlock and more probusiness legislation Specifically Cardillo said corporate tax reform and immigration legislation would likely move to the top of a GOP priority list as Democratic efforts to raise the minimum wage get shelved These are all things that could benefit labor markets Cardillo said Some influential voices on Wall Street are skeptical however that a shift in the balance of power in Congress will have much immediate impact on breaking through the longstanding political logjam Whatever the outcome of Tuesdays election no progress is likely to be made on the key issues of corporate tax reform immigration reform or entitlement reform before the 2016 presidential election David Kelly chief global strategist at JP Morgan Funds said This is quite important in the medium term for US investors since without real efforts to increase both labor and capital supply the US economy is likely to run into a significant capacity constraint in the next two years leading to higher inflation and interest rates Kelly added Meanwhile in New Hampshire Fox News is projecting that Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen will beat Republican challenger Scott Brown in one of the more closelywatched races of this election And in Louisiana in another race that could determine the strength of the GOPs Senate majority Fox News is projecting that the Senate race will go to a runoff on December 6 Based on exit polling Fox projects that threeterm Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu and Republican challenger Bill Cassidy will both fail to exceed 50 of the vote tonight so neither can claim an outright win in Louisianas socalled jungle primary Heres a roundup of the Senate flips from Democrat to Republican In North Carolina Fox projects that Thom Tillis a Republican member of the state legislature will oust US Senator Kay Hagan a firstterm Democrat in a closely fought race that saw spending top 100 million Those turnovers are in addition to an earlier pick up in West Virginia where Republican Shelley Moore Capito defeated her Democratic opponent for seat held by Democrats for nearly three decades Candidates and those with a vested interest in the results have spent 4 billion seeking votes a record for a midterm election A WinWin Situation for Stock Markets A call for raising the minimum wage one supported by President Obama and many Democrats is another hot button issue that has yet to be resolved In the shortterm continued gridlock could actually benefit investors because stock markets have been moving higher in recent years despite Washington dysfunction Maintaining the status quo of a dysfunctional Congress would mean the markets would continue to respond solely to economic data and Federal Reserve policy rather than politicallydriven legislation Its a winwin situation for the stock markets Cardillo said Republicans have not controlled the Senate since 2006 ahead of President Obamas election two years later Control of the Senate may not be determined for months however if individual candidates in Louisiana and Georgia fail to collect more than 50 of the vote forcing runoffs in December and January respectively According to the latest polls Democratic incumbents are battling to retain their seats in Alaska Arkansas Louisiana and North Carolina states in which Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney defeated Obama in the 2012 election Given Obamas plummeting approval ratings voters in those states could play a key role in shifting the balance of power in Congress Other incumbent Senators facing tough reelection bids are Colorado Democrat Mark Udall and Republicans Pat Roberts of Kansas and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky who would replace Nevada Democrat Harry Reid as Senate Majority leader if the GOP gains control of Congress upper house McConnell won his election against Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes The only question related to House races was whether and by how much Republicans would increase their majority All 435 seats were at play and a gain of 13 additional seats would leave the GOP with its largest majority since 1946 Weak Economic Recovery Could Boost GOP With the presidents approval rating hovering at around 40 many Democratic candidates chose to distance themselves from Obamas sixyear legacy in particular Obamas signature piece of legislation the Affordable Care Act which sought to reform the nations health care system but has come under harsh criticism from opponents of all political persuasions In addition many voters are likely to hold the president and his party responsible for an economy that hasnt recovered as quickly as many would have preferred While the headline unemployment rate has fallen sharply in the past few years wages have been stagnant and many Americans have been forced to accept temporary jobs or parttime positions Significant numbers of Americans have also dropped out of the workforce altogether out of frustration in finding a good paying job with benefits The labor force participation rate a key economic indicator for the health of US labor markets is at its lowest level since the 1970s Elsewhere across the country 36 states will elect governors in races that could potentially impact the 2016 Presidential election notably in Wisconsin where incumbent Republican Gov Scott Walker defeated his Democratic opponent In Rhode Island Fox News is projecting that state Treasurer Gina Raimondo a Democrat will beat Cranston Mayor Allan Fung a Republican to replace retiring Democratic Governor Lincoln Chaffee a former GOP Senator In those 36 gubernatorial contests an unusual number of incumbents appeared to be struggling heading into the election While Obama raised millions of dollars for Democratic candidates over the past two years many candidates chose not to be photographed with the president for fear of alienating voters who have grown disillusioned with the president

shooting of teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson MoAP PhotoCharlie Riedel File FERGUSON Mo  Missouri police have been brushing up on constitutional rights and stocking up on riot gear to prepare for a grand jurys decision about whether to charge a white police officer who fatally shot a black 18yearold in suburban St Louis The preparations are aimed at avoiding a renewed outbreak of violence during the potentially large demonstrations that could follow an announcement of whether Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson will face a criminal trial for the Aug 9 death of Michael Brown     Police and protesters have repeatedly clashed since the shooting which prompted a national conversation about race and police tactics Images of officers in riot gear and armored vehicles confronting protesters have drawn widespread criticism Many protesters want Darren Wilson indicted for murder Grand jury proceedings are secret but legal analysts say recently leaked information about Wilsons testimony to investigators may be an attempt to prepare the public for the possibility that he might not be charged The decision could be made public within the next month In the meantime law officers have adjusted their tactics for interacting more peacefully with protesters while also honing their procedures for quick widespread arrests They plan to have a large contingent of officers at the ready but have been meeting with clergy community leaders and students in hopes of building relationships that could ease tensions on the streets I know theres a lot of anxiety theres a lot of fear anticipation about that announcement said Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt Ron Johnson who was put in charge of security in Ferguson in the days after Brown was killed and is now part of a coordinated command with local police But I have a lot of hope Law enforcement officers expect to receive at least a days notice before a grand jury announcement That should provide time for them to execute security plans but may also allow demonstrators to prepare The moment I learn that there is in fact a nonindictment then theres going to be an organized protest said Eric Vickers a black St Louis attorney and civil rights activist Brown was unarmed when Wilson encountered him walking in the street with a friend A scuffle ensued and Brown was shot multiple times Witness accounts of what happened varied with some people saying they saw Brown raise his hands as if in surrender Wilson told investigators he felt threatened while fighting with Brown from inside a police SUV where an initial gunshot was fired according to information provided to several news outlets by people described as familiar with the investigation but otherwise not identified After Brown fled the vehicle Wilson said Brown turned around in threatening manner prompting the officer to fire the fatal shots according to those accounts of his testimony Wilsons description of events was leaked recently as was an autopsy report that showed Brown had marijuana in his system and was shot in the hand at close range Wilson has alleged Brown was trying to grab his gun in the SUV It appears that it may be calculated to soften the blow if there is no indictment said Peter Joy a law professor at Washington University in St Louis who directs the schools Criminal Justice Clinic But he said its conceivable that if the leaks are from law enforcement that perhaps there may be an indictment and this is calculated to garner public sympathy for officer Wilson Wilsons attorneys have denied being the source of the reports The shooting stoked longsimmering racial tensions in Ferguson a predominantly black community with an overwhelmingly white police force Protests have continued for two months in the St Louis area often peaceful but sometimes devolving into clashes between police firing tear gas and demonstrators lobbing rocks and bottles Law enforcement agencies have declined to say whether they will proactively line the streets with more officers as the grand jury announcement is made or position them in strategic locations to react as needed St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said hes learned it works better to let sergeants and lieutenants retain their normal place in the chain of command instead of supplanting them with higherranking officers Weve also learned we have to have a dialogue with our demonstrators so they know what to expect from us and we know what to expect from them Belmar said Police are attempting to better document events and handle widespread arrests more efficiently To ensure its at full strength the state Highway Patrol is limiting trooper vacations around the time of a potential decision and local police may be put on longer shifts After the initial clashes with protesters the state Highway Patrol purchased more shields and equipment for its officers St Louis city police recently spent 325000 upgrading helmets sticks and other civil disobedience equipment said Police Chief Sam Dotson More than 350 St Louis officers now have been trained in civil disobedience tactics St Louis County police and state troopers also have undergone training focused largely on ensuring they understand protesters constitutional rights Belmar Johnson and other law officers have been meeting frequently with clergy students and community leaders Pastors in turn have been preaching messages of nonviolence Earlier this week Democratic state Sen Jamilah Nasheed of St Louis intentionally got arrested for refusing to leave the street in front of the Ferguson Police Department Even that was an act preparation Nasheed said she wanted to show others that you can peacefully protest but you dont have to be violent under the banner of justice for Michael

Fox,http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2014/09/29/marijuana-industry-takes-another-step-into-mainstream-by-making-political/,DENVER  The entrepreneurs of the young US marijuana industry are taking another step into the mainstream becoming political donors who use some of their profits to support cannabisfriendly candidates and ballot questions that could bring legal pot to more states The political activity includes swanky fundraisers at Four Seasons hotels and art auctions at law firms And members of Congress who once politely returned the industrys contribution checks are now keeping them Were developing an industry here from the ground up If we dont contribute politically and get out there with the candidates we cant help shape what happens said Patrick McManamon head of Clevelandbased Cannasure Insurance Services which offers insurance to marijuana growers and dispensaries Medical marijuana businesses have been giving to candidates since the late 1990s With the arrival of recreational pot in Colorado and Washington the industry and its political influence are expanding rapidly Pot is now legal for medical or recreational purposes in 23 states and Washington DC More marijuana measures will be on the November ballot in Oregon Florida Alaska and the nations capital so many contributions are being funneled into those campaigns and the candidates who support them Compared with the donations of other industries or advocacy groups the political spending by marijuana businesses is modest But said Tripp Keber head of Denverbased Dixie Elixirs  Edibles which makes potinfused soda food and lotion the word is out that the marijuana industry has money to give Keber attended a summer fundraiser for Colorado Gov John Hickenlooper who opposed legalization in 2012 but has promised to regulate the industry according to voters wishes It was interesting to see how hes starting to evolve I said Im telling you I can get 100 people in the room who would be happy to max out or give the states maximum legal donation of 1100 Keber said A few weeks later in August Keber threw a fundraiser at the Four Seasons in Denver with a goal of raising 16000 for Hickenlooper The event netted 40000 In Washington state the industrys contributions are channeled into reforms that include reducing the tax rate on pot and kicking some marijuana revenue back to cities and counties to encourage more communities to allow dispensaries said dispensary owner John Davis who also serves as director of the Coalition for Cannabis Standards and Ethics Not long ago most marijuana entrepreneurs were trying to scrape a few dollars together to get started Keber said Now this industry is becoming profitable and were taking that profit and investing it politically There isnt a week that goes by where we dont make a political donation The Oregon ballot measure has raised about 23 million A medicalmarijuana question in Florida has attracted nearly 6 million And the Alaska campaign has brought in about 850000 A recreational pot measure in Washington DC attracted few donations perhaps because it appears almost certain to pass Colorados congressional delegation alone has received some 20000 this year from the marijuana industry according to federal campaignfinance data The true figure is probably much higher because many donors do not mention the drug in campaignfinance disclosures The largest federal spender on marijuana advocacy is the Marijuana Policy Project which plans to donate 150000 to federal candidates this year up from 110000 in 2013 The Drug Policy Alliance and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws have also given directly to federal candidates and taxexempt industry groups such as the National Cannabis Industry Association can spend an unlimited amount of untracked money Politicians who used to reject checks from promarijuana donors arent doing that anymore said Ethan Nadelmann head of the New Yorkbased Drug Policy Alliance Still the same candidates who cash the checks arent always keen to talk about it About a dozen recipients of marijuana money declined interview requests or did not return calls from The Associated Press A Colorado state lawmaker who accepts marijuanaindustry donations conceded thinking twice before taking them I always worry about what peoples perceptions will be said Rep Jonathan Singer a Democrat who is the only sitting Colorado legislator who supported legalization But it came down to Im on record for where I stood before I ever took a penny from this industry Todd Mitchem a Denver marijuana industry consultant recalled a fundraiser earlier this year thrown by a maker of cannabis vaporizer cartridges for a state legislator When the company posted photos from the event on its Facebook page the lawmaker asked that the images be taken down They just didnt want to be seen They were still taking the money said Mitchem who declined to name the lawmaker The only member of Congress who responded to the AP was Colorado Democratic Rep Jared Polis a longtime ally of the marijuana industry who has proposed federal legalization As long as this industry Is following our state marijuana laws Polis said in a statement their contributions are the same as those from any other legal donors ___ Associated Press writers Nigel Duara in Portland Oregon Becky Bohrer in Juneau Alaska

are confirming the arrest of Beltran Leyva at a seafood restaurant in the city of San Miguel de Allende AP PhotoUS State Department websiteThe Associated Press MEXICO CITY  Hector Beltran Leyva the purported head of a feared drug gang allegedly run by his family became the fourth brother to fall when soldiers grabbed him while dining at a seafood restaurant No shots were fired during the operation in San Miguel de Allende a popular enclave for foreigners and artists in the central state of Guanajuato federal criminal investigations chief Tomas Zeron said Wednesday night     With the arrest Mexicos government landed another highprofile blow against the countrys cartels At least nine capos have been killed or captured by security forces since 2009 including elusive Sinaloa cartel boss Joaquin El Chapo Guzman one of the worlds most wanted men Mexican authorities have said Beltran Leyva 49 assumed leadership of the familys cartel after his brother Arturo was killed by troops in a gunbattle in late 2009 Two other brothers are behind bars for their involvement in the cartel The Beltran Leyva gang terrorized parts of central Mexico for years including Morelos state to the south of Mexico City It declined somewhat after the brothers arrests and killing but the US Treasury Department said last November that the cartel appeared to be reorganizing and regaining some power Obviously this is not the Beltran Leyvas organization in its strongest moment  but it continues to be a criminal organization capable of generating localized violence in some states Mexican security expert Jorge Chabat said Zeron said Beltran Leyva had adopted a moderate profile after becoming head of the cartel to avoid detection An 11month investigation determined he had made his home in the central state of Queretaro where he passed himself off as a businessman selling art and real estate Zeron said He said Beltran Leyva was tracked to San Miguel de Allende and taken into custody along with a man suspected of being involved of the cartels finances Two federal officials told The Associated Press earlier that Beltran Leyva was believed to have been caught but DNA tests were being done to confirm it Zeron said those results were still forthcoming but said it was clear the man was Beltran Leyva He did not take questions This action proves the effectiveness of the public policy of security and law enforcement to achieve the Mexico at peace that we desire President Enrique Pena Nietos verified Twitter account said late Wednesday Zeron said the investigation was carried out jointly by various security agencies but the arrest was made by the army an institution that has come under criticism recently for the June killing of 22 suspected gang members in a town south of Mexico City According to the US State Department Beltran Leyva alias The H and The Engineer was born Feb 16 1965 in the northern Mexican state of Sinaloa a cradle of drug trafficking He has been indicted in courts in the District of Columbia and New York US authorities have offered a reward of up to 5 million for information leading to his capture and Mexico had offered its own bounty of 30 million pesos about 37 million US and Mexican authorities say the Beltran Leyva gang is responsible for trafficking drugs to the United States and Europe including cocaine marijuana heroin and methamphetamine It was originally part of Guzmans Sinaloa cartel but broke with that group in 2008 Guzman was nabbed in the Pacific Coast resort of Mazatlan in February more than a decade after he escaped from prison In 2013 authorities in northern Mexico arrested Miguel Angel Trevino Morales alias Z40 leader of the notorious Zetas cartel Fellow Zetas leader and founder Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano alias El Lazca was killed by marines the previous year Andrew Selee a Mexico expert at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington said the Beltran Leyva cartel established a pattern of extreme brutality that has since become the hallmark of other gangs such as the Zetas Its a huge deal to get Hector Beltran Leyva who took over the most bloodthirsty cartel in Mexico The Beltran Leyva

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/03/19/ptsd-added-to-medical-marijuana-worthy-conditions-in-michigan/," A state official has reluctantly added posttraumatic stress disorder to the list of conditions that qualify for medical marijuana in Michigan

Steve Arwood who heads the agency that oversees the program said hes following the recommendation of an advisory panel especially the affirmative vote of Michigans chief medical executive Dr Matthew Davis

I do remain very concerned with the scope of this approval and the process in general  First the condition of PTSD is a mental health issue Granting this approval steps Michigan away from the use of marijuana for disease of the body or chronic pain symptoms of a physical nature Arwood said in an order dated last Friday

PTSD is considered a mental health condition linked to a terrifying event Since Michigan voters approved it in 2008 marijuana typically has been used to relieve the side effects of cancer glaucoma HIV hepatitis C and a few other conditions PTSD is the first condition to be added to the original list although seven other states allow doctors to recommend marijuana to treat the disorder

Michigan users of medical marijuana need a doctors diagnosis and a card from the state More than 100000 people have cards including 86 who are under age 18 according to the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs

I remain concerned that there may be insufficient evidence on the effect of marijuana on minors said Arwood department director    ",2014-03-19T11:03-04:00,drugs

This sea change on the state level reflects a rising tide of enthusiasm for legal marijuana According to Gallup 58 percent of people nationwide now say they support legalization And they are putting their money where their mouth is The US market for legal marijuana currently valued at 14 billion is projected to grow to 23 billion in 2014 and 102 billion in five years according to a recent report by ArcView Market Research In Colorado and Washington state the combination of broad popular support and potential for extra tax revenue along with promises to strictly regulate the industry has convinced the federal government to reserve judgment for the time being That is the Obama Administration is willing to permit the adultuse experiment for now which means in some sense overlooking the fact that marijuana is still according to federal law a Schedule 1 narcotic with no known medical value Its politically risky for the federal government to ride roughshod over state laws voted in by a majority of the people says William McGrath a partner at the Washington DCbased Potomac Law Group Political calculation also plays a role The administration is fully aware of which way the wind is blowing on the issue McGrath says A majority of Americans favor legalization and there is overwhelming support among younger voters In return however the Department of Justice has laid out strict requirements that marijuana cultivators and retailers must follow and Colorado has issued rules of its own Two documents totaling more than 230 pages and issued by the Marijuana Enforcement Division a branch of the Colorado Department of Revenue spell out the rules for medical and recreational marijuana businesses The oversight is extensive This business is not for everyone Gehring says Were in a highly regulated industry because of the federal illegalities Barriers to entry
For wouldbe weed entrepreneurs there are primarily three barriers to entry The first is the maze of legal requirements In Colorado anyone directly involved in the production or distribution of weed must have lived in the state for the past two years at a minimum Retail shops and grow operations need licenses often multiple licenses for which a public hearing and inspections are mandatory And like casino workers Gehrings employees have to be individually licensed by the state Everyone must pass a background check And thats only the tip of the iceberg Even childresistant packaging is required Its a very comprehensive scheme that will require a great deal of expertise that may be foreign to those in the marijuana trade McGrath says Read the entire report atEntrepreneur Copyright 2014 RelatedUp in Smoke First Retail Licenses for Marijuana Distributed in Denver Brian Patrick Eha is an assistant editor at Entrepreneurcom

Of Republicans running against incumbent Democrats Rep Tom Cotton RArk has had one of the easiest paths to victory given that the state has trended Republican for all of Sen Mark Pryors term Cotton is expected to beat the incumbent Democrat However if Pryor prevails there is hardly any chance the Republicans will wrest control of the Senate from Democrats

Clintons cant tout clout  Just as Cotton is expected to score a win for Republicans in the Senate race GOP gubernatorial candidate Asa Hutchinson is favored to win over Democrat Mike Ross And like Pryor Ross was very much part of former Governor Bill Clintons legacy in the state Double statewide losses for candidates whom Bubba worked hard to rescue would be strong evidence that his wifes presidential bid wont bring Arkansas and other Southern and border states back into the Democratic fold

tradition of the west is you have to have firearms to protect yourself Colorado certainly in the forefront of that Now Carville when you look at these races and you look at Colorado JAMES CARVILLE DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST Right OREILLY If Colorado were to go republican if all right would that signal to you a shift in the mood of the entire country CARVILLE No Look it should be a good republican year Historically the sixth year of the incumbent party The governments race is tied Thats a great dog bite  it should be tied And they might win And it could be some sort of a backlash You know remember the pot referendum was passed by the voters And it still according to the polling still would pass if it went again today I dont see this as being some political earthquake in the making It may very well win the Senate seat It may very well win the governors race Its an elections in what should be a really good republican year OREILLY All right The reason the pot deal won in Colorado is because a huge money came in to support it Out of state money Enormous amount of money to get it on the ballot and to support it And the demographics have shifted in Colorado as well CARVILLE Yes OREILLY Its not the state it used to be when I lived there CARVILLE Nothing is what it used to be Things change OREILLY I just think its a really interesting platform because there have been unintended consequences of this pot legalization Now lets go to North Carolina In North Carolina this is another big one Because if Hagan loses she is popular in that state or at least was Then I say its all over for the democrats at least for the next two years until the presidential race starts You say Kate OBENSHAIN Well I think its a huge indicator that it will be incredibly great night for republican if Kaye Hagan goes down particularly given the nasty antiTillis campaign that we have been seeing largely funded by outside money that Kay Hagan claims to be he opposed to But the dirtiness I was looking at Politico the other day And every page I turned to was Tom Tillis will not protect women This constant mantra I think one of the things that will tell us is that war on women means that theres been out there for  OREILLY Yes and thats been played in Colorado you referenced the outside money in North Carolina Lets role this sound bite go BEGIN VIDEO CLIP SEN KAY HAGAN D NORTH CAROLINA If you think about it you have a handful of the wealthiest people in this country that are dictating what 350 million Americans hear and see on TV and thats wrong To me that is not democracy UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN But as long as the money is coming from people who support you its okay HAGAN You know I certainly wish that we could have disclosed where people  where no matter who gives money that the public knows and follows that Thats why I support this bill END VIDEO CLIP OREILLY Carville why didnt she give the money back when it comes from the outside of the state Why didnt she give the money back CARVILLE First of all I think  250 million in this cycle alone And she wanted to make that point thats fine OREILLY But she didnt give the outside money back How can you criticize CARVILLE Thom Tillis is saying to North Carolina  CROSSTALK ObamaCare and Medicaid bring that up Not the first politician to say I am taking this money but it shouldnt be there OREILLY Carville focus can why didnt she give the money out of state back CARVILLE Again she doesnt have to She made her point OREILLY OK She doesnt have to All right She looks like a fool She looks like a fool Thats all CARVILLE Right OREILLY All right Thanks very much Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network LLC ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Copyright 2014 CQRoll Call Inc All materials herein are protected by

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/10/23/number-people-dying-trying-to-cross-us-mexico-border-hits-15-year-low/,"TUCSON Ariz AP  The number of people who die trying to cross the USMexico border has dropped to the lowest level in 15 years as more immigrants turn themselves in to authorities in Texas and fewer are taking their chances with the dangerous trek across the Arizona desert The US government recorded 307 deaths in the 2014 fiscal year that ended in September  the lowest number since 1999 In 2013 the number of deaths was 445 The Border Patrols Rio Grande Valley sector finished the 2014 budget year with 115 deaths compared with 107 in the Tucson sector according to figures obtained by The Associated Press It marks the first time since 2001 that Arizona has not been the deadliest place to cross the border Arizona has long been the most dangerous border region because of tripledigit temperatures rough desert terrain and the sheer volume of immigrants coming in to the state from Mexico But more immigrants are now entering through Texas and not Arizona driven by a surge of people from Central America The Tucson and Rio Grande Valley both saw their numbers of deaths decline from 2013 although Arizonas drop was more precipitous Border enforcement officials say the lower numbers are in part due to increased rescue efforts as well as a Spanishlanguage media campaign discouraging Latin Americans from walking across the border Tucson Sector Division Chief Raleigh Leonard says the addition of 10 new rescue beacons that were strategically placed in areas where immigrants traverse most often has been a factor in the decrease in deaths I think we can all agree that crossing the border is an illegal act but nothing that should be assigned the penalty of death Leonard said in an interview Immigrant rights advocates are skeptical that it is solely the Border Patrols efforts contributing to the decrease in deaths At best what the Border Patrol is accomplishing is a geographical shift in where these deaths are happening  rather than adequately responding to the scale of the crisis said Geoffrey Boyce a border enforcement and immigration researcher at the University of Arizona and a volunteer with the Tucsonbased nonprofit No More Deaths The Rio Grande Valley sector was flooded with a surge in unaccompanied minors and families with children who turned themselves in at border crossings in Texas Most were from Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador where gang violence and a poor economy have driven out huge numbers of people That surge has dwindled recently however as US and Central American authorities have launched a public relations campaign warning parents against sending their children to the US Meanwhile the Tucson Sector once the busiest in the nation has seen a steep decline in border crossers Fewer Mexicans are crossing into the US as the economy here has faltered and drug violence at home has improved The Border Patrol also responds to hundreds of cases each year of immigrants who need to be rescued while crossing the desert long an issue in the Arizona desert The Border Patrol conducted 509 rescues in the 2014 fiscal year in the Tucson sector compared to 802 in 2013 Some of the rescues are made with the help of beacons that were activated 142 times this year The beacons are 30feet tall solarpowered and have sun reflectors and blue lights on top that are visible for 10 miles The beacons also have signs in three languages directing users to push a red button that sends out a signal for help Agents respond usually within 10 minutes to an hour The agency has a team dedicated solely to rescues called Border Patrol Search Trauma and Rescue Agents in this elite group spend their days searching for immigrants and responding when one seeks help They assist not only those who cross the border in search for jobs but also drug mules and smugglers who become injured or dehydrated in the summer heat It was only 10 am and already 95 degrees on a day in late June when the units agents provided medical assistance to a 28yearold man suspected of smuggling drugs near Sells Arizona The thin man had an ID from El Salvador and said he lived in Tucson He oscillated between Spanish and English but his message was the same He was in extreme pain The agents gave him a gallon of a sports beverage He was to drink it slowly they told him or else it would make him sick Next they connected a saline bag intravenously and checked his vitals The agents monitored him and reexamined his vitals concluding that he wasnt dehydrated but suffering from muscle fatigue Minutes later agents who used a drugsniffing K9 to search the area found several bundles of marijuana and another suspected smuggler The men were arrested on suspicion of being in the country illegally but were not charged with smuggling because the loads of marijuana were not found on them To us it could be a mule an illegal immigrant Theyre all the same Theyre human beings Leonard said Follow us on twittercomfoxnewslatino

 Holders legacy Dems midterm cash crush
 Wolf looking for revenge with Orman
 Grimes poormouthing draws scrutiny
 Coakley now trails in Globe poll
 On like Donkey Kong     HOLDERS LEGACY DEMS MIDTERM CASH CRUSH
Attorney General Eric Holders legal legacy will be debated for months and years to come but his most important political benefaction to his party is on display right now as Democrats continue to crush Republicans in campaign spending for Novembers midterm election Republicans have long warned of a chilling effect on conservative groups and donors while the investigation into the targeting of President Obamas political enemies by the IRS drags on And according to key players in two significant conservative political groups fear of IRS reprisals remains a top concern among anxious donors Unions dont worry about this Harry Reid doesnt worry about this But our donors constantly worry one operative told Fox News First They think about their companies their families and just the cost of dealing with audits and harassment

How will Democrats spending advantage shape the battle for control of the Senate Watch Political Pros Joe Trippi and Matt Schlapp discuss on Power Play with Chris Stirewalt

The best bad reputation to have  More than 16 months after the IRS targeting scandal first came to light there have still been no criminal charges lodged despite revelations of missing evidence further proof of strong political bias in selecting targets and muddled answers from the agency about cooperating with congressional investigators Meanwhile the team Holder tapped to investigate has not exactly inspired confidence about tenacity and impartiality So rather than resolving the matter all of the attention to the stillunresolved corruption claims has mostly served to advertise the possibility of political punishment for administration foes Having a reputation for a corrupt and partisan IRS deserved or not is the political equivalent of a football team having a reputation for dirty hits and cheap shots on defense Whether its is true or not the other guys still flinch Practically speaking this is a bad reputation that is good to have And rather than blowing the whistle Holder has seemed very content to run out the clock

California Attorney General Kamala Harris a favorite of the president and a liberal crusader has to be considered the frontrunner for the postelection appointment to replace Holder

While operatives in proGOP groups claim that they will have the cash necessary to help tip control of the Senate they concede that many donors have simply refused to open pocketbooks with two years still left of the Obama administrationWhen you combine it with the kind of public pressure that billionaire donors Charles and David Koch have experienced its a real consideration yes said another operative

WOLF LOOKING FOR REVENGE WITH ORMAN
Milton Wolf who lost tough primary battle with Republican Sen Pat Roberts may dish out some political payback by endorsing Roberts general election opponent Greg Orman in the key Kansas Senate race As Wolf weighs the move sources tell Politico Theres a big catch To win Wolfs endorsement Orman must first agree to caucus with the Senate GOP if he were to defeat RobertsThe two men were scheduled to meet Friday afternoon at Ormans house in Olathe Kansas just outside of Kansas City according to two people familiar with the matter One person said Ormans team sought the meeting but there was no ask for an endorsement Another source said the meeting may be canceled now that the media have caught wind of itAn endorsement could provoke some sharp GOP backlash for Wolf too As Roberts has slipped in the polls the GOP has made a furious push to showcase a united front behind his candidacy

Palin pans Orman  Former Gov Sarah Palin RAlaska warned the crowd at a pancake breakfast Thursday for Sen Pat Roberts to be wary of opponent Greg Ormans claim to be an independent LA Times I know independence Palin said Supporting Barack Obama supporting Obamacare supporting amnesty supporting Harry Reid Thats not independent Thats someone whos trying to snooker ya Kansas

Ambivalence advantage  In his column this week George Will got into the complicated math surrounding Ormans potential party allegiance If in January there are 51 or more Republican senators and 48 Democrats counting the two independents who caucus with them Orman would join the Republicans If there are 50 Republicans and 49 Democrats would Orman conduct an auction What problemsolving agenda would each party outline to engage him to give it control

New details renew Roberts residency woes  Mortgage documents have come to light in the monthslong controversy over Sen Pat Robertss residency Topeka Capital Journal On Wednesday records surfaced that Roberts signed a Deed of Trust in 1997 and 2003 for property owned in Alexandria Va with his wife Franki that contained text about a principal residence The documents which include a series of covenants required Roberts to attest the couple within 60 days of executing the document shall continue to occupy the property as borrowers principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2014/08/14/nfl-seeks-right-answer-for-marijuana-use-by-players/,Marijuana is casting an everthickening haze across NFL locker rooms and its not simply because more players are using it As attitudes toward the drug soften and science slowly teases out marijuanas possible benefits for concussions and other injuries the NFL is reaching a critical point in navigating its tenuous relationship with what is recognized as the analgesic of choice for many of its players     Its not lets go smoke a joint retired NFL defensive lineman Marvin Washington said Its what if you could take something that helps you heal faster from a concussion that prevents your equilibrium from being off for two weeks and your eyesight for being off for four weeks One challenge the NFL faces is how to bring marijuana into the game as a pain reliever without condoning its use as a recreational drug And facing a lawsuit filed on behalf of hundreds of former players complaining about the effects of prescription painkillers they say were pushed on them by team trainers and doctors the NFL is looking for other ways to help players deal with the pain from a violent game A Gallup poll last year found 58 percent of Americans believe marijuana should be legalized Thats already happened in Colorado and Washington  the states that are home of last seasons Super Bowl teams The World AntiDoping Agency has said it does not need to catch outofcompetition marijuana users And at least one highprofile coach Pete Carroll of the champion Seahawks publicly said hed like to see the NFL study whether marijuana can help players There are no hard numbers on how many NFL players are using marijuana but anecdotal evidence including the arrest or league discipline of no fewer than a dozen players for pot over the past 18 months suggests use is becoming more common Redskins offensive lineman Ryan Clark didnt want to pinpoint the number of current NFL players who smoke pot but said I know a lot of guys who dont regularly smoke marijuana who would use it during the season Washington wouldnt put a specific number on it but said he too knew his share of players who werent shy about lighting up when he was in the league including one guy who just hated the pain pills they were giving out at the time Another longtime defensive lineman Marcellus Wiley estimates half the players in the average NFL locker room were using it by the time he shut down his career in 2006 They are leaning on it to cope with the pain said Wiley who played defensive line in the league for 10 seasons They are leaning on it to cope with the anxiety of the game The NFL is fighting lawsuits on two fronts  concussions and painkillers  both of which some argue could be positively influenced if marijuana were better tolerated by the league The science however is slowmoving and expensive and might not ever be conclusive says behavioral psychologist Ryan Vandrey who studies marijuana use at John Hopkins Marijuana may work better for some people while narcotics and other painkillers might be better for others Different medicines work differently from person to person Vandrey said Theres pretty good science that shows marijuana does have pain relieving properties Whether its a better pain reliever than the other things available has never been evaluated Washington who is part of the concussion lawsuit is working with a biopharmaceutical and phytomedical company called KannaLife Sciences that recently received licensing from the National Institutes of Health NIH to develop a drug to treat concussions using derivatives from medical marijuana Cofounder Thoma Kikis who has been working on cannibasbased solutions to concussions for a few years said he approached the NFL about signing on to the research They didnt want to meet didnt want to take a position to create any kind of controversy Kikis said I understand that But ultimately theyre going to have to make a decision and look into different research NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has treaded gingerly around the subject Before last seasons Super Bowl he said the league would follow the medicine and not rule out allowing players to use marijuana for medical purposes An NFL spokesman reiterated that this month saying if medical advisers inform the league it should consider modifying the policy it would explore possible changes A spokesman for the players union declined comment on marijuana beyond saying the union is always looking for ways to improve the drugtesting policy But earlier this year NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith said the marijuana policy is secondary when set against the failure to bring Human Growth Hormone testing into the game Some believe relaxing the marijuana rules could be linked to a deal that would bring in HGH testing Ive heard that in conversations said Wiley a plaintiff in the painkiller lawsuit And I think its despicable that youd pit them against each other The NFL drug policy has come under even more scrutiny this summer after the NFL handed down a seasonlong suspension of Browns receiver Josh Gordon for multiple violations of the NFL substanceabuse policy That suspension especially when juxtaposed against the twogame ban Ray Rice received for domestic violence has led some to say the leagues priorities are out of whack In June Harvard Medical School professor emeritus Lester Grinspoon one of the forefathers of marijuana research published an open letter to Goodell urging him to drop urine testing for weed altogether and more importantly fund a crash research project for a marijuanabased drug that can alleviate the consequences of concussions As much as I love to watch professional football Im beginning to feel like a Roman in the days when they would send Christians to the lions Grinspoon said I dont want to be part of an audience that sees kids ruin their future with this game and then the league doesnt give them any recourse to try to protect themselves The league does in fact fund sportshealth research at the NIH to the tune of a 30 million donation it made in 2012 But the science moves slowly no matter where its conducted and as Vandrey says the NFL is in business for playing football not doing scientific research Meanwhile marijuana becomes more and more acceptable across America every day But even with the Super Bowl being dubbed The Stoner Bowl and the issue hanging heavily over the NFLs marquee event the league has shown no signs of quick movement The leagues threshold for a positive test remains 10 times lower than that of WADA which changed its limit last year in a nod to the reality that the drug is not a performance enhancer The NFLs conundrum is figuring a graceful way to keep tabs on those who use marijuana recklessly  or recreationally  while giving others a legitimate form of pain relief Id like to see us advance the subject to where were all mature and we get it Wiley said and we let players make the decision for themselves,2014-08-14T12:06-04:00,drugs

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/10/31/largely-ignored-ballot-measures-across-us-could-impact-latinos/,"Along with hundreds  maybe even thousands  of candidates fighting to get themselves elected to political offices across the country there are more than 140 ballot initiatives that are being decided on Tuesday All of them asking voters to take sides on issues as varied as drivers cards for undocumented immigrants in Oregon and raising the minimum wage in Arkansas to recreational marijuana and stricter gun laws That is actually a very low number of ballot measures down from nearly 190 in 2012 But that doesnt mean that there isnt a lot at stake both in terms of important issues as well as money spent by itself one California ballot measure Proposition 45 which would allow the states insurance commissioner to intercede in conflicts over health insurance rate hikes has drawn more than 50 million in spending by outside groups A number of those ballot initiatives could have a direct impact on the lives of Latinos and this has politicians activists political action committees and voter organizations on all sides hoping to win over this key demographic There are less ballot initiatives this year but the ones that are on the ballot are very important Justine Sarver executive director of the Ballot Imitative Strategy Center told Fox News Latino The Latino voting population is not huge in a lot of these states but it is still very important The ballot initiative in Oregon  the Alternative Driver Licenses Referendum  is probably the one that could most directly affect the lives of Latinos The measure is a citizens veto referendum on State Bill 833 a bill passed in 2013 by the Oregon Legislature which grants official driver IDs to people who cannot prove legal presence in the US  Justine Sarver executive director of the Ballot Imitative Strategy Center The proposal has enflamed sentiments on both sides of the immigration debate Trying to make life easier for these people here illegally just makes me ashamed and embarrassed that that our government supports this measure Cynthia Kendoll a campaign manager for Protect Oregon Driver Licenses told FNL Kendoll and other opponents of granting government identity cards to undocumented immigrants and others who cant prove theyre in the country legally is that theres no way to prove the people who apply for the cards are who they claim to be  making the system ripe for corruption This is one of the most fraudriddled documents in the nation Kendoll said of SB 833 Weve got a pervasive culture of corruption where we pick which laws apply to whom and how to enforce them Supporters counter that these documents help keep roads safer as people who may have been driving without insurance or a licensewill go through the training process and be more accountable The measure makes sense because it makes drivers know the rules of the road and it is not a proxy for immigration laws Becky Straus legislative director of the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU of Oregon told FNL It has nothing to do with immigration but instead its about drivers safety and civil liberties Oregons 60 Driver and Motor Vehicle Services offices could begin issuing driver cards in as little as 30 days if the initiative passes Recent polling data suggests the majority of likely voters are leaning toward vetoing SB 833 Oregon would become one of 12 states in the US to allow drivers cards for undocumented immigrants while only two states  Arizona and Nebraska  deny drivers license to young people granted protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA program Illinois also has a number of proposals on the ballot in this years elections including a nonbinding question about raising the minimum wage in the state but the most pressing for Latinos in the state is the Right to Vote amendment Proponents and adversaries of the initiative alike have suggested that the amendment is at least in part meant to discourage a controversial voter identification card like that being used in Texas but the main thrust of the proposal is to ensure that no person is denied the right to vote based on race sex color ethnicity as well as a host of other factors When Illinois state Senate voted back to put the amendment up for vote in November the move was widely praised by Democrats who claim that proof of citizenship measures unfairly disenfranchise lowincome people  often Democrats  who dont have IDs or the money to acquire them No voter should have to face the suppression tactics that we see in other states across the nation Democratic Gov Pat Quinn said in a prepared statement as he encouraged voter approval earlier this year The US Supreme Court said last week that Texas can use its controversial new voter identification law this election A majority of the justices rejected an emergency request from the Justice Department and civil rights groups to prohibit the state from requiring voters to produce certain forms of photo identification in order to cast ballots Democrats in Illinois including the bills sponsor Sen Kwame Raoul have not denied the fact that the Right to Vote amendment is an attempt to dissuade any implementation of voter ID laws It is definitely definitely intended to discourage voter ID laws Raoul said If you cast a vote for this you are casting a vote against voter ID laws For the amendment to go into effect it would need to garner the approval from either 35 of the people who vote solely on the question or a majority of all people voting in the election Some of the other measures that are piquing interest across the nation deal with issues like birth control gun ownership and the legalization of marijuana In Colorado a personhood amendment would add fetuses to those protected by the states criminal and wrongful death act Opponents say it would effectively ban abortions In North Dakota Measure 1 would provide the inalienable right to life for humans at any stage of development Supporters and opponents differ on what impact it might have on abortion regulations Voters in Oregon Alaska and the District of Columbia all have the chance to legalize the recreational use of marijuana by adults a step already taken two years ago by voters in Colorado and Washington state A measure in the Latinocentric state of Florida would legalize medical marijuana use Washington state has two competing gunrelated measures on its ballot with one pursuing background checks for all gun sales and transfers including private transactions and another that would prevent any such requirement involving purchases from private sellers The Associated Press contributed to this report  Follow Andrew OReilly on Twitter aoreilly84 Follow us on

Fox,http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2014/10/27/voters-in-11-states-to-weigh-in-on-tax-proposals/,Direct public involvement in shaping the United States tax policy has a long history There was the Boston Tea Party tax protest as the country was being formed More than 200 years later citizen lawmaking was still going strong with Californias watershed Proposition 13  a tax ballot initiative to reduce property taxes by more than 50 percent Now every election cycle tax issues appear on ballots across the country for voters to determine whether levies will be enacted ended or even permanently banned It will happen again on Nov 4 with 20 statewide taxrelated issues to be decided by voters in 11 states Georgia Illinois Louisiana Massachusetts Nevada North Dakota Oklahoma Tennessee Virginia Washington West Virginia Western states tend to have more direct democracy laws says Brittany Clingen ballot measures project director for Ballotpedia The online tracking of national voter initiatives is a project of the nonprofit Lucy Burns Institute However the move for direct voter say in the laws that govern them is found nationwide as people become more frustrated with government Clingen says Since taxes often are a key component of such frustration its no surprise that many ballot questions are taxrelated Three tax measures were decided in the August primaries In August Alaska voters opted to keep tax breaks in place for oil companies Thats not a surprise since the Last Frontiers economy relies heavily on the collection of that natural resource What was somewhat of a surprise was that the measure narrowly passed Michigan voters decided to do away with the states tax on business property such as equipment machinery and computers Supporters said the tax break was needed to keep the states business climate competitive Missouri voters however rejected a temporary sales tax increase that would have funded state transportation projects Some of the remaining taxrelated initiatives will change or repeal existing laws Others are advisory only giving lawmakers suggestions for future tax legislation And in a few cases the tax component is only a small part of a larger question But both business and individual tax issues are important to the taxpayers who will be going to the polls Among the initiatives that tax watchers are keeping a close eye on are the income tax questions in Georgia Illinois and Tennessee Georgia voters will decide whether to cap the state income tax at the current 6 percent rate Amendment A would prohibit any increase a move supporters say is needed to make the Peach State more competitive with other Southern states Opponents say individual income tax rates generally dont prompt population moves and that the ballot question is merely a political gimmick Illinois voters will get their say about raising taxes on their wealthier neighbors The Illinois Millionaire Tax Increase for Education question asks voters whether they support increasing the state income tax by 3 percent on incomes greater than 1 million The added money would go to school districts based on enrollment size The vote however is advisory only Any actual increase if favored by most Prairie State voters would have to come from the state legislature Of course since it is advisory only lawmakers could decide not to increase taxes even if most voters said it was OK Then theres Tennessee the Volunteer State one of nine states that does not have an income tax on wage and salary income Amendment 3 would keep it that way forever If approved by Volunteer State voters the state legislature would be prohibited from levying authorizing or permitting any state or local tax upon payroll or earned personal income The change would not affect the states current tax on certain dividend and interest income In 2013 Massachusetts lawmakers hiked the states gasoline tax from 21 cents to 24 cents The Transportation Finance Act also provides for that tax to increase annually based on the inflation rate Voters could put an end to those automatic tax hikes by approving Question 1 next month Opponents of the automatic gas tax hike say its unfair No other Massachusetts tax is tied to the rate of inflation They also are concerned that lawmakers could use this tax as the basis for tying other taxes to the Consumer Price Index Those who want to keep the annual gas tax hikes in place argue that its the best way to ensure the state has sufficient money to pay for road and infrastructure maintenance If Nevada voters approve Question 3 in November some of the states businesses would face a 2 percent margin tax beginning Jan 1 2015 Small businesses are exempt from the new tax It would apply only to firms with revenues of more than 1 million The new tax money would be dedicated to public school costs Supporters of the tax say businesses benefit from a better educated public The added revenue they argue could help reduce class sizes provide teachers and students with more tools and technology fund early childhood education programs and enhance the Silver States ability to recruit and keep quality educators Opponents of the tax say it would destroy one of the states best tools for attracting new businesses a low tax rate An analysis prepared for the Coalition to Defeat the Margin Tax found that the proposal would take Nevada from below the national average in several business tax categories to among the top five states in the country Voters in two Northern California cities will decide whether they should pay a tax on sugary beverages such as sodas sweetened tea and energy and sports drinks The Berkeley proposal would assess a 1centperounce tax on sugarsweetened beverages The money would go to the citys general fund San Franciscos measure calls for a 2centsperounce tax The new revenue would go to specific programs such as health education and programs promoting healthy lifestyles Attempts to implement similar beverage taxes by other states and cities across the country have generally failed Could that record change in one or both of these California cities known for their liberal politics and public activism If so the outcome could spark renewed enthusiasm for socalled soda taxes elsewhere Supporters of contentious issues will try to test at local levels first says Clingen That strategy has been used before to advance policy dealing with genetically modified organisms fracking and marijuana Its less expensive says Clingen If its successful they work to expand

beach with dredged sand a pricey step many experts say is a temporary fix at best Jamaica is readying plans to build submerged breakwaters it hopes will absorb wave energy and slow loss of shoreline using an initial 54 million in grants from a UN climate change convention The breakwater project in Negril which one study says could cost as much as 77 million over the course of 80 years offers a glimpse of what may lie ahead for other coastal towns Caribbean islands many already heavily in debt will be faced with the choice of trying to armor shores with seawalls and breakwaters or conducting a costly retreat from seas that the UNbacked Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says could rise by nearly a meter yard by the end of the century Beaches across the region are being transformed by a variety of factors shoreline development surges from increasingly intense storms coastal pollution that affects marine life coral reefs crumbling in warmer waters The changes are particularly worrisome for the Caribbean because of its dependence on seaandsand tourism In addition roughly 70 percent of the Caribbeans people and much of its essential infrastructure are situated along coasts The region is facing an existential threat said Ulrich Trotz science adviser for the Caribbean Community Climate Change Center which provides policy advice and guidelines to more than a dozen member nations and territories We dont have much time Action now is imperative if the Caribbean is to survive as we know it Trotz said in a phone interview from Antigua According to the World Bank some areas of the island of St Vincent have lost up to 30 meters yards of beach over the last nine years A recent study by the bank forecasts that the Dominican Republics capital of Santo Domingo where many residents live along the Ozama River and in its flood plain will be one of five global cities most affected by climate change over the next 35 years Building seawalls to protect from an encroaching sea an approach that has seen limited success in places like California has been one response on the island of Barbados But in many cases scientists say allowing shores to retreat or bolstering beaches with vegetation and restoring wetlands could be smarter  Last year Cuba razed seaside buildings to restore shorelines to something approaching its natural state For many beaches adaptation measures such as bringing in sand and creating seawalls will only slow the inevitable and at a significant and continual financial cost said Jason Spensley of the UN Climate Technology Center and Network Environmental experts and civil planners say leaders across the region need to adapt for the long term City developers could adjust how they zone improve enforcement of marine regulations and better plan water systems for example Beachfront developers could be encouraged to protect dunes and anchoring vegetation such as seagrasses better manage coastal runoff pollution and push construction farther back from the sea We just dont seem to be prepared to do any of it Its as if we do not see what Negril has become what the dangers to its future are said Diana McCaulay CEO of the nonprofit Jamaica Environment Trust But Shelia McDonaldMiller program manager for the governments breakwater project said she is confident the offshore structures of boulders will slow Negrils erosion She expects construction to start next year Simon Mitchell a geologist at the islands University of the West Indies says governments need to think further ahead In lowlying Negril for example there is no doubt that hotels perched along the beach will be deluged in coming decades he said We need to be looking 50 years into the future he said We cant keep going into places with pristine beaches immediately put in hotels and then end up with the same problem in 10 years time because those beaches are eroding away ___ David McFadden on Twitter

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/27/weed-booze-and-bears-ballot-questions-compete-with-candidates-for-voters/, While candidates and parties duke it out for victory on Election Day a justasheated battle is being waged in a number of states over guns abortion booze marijuana  even bears Ballot initiatives often are the sidebar story of any election but for some voters the debate this year over yes or no on a range of ballot questions has been the marquee issue drawing millions of dollars to each side and in some cases forcing candidates running in those states to take a position     One of the highestprofile battles again is over weed After Colorado and Washington became the first states to effectively legalize  and regulate  nonmedical marijuana in the last election the propot movement is trying to expand the legal weed map next week Unlike several past elections gay marriage is not on the ballot this year But other social and economic hot buttons including the minimum wage are According to electiontracker Ballotpedia voters are weighing in on 153 ballot measures on Election Day Marijuana bans up in smoke Two years ago voters in Colorado and Washington legalized recreational pot statewide and the federal government largely has stayed out of their business On Nov 4 Oregon which voted down such a measure in 2012 Alaska and the District of Columbia will ask voters whether they too want to join the marijuana legalization experiment Promarijuana voices like Morgan Fox at the Marijuana Policy Project say the prospects for legalization are looking good Polls have shown voters in Oregon and DC largely support the measures though voters views toward legalizing weed in Alaska are still a bit hazy Florida with its huge senior community also has a question on the ballot on legalizing medical marijuana They all seem like they are pretty close except for DC which has overwhelming support Fox said But I think they all stand a very good chance of passing Last week Sen Jeff Merkley DOre became the first US senator to support marijuana legalization for his state Drug Policy Action which has received major funding from billionaire currency trader George Soros contributed 500000 to the Yes on 91 campaign in Oregon Washington DCbased New Approach PAC tied to the family of the late billionaire Peter Lewis gave 300000 to the effort Big money plays a huge role in the yes campaign said Kevin Sabet legalization opponent and cofounder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana SAM You have millions of dollars poured in to the yes side and on the no side you just have a lot of volunteers from citizens and groups that dont traditionally have a lot of money They are trying to manipulate from the outside End of the dry spell There arent many places that still ban alcohol though 10 states including Arkansas still have areas that do A ballot initiative that would legalize booze statewide is pitting big fundraising guns at WalMart which wants to want to end prohibition against the liquor dealers who want to keep it It promises to be a big draw on Nov 4 According to local reports 37 out of Arkansas 75 counties prohibit the sale and purchase of alcohol Business interests like WalMart want to be able to sell beer and wine over the counter everywhere in Arkansas Liquor dealers who operate shops just outside dry counties have lined up to defeat the measure known as Issue 4 An October poll by Talk Business  Politics found that 54 percent of voters opposed lifting prohibition statewide Dueling gun measures Following the elementary school shooting massacre at Sandy Hook and other highprofile tragedies involving firearms gun control advocates have been pouring cash into legislative efforts as well as ballot initiatives Washington state has two dueling gun measures at the ballot box on Nov 4 If both win it likely will tie up the issue in court Initiative 594 calls for a comprehensive tightening of the states background check policies  requiring background checks for virtually all purchases including online and gunshow sales Opponents including the National Rifle Association NRA have been vastly outspent as the campaign heads into the last week According to a report in September the proI594 funders including former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg and Bill and Melinda Gates have given 75 million toward its passage Competing measure I591 is supported by gun rights advocates and would do the opposite by barring the state from enacting its own backgroundcheck laws deferring to the federal government on that front It also would prohibit government agencies from seizing guns without due process Dont feed the bears A ballot initiative drawing major national attention in Maine would restrict the way residents can hunt for bears Right now hunters can use a range of tactics to kill their quarry  from trapping and chasing them down with dogs to baiting them with sweets like jelly doughnuts All three methods would be banned if Question 1 passes Maine hunters would have to stalk and shoot bears the oldfashioned way which is more humane proponents say Critics say it would balloon Maines bear population Both sides have spent some 16 million on TV ads to persuade the public Abortion Three state measures would challenge some abortions In Colorado voters will decide whether to amend the state constitution to define the fetus as a person under the criminal code In North Dakota voters weigh the question of whether the state constitution should protect the rights of the unborn In Tennessee a measure would make it easier for the state to pass restrictions on abortion Drugtesting docs and malpractice In California voters will decide whether to require doctors to submit to drugtesting the first such policy in the country Proposition 46 also would raise the cap on painandsuffering awards Proponents say it would be a win for patients while critics say it all amounts to a grab by tort lawyers Sentencing reform Prison overcrowded California is weighing Prop 47 which would dramatically change how the state treats certain nonserious nonviolent drug and property crimes by downgrading them from felonies to misdemeanors The measure also would allow those currently serving time for such offenses to apply for a reduced sentence as long as they have no prior convictions for more serious crimes like murder attempted murder or sexual offenses Minimum wage Several states are asking voters to decide minimum wage increases A South Dakota measure would hike the rate from 725 an hour to 850 An Alaska measure would raise it from 775 an hour to over two years 975 Arkansas and Nebraska also have similar measures on the ballot Illinois is asking voters about the minimum wage but the result is nonbinding,2014-10-27T07:48-04:00,drugs

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/10/24/prosecutors-no-new-evidence-witness-on-boston-marathon-bombing-suspect-brother/,BOSTON  Prosecutors said in a court filing Friday they dont have any new evidence that the brother of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was involved in a 2011 triple slaying and have no witness who will testify to what Tsarnaev knew about his brother and the killings The government made the statements in response to Tsarnaevs lawyers request earlier this month for information about a witness they said the government previously mentioned     Defense lawyers are seeking information that could show Tsarnaev was influenced by his brother in the 2013 bombings Prosecutors said Friday they had disclosed only that a third party told investigators there was someone who might say Tsarnaev knew his brother Tamerlan was involved in the socalled Waltham killings Whether that person would actually say it let alone testify to it is another matter entirely prosecutors said The government has no evidence that Tamerlan Tsarnaev actually participated in the Waltham murders so there is nothing to produce The government also repeated its argument that the facts of the 2011 case and what someone says Tsarnaev knew about it are irrelevant to Tsarnaevs state of mind when the bombings took place Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges and could face the death penalty if convicted at his trial scheduled to begin in January Prosecutors say the Tsarnaev brothers planted two pressurecooker bombs near the finish line of the April 15 2013 marathon killing three people and injuring more than 260 Tamerlan died following a shootout with police three days after the bombings In court papers a year ago federal prosecutors said a friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev told investigators Tamerlan participated in the unsolved killings of three men found in Waltham with their throats slit and sprinkled with marijuana The friend Ibragim Todashev was shot to death by authorities while being questioned in Florida last year Prosecutors said a judge has already ruled they didnt have to give the defense a written or recorded account of Todashevs statement and theres no reason to reconsider Prosecutors also said the Middlesex district attorney has told them the Waltham investigation remains active and ongoing In a separate filing Friday Tsarnaevs lawyers complained for a third time about media leaks they say are jeopardizing his right to a fair trial They cited a recent Newsweek magazine piece containing statements from unnamed law enforcement sources They say the article casts the entire Tsarnaev family in an extremely negative light and suggests that others were somehow involved Tsarnaevs lawyers want US District Judge George OToole Jr to hold a hearing and call supervising law enforcement officers to testify about their efforts to stop unauthorized communications with the news media OToole has rejected two earlier defense requests for a hearing but has told prosecutors to warn law enforcement against disclosing information about the case to the media Prosecutors sent a letter about the judges concerns to law enforcement agencies involved Also Friday Tsarnaevs lawyers said in a filing that they do not believe they are required to file a list of defense witnesses before Tsarnaevs trial They said they are worried that once the defense witness names are turned over to prosecutors the witnesses would decide not to testify given the virtual certainty that the FBI will descend on each of the nonexpert witnesses to interview them His lawyers said they have encountered unusual and severe obstacles in trying to get witnesses who knew Tsarnaev and his family to testify A spokeswoman for prosecutors declined to comment ___ Associated Press writer Sylvia Wingfield contributed to this story,2014-10-24T21:36-04:00,drugs

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/08/21/did-marijuana-smoking-give-these-young-men-heart-attacks/, Recent reports of sudden heart problems in people who had smoked marijuana has raised concerns about its safety especially as more states legalize the drug for medical and recreational use Marijuana smoking is becoming more prevalent said Dr William Abraham a cardiologist at Ohio State Universitys Wexner Medical Center and this does give us an opportunity to better study and better understand what its health consequences are     Many of the reports involved only one or a few patients such as the otherwise healthy 21yearold UK man who was a regular marijuana smoker and who suffered a heart attack due to a blood clot in one of the arteries in his heart The doctors were able to rule out the possibility that the heart attack was caused by atherosclerosis or a buildup of plaque in the arteries Another report looked at these three people who needed to be revived with CPR when they developed heart problems after smoking pot As awareness grows so does the information available on the potential dangers of marijuana smoking In a larger study in France published this year in the Journal of the American Heart Association researchers identified 35 cases of cardiovascular complications amounting to 18 percent of all serious side effects from cannabis use reported to a government database Nine of the patients died Marijuana Not Free of Health Effects None of these studies however are very rigorous  the kind you would need in order to show a definitive link between marijuana and heart attacks When you look retrospectively into databases and pull out bits and pieces of data and then assemble them and present them the results can often times be misleading said Dr Mark Rabe chairman of the scientific advisory board for Medical Marijuana Sciences a company that is researching the anticancer potential of marijuana And when you look further into other variables its very difficult to draw conclusions Marijuana does have some documented effects on the cardiovascular system including increasing the heart rate by as much as 100 percent an effect that can last for up to three hours While some pot smokers report that this becomes less of a problem after continued use it can be significant enough for people to seek medical help Its not uncommon for us to see marijuana smokers or people who ingest marijuana in other forms  in edible forms  come to the emergency department with anxiety or agitation associated with heart racing Abraham said There is limited information available on the effects of marijuana perhaps because people are hesitant to admit to using an illegal drug when they show up in the emergency room However there are some reports of more serious cardiovascular problems such as chest pain heart attack irregular heart rhythms and ministrokes known as transient ischemic attacks that are often considered an early warning sign for a full stroke The incidence of those types of more serious events appears to be very low  maybe less than a percent risk said Abraham but when you look at a growing population of marijuana smokers or marijuana ingesters this now may translate into a lot of people According to the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health 189 million people in the US had used marijuana in the previous month Even if just one percent of those people experienced cardiovascular effects after lighting up that is still many thousands of potential problems Higher Risks for Certain Groups Certain groups of people may be more at risk for cardiovascular problems from smoking marijuana Patients who have other risk factors for heart and vascular disease are at higher risk for complications from marijuana ingestion Abraham said So folks who are older folks who have diabetes or high blood pressure or high cholesterol folks who also smoke cigarettes  the typical risk factors for heart attack and stroke As seen in some of the recent studies even young people may not be immune to the adverse effects of smoking marijuana or eating products containing the drug I think its also important to note that even young otherwise healthy people without any risk factors have been reported to have heart attacks and strokes and other cardiovascular complications of marijuana ingestion Abraham added With so many unknowns most doctors would recommend caution to pot smokers Warning signs to look for include an increased heart rate that doesnt stop after a few hours or extreme drops in blood pressure For Rabe though the benefits of marijuana may outweigh the downsides for most people especially when pot replaces pharmaceutical drugs that carry their own serious side effects I believe that its an important thing to be concerned about and pay attention to Rabe said but the evidence thats out there would suggest that the risk of cardiovascular problems would be very low relative to the potential benefit of the therapeutic effects of cannabis,2014-08-21T12:30-04:00,drugs
Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/09/26/reporter-alaska-pot-vote/, It was the f it heard round the web Alaska reporter Charlo Greene achieved viral video fame this week by announcing onair she was quitting to work on passing the states Ballot Measure 2 which would legalize marijuana     And as for this job  f it I quit said Greene who until that moment worked for KTVA in Anchorage But will all the attention surrounding her spectacular exit boost the ballot initiative itself Perhaps not surprisingly Greene seems to think so She told FoxNewscom she believes her actions 1000 percent benefit the prolegalization movement If I had just given my two weeks the viewers would have never known she said Others in Alaska arent so sure what the impact will be The marijuana ballot measure polls show has voters about evenly divided and even a small shift could make the difference At the same time the ballot measure has been a hot topic in Alaska for months and both supporters and opponents downplayed the impact Greenes move may have on voters Taylor Bickford a spokesman for the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana in Alaska told FoxNewscom while its entirely possible Greenes outspoken outreach could drive some Alaskans to the polls it doesnt compare to the months of work the campaign has put in to gain support Charlo Greene has transitioned from someone who reported on the ballot measure to a supporter Bickford said But shes just one supporter amongst many Charles Fedullo a spokesman for the Big Marijuana Big Mistake Vote No on 2 campaign told FoxNewscom he believes there will be a high voter turnout for the fall election regardless of Greenes actions as there are many important issues on the ballot When it comes to Charlo Greene people will make up their own minds whether she is a valuable spokesperson for the promarijuana organization he said The attention surrounding Greene whose real name is Charlene Egbe has raised some concerns from the propot movement that the stunt could end up hurting the cause by casting it in a bad light A former neighbor of Greenes also reportedly filed a restraining order against her after claiming his daughter got sick due to the marijuana smoke from her room Greene who runs the Alaska Cannabis Club allegedly threatened the father though she denies it Alaska has a long and muddled history with legalized marijuana University of AlaskaAnchorage Professor Jason Brandeis notes that the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 1975 that Alaskans could possess small amounts of recreational marijuana in the privacy of their homes for personal use The permissible amount commonly is understood to be less than four ounces Alaska also legalized medical marijuana in 1998 However Alaska has several laws on the books that punish any nonmedical marijuana useThis has created what Brandeis called a legal gray area  technically you can smoke marijuana in your home but you can also be prosecuted if youre caught It makes it a little bit tricky Brandeis told FoxNewscom Ballot Measure 2 would do away with that gray area by legalizing recreational marijuana use for people over the age of 21 and regulating its production sale and use in the state Bickford said the changes are long overdue to reconcile the confusing and damaging laws in a state that already has a multimillion dollar marijuana industry Bickford added that many Alaskans believe its better to have Alaskas marijuana industry regulated than in the hands of criminal enterprises However Fedullo strongly disagreed He said the antilegalization campaign is largely made up of volunteers everyday Alaskans worried that national promarijuana organizations are trying to push their agenda in the fiercely independent state People are very concerned he said And Alaskans in general the hair on the back of our neck stands up when we feel there is outside influence coming here Fedullo said a lot of people he has spoken with in the state are worried about the effects legal marijuana has had in Colorado and Washington and what impacts a legal marijuana industry could have on Alaskas communities Greene described the ballot initiative as vital for the movement As for her signoff splash Greene said after watching months of coverage on her TV station she finally got the opportunity to voice her opinion The fact that Im sitting here with you on FoxNewscom talking about Ballot Measure 2 and what it means for Alaskans right here today just shows that whatever I did worked to spark a conversation about marijuana reform in Alaska across the nation and across the world she said Thursday Recent surveys of voters by the Democraticleaning Public Policy Polling indicate support for Ballot Measure 2 may be on the decline In a May poll 48 percent of voters said they would vote yes on the measure while 45 percent said they would vote no and 7 percent said they were undecided However in an August poll 44 percent of voters said they would vote yes on the measure while 49 percent said they would vote no and 8 percent said they were undecided,2014-09-26T07:00-04:00,drugs

messages on college campus sidewalks intense getoutthevote drives are mobilizing in Oregon and Alaska to legalize retail sales of marijuana to anyone old enough to drink But backers of the legalpot ballot measures in both states have a challenge that their predecessors in Colorado and Washington state didnt face two years ago   increasing turnout of young voters in a midterm election Young voters who as a generation are more likely to support recreational marijuana usually turn out during presidential years like 2012 but stay home during midterms when the electorate skews older and more conservative If young people 18 to 29 years old vote like they did in 2012 Oregons Measure 91 for example would pass said Ethan Nadelmann head of Drug Policy Action a major contributor in the national campaign to legalize marijuana Thats really what it boils down to he said Washington DC is voting on whether to make it legal to possess marijuana but not sell it Whatever happens in the states and the nations capital advocates plan to quickly shift their attention to the 2016 presidential elections and the big prize California where hopes are high for approval of legal pot despite a 2010 rejection Even if all those things go down to defeat I still think its a clean slate in 2016 said Jeffrey Miron an economist at Harvard University and the Cato Institute who follows national drug policy Mark Kleiman a drug policy consultant who helped Washington set up its legal marijuana industry said the outcomes in Oregon and Alaska will help determine the enthusiasm of funders financing the legalization campaign in California In the meantime the focus is on Oregon and Alaska Oregon is a blue state that decriminalized marijuana in 1973 and authorized medical marijuana in 1998 The states southwestern corner is renowned for growing some of the nations best marijuana and attracts outlaw growers from the US and Mexico Medical pot dispensaries were approved last year to sell to nearly 70000 patients Alaska by contrast is more conservative but theres a strong libertarian streak and small amounts of marijuana have been legal for personal use since a 1975 state Supreme Court ruling Medical pot is legal but not dispensaries Both states have seen previous initiatives to legalize marijuana fail This time around campaigns have major contributions from outofstate donors who want see the legal pot movement garner more victories In Alaska supporters of Measure 2 have raised more than 890000 nearly all of it from the Marijuana Policy Project the largest federal spender on marijuana advocacy Opponents have raised nearly 150000 Despite the difference the no campaign    Big Marijuana Big Mistake    is not giving up relying heavily on volunteers social media letters to the editor and word of mouth More and more Alaskans are donating to the no campaign said spokeswoman Deborah Williams Theyre convinced we need to defeat this measure And we will win this measure In Oregon two groups backing Measure 91 have raised a total of nearly 4 million most of it spent on TV ads Opponents have raised 168000 In the state where elections are settled exclusively by mail ballots closing the deal means a twostep process said Liz Kaufman campaign director for Yes on 91 People need to mark their ballots and then turn them in The campaign is reaching out with TV phone trees doortodoor canvassing and chalking on college campuses Youd be surprised how many people mark up their ballots and dont turn them in Kaufman said In Alaska a recent poll for initiative proponents shows overwhelming support among voters under 35 with the measure winning by 18 points Another for opponents shows it losing by 10 points Its a very polarized race said Anchorage pollster Ivan Moore who conducted the poll for the initiative sponsor Young people like it and old people dont And the trouble for the yes side is that old people vote and young people dont Another key demographic is mothers With only 168000 to spend the Noon91 campaign in Oregon used most of it to mail 155000 postcards to mothers from Portland to Eugene It focused on fears that marijuanainfused candy and sodas pose a danger to kids They have also flown in people from Colorado to speak out said Clatsop County Sheriff Tom Bergin a leader of the no campaign Its really difficult he said Weve got daytime jobs The potheads dont This is their job to get this legalized Polls in Oregon have shown support for legalization declining as election day approaches but still with a fair chance of passing said Seattle pollster Stuart Elway In Washingtons experience the measure outperformed the polls he said What we have in Oregon right now is a statistical dead heat Its going to depend in large part on who votes

Fox,http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2014/08/15/with-attitudes-changing-and-science-shifting-nfl-searches-for-marijuana-answers/,Marijuana is casting an everthickening haze across NFL locker rooms and its not simply because more players are using it As attitudes toward the drug soften and science slowly teases out marijuanas possible benefits for concussions and other injuries the NFL is reaching a critical point in navigating its tenuous relationship with what is recognized as the analgesic of choice for many of its players Its not lets go smoke a joint retired NFL defensive lineman Marvin Washington said Its what if you could take something that helps you heal faster from a concussion that prevents your equilibrium from being off for two weeks and your eyesight for being off for four weeks One challenge the NFL faces is how to bring marijuana into the game as a pain reliever without condoning its use as a recreational drug And facing a lawsuit filed on behalf of hundreds of former players complaining about the effects of prescription painkillers they say were pushed on them by team trainers and doctors the NFL is looking for other ways to help players deal with the pain from a violent game A Gallup poll last year found 58 percent of Americans believe marijuana should be legalized Thats already happened in Colorado and Washington   the states that are home of last seasons Super Bowl teams The World AntiDoping Agency has said it does not need to catch outofcompetition marijuana users And at least one highprofile coach Pete Carroll of the champion Seahawks publicly said hed like to see the NFL study whether marijuana can help players There are no hard numbers on how many NFL players are using marijuana but anecdotal evidence including the arrest or league discipline of no fewer than a dozen players for pot over the past 18 months suggests use is becoming more common Washington Redskins defensive back Ryan Clark didnt want to pinpoint the number of current NFL players who smoke pot but said I know a lot of guys who dont regularly smoke marijuana who would use it during the season Washington wouldnt put a specific number on it but said he too knew his share of players who werent shy about lighting up when he was in the league including one guy who just hated the pain pills they were giving out at the time Another longtime defensive lineman Marcellus Wiley estimates half the players in the average NFL locker room were using it by the time he shut down his career in 2006 They are leaning on it to cope with the pain said Wiley who played defensive line in the league for 10 seasons They are leaning on it to cope with the anxiety of the game The NFL is fighting lawsuits on two fronts    concussions and painkillers    both of which some argue could be positively influenced if marijuana were better tolerated by the league The science however is slowmoving and expensive and might not ever be conclusive says behavioral psychologist Ryan Vandrey who studies marijuana use at John Hopkins Marijuana may work better for some people while narcotics and other painkillers might be better for others Different medicines work differently from person to person Vandrey said Theres pretty good science that shows marijuana does have pain relieving properties Whether its a better pain reliever than the other things available has never been evaluated Washington who is part of the concussion lawsuit is working with a biopharmaceutical and phytomedical company called KannaLife Sciences that recently received licensing from the National Institutes of Health NIH to develop a drug to treat concussions using derivatives from medical marijuana Cofounder Thoma Kikis who has been working on cannibasbased solutions to concussions for a few years said he approached the NFL about signing on to the research They didnt want to meet didnt want to take a position to create any kind of controversy Kikis said I understand that But ultimately theyre going to have to make a decision and look into different research NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has treaded gingerly around the subject Before last seasons Super Bowl he said the league would follow the medicine and not rule out allowing players to use marijuana for medical purposes An NFL spokesman reiterated that this month saying if medical advisers inform the league it should consider modifying the policy it would explore possible changes A spokesman for the players union declined comment on marijuana beyond saying the union is always looking for ways to improve the drugtesting policy But earlier this year NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith said the marijuana policy is secondary when set against the failure to bring Human Growth Hormone testing into the game Some believe relaxing the marijuana rules could be linked to a deal that would bring in HGH testing Ive heard that in conversations said Wiley a plaintiff in the painkiller lawsuit And I think its despicable that youd pit them against each other The NFL drug policy has come under even more scrutiny this summer after the NFL handed down a seasonlong suspension of Browns receiver Josh Gordon for multiple violations of the NFL substanceabuse policy That suspension especially when juxtaposed against the twogame ban Ray Rice received for domestic violence has led some to say the leagues priorities are out of whack In June Harvard Medical School professor emeritus Lester Grinspoon one of the forefathers of marijuana research published an open letter to Goodell urging him to drop urine testing for weed altogether and more importantly fund a crash research project for a marijuanabased drug that can alleviate the consequences of concussions As much as I love to watch professional football Im beginning to feel like a Roman in the days when they would send Christians to the lions Grinspoon said I dont want to be part of an audience that sees kids ruin their future with this game and then the league doesnt give them any recourse to try to protect themselves The league does fund sportshealth research at the NIH to the tune of a 30 million donation it made in 2012 But the science moves slowly no matter where its conducted and as Vandrey says the NFL is in business for playing football not doing scientific research Meanwhile marijuana becomes more and more acceptable across America every day But even with the Super Bowl being dubbed The Stoner Bowl and the issue hanging heavily over the NFLs marquee event the league has shown no signs of quick movement The leagues threshold for a positive test remains 10 times lower than that of WADA which changed its limit last year in a nod to the reality that the drug is not a performance enhancer The NFLs conundrum is

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/09/29/president-obama-attorney-general-holder-and-our-police-officers/, The police shooting of 18yearold Michael Brown in Ferguson Mo last month turned a St Louis suburb of 21000 into a media circus The public watched breathlessly in the weeks that followed as violent protests pitted police against protesters and looters against shop owners While so much of the discussion has focused on race it also concerns the role of law enforcement in our communities Until April I served as the assistant director of the FBI where I was honored to work sidebyside with some of the bravest and most committed people Ive ever known  those in law enforcement These men and women dedicate their lives  and sometimes even lay down their lives  in the service of our communities and our country Unfortunately my colleagues in law enforcement are learning all too well that their sacrifices arent always of concern to their federal government     Earlier this month we learned that Attorney General Eric Holder ordered the Department of Justice to conduct a full investigation of the Ferguson Police Department The timing of the announcement preceded by Holders visit to Ferguson and the attendance of White House representatives at Browns funeral was a blatant attempt to sway public opinion These efforts by theObama administration could in turn risk influencing citizens who have been assembled as grand jurors or may be called to be jurors in a potential trial What seems abundantly clear is that the leadership Department of Justice is unconcerned about Officer Darren Wilsons legal fate since it has already reached its own conclusions about what happened that night in Ferguson Unfortunately politicization of what is supposed to be blind justice is hardly unusual in the Obama administration TheWashington Postnoted thatHolder has ordered twice as many investigationsof law enforcement than any of his predecessors While many inthelaw enforcement community may feel relievedto learn of Attorney General Holders anticipated departure as head of DOJ one must wonder if the damage has already been done The ramifications of these efforts are disturbing and very real They cast doubt reinforce skepticism and risk compromising cooperation between law enforcement and those living in the communities they serve Simply put these efforts by the Obama administration may well make it more difficult for police to do their jobs But what is just as telling about the Obama administration is what it doesnt say and what it doesnt do Three recent cases underscore how police officers are forgotten by the Department of Justice when the events dont suit its purposes In early JulyIndianapolis police officer Perry Rennwas shot and killed allegedly by 25yearold Major Davis Jr who authorities say was brandishing an assault rifle on the street Davis had several prior runins with the police including one where he was found in a home known for drug activity and where police uncovered two loaded assault rifles cocaine marijuana and cash About a week later in Jersey City NJpolice were ambushedresponding to what was reported as a robbery at a Walgreens The store was never robbed A man named Lawrence Campbell entered the store stabbed a security guard with a knife took his gun and waited for the police to come When police officer Melvin Santiago and his partner arrived Campbell shot Santiago dead Santiagos partner then shot and killed Campbell In a sickening twist a street memorial for the killer was set up in the neighborhood replete withmessages including Thug in Peace along with empty liquor bottles and balloons The city later removed the memorial Earlier this month inRochester NYpolice officer Daryl Piersonwas backing up a fellow officer who stopped a car Two occupants fled and Pierson began a pursuit on foot when he spotted a man who fit the description Seeing that Pierson was catching up to him suspect Thomas Johnson III allegedly turned fired a 25 caliber handgun and killed him A second round struck a bystander Johnson was fresh from serving three years for attempted robbery and faced parole violation Where were President Obama and Attorney General Holderafter thesepolicekillings this summerWhere were their press events or commentsWhy werent the attorney general and the other White House officials who visited Ferguson and attended the funeral of Michael Brown not dispatched to attend the funerals and offer public condolences to these officers colleagues and families Not even a phone call Where were the community organizers and rallies calling for an end to the senseless violence against the police officers who defend and protectour communities day in and day out regardless of race So far this yearpolice officer lineofduty deaths are up 16 percent from last yearand shootingrelated law enforcement fatalities are up 61 percent Where is our activist attorney general the nations top law enforcement officer on the issue of the dangers facing police every day After six years in this role where has his voice been as law enforcement officers are victimized by the unknown threat of someone theyve just stopped for speeding or a broken taillight What exactly is Holders message Is it that the police fatalities are simply acceptable losses in a profession whose workers should have known the risks when they signed up for the job  the cost of doing businessAnd where were the national media the satellite trucks and the 247 coverage of these events Exactly President Obama has had much to say about perceptions during his tenureHe and his attorney general know wellthat perceptions are formed not only by what yousay and do but also by what you dont say and what you dont do Iknow that thousands of dedicated law enforcement professionals are deafened by their silenceas they quietly pay respects to their valiant fallen colleagues The Obama administration is obviously turning its back on the brave men and women who put their lives on the line every day to serve and protect our communities Its politicization of our nations justice system only makes it more difficult for police to do jobs that are already dangerous and too often lifethreatening Of course police are not above the law and nearly all take great care to ensure that citizens rights are respected and that everyones life is secure And those police who wantonly or recklessly fail to adhere to protocol or who intentionally violate the rights of citizens should be face termination andor prosecution But that is for the courts to decideIn matters as sensitive as these the Obama administration should not be in the business of shaping public opinion to achieve an outcome that matches a political agenda Instead it should demonstrate restraint and point to the due process rights all of our citizens including the police should enjoy remaining ever mindful of the scope of its power and the delicate judicious manner in which it should be exercised  Ron Hosko is president of theLaw Enforcement Legal Defense Fund and former assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

 Dems look to new Colorado voting law to save Senate
 Ruhroh Dem congressional approval lowest since 94
 Power Play Brown breaks down his Senate strategy
 Hillary heats up rhetoric
 Leave em laughing     DEMS LOOK TO NEW COLORADO VOTING LAW TO SAVE SENATE
Colorado is the key to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reids firewall It along with Democratheld seats in Iowa and North Carolina is part of the last line of defense against Republican majority If they lose any of these three seats it would be hard to imagine Reid  Co holding the Senate And right now things arent looking good for the blue team in Colorado After an abysmal campaign by Democratic incumbent Sen Mark Udall Republican challenger Rep Cory Gardner holds a lead of nearly 3 points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls And any incumbent polling at an average of 44 percent the week before the election would ordinarily look like a sure loser But Colorados election is going to be anything but ordinary The combination of sameday registration and mailin ballots also has many on the right worried about outright fraud in what could be a razorthin vote to decide a razorthin Senate majority Even without fraud though Republicans have reason to worry

The latest NBC NewsMarist Poll gives Rep Cory Gardner RColo 46 percent to Democratic Sen Mark Udalls 45 percent

Wild West  Colorado is making its first foray into voting by mail leaving just a handful of inperson polling places around the state Similar moves in Washington and Oregon have helped cement those states as Democratic bastions after decades of dabbling in occasional Republicanism Instead of having to physically take unenthusiastic voters to the polls in vans Democrats could just catch them at home and get them to sign on the line and mail in their votes But the specifics of Colorados law as David Drucker explains go far beyond even whats been done in the Northwest As Democrats work hard to fire up Hispanic voters with talk of a mass amnesty granted by President Obama after the election Colorado also remains the only state on the midterm map to boast a large enough Latino population to provide an opportunity for Obamastyle demographic dicing to be successful As Democrats demonstrated in 2010 for Reid an organizing surge can help save an incumbent down in the polls

Washington Examiner Enough noncitizens illegally vote in US elections to potentially decide close races a new study suggests Old Dominion University political scientists Jesse Richman and David Earnest found in an article due to be published by the journal Electoral Studies that 64 percent of noncitizens voted in the 2008 elections and 22 percent voted in the 2010 midterms

Not flatfooted  Republicans though have learned some lessons in Colorado Aside from actually competing for Latino votes the GOP has also gone all in on the votebymail system With over a half million ballots received according to the most recent figures from Colorados secretary of state election offices have tallied 62000 more ballots from Republican voters than Democrats That puts the GOP in the lead with 44 percent to Dems 32 percent hardly where anyone expected the race to be given the incredible sums that Democrats have spent on advertising and organization Remember that Udall unlike some other endangered Dems is actually very liberal Hes not running against the president hes mostly been talking about ladyparts But Republican operative remain very nervous that despite a new focus in the party on pushing early voting the state is just too friendly to Democratic base turnout efforts with the new law One top GOPer told Fox News First that he thinks Garner needs to be up by more than 3 points in preelection polls to actually pull out the win

AP Former President Bill Clinton is headlining an evening rally in Aurora today Hell be promoting Udall along with Gov John Hickenlooper and congressional hopeful Andrew Romanoff

Knock knock  Whatever the case the new voting regime provides Democrats unprecedented opportunities to drive turnout even when their voters are not feeling enthusiastic Its one thing to have to go wait in line to vote but quite another to just sign on the dotted line when the party canvasser comes to your door

Fox,http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2014/07/23/banks-just-say-no-to-marijuana-businesses/,More than 20 states now permit the retail sale of marijuana to at least some consumers But those who want to purchase weed where its statelegal often will need to bring cash because many of the retailers that sell the product operate outside the US banking system Thats because federal law still classifies marijuana as an illegal substance says Rob Rowe vice president and senior counsel of the American Bankers Association a banking industry group in Washington DC Under federal law the possession or use of marijuana is illegal in all US states Banks are heavily regulated and their interactions with marijuana businesses could run afoul of not only the federal Controlled Substance Act but also several other federal statutes That would present significant risks should they decide to accept marijuana businesses as customers Since all banks are subject to federal law theyre unable to offer any banking services to marijuana business Rowe says That means marijuana services dont have access to checking or savings accounts loans or any type of card services The only payment mechanism left without access to the banking system is cash  plain and simple Credit cards and debit cards arent an option because a merchant must have a bank account to accept deposited receipts from such transactions The dilemma of pot shops might go away in the coming weeks The US House of Representatives has passed a measure that bars Treasury and securities regulators from spending money to penalize banks that provide services to legitimate marijuana businesses It has yet to go before the Senate Breaking Into the Banking System Some marijuana businesses have found ways into the banking system but most have to operate on a cashonly basis says Taylor West deputy director of the National Cannabis Industry Association a marijuana businesses group in Denver Thats an inconvenience to their customers West says Ways into the banking system include personal bank accounts holding company bank accounts and creative business names that might obscure the businesss true nature at least for a while Generally these are temporary solutions at best West says Usually what happens is a business gets set up with a bank then its doing fairly large amounts of cash transactions and that raises flags with the bank compliance officers And then they end up getting their account shut down Rowe confirms that such accounts are likely to be denied or terminated once the bank gets wise to the true type of business Banks are increasingly closing accounts when they detect its a marijuana business he says ATMs Supply Ready Cash Another workaround though less satisfactory is the installation of an ATM on the premises or nearby ATMs can help customers make cash purchases regardless of the product thats for sale says Bruce Renard executive director of the National ATM Council an ATM operators group in Jacksonville Florida To the extent that cash is needed an ATM is certainly a prime location for customers of all types of goods to get cash The wide availability of ATMs is all about convenience for customers he says Can Pot Businesses Survive Cash isnt an issue only for the customers of marijuana retailers These businesses also pay their employees utility bills and even their taxes in cash which adds up to a lot of cash on the premises and considerable security risks The implications for customers include not only the inconvenience but also constraints on how much time and energy that owners and operators have to focus on their businesses West says You end up with a business thats spending a lot of time and resources managing the logistics of cash she says Any time theyre spending time and resources on that its less time and resources that theyre spending on customer service and making the best experience for their customers Feds Try to Help One federal government agency has tried to address the issue The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network or FinCEN writes regulations intended to help protect the US financial system from money laundering and terrorist financing In February FinCEN issued guidelines that purported to clarify how banks could offer services to marijuana businesses The guidelines required banks to monitor marijuana businesses to a greater extent than other companies if they wanted to initiate banking relationships with them Banks generally took a dim view of this approach There hasnt been a wholesale opening up of the banking industry as wed hoped West says We have heard anecdotally about some cautious and quiet progress with some individual banks working with some individual businesses But its been very quiet Customers Bring Cash  for Now The bottom line is that marijuana businesses would like to operate within the US banking system and accept checks credit cards and debit cards as well as cash for purchases of their products However they might have a long wait since banks likely wont open their doors to them unless multiple federal laws are changed When coupled with extremely heightened expectation for scrutiny of the customer and the extremely risky nature of the business from a legal perspective banks have elected to just say no Rowe says Copyright 2014 Bankrate

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2014/09/25/teddy-takes-over-as-vikings-host-high-powered-falcons/,"SportsNetworkcom  Teddy is ready to take over in Minnesota As least thats what Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer believes as he prepares 
  his rookie quarterback Teddy Bridgewater for his first NFL start against the 
  Atlanta Falcons Minnesota was hoping to have much more time to groom its prized freshman 
  behind veteran bridge quarterback Matt Cassel but fate rarely cares about 
  anyones plans Cassels broken foot suffered in a 209 loss to the Saints in Week 3 has 
  accelerated the learning curve for Bridgewater dramatically and the Louisville 
  product who was once regarded as the top overall prospect in the 2014 draft 
  class will be taking over a desperate team coming off perhaps the worst week 
  in franchise history Zimmer the Vikings firstyear head coach has had to deal with the Adrian 
  Peterson childabuse scandal which robbed the organization of perhaps the best 
  pure runner in the profession a receiver in Jerome Simpson who cant stop 
  drinking and smoking marijuana even when he is suspended for those very 
  things along with seasonending injuries to Cassel and what has been the 
  clubs best offensive lineman right guard Brandon Fusco I never envisioned that Zimmer said on Wednesday But its part of 
  football Last year in Cincinnati where Zimmer was the defensive 
  coordinator we lost our best defensive tackle our best corner one of our 
  best linebackers our very good defensive end Things happen in the NFL so 
  this is a survivalofthefittest game Its always a marathon The toughest teams always go I think we have good 
  coaches here so well continue to coach the guys that are playing as hard as 
  we can and keep moving Things are so bad in Minny the fact that emerging tight end Kyle Rudolph is 
  likely on the shelf for only six to eight weeks after having sports hernia 
  surgery on Tuesday in Philadelphia is considered a positive for the 
  organization Were hopeful that hell be back soon Zimmer said Were anticipating its 
  not going to be eight weeks Like most rookies playing on the road Bridgewater left some plays on the 
  field against the Saints but he also made some plus throws and the innate 
  ability to extend plays with his athleticism He ended up 12of20 for 150 
  yards with no touchdowns or interceptions and added 27 more yards on the 
  ground I thought he did some good things obviously it was a tough situation with 
  him going in there Zimmer said Matt Asiata tallied 35 yards on 12 totes in place of Peterson who missed his 
  second straight game since allegations of child abuse surfaced against the 
  star running back The Falcons meanwhile are coming off one of the best performances in their 
  franchises history a 5614 beatdown of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers It was a recordsetting night for Atlanta wide receiverkick returner Devin 
  Hester who passed Hall of Famer and former Falcons cornerback Deion Sanders 
  for most return touchdowns in NFL history with a 62yard punt return for a 
  score in the second quarter his 20th Hester paid tribute to Sanders with an extended high step into the end zone 
  Sanders now a television analyst was in attendance at the Georgia Dome He was so happy said Hester He said he almost pulled a hamstring 
  sprinting toward the end zone with me I love that guy man He was very 
  emotional as well Earlier in the game Hester also took an end around and went 20 yards for the 
  first rushing touchdown of his career Matt Ryan completed 21of24 passes for 286 yards and three touchdowns for the 
  Falcons who bounced back from a 2410 loss to the Bengals Julio Jones caught 
  nine passes for 161 yards and two scores Even as good as tonight was I think there were areas where we can improve 
  and get better said Ryan But all in all it was a pretty good effort We 
  had good energy Steven Jackson carried the ball 14 times for 54 yards and a touchdown for 
  Atlanta which racked up 488 yards of total offense Antone Smith rushed for 
  50 yards and a score on four carries The Falcons scored the secondmost points in team history and did so without 
  wide receiver Roddy White who sat out with a hamstring injury The Vikings are 1510 alltime versus Atlanta but the Falcons have won three 
  of the past four in the series including a 2414 win the last time the two 
  teams met back on Nov 27 2011  Ryan threw for three TDs in that one 
  including a 27yarder to Harry Douglas while White has 120 receiving yards 
  and a TD WHAT TO WATCH FOR So to summarize when Bridgewater the 32nd overall pick in Mays draft makes 
  his first start for the Vikings on Sunday three of the teams topfive 
  projected playmakers will either be banished Peterson released Simpson or 
  injured Rudolph meaning Teddy Ballgame will be asked to matriculate down 
  the field with players named Asiata Adam Thielen and Rhett Ellison I dont think hes thinking Woe is me Zimmer said I think hes 
  thinking about his opportunity and what he has to do to help this football 
  team Well hes thinking a little bit Its a challenge Bridgewater admitted Youre talking about some great 
  football players being out Its all about taking advantage of what we 
  have Many believed that Bridgewater was the most polished and NFLready signal 
  caller in this years draft class and sure enough he didnt look nervous or 
  overwhelmed after replacing Cassel last week in one of the most difficult 
  places to play in the NFL the MercedesBenz Superdome and Zimmer believes 
  there is much more to come Hes ready the coach surmised Honestly I think hes been ready since the 
  day he walked in Others agree We should win every single game we play with him at quarterback Vikings 
  center John Sullivan said Falcons coach Mike Smith meanwhile admitted his game plan changed with the 
  move to Bridgewater Weve got a challenge in my mind with an athletic quarterback to be able to 
  keep him in the pocket the coach surmised As good as the Falcons have been as a whole the defense hasnt really been 
  carrying its own water surrendering 387 yards a game 27th in the NFL Of course Ryan and Co can outscore just about anyone and the veteran QB set 
  club records with  an 875 completion percentage 21of24 and a 1559 passer 
  rating in the rout over Tampa Bay in Week 3 Meanwhile the receiving group of Jones White Douglas and Hester looks 
  untenable for a Minnesota defensive backfield with only one real difference 
  maker in safety Harrison Smith OVERALL ANALYSIS The insertion of Bridgewater gives what was looking like a moribund team some 
  life but this is just not the week it will pay off Atlanta just has two many 
  weapons and the Vikings wont be able to keep up Its not all about me I dont have to do it my myself said Bridgewater

production distribution and sale of marijuana Tuesday If approved Uruguay would be the first country to regulate the marijuana market from production to retail AP PhotoMatilde CampodonicoThe Associated Press MONTEVIDEO Uruguay  Uruguays plan to set up a legal regulated marijuana market has reached its final legislative stage with the Senate expected to approve the plan by late Tuesday and send it to President Jose Mujica for his signature Senators prepared for a long day and night of speeches after debate begins Tuesday morning The body is dominated by Mujicas ruling Broad Front coalition which wants to make Uruguay the worlds first nation to put the government at the center of a legalized marijuana trade     Congress lower house already passed it and the Senate rejected all proposed amendments so Senate passage would put the law on the desk of Mujica who is one of the plans biggest boosters despite saying hes never tried pot himself This is a plague just like cigarettes are a plague Mujica told reporters recently Polls say twothirds of Uruguayans oppose the plan despite a national TV campaign and other lobbying efforts funded by billionaire currency speculator and philanthropist George Soros whose Open Society Foundation and Drug Policy Alliance campaigned for the proposal Hannah Hetzer a lobbyist for the Alliance moved to Montevideo for the campaign and celebrated the Senates expected passage Its about time that we see a country bravely break with the failed prohibitionist model and try an innovative more compassionate and smarter approach she said in a statement Monday night Mujica says the goal is to get organized crime out of marijuana dealing not to promote the use of pot The government hopes that when licensed growers providers and users can openly trade in the drug illegal traffickers will be denied their profits and go away During its hearings the Senate Health Commission received extensive arguments from educators psychiatrists and pharmacists urging it to back away from the plan Psychiatrists predicted a rise in mental illness Pharmacists said selling pot alongside prescription drugs would harm their professional image Marijuanas negative impact on learning is well known and is related to educational failure behavioral problems and depressive symptoms teacher Nestor Pereira testified representing the National Public Education Administration But Senate committees sent the proposal for a floor vote without changes hoping to avoid a return trip to the lower chamber where it passed by a single vote Socialist Deputy Julio Bango who coauthored the proposal told The Associated Press This is not a law to liberalize marijuana consumption but rather to regulate it Today there is a market dominated by drug traffickers We want the state to dominate it The project includes a media campaign launched Friday aimed at reducing pot smoking by warning of its dangers to human health Uruguays drug czar Julio Calzada said no pharmacist or other business will be forced to sell the drug Calzada said his office will have 120 days to craft regulations following adoption Mujica pledged that his government will work through the traditional southern summer holidays to make the rules as precise as possible There will be much to discuss and to work on Well spend the summer working Theres nothing magic about this the president said As for concerns that Uruguay could become a mecca for marijuana tourism Mujica stressed that the measure would restrict the legal sale of pot only to licensed and registered Uruguayan adults Marijuana grower Marcelo Vazquez told the AP he cant wait to pay taxes on the weed hes grown illegally for 20 years After repeated police raids and arrests hes optimistic He has a greenhouse of marijuana plants growing outside Montevideo and is thinking about creating a business catering to licensed growers who lack space in their own homes This is a huge opportunity and we have to take advantage of it Vazquez said My lifelong dream has been to legally cultivate marijuana and to live off this to pay my taxes,2013-12-10T00:09-05:00,drugs

  then  revealed its  findings on the following day The Ontario County District 
  Attorneys  Office announced  on Sept 16 that a grand jury would determine if 
  charges  should be  filed against  Stewart for  his involvement  in the  fatal 
  accident Ontario  County  District  Attorney  Michael  Tantillo  said  during  a  press 
  conference  on Wednesday  that approximately two dozen people testified before 
  the  grand jury  These  included  a number  of  race  car drivers  racetrack 
  employees  and  volunteers two accident reconstructionists medical personnel 
  and a number of police officers Tantillo  noted the  grand jury  reviewed a  number of  photographs and  video 
  recordings as well as other documentary evidence After  listening to and questioning all of the witnesses and reviewing all of 
  the  evidence the grand  jury has determined that there is no basis to charge 
  Tony  Stewart with any crimes His case was therefore NoBilled by the grand 
  jury Tantillo said in his opening statement Tantillo  also said  a toxicology  report indicated  that Ward  was under  the 
  influence  of marijuana at the time he was competing in the race There was no 
  toxicology work performed on Stewart A certified drug recognition expert had interviewed Stewart on the night of 
  the  collision  and determined that  he found no  basis to observe any alcohol 
  consumption or impairment by drugs Tantillo said Stewart  a threetime  champion in NASCARs premier series struck and killed 
  20yearold Ward at Canandaigua Motorsports Park The incident occurred during 
  a  caution  when Ward  climbed out  of his car  and then  walked down the dirt 
  track  pointing his finger in the direction of Stewart and apparently yelling 
  at  him to  express his displeasure The  right rear of Stewarts car hit Ward 
  and dragged him briefly across the track The  caution came  when  Stewart  and Ward  made  contact  while battling  for 
  position with Ward spinning out and hitting the wall Ward died from massive blunt trauma Following  the  announcement of the  grand jurys decision Stewart released a 
  statement  saying This  has been the toughest and most emotional experience 
  of  my life  and it will stay with  me forever Im very grateful for all the 
  support Ive received and continue to receive I  respect everything  the  District  Attorney and  Sheriffs  Office did  to 
  thoroughly  investigate  this tragic accident  While the process was long and 
  emotionally  difficult  it allowed  for all  the facts of  the accident to be 
  identified and known While  much  of the  attention has been  on me its  important to remember a 
  young man lost his life Kevin Ward Jrs family and friends will always be in 
  my thoughts and prayers NASCAR also issued a statement on the decision There  are no  winners in tragedy NASCAR chief communications officer Brett 
  Jewkes  said in the statement Our thoughts and prayers remain with the Kevin 
  Ward Jr family and Tony Stewart as they all cope with this tragic incident at 
  Canandaigua  Motorsports Park  This has  been a  difficult time  for everyone 
  involved  and  we  have  respected  the  local  authorities  responsible  for 
  reviewing this case The  Ontario  County Sheriffs Department conducted a monthlong investigation 
  of  the incident  before handing its findings over to the district attorney on 
  Sept  11  Among the  evidence handed  over to the  district attorney were two 
  videos of the accident  one which was seen by the public and the other being 
  the racetracks own video The  videos actually  did not  demonstrate any  aberrational driving  by Tony 
  Stewart  until the point of impact with Kevin Ward at which point his vehicle 
  veered  to  the right  up the track  as a result  of the collision Tantillo 
  said Prior to that his course was pretty straight Stewart  missed  three Sprint Cup  Series races   Watkins Glen Michigan and 
  Bristol  while he was in seclusion following the incident at Canandaigua He 
  returned to competition the last weekend in August at Atlanta Stewart did not 
  qualify  for the Chase  for the Sprint Cup championship The series will be at 
  Dover this weekend for the third race in the Chase    ",2014-09-24T20:18-04:00,drugs

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/money/2014/08/03/uruguay-marijuana-marketplace-program-could-be-going-up-in-smoke/,"MONTEVIDEO Uruguay AP  Uruguays plan to create the worlds first national governmentregulated marketplace for legal pot may be going up in smoke Delays in implementing the plan are putting it at risk as polls point to opposition gains in Octobers election and say most Uruguayans oppose a legal pot marketplace Opposition politicians have said they will seek to repeal or modify the legislation which gives the national government power to oversee the production sales and consumption of marijuana I am convinced that the current project is never going to be applied the principal opposition presidential candidate Luis Lacalle Pou told The Associated Press The entire project is not workable The pharmacies dont want to sell the drug and nobody is going to register as a user as the law obliges The legislation which went into effect in May allows for the growing of pot by licensed individuals the formation of growers and users clubs the sale by pharmacies of 40 grams of pot a month to registered users and the tracking of legally grown marijuana through a system of genetic markers of authorized plants President Jose Mujica and his Broad Front movement have promoted the plan as a way to deal with rising homicide and crime rates associated with drug trafficking and the increasing use of crack cocaine In the last 13 years the homicide rate in Uruguay has increased by 21 percent and the rate of violent robbery by 250 percent Officials say a legal pot market could provide an alternative to crack and reduce the power of drug gangs The appearance of drug trafficking signified a brutal cultural change in the world of crime and a nearly absolute disregard for the value of life Mujica told the AP in May So we decided to try to snatch away a part of that market It wasnt until Friday almost three months after the pot law went into effect that the government made its first call for applications from those interested in growing pot for the legal market It said after registration closes Aug 18 bidders will be winnowed to a short list of candidates from which up to five will be chosen to get a license for legal cultivation Officials have given conflicting dates for when the drug might reach pharmacies ranging from late this year to sometime in 2015 Experts say the delays are due to the fact that no other country has attempted such a plan and that authorities still lack detailed plans and rules for creating the market Disagreements within the government over basic aspects of the proposal are also holding things back Opposition Colorado Party presidential candidate Pedro Bordaberry said The entire project is one big improvisation The man in charge of the program Julio Calzada has dismissed concerns insisting the bids to select growers will be a success and the project will go forward While Mujicas marijuana plan was widely applauded globally and seen as going beyond marijuana legislation in the US states of Colorado and Washington most Uruguayans oppose it The most recent poll said only 27 percent of Uruguayans surveyed approve of the law and 64 percent oppose it Sixtytwo percent said they want the law repealed The survey by the polling firm Cifra questioned 1001 people between July 4 and 15 and had an error margin of three percentage points People are against drugs and dont distinguish between them said Adriana Raga director of Cifra For a small educated sector  very small  marijuana is something special But for the great majority of Uruguayans all drugs are bad and marijuana is another bad drug the same as base cocaine paste With elections nearing politicians are paying heed to public opinion The top opposition candidates are supporting repeal or modification of the law Polls indicate a tight race in October congressional and presidential elections between the Broad Front and the opposition None of the seven presidential candidates appears capable of getting enough votes to win outright in the first round That would set up a runoff on the last Sunday in November between the two top votegetters For the law to be out of peril the Broad Front has to win both the presidency and a majority in congress which it currently barely controls The data that we now have does not show this is happening said Raga of Cifra There are still three months of campaigning to go but as of today it is not our hypothesis Uruguays main polling companies say around 40 percent of Uruguayans intend to vote for the leftist governing coalition which would need almost 50 percent to keep its grip on the legislature Lacalle Pou who is second in the presidential race has said he would try to repeal the articles of the law that allow for the sale of marijuana in pharmacies Other factions in his conservative National Party want to overturn the law altogether Even the farleft Popular Unity coalition has said its legislators might oppose the legislation if they are elected Commercialization of marijuana by the state is the wrong road to take said Pablo Mieres presidential candidate for the fourthplace

has planned a visit to Colorado next week to talk up the measure Labeling opponents in Colorado feel confident theyll be able to defeat the proposal Theyve spent just about 3 million on television ads according to campaign finance data analyzed by the Center for Public Integrity The ads call the labeling measure misleading because it doesnt cover many foods in the grocery store including eggs meat dairy and beer Those foods arent currently genetically modified though animals are often raised on feed that has been modified Labels also wouldnt be required on foods and drinks sold for immediate consumption by grocery stores restaurants or delis Proponents said those foods are regulated in different code sections making them impossible to include in a single ballot question But opponents say the differences would confuse shoppers Labels on food are very important to me They need to be very reliable and not leave people making assumptions said Mary Lee Chin a registered dietitian who volunteers for the opposition campaign Chin said GMOs can help the environment by producing foods that require less water or fewer pesticides Genetic engineering techniques theyre a more efficient way of growing foods said Chin who has worked as a consultant for Monsanto in the past but no longer works for the company Colorado and Oregon could become the first states to adopt mandatory GMO labels through public votes Washington and California rejected GMO ballot proposals in recent years Vermont lawmakers have approved GMO label requirements but the matter is still being fought in the courts Publicly available polling is limited on GMO label requirements Colorado State University looked at the question 14 years ago and found mixed results In that 2000 survey shoppers along the Front Range were asked about genetically modified potatoes A whopping 78 percent supported mandatory labeling   but respondents were not willing to pay a premium for such labeling Farming groups opposed to mandatory labeling argue it would make food more expensive though the sides disagree on how much Proponents are hoping Colorado is now ready to make GMO labels mandatory This issue is really resonating with people They want to know whats in their food said Kelly Erb spokeswoman for Right To Know Colorado The GMO question is one of four statewide ballot measures Coloradans will decide next month Dozens more ballot questions are pending in other states on everything from guns to marijuana to gambling More than 1 billion dollars will likely be spent on campaigns this year for ballot measures according to the Center for Public Integrity Thats more than the Republican and Democratic parties have raised collectively this cycle CPI looked at television ad spending on all ballot measures nationwide Other highlights from Colorado    A measure to allow casino gambling at a horse racetrack in suburban Denver Amendment 68 has attracted more TV spending than any ballot question outside California Supporters have spent about 64 million on 5582 television ads Opponents have spent about 57 million on 6390 ads    A measure to add unborn human beings to Colorado criminal code is as lopsided as the GMO measure Opponents are the only ones on TV Abortionrights groups that fear the measure could harm reproductive rights and had spent about 477000 on television ads through Oct 20

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/01/22/anti-drug-groups-rebuke-obama-over-marijuana-remarks/, President Obama is taking a hit from antidrug groups for downplaying the effects of marijuana use as some point out his recent comments appear to clash with statements by his own health and law enforcement agencies The president in a recent interview with The New Yorker likened pot to cigarettes and alcohol     As has been well documented I smoked pot as a kid and I view it as a bad habit and a vice not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life I dont think it is more dangerous than alcohol Obama said He added that smoking marijuana is not something I encourage and is a bad idea a waste of time not very healthy But antidrug and public health organizations have since seized on the remarks claiming the president is giving a muddy picture of the medical downsides of marijuana His laissezfaire attitude about legalization has drug policy and prevention experts scratching their heads in confusion as to why the President will not give clear guidance on this important issue The DrugFree America Foundation said on its website President Obama is surrounded by a myriad of experts who have voiced serious concerns about the harms of marijuana and rejected legalization so either he is seriously illinformed about the issue or is completely ignoring warnings from his highlyesteemed advisers Obamas comments were made to the backdrop of Colorado and Washington state legalizing and regulating marijuana His remarks could be taken as another signal that his administration will not interfere with their experiment  though recreational marijuana use remains illegal under federal law The president echoed the argument that prolegalization advocates often make stressing the cost to society of locking up minor drug offenders Middleclass kids dont get locked up for smoking pot and poor kids do Obama said And AfricanAmerican kids and Latino kids are more likely to be poor and less likely to have the resources and the support to avoid unduly harsh penalties But his administration and those of his predecessors repeatedly have documented and publicized health risks from the drug Obamas own Office of National Drug Control Policy still states on its website that the administration steadfastly opposes legalization of marijuana and other drugs The office lists a range of negative health and mental consequences from the drug including schizophrenia lower IQ as much as an 8 point drop and higher risk of heart attack The National Institute on Drug Abuse says the drug is addictive with nearly 42 million people having a pot abuse or addiction problem in 2011 The agency says the drug is linked to school failure and high doses can cause psychosis or panic when youre high The American Society of Addiction Medicine released a statement on Tuesday noting that the drug impairs memory motor function and respiratory health when smoked  and can be addictive Addiction is a chronic brain disease that can affect people at any age In fact the younger one initiates alcohol or drug use the greater the likelihood that he or she has addictive disease ASAM President Stuart Gitlow said A recurring rebuttal to the presidents comments is that weed today is stronger than it was when say Obama smoked it The White House drug office says studies show the potency has almost tripled over the past 20 years The president attracted a rebuke along those lines from former Democratic Rep Patrick Kennedy who told MSNBC that Obamas director in charge of drug abuse would tell him that in fact todays modern genetically modified marijuana  so its much higher THC levels  far surpass the marijuana that the president acknowledges smoking when he was a young person He said the presidents remarks were wrong Despite the discord Colorado is charging ahead with launching the nations first legal pot trade and other states are considering loosening their own rules The New Hampshire House recently approved a legalization bill Advocates point to the legal and personal costs to individuals of continuing to prosecute a fullthroated drug war FBI stats show hundreds of thousands of people are arrested every year for marijuana Obama in his interview suggested there is hypocrisy in the system since those writing drug laws have probably done the same thing as those being locked up,2014-01-22T11:05-05:00,drugs

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/28/big-number-governors-in-tight-races-sets-stage-for-potential-record-number/, A staggering number of US governors are in political peril ahead of next weeks elections setting the stage for a potentially historic wipeout from Alaska to Florida if incumbents cant hold on Of the threedozen governors facing reelection this year estimates and surveys generally show about 10 incumbents either trailing or running close to even in their races One survey from Governing magazine pegs the number at 18 including eight competitive races     If the challengers can rally it will be a year for the history books The last time 10 or more governors lost was in 1962 when 11 out of 26 were defeated  We could easily see a record because all of these tossups are really really close said Louis Jacobson who handicapped the races for Governing The incumbents in Governings 10 tossup races are a mix of seven Republicans and three Democrats and include such highprofile state leaders as Colorados John Hickenlooper a Democrat and Floridas Rick Scott a Republican The others are Michigan Republican Rick Snyder Georgia Republican Nathan Deal Alaska Republican Sean Parnell Wisconsin Republican Scott Walker Kansas Republican Sam Brownback Connecticut Democrat Dan Malloy Illinois Democrat Pat Quinn and Maine Republican Paul LePage A survey by The Washington Post lists 10 tossups while University of Virginia professor and political analyst Larry Sabato puts the number at seven All three surveys show Pennsylvania Republican Gov Tom Corbett  who is trailing Democratic challenger Tom Wolf by doubledigits in the polls  headed for defeat What exactly is driving the tight electoral landscape this year is likely a mix of factors Jacobson argues that several Republican governors are on the endangered list because they were elected in Democratleaning states in the 2010 GOP wave election In some states Democrats have been able to rebound He also points to overall dissatisfaction with incumbents though cautions that recordlevel voter disapproval for Washington doesnt necessarily trickle down to governors Caleb P Burns a Republican adviser and attorney with the Washington DC law firm Wiley Rein LLP agrees that the political map is indeed significant pointing out that nearly half of the imperiled governors are Republicans in Democraticleaning or swing states It may simply be the wave is receding he said The Republican governors elected in 2010 might not be able to make a strong enough argument again to dispel constituents of their predispositions Democrats are embattled too The rise and fall of Colorados Hickenlooper who made all three lists appears to be a product of both his own decisions and circumstances beyond his control He enjoyed strong approval ratings early in his term while working with a GOPled House only to see them unravel after voters gave Democrats control of both chambers in 2013 Hickenlooper signed more than 400 bills last year including ones on the environment and gun control that infuriated conservatives in the swing state Doing so much so fast in one year was a big bite to take the firstterm governor recently told Governing a nonpartisan publication focusing on state and local government And he conceded in a recent debate against Republican challenger and former Rep Bob Beauprez that Colorado was reckless last year in legalizing recreational marijuana Beauprez leads by 2 percentage points 45to43 percent according to an averaging of polls by the website RealClearPolitics In Florida Scott has steadily closed the lead of frontrunning Democratic challenger Charlie Crist  in one of the oddest tightest and most expensive gubernatorial races Crist a former Florida Republican governor has twice changed political parties He also triggered a bizarre incident when he brought a fan on stage before a recent debate which resulted in Scott delaying the start  and a barrage of media coverage mocking the dispute The 627 million spent so far on TV ads according to a Center for Public Integrity media analysis helps make it the one of the costliest gubernatorial races of the year Scott along with Republican governors in Maine and Michigan were elected in Democratleaning states in the 2010 election Jacobson though points to a few outlier tossup races in which GOP incumbents are in jeopardy of losing in Republicanleaning Alaska Kansas and Georgia In Kansas Gov Sam Brownback for example appears to have alienated voters with his strong conservative agenda that has included pushing tax cuts resulting in state budget problems and eliminating teacher tenure In Alaska Parnell is the victim of an unusual political wrench called a fusion ticket Democratic nominee Bryon Mallott quit the race to become lieutenant governor for Republicanturnedindependent Bill Walker in an effort to team up and oust Parnell In Wisconsin which like Colorado has a history of electing Democratic and Republican governors embattled GOP Gov Scott Walker is again fighting to keep his post landing him in the tossup category Walkers successful 2011 efforts to roll back collective bargaining powers for most public employees  to help reduce the states budget deficit  resulted in a 2012 recall election that he survived Republicans continue to strongly support Walker but polls show very little Democratic support in a race that will likely hinge on voter turnout He and Democratic challenger Mary Burke are now virtually tied according to RealClearPolitics President Obama is heading to that state late Tuesday to try and boost Burkes candidacy,2014-10-28T13:17-04:00,drugs

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/10/09/secret-service-scandal-cover/,This is a rush transcript from The Five October 9 2014 This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated GREG GUTFELD COHOST Hello everyone Im Greg Gutfeld along with Kimberly Guilfoyle Bob Beckel Eric Bolling and she was married to a Smurf in the 90s its Dana Perino this is The Five     You remember the Colombian prostitution scandal that vanished after all those Secret Service agents were punished According to The Washington Post they werent the only ones hiring hookers A young White House staffer and son of a big Democratic donor was there too Was he punished as well Well if you call landing a gig at the Office of Womens Global Issues punishment then yes he did So I guess he was just doing undercover work in Colombia witnessing the injustices up close Maybe the producers at MSNBC will buy that excuse Worse The Post reports that the White House may have had the report on the scandal put off until after the election But thats not like them at all Benghazi the IRS they would never bury something to save an election knowing the media would oblige Who were the hookers again I certainly hope Media Matters get its talking points out soon to dismiss this story and demonize the reporters chasing it Yet while we wonder what happened to those missing EPA emails or that impending report on Bowe Bergdahl which likely wont come out until after the elections wheres Waldo I mean Obama Fundraising with Gwyneth Its the only part of politics hes good at I blame global warning And so as agents and military men were punished a skeevy White House merrily skipped to reelection with their cronies rewarded a machinery impervious to consequence thanks to its media enablers Its a fine web they weave where everyone gets screwed except those who paid in advance So KG I want to read this statement from Richard Sauber hes the attorney representing Jonathan  Dach Dach Whatever Dach the kid that was over there KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE COHOST Right the aide GUTFELD That apparently was linked to prostitution He says the allegations about any inappropriate contact by Jonathan Dach in Cartagena are utterly and completely false hes ducking the question When he arrives he was met at the airport by US embassy staff driven to the hotel checkedin went to dinner and promptly went to bed exhausted So we think theres nothing wrong there KG he would say that but its kinda strange that he gets a plum job all these guys get fired or demoted but he gets a great job In a weird way it shows how the White House is willing to protect the mother ship at the expense of these agents GUILFOYLE And the answer was in the call of the question I comment you with that Greg Youre exactly right GUTFELD I dont wanna do that GUILFOYLE Its a double standard right And it shows the hypocrisy of the administration because they fired secret service agents for the same conduct even though they said well listen prostitution is legal in Cartagena in Colombia so this was okay They were committing an offense there as always its the coverup that is the most agreedous of the crime that aspect of it But he why are they saying hes okay to work for them if the secret service agents are not Why And that they covered it up as well Thats the problem here GUTFELD Thats I think to coverup putting it off which happens to be a regular thing for them So Kermit if I can ask you this question this is not  The Washington Post is not a crack pot website This is The Washington Post how can any of the left wing blogs or the liberal media dismiss this DANA PERINO COHOST Thats why theyre a little bit compound  you know theyre floundering a little bit because theyre not exactly sure Carol Leonnig and David Nakamura have been writing pieces of  theyre experts on the secret service issues GUTFELD Right PERINO Number one GUILFOYLE Number one PERINO But there are also  theyre seasoned reporters that do a lot of investigative  investigatory things So if I were the White House press secretary if I saw this piece Id say Is there something I dont know What do they know that we dont know that somebody here hasnt told me or what questions am I not asking Basically right before  as soon as the piece posted the White House was on the record saying its totally false But interesting thing for me is this part where it says that a lead government investigator told the investigators that he was pressured by superiors to withhold evidence because a link to the White House would be potentially embarrassing to the administration The reason theyre having a big problem I think at the White House defending this is that they know that these reporters theyre not just going to throw in the inaudible their reputations are on the line I would also note that The Washington Post has not changed the story Theyve not taken it down theres not been any editing of it and I think there would have been if there was problem Why are you laughing at me GUILFOYLE Shes right GUTFELD No this is the Kermit thought it is the beautiful sweater CROSSTALK PERINO No I didnt hear anything I just said It was brilliant GUTFELD It is brilliant Eric is gonna add to that brilliance ERIC BOLLING COHOST In view  I pull the same line I mean its a 15page online 15page  piece and I pulled the same line Here is what they quote lead as saying we investigator With he was told to withhold and alter forget withhold I mean withhold is bad enough PERINO Yeah alter BOLLING Told to alter certain information in his report because it is potentially damaging to the administration Wow I mean that isnt  the people will say You know maybe the IRS isnt a scandal or Benghazi is not a scandal If someone from the White House tells an IG to withhold and alter information until after an election I would call that definitely a scandal Can I talk briefly about this young guy this Jonathan Dach I believe I could be wrong with that 25yearold advance goes to Colombia and then ends up at least loosely tied by these investigators with this prostitute and then comes back and he is point out gets a job in the Office of Womens Global Issues at the White House and his father the rich donor works in the administration as well GUTFELD Yeah and it has given at least 20000 to President Obama and thousands to other  to the Democratic Party So Bob GUILFOYLE Theyre good to their friend GUTFELD Yeah theyre good to the friend GUILFOYLE They are good with that GUTFELD So Bob I cant  I none of us can expect the president to know or be responsible any for illicit activity this going on in Colombia but the coverup to save the election weve talked about this and you admit this isnt a practice Thats pretty unconscionable BOB BECKEL COHOST Well it  first of all I want to go through this one the  it was not the White House who fire the secret service agents secret service itself made that decisions Secondly back then I defended the secret service guys who were bachelors because its legal they are off duty Now I will be more than happy even further happy to defend this kid he was a volunteer and its legal PERINO But he said it didnt happen BECKEL Pardon me PERINO He said it didnt happen BECKEL Im not defending his line Im just saying the thing what happen GUILFOYLE He is lying PERINO So youre saying that hes lying GUILFOYLE Yeah BECKEL Can I have a second please If I had that information and I were involved in politics and it was 30  60 days before the campaign I would bury it too BOLLING Wait wait You would tell someone to bury the information with after BECKEL He was a volunteer I could care less BOLLING No no no Who cares what the kid did Its the fact that they  this Nieland David Nieland is the lead investigator the IG was told by the White House to bury the information You dont think thats a conspiracy BECKEL This was a nonemployee of the federal government who was doing exactly PERINO Who got rewarded with a job in the federal government GUILFOYLE Bob is telling BECKEL Thats a mistake Thats a bad mistake I would have a word  I would send him on his way But  thats not the point I mean to make a big deal out of this this is a lot of a big deal but CROSSTALK BOLLING He was told by the White House to bury the information Forget about what he did Who cares with a 25yearold kid does in Colombia Its the fact the White House leans on an IG to bury and alter certain information because of an election GUILFOYLE He doesnt care BECKEL If you ever been in a campaigns when things are close like that and something comes up that is not illegal youll bury it GUTFELD But Bob that  this is the son of a donor BECKEL So GUTFELD His gots but he didnt  everybody got thrown under the bus but him Thats pretty disgusting BECKEL Why should he thrown up out there under the bus GUILFOYLE Special treatment GUTFELD Well he might have been involved BECKEL Honest GUTFELD And we have on top of that the fact that they delayed the report until after the election which seems to be a practice which is what happened  GUILFOYLE And they were told to alter it I mean come on BOLLING Can I add one more layer of the why GUILFOYLE Assuming candles ph No one is shocked anymore by anything BOLLING Because the whole issue about this was these people the advance team knew exactly where President Obama was gonna be at every single point of the way They had car services booked from to go here to here to here and if youre sleeping with a prostitute who knows where she comes from and if youre leaving her that information if youre drunk sleeping with her then maybe the world knows where President Obama is gonna be at what time GUTFELD Thats why it matters BECKEL OK Alright I think we obviously have different  but this is a 25yearold kid is PERINO First of all hes not a kid Hes 25years old OK That is a man Hes making decisions on his own He got his dad happened to be a rich guy who used to give money to the Democrats fine Goes on to serve in the administration at HHS or yeah HHS then his son gets a plum assignment while everybody else has to take the fall What kind of a man is that Besides I actually care about the women GUTFELD The women at work at the  yes PERINO Well and also the women in Colombia GUTFELD Yeah PERINO This is someones daughter mother sister these are women that have either chosen because of bad circumstances or pushed into or forced into a situation that is terrible and I dont think that  I dont like it that even if he is a volunteer he still got paid government money to pay for his expenses I dont want my government dollars to go exploiting women and then I mean you just got to hope theyre being humorous about it that giving them a job at the Office of Global Womens Issue at the State Department GUILFOYLE The irony is not lost on us PERINO I wonder how the spokespeople at the State Department feel about it GUILFOYLE And who has a war against women I ask you BECKEL That was  that really was a fall that you could possibly  GUILFOYLE On top of everything else theyre just stupid GUTFELD Yeah BECKEL I cant imagine  GUILFOYLE But theres moral of equivalency here You know  the bad thing GUTFELD Let me go to  let me  Im gonna go to you Kimberly after this This is a substantial ph tape of Congressman Chaffetz and Ronald Kessler slamming the White House double standard in this scandal BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JASON CHAFFETZ UTAH CONGRESSMAN There were nearly two dozen secret service and military personnel that were either fired or reprimanded but the concern is that when it came to the White House and the White House taking care of its own personnel totally different standard and perhaps a misdirection and some coverup RONALD KESSLER AUTHOR Its really the White House thats the key here and they perpetuated a double standard where secret service agents were fired for hiring prostitutes as they should have been yet their own aide was involved and they covered it up END OF VIDEO CLIP GUTFELD So there is a lot of double standards here One of these  I keep thinking if this was under President Bush they would blame it on his frat boy past GUILFOYLE And it would be front page Do you understand that The unfair dealing lack of moral standards CROSSTALK BECKEL This is not President Bush PERINO Why were we  were not in a corner GUTFELD Im in the corner President Obama is GUILFOYLE The whole thing is  this is how offensive it is They keep outdoing themselves like Oh you think that scandal was bad we got another one They just jumped it every time GUTFELD Thats true there will be another one PERINO It would have been a culture  they would have said it was a culture of allowing this type of bad behavior to happen turned a blind eye to it That was  what the accusation  BECKEL They made it a terrible blunder giving this guy a job afterwards no question about that I think youve now elevated this to a scandalize this Its as sad into our  skill GUTFELD But PERINO Its not the point Bob CROSSTALK GUTFELD Ive dont really think that the job is the problem PERINO He told the investigators to lie BECKEL No Is ay this  I understand that Im just saying that  I can sort of understand that GUILFOYLE Youre talking about the act itself that you dont have a moral problem with Were talking about the fact that they covered it up BECKEL One question at a time Can I answer your question GUILFOYLE Yeah GUTFELD But you keep interrupting them GUILFOYLE Right LAUGHTER GUTFELD The point is we get it You dont think that act is a big deal Were talking about the lie BECKEL Cover up GUTFELD The cover up OK PERINO And the media is complicit BECKEL Which portion should I respond GUTFELD Anywhere you want BECKEL OK Greg GUTFELD Yes keep it on Bob GUILFOYLE Youre running out of time LAUGHTER PERINO To the cover up I want to hear that BECKEL If I were in a campaign I would run it and somebody came to me and said Bob one of our volunteers who were helping the presidents advance got hooked up with a prostitute in Colombia Id say Is it illegal No I said Those wait for that until the campaign is over BOLLING OK Then take it one step further with the  which is a Dana points out with the White House did today and said This is absolutely false The Washington Post reporter that CROSSTALK BOLLING But here  they are right Correct Because now theyve gone on record saying this is false its not true and when GUILFOYLE And now we know it is BOLLING When theres some link to this guy and that prostitute to that room youre going to have the White House again again lying to the American people GUTFELD One last thing quick Dana the Bowe Bergdahl report when is that coming out Is that gonna come out after the election PERINO I dont know when it is coming out GUTFELD Yeah PERINO I would say this if the White House is sitting on that report and they are thinking that it is a smart thing to do to wait until after the election to reveal whatever information is in that report because they think it would possibly hurt them in the midterms but I dont think it would Ive been  but the midterms are gonna be what they gonna be Theyre holding that report back to be try to protect the president I think thats unconscionable and I hope that the press is asking them where is that report GUILFOYLE Yeah unethical BECKEL Is this about the guy that went AWOL and  GUTFELD Yeah BECKEL That would be his mistake GUTFELD Alright Dont go away Your Ebola update is up next on The Five COMMERCIAL BREAK GUILFOYLE We turn now to the Ebola scare 200 airplane cabin cleaners walked off the job today at New Yorks LaGuardia airport They say they fear for their safety because theyre not protected enough from possible exposure to Ebola BEGIN VIDEO CLIP HECTOR FIGUEROA PRESIDENT OF 32BJ SEIU Were here today inaudible because we can no longer tolerate unsafe working conditions The whole country is shivering worried about the problems of Ebola Airport workers are on the front line of protecting the public To protect the public we have to protect the workers END OF VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE Well meanwhile five airports to the US are going to be testing travelers from West Africa for fevers when they arrive here in the United States something we talked about before that we thought they should have started doing right away in addition to grounding some of the flights Eric do they have the right call here the right opinion to say Listen were not protected enough we dont have the right gear BOLLING The airport workers GUILFOYLE Yeah BOLLING Yeah I feel bad for them I really do Look we dont know enough and they said we need to be better trained we need more equipment we need more things to make sure that theyre safe thats all theyre asking for I am no fan of unions and workers walking off the job but in this case man I got to tell you when its life or death I got to say Im kind of understand that Why five airports Why not 500 airports Why not all airports why not all incoming flights from one of those three countries GUTFELD I can address that Its a symbolic gesture BOLLING Right GUTFELD Which the White House loves to do and the problem  this is an important thing When you do something for show it always replaces doing something that actually solves the problem PERINO Right GUTFELD And we live in an age where solutions are being replaced by symbolism and symbolic gestures when they replace solutions are deadlier than doing nothing that what scares me BECKEL I think its fair to say it would be difficult to cover 500 airports I dont know how many people work there but I think it should be more than that and by the way I want this data record LAUGHTER GUILFOYLE I know what youre going to say BECKEL And its my goal that you finally said something supportive over union Im glad to it BOLLING No no no the point is if your life is on the line BECKEL Right BOLLING OK GUILFOYLE Just say OK BOLLING OK LAUGHTER GUILFOYLE Dana OK PERINO OK Im gonna disagree GUTFELD Really PERINO Because I have been persuaded by Dr Frieden who runs the CDC who explained today in an oped that I thought was very well argued why he thinks it is a bad thing to shut down all the airports GUILFOYLE So articulated PERINO And all the flights from there I thought well its quite lengthy GUILFOYLE OK PERINO But one of the things he was saying is the difficulty of actually doing that of needing to fight the problem as the source of actually it being kind of infective because people could be in those countries go another country then come here That  youre not solving the problem He argues that you could make it worst if you shut down those airports So I   Im just gonna say  I trust them They have to grapple with much larger and bigger issues than I have to they actually have the responsibility  front line responsibility for it so GUTFELD Yeah I would like to think that they know what theyre doing I agree with you on that PERINO Yes We will find out eight months from now GUILFOYLE Well we would think so except for the fact they sent people into the apartment without proper HAZMAT material I mean this is  I dont understand I think theyre kind of playing catchup on this debate obviously a very bright man I know he went to my place I like the fact he went to the scene he went to the heart of the scene he went there to Liberia to see it for himself fantastic But what harm does it take  honestly I disagree with his argument and Ive heard him I read it about shutting down the airports I think you should do that Dont let the flight come in until we do what he said which is contain it at the source Shut it down there CROSSTALK PERINO Apparently they also are having a really  theyre being criticized by some health care workers and doctors including  our airport workers despite having a lack of information GUILFOYLE Right PERINO So we have a lot of different ways to communicate with people now through phones also through different ways and it feels like the health care workers including of a very a senior doctor I talked to this week that doesnt anything to do with Ebola but she is concerned because shes heard nothing and she would like to know  she would like to know more BECKEL I thought it was the sheriffs department that sent that guy in Ebola wasnt it GUILFOYLE Yeah but this is my point Why  its your problem  because they werent even supposed to have to go in there Its not their job they said it should have been federal employees to go in They went out in without the proper material The point is this isnt a tight operation they want us to be instead because theres a worldwide shortage of the medicine to treat Ebola Youve Dr Kent Brantly driving the survivor with the serum the antibodies in his body So he stopped twice now to give blood to donate because they dont even have the proper medicine theres a worldwide shortage to save people I mean its BECKEL Does the fault really lie to air with the police department knowing that its put them in and wait PERINO Well I know I actually think it gets back to the bigger point that the CDC has  I think you could argue they have been late and that they have been lax in their communication of how to actually prepare and be ready for it Even if you are at a local police department like a bulletin board like FYI everybody be aware of this little email that goes out somewhat GUILFOYLE It happened Dr Frieden when this first happen said Its not necessary to wear HAZMAT materials to go into the scene BOLLING Right GUILFOYLE HE said that And then five days later when they couldnt find anyone to go in and clean the apartment then the people go in with the HAZMAT BOLLING If this is GUILFOYLE Oh and then theres the sheriff that is in the hospital that theyre still testing for Ebola markers even though he was just in there you know walked in and he said he didnt touch any bodily fluids So did they really know how it spread some say BOLLING Thats the problem and theyre analyzing  and Greg may be 100 percent right and we are overreacting but as things start to come out we realize we werent 100 percent accurate on certain things It wouldnt be a bad idea Can I throw a controversial  a provocative thought on the table Shouldnt we GUILFOYLE Can you tell me what it is first LAUGHTER BOLLING Shouldnt we be profiling people who we suspect of having or potentially having Ebola BECKEL Thats what youre doing CROSSTALK PERINO I think you profile them by saying have you been traveling to those area or living there Thats  I mean that kind of profiling BOLLING Yes you show symptoms you come from that  part of the world PERINO I think thats what they are doing BOLLING I dont know it sounds like theyre taking five airports and hope they can catch some GUTFELD Yeah I think  I have to say that we  its  what if questions are great on talk shows but hysteria it can be as contagious as the disease and at times by act  getting people to act irrationally is actually deadlier because people do not take careful precautions when they panic And I know that  you know for television its good to be concerned but you got to control GUILFOYLE I think this is controlled and measured and perhaps GUTFELD I dont know about you Kimberly GUILFOYLE Coming up GUTFELD I think youre out of control GUILFOYLE Completely just inside Were gonna guess you up to speed on whats happening now in races across the country ahead of the fast approaching midterm elections Dana got the low down next Stay with us COMMERCIAL BREAK PERINO That song was written for Greg Gutfeld OK the midterm election there is 26 days away where the things stand A Fox News poll shows Republicans trending ahead in five battleground Senate races Alaska Arkansas Colorado Kansas and Kentucky Theres been a lazy and surprised though in South Dakota they could spell trouble for the GOP the independent candidate in the threeway contest is just behind the Republican FrontRunner In North Carolina the race remains tight between incumbent Democrat Kay Hagan and her GOP challenger Tom Tillis Tillis has been attacking her record on terror accusing her of skipping a hearing on ISIS last month to attend a fundraiser On Tuesday the senator admitted it was true BEGIN VIDEO CLIP QUESTION Did you miss any of the meetings specifically for a fundraiser KAY HAGAN UNITED STATES SENATOR You know there was one and what was happened at that hearing it was scheduled early in the day and then votes were scheduled and that hearing then that hearing then had to be postponed later that day So yes I did miss that one END OF VIDEO CLIP PERINO OK Were going to talk about that But first Bob I have two questions for you First has your October surprise that you predicted happened yesterday BECKEL No It hasnt PERINO Is it still going to happen GUTFELD Its the secret service GUILFOYLE Hes still making it up BECKEL No PERINO OK Heres what I want to ask you out of  most presidents  that I will show a full screen here Most president that have a second term when they go to put the midterm election and that that sixth year they usually lose you could look all of that except for Bill Clinton believe it or not I was able to pick up some seats but that was partly because they were running against impeachment The hardest thing to measure that I have learned from you Bob is turnout in the midterm elections So has that gotten any better with the technology and more sophisticated modeling BECKEL No actually in some ways it hasnt Its gotten worse and Ill tell you why Its one of the problems with trying to poll at this stage of the game is that the assumption is and its right that the Republicans have momentum on their side You can ask that question and more Republicans say yes than Democrats But with the proliferation of absentee ballots more and more states are turning to early voting and people like it Look at Oregon they had two months now Far too long But we used to determine  we used to think to ourselves theres a lot of absentee ballots and that meant there was going to be a fairly large turnout What were finding out is that people are voting absentee because they dont want to vote on election day Theyve got other things going on And theres nothing that  nobody comes back with UNINTELLIGIBLE Oh youre really not absent Thats one thing The second thing is people are voting in the local elections that we dont take into account most of these pollsters Very hot local elections whether its for mayor or whether its for lieutenant governor It could be any number of things but you have to look up and down the ballot People go in to vote GUILFOYLE Right Whats the draw right BECKEL Right And theyre going to be in there theyre going to probably vote for the Senate So the problem with focusing on the Senate alone is that you really cant get the turnout exactly right which is why this thing  I mean my own guess is theyre probably  there certainly will be an increase in Republican turnout I just dont know how you could measure it now and its getting more and more difficult all the time So thats my  oh and the last thing I would say is referendums and initiatives Theres so much money being spent on so many of those in the states that allow them that thats increasing turnout around a set of issues that have nothing to do with this PERINO Like legalizing the marijuana BECKEL OK Greg let me ask you Does it matter that Senator Kay Hagan whos running for the clip we showed shes admitted finally that she didnt go to a hearing for a fundraiser does it matter GUTFELD No shes just following the example of her great leader Its always been about winning elections taking precedence over winning wars Its based on a toxic ideology that American military expression of might is evil and imperialistic Can I talk about the Senate races PERINO Yes please GUTFELD They arent running against each other Theyre running from Obama which makes me return to the conclusion Ive gone to many times if winning an election demands that you dump the consequences of liberalism why not dump them for good Because youre liars hypocrites and selfpromoting jerks GUILFOYLE Wow PERINO Im going to ask Eric about the economy but let me GUILFOYLE Can I talk about Kay Hagan too PERINO Sure GUILFOYLE Just a little bit PERINO Yes GUILFOYLE OK So I think shes got to be ahead maybe like by three percentage points I mean especially in North Carolina Elections break late too I think it will matter that she didnt show up and Ill tell you why Because ISIS has been on a regular schedule beheadings every three weeks or so And this is just within that target range If we see another beheading God forbid of an American and a veteran and this is something she does not sufficient interest in I think the American people should care Because this election is not just going to be about the issues PERINO And she dodged the question for so long I think if she just would have GUILFOYLE It looks shameful PERINO Can we get Eric in there because he hasnt had a chance yet Eric James Carville once said its the economy stupid Is it  in this midterm do you think its the economy BOLLING I do And look at the numbers 55 percent of the population both Republican and Democrats and independents believe the economy is in the  remains weak 65 percent feel the country is going in the wrong direction Food prices are up energy prices are up incomes are literally down under President Obama Percentage of Americans working is at 40 year lows I think its going to end up being a reflection of a poor economy Again 1 percent is doing great The people at the very tippy top of the ladder are doing fantastic The middle class is not The bottom is taken care of BECKEL But you know what We have to look at it state by state In certain places like North Carolina where theyre doing much better in the research triangle The other thing is we dont know Always a fascination by elections Were going to talk about the St Louis thing There will be ire in the black community no matter how you look at it In North Carolina the assumption is blacks will turn out in low numbers in midterms If the St Louis story takes off over the next couple of weeks youll see an increase in black turnout Those are things we dont know for politics Thats what makes is a fascinating profession GUTFELD You know you brought up the  it was Carvilles statement Its the economy stupid I think the motto for this election Its the stupid stupid PERINO Stupid Stupid squared I was going to ask Kimberly but now I just get to make a statement instead So Elise Stefanik who is the candidate up in upstate New York Shes running against a couple guys up there a Democrat and an independent Shes a friend of mine She worked at the White House If she wins and shes likely too shell be the youngest member ever I mean shes 29 or 30 But get this in the debate last night the Democrat  her challenger the Democrat complains to her because she had never done manual labor like he did like  I know Republicans have a problem with women But I feel like Democrat men have a problem with Republican women who are running Do you think BECKEL A statement like that is something that you do when youre running for senior president of the class You dont make those kind of mistakes when youre running for federal office That I blame on his consultants Thats something that  that was a scripted answer by the way PERINO I would think so BECKEL And anybody who scripts an answer like that frankly ought to get out of that and get into the dry cleaning business PERINO Well GUTFELD Wait a minute The dry cleaning business is hard BECKEL No Not as hard as being a liberal GUILFOYLE That was very tough PERINO OK That was fun but theres more to come on that in the coming weeks Next there is a new wave of unrest in Missouri after an offduty police officer shoots an armed man in St Louis Erics been following the protests and well talk about that ahead  COMMERCIAL BREAK BOLLING Two months after the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson theres been another shooting involving police thats sparking protests this time in nearby St Louis Last night an offduty white officer shot and killed black 18yearold Vonderrit Myers Jr Police said Myers was armed and fired at the cops first BEGIN VIDEO CLIP SAM DOTSUN ST LOUIS POLICE CHIEF I know emotions are high and tensions are high but the reality is what weve seen or what the evidence tells me right now is an individual pointed a gun at a police officer fired at least three rounds and continued to pull the trigger END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Angry crowds gathered quickly as word spread Now Bob I know you want to weigh in aggressively on this but let me ask KG first This is different though This we have police saying the young man fired first and thats GUILFOYLE Pulled a gun fired three shots so youre allowed to use force BECKEL Allegedly GUILFOYLE OK well were just  fine Bob if that makes you feel better of course Allegedly But the gun did fire and it was fired three times and he did have a gun So that changes the dynamic completely So the allegation then is is it a justifiable shooting Well certainly if you can prove that he fired first on the officer The officer has the right to be able to defend himself He does not have an obligation to die This is a very sad tragic case and then the question becomes did the officer use excessive force in the number of rounds that he fired from the gun BOLLING Well listen Im not no criminal justice expert but if you  if you fire  even point a gun at an officer you better expect to be shot Well that assumes first of all there was a gun b it was shot Three that you believe the police in St Louis which I do not personally its only personal opinion And the use of 17 shots into a teenager who was not shooting his gun it was jammed according to the police which I dont believe is expressive force Now  let me just finish this statement if I could There are those of us who believe if you look at the history of the St Louis Police Department which has been a hot bed of racial tension over the decades that this kind of thing does not surprise me It certainly will not surprise the black community in St Louis It will take a long time to resolve There will be a significant backlash over it and I think it will have an impact BOLLING Dana the police recovered the gun Three bullets were missing and they got the shells from  that were dispensed GUILFOYLE The casings were recovered BOLLING So Bob can say theres a big conspiracy here PERINO Why are we arguing that point Bob Thats what the evidence said BECKEL Because the police say the casings have been recovered and that the gun has been recovered and until I see it smell it feel it I dont believe BOLLING After all the scrutiny theyve been getting over the Michael Brown case do you think they would play around with altering evidence BECKEL Youre not going to get this away from me CROSSTALK GUILFOYLE Youre going to get the ballistic report and then check the GSR on his hand and match it up and the the casings are going to match the weapon BECKEL Well see Well see BOLLING Is Bob right Greg that this is going to be a thing going forward or does this go away GUTFELD Well unfortunately he might be right Factually this incident is different But due to a climate of racial conflict stoked by the media and an influx of outside activism facts are now erased by feeling which makes all the incidents sound the same So it enables someone like Bob to take an incident that is different and say Oh its not surprising that it would occur here Youre generalizing based on a specific incident which we tend to see as bigoted or smearing if it you were to do that to a group of people The end result will be more unrest a tepidstyle policing out of fear and an anarchy that radicals could only dream of BOLLING On the Internet Bob I lot of people were upset with NBC News for putting out a tweet that talked about the officer killing the 18 yearold  the white officer killing the 18yearold black young man but never pointed out the fact that shots were fired at the officer first Dont they have that responsibility BECKEL Well they have that responsibility if they have the evidence to back it up Look you know Im not  I dont want to see BOLLING NBC report the facts BECKEL I understand that but what I have not yet seen is the St Louis police report the facts Now lets wait and see The point is in the black community GUTFELD Then we shouldnt have done this segment If we cant  if were going to sit here and hypothesize and make conjectures and just wait and see then maybe we shouldnt do these stories Lets not do them until we have the facts Maybe we should do it that way I would like to do it that way PERINO Or we could argue the facts that we have GUTFELD Right And not say the facts arent facts GUILFOYLE Guys guys guys Lets not get crazy here This is freaking me out We do have the facts We do know that the casings were recovered We do know that  and if anybody fired a gun here and some of you have that is not unheard of to have a high capacity gun like that a nine millimeter maybe you had a couple like two to three quick bursts Its not unheard of to do that And the officer is following police protocol Bob If someone is shooting at you you can shoot at them and put them down until they stop And the threat is not there BECKEL I asked you a simple question You said the facts are And I BOLLING Bob when they have  when they have gunshot residue on them CROSSTALK GUILFOYLE You want to hang out in like conspiracy land BOLLING Well get more facts BECKEL Facts are a good idea From the police department BOLLING Why schools in one state have ordered teachers to stop calling kids boys and girls Political correctness run amok Greg has all of that next COMMERCIAL BREAK BECKEL This is something you have to hear to believe like St Louis A school district in Nebraska has provided new guidelines for teachers encouraging them not to use gender definitions like boys and girls to describe their students The reason The guidelines say applying boy and girl tags to students doesnt promote gender inclusiveness Im having a hard time getting through this No one wants to demean the transgender community certainly not me but isnt this going a bit too far Greg GUTFELD Well this is  this is disturbing As we know penguins are sexually dimorphic meaning the males BECKEL That wasnt in the read the penguin thing GUTFELD What BECKEL You have to explain the penguin thing GUTFELD Oh they want them to be called purple penguins and not boys and girls They want to be called purple penguins Thats the point Which is going to confuse kids because penguins A molt every year Now kids think theyre going to molt No 2 theyre changing into purple when penguins are black So thats kind of racist PERINO Like their climate their like habitat is going away GUTFELD Exactly Its going to scare the heck out of kids who  its weird Modernday educators are preoccupied with gender I think gender identity politics has replaced religion in education PERINO Yes Less gender more math GUILFOYLE Why does it have to be purple though BECKEL Are you surprised this would happen in Nebraska which is a fairly conservative state as say opposed to New York PERINO As Greg has explained to me many times the liberal academic complex GUTFELD Complex PERINO  is alive and well And thats where I think it happens in  the quotes from the guy are pretty interesting I just think that if youre a liberal and you really want this to happen you want kids to be called purple penguins they might just want to wait Because how would we ever elect our first woman president BECKEL Thats a good point GUTFELD Wed elect a penguin BECKEL Can you tell the sexual content of BOLLING Oh lord GUILFOYLE Bob dont destroy the segment BECKEL Its my segment CROSSTALK GUTFELD Youre the one who pops the ball GUILFOYLE Thats what he does BOLLING How old are these kids do we know GUILFOYLE Hes a playground ball popper BECKEL Let me pop your ball for a second here OK GUILFOYLE Oh jeez I cant BECKEL Here youve got a situation where  you say that liberals believe this I know lots of liberals myself included who think its ridiculous Now do you think its fair to blame the entire liberal community for this GUTFELD Yes GUILFOYLE Yes actually Yes Im pretty comfortable with that BECKEL This makes sense Just like you PERINO  the facts that it wasnt Im going to blame them GUTFELD Gender identity politics This is yours The right has created some things that you dont like This is the baby of the left Identity politics You guys made it Were living it BECKEL You guys made it GUTFELD Yes What about the Pittsburgh Penguins the hockey team Are they going to have to change their logo from a penguin to a little boy BECKEL No they cant That would identify them as boys They have to be little boys and little girls GUTFELD Thats true BECKEL Eric you havent had a chance to speak on this I know you probably are going to rush to get your kid into this school system What would you say if you came home BOLLING All I have to say is kids have so much to deal with and to worry about What theyre being called penguins or boys and girls is ridiculous But these are middle schoolers These kids have already figured out gender identities well before middle school BECKEL Id say this is BOLLING You know what The inmates have now started running the asylum Thats what this is all about GUILFOYLE Can you imagine if Eric came home like Hey Im a purple penguin Dad What do I do about this BECKEL All liberals and GUILFOYLE This is a little bit ridiculous BECKEL Ill tell you what I think if the country would  I know you believe this would be far better off with no liberals at all So maybe we should GUILFOYLE I didnt say that There would be nobody to make fun of BOLLING What about the Penguin Batman Im not sure if I should GUILFOYLE I do like that movie Happy Feet GUTFELD The penguins are black Obviously racist BECKEL How do you know GUILFOYLE Well it is Its like discriminatory to all the other colors GUTFELD Its hard to tell You have to ask BECKEL One

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/06/05/marijuana-use-may-affect-size-and-shape-men-sperm/, Smoking marijuana may affect the shape and quality of young mens sperm ultimately putting their fertility at risk new research shows In a study published in the medical journal Human Reproduction researchers analyzed many different lifestyle factors that could possibly have an impact on male infertility The study was the largest of its kind examining how habits such as smoking and drinking alcohol affected mens sperm size and shape  also known as sperm morphology     According to the researchers marijuana use was the only habit they studied to be strongly associated with abnormal sperm morphology We werent really interested in the cannabis angle at all Dr Alan Pacey senior lecturer in andrology at the University of Sheffield in England told FoxNewscom We were interested in trying to best define the risks of sperm quality We recruited a couple thousand guys who gave us a sperm sample and allowed us to investigate aspects of their livesIt was just one of the things we asked if they did it was no more detailed than that For their study Pacey and his team recruited more than 2000 men from 14 fertility clinics in England giving them detailed questionnaires about their medical history and lifestyle habits For reference on proper sperm morphology the researchers used guidelines published by the World Health Organization which detail what normal sperm should look like and the exact dimensions normal sperm should be Sperm with abnormal morphology are thought to swim less well than normal sperm making it harder to reach a womans egg and fertilize it Reliable sperm morphology data was only available for 1970 of the men recruited and of this group 1652 men produced normal samples of sperm  meaning over 4 percent of their sperm was the right shape size The other 318 men had abnormal samples meaning less than 4 percent of their sperm morphology was correct When cross analyzing the sperm samples with the mens lifestyle habits and other factors the researchers found only two strong correlations The men with abnormal sperm samples were nearly twice as likely to have ejaculated during the summer months from June to August and they were much more likely to have abnormal sperm if they had smoked cannabis in the three months prior to ejaculating Although their study didnt examine why marijuana may impact sperm shape some preliminary studies have revealed that the drug could alter the sperm production process I do know there is some work in laboratory animals that suggests marijuana can affect the way the DNA in the sperm is packaged together and thats significant Pacey said When sperm are made the DNA they maintain has to be packaged in the head very tightly and when that process doesnt work properly you get an abnormal sperm So the cannabis is maybe interrupting that DNA folding But Pacey said the study has other implications besides the possible link between marijuana and infertility The researchers didnt find any associations between other common lifestyle factors such as cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption  two habits that have long been associated male infertility This suggests your body mass index your age your ethnicity your previous medical history and your alcohol consumption didnt have any effect Pacey said What happens when people are trying for a baby they tend to become really healthy they often go on crazy episodes of putting out things that are part of their everyday life and the evidence to support that is actually pretty weak Pacey noted for couples who are trying to have a baby men may want to abstain from cannabis use for some time as it usually takes up to three months to make a sperm Otherwise the number one predictor of normal sperm morphology and male fertility is ultimately genetics There are fewer risks than people think and that makes sense to me Pacey said The single thing that affects fertility is how big your testicles are If youre blessed with big testicles youll produce more sperm,2014-06-05T09:30-04:00,drugs

  Racing spoke to reporters on Monday at his teams headquarters The  43yearold driver does not plan to compete in sprint car races at least 
  not in the foreseeable future I  dont know  when or if Ill ever  get back in a sprint car Stewart said 
  The  support  from the fans  and the support from  your peers and people that 
  were  around  everyday Ive had  drivers that Ive  raced with every week and 
  drivers  that I havent  raced with for months that have said Dont let this 
  keep  you from doing  what you love This is what Ive done all my life This 
  is what Ive done for 36 years and I wouldnt change anything about it I  love  what I do  I love driving  race cars I  think it might change but 
  right  now as far as  how much of it and what I do there was never a thought 
  in my head about stopping That would take the life out of me Stewart  struck  and killed 20yearold  Ward at Canandaigua Motorsports Park 
  The  incident occurred  during a caution when  Ward climbed out of his car and 
  then  walked down  the dirt  track pointing  his finger  in the  direction of 
  Stewart and apparently yelling at him to express his displeasure Both drivers 
  had  made contact  while battling  for position  with Ward  spinning out  and 
  hitting the wall and therefore forcing the caution The  right rear  of Stewarts car hit  Ward and dragged him briefly across the 
  track Ward died from massive blunt trauma Stewart missed three Sprint Cup races  Watkins Glen Michigan and Bristol  
  while  he was  in seclusion following the incident at Canandaigua He returned 
  to  competition the last weekend in August at Atlanta Stewart did not qualify 
  for  the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship He finished 14th at Dover this 
  past Sunday  the third race in the Chase Ive  been racing since Atlanta but it hasnt been business as usual by any 
  means  he said This  is going to be a healing process for me It makes you 
  think  about a  lot of things other  than driving race cars but the one thing 
  thats  probably helped  me  more than  anything  else is  being  back at  the 
  racetrack and being around my racing family remembering that I have a passion 
  for  what I do  Thats probably helped me more than anything when it comes to 
  trying to make that next step to move forward Last Thursday Stewart spoke to the Associated Press about the fatal accident 
  saying  I  know 100  percent in my  heart and in  my mind  that I did not do 
  anything wrong This was 100 percent an accident When  Ontario  County District  Attorney Michael  Tantillo announced the grand 
  jurys  decision  to clear Stewart of  any criminal charges last Wednesday he 
  revealed  that a  toxicology report had indicated Ward was under the influence 
  of  marijuana at the time Ward was competing in the race and it was enough to

the polls today some have been turning to smartphone apps to help make sense of the candidates and issues at play during what has been a particularly contentious midterm election cycle Various groups from across the political spectrum  Republicans to Democrats to those choosing to remain nonpartisan  have developed a range of apps for those involved in the election process from voters to polling center volunteers With smartphone apps becoming increasingly more prevalent in all aspects of daily life it is only natural that their role will continue to grow in future elections according to Rob Tannen director of design and strategy at the Intuitive Company which recently developed Intuitive Voting a prototype app geared to improve the election process     You think the presence of apps in the political process would have happened more aggressively by now than it has Tannen told FoxNewscom Going forward I think there is the infrastructure in place for more people to get the right information at the right time While still in its conceptual phase Intuitive Voting is the kind of app that Tannen said he hoped would help improve the voting process in future election years Designed as two separate apps  one used by polling center volunteers and the other for actual voters  Intuitive Votings features include clear concise information on volunteer protocol a tool to help people register to vote and detailed information on candidate platforms The app was recently the winning design in the Human Factors and Ergonomics Societys 2014 voting Design Competition Tannen said the teams vision for the app is for it to be a nonpartisan tool that provides objective information to voters and volunteers While not yet a reality he said that tools like Intuitive Voting are necessary in helping voters make sense of the barrage of information they get on a daily basis from campaigns and interest groups There are currently several apps in existence that attempt to help voters determine who they should vote for this election season For example Votr developed by media company Vocativ is an election app that takes a few cues from popular dating app Tinder Votr gives users the opportunity to assess each of the 161 candidates vying for the 36 open US Senate seats in Tuesdays elections Users answer several emojianimated personal questions  some are issuebased like whether or not one supports gay marriage to the more trivial like whether a user is a dog or cat person  and then presents candidates who users can vote yes or no for If the candidates answers match those of the users then he or she will most likely get a decided yes For example when Emily Marie Sanchez 2014 Texasbased Green Party candidate for the US Senate pops up on the app her positions like prochoice supports stricter gun laws and supports marijuana law reform appear under her profile picture in addition to a few quick facts After looking at her overview the apps user has the option to swipe yes or no While the Intuitive Voting and Votr apps were developed by nonpartisan organizations various interest groups from both the right and the left have been applying app technology to try to make an impact during todays elections True the Vote a Texasbased conservative group has an app called VoteStand for both iOS and Android phones that is designed to allow users to report cases of potential election irregularity and fraud According to True the Votes website the geolocationbased apps users are encouraged to report incidents like absentee voting fraud machine tampering or voter intimidation by taking photos or writing posts that will be submitted to True the Vote The conservative nonprofit will post users submissions that have been vetted and potentially contact local polling officials about alleged incidents of voting fraud The current version of the app was released last week and Logan Churchwell True the Votes communications director told FoxNewscom that it currently has around 10000 users Churchwell said that so far the app has been downloaded the most in Texas California and Florida and does not collect information such as a users party affiliation Of course given the fact that all of VoteStands content is crowd sourced it is important that users avoid breaking any voting laws The group lists on its website guidelines and suggestions for the apps users For instance users have to be clear that they are not violating the state rules for shooting video and taking photographs inside polling locations as well as potentially intimidating any fellow voters Criminal penalties could result from violating voting laws With such increased interest in inserting apps into the election process one natural question immediately comes up  will online voting ever become a reality in an increasingly digitized world Tannen said it is a possibility that will take a while to become a reality You have real app designs for financial services and the banking industry and obviously people are very safely and easily processing confidential transactions online and on phones he explained Obviously that could be applied to voting down the line All of the technology is there the infrastructure is there but the question comes down to money and organizations like local governments that are responsible for voting machines It involves local money To bring the voting process online it is probably going to be driven by the private sector down the line Make sure to catch all of the election coverage here on FoxNewscom,2014-11-04T13:26-05:00,drugs

practice for the NASCAR Sprint Cup series auto race at Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet Ill A grand jury decided against charging Stewart in the death of Kevin Ward Jr on a dirt track last month in upstate New York Stewart took three weeks off from racing after the crash AP PhotoPaul J Bergstrom File There were days whenTonyStewartcouldnt get out of bed It was a chore to take a shower to leave his room The television was on he would stare at it and have no idea what he was watching He didnt care about racing He didnt want to talk to anyone let alone face his family friends or other drivers Stewartsgrief over the death of Kevin Ward Jr was overwhelming and he couldnt find his way out of the fog     Stewart one of NASCARs biggest stars spent three weeks in seclusion at his Indiana home after the car he was driving struck and killed Ward at a dirt track in upstate New York He describes those weeks as the darkest of his life I know 100 percent in my heart and in my mind that I did not do anything wrong This was 100 percent an accidentStewarttold The Associated Press on Thursday in his first interview since a grand jury decided he would not be charged in Wards death On the advice of legal counselStewartwould not describe what he remembers about the crash at Canandaigua Motorsports Park Ward andStewarthad been racing for position when Ward crashed exited his vehicle and walked down the dark track in an apparent attempt to confrontStewart A toxicology report found Ward also had marijuana in his system Wards family has said the matter is not at rest andStewartmay still face a civil lawsuit Sitting on the couch of his North Carolina home a sprint car race in Arkansas on mute on the televisionStewartsaid not being able to talk about what happened is extending his anguish It keeps me from moving forward It just stays there hanging over my headStewartsaid Ward andStewartdidnt know each other andStewartdoesnt recall them ever talking He laments that in the scrutiny that followed  some questioned ifStewarthad tried to intimidate Ward for stepping on the track  that the loss of the 20yearold driver and his promising career fell to the background He said he cant imagine how the Ward family is feeling I guess the end result is I dont blame them for anything they say he said Understanding how to deal with his grief and getting back on the track was difficultStewarthas had his share of controversy and drama in his volatile but successful 16year NASCAR career none of it prepared him for the emotions he felt following Wards death He said he needed professional help to cope with the situation and asking for assistance wasnt easyStewart 43 isnt married has no children and keeps a tight inner circle Hes a solitary figure of sorts someone who broods and stews alone and opening himself up for selfexamination was a monumental task He had no choice You sit there and you wrack your brain you try to analyze Why did this happenStewartsaid I made myself miserable just trying to make sense of it  I just couldnt function Ive never been in a position where I just couldnt function His tumble into depression began almost immediatelyStewartleft Canandaigua after the crash and went to Watkins Glen where he was scheduled to race the next morning It was roughly 2 am when he got back to his motorhome and he looks back now and says he was in shock ButStewartis a racer through and through and racers pick themselves up and race So thats what he told his team he would do He wanted to get into his No 14 Chevrolet that Sunday and go because thats what he had done his entire life But when he woke up the next morning he realized immediately he was in no condition to be in a car nor did he have the desire to drive He did an aboutface and pulled out of the race the first of three he sat out You race hurt you race sick and thats the way racers have always been he said You say you can go do what you need to do and then it becomes very clear that you cant He watched the closing laps on television at home in Indiana only because he wanted to see the laterace battle for a berth in NASCARs playoffs He watched half of the race he missed in MichiganStewartsaid practices and qualifying sessions didnt interest him even as the three other cars he coowns at StewartHaas Racing continued with their season without their leader at the track It wasnt until Bristol the third race he missed thatStewartwas interested in watching It just wasnt important to me he said But he had to go back to work eventually and he had to get out of his house If he didnt give himself a routine he would never begin to heal SoStewartreturned to the track at the end of the August racing at Atlanta where he received a rousing ovation from the crowd during driver introductions It wasnt easy going to the track  it still isnt  and although hes back in his car his life is far from normal At home in North CarolinaStewartbarely steps outside the house He needed a hairdresser to come to his place just to get a muchneeded haircut You are part of something so tragic and so unthinkable its hard to face anybody he said It was hard to wrap my arms around this and it still is I havent been a part of society for more than six weeks You are scared to be around anybody you are embarrassed to be around anybody because of what happened Focus comes whenever he pulls on his helmet and fires up his engine Though his performance has been horrific by his own standards in his last three races getting back into the car is a step toward normalcy The rest of the time A day feels like a month His mind wanders his emotions get the best of him There hasnt been a day thats gone by that I havent thought about it And it will be like that all your life he said You are never going to forget about it You are never going to not see it happen all over again Its going to be a part of me forever,2014-09-26T09:27-04:00,drugs

getting into the car with four friends and driving over 100 mph before crashing into trees with such force that it split the car in half AP PhotoFrank Eltman File New York teenager Joseph Beer smoked marijuana climbed into a Subaru Impreza with four friends and drove more than 100 mph before losing control The car crashed into trees with such force that the vehicle split in half killing his friends Beer who was 17 in October 2012 when the crash occurred pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicular homicide and was sentenced last week to 5 years to 15 years in prison     As states liberalize their marijuana laws public officials and safety advocates worry there will be more drivers high on pot and a big increase in traffic deaths Its not clear though whether those concerns are merited Researchers are divided on the question A prosecutor blamed the Beer crash on speed and weed but a jury that heard expert testimony on marijuanas effects at his trial deadlocked on a homicide charge and other felonies related to whether the teenager was impaired by marijuana Beer was convicted of manslaughter and reckless driving charges Studies of marijuanas effects show that the drug can slow decisionmaking decrease peripheral vision and impede multitasking all of which are important driving skills But unlike with alcohol drivers high on pot tend to be aware that they are impaired and try to compensate by driving slowly avoiding risky actions such as passing other cars and allowing extra room between vehicles On the other hand combining marijuana with alcohol appears to eliminate the pot smokers exaggerated caution and to increase driving impairment beyond the effects of either substance alone We see the legalization of marijuana in Colorado and Washington as a wakeup call for all of us in highway safety said Jonathan Adkins executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association which represents state highway safety offices We dont know enough about the scope of marijuanaimpaired driving to call it a big or small problem But anytime a driver has their ability impaired it is a problem Colorado and Washington are the only states that allow retail sales of marijuana for recreational use Efforts to legalize recreational marijuana are underway in Alaska Massachusetts New York Oregon and the District of Columbia Twentythree states and the nations capital permit marijuana use for medical purposes It is illegal in all states to drive while impaired by marijuana Colorado Washington and Montana have set an intoxication threshold of 5 parts per billion of THC the psychoactive ingredient in pot in the blood A few other states have set intoxication thresholds but most have not set a specific level In Washington there was a jump of nearly 25 percent in drivers testing positive for marijuana in 2013  the first full year after legalization  but no corresponding increase in car accidents or fatalities Dr Mehmet Sofuoglu a Yale University Medical School expert on drug abuse who testified at Beers trial said studies of marijuana and crash risk are highly inconclusive Some studies show a two or threefold increase while others show none he said Some studies even showed less risk if someone was marijuanapositive he testified Teenage boys and young men are the most likely drivers to smoke pot and the most likely drivers to have an accident regardless of whether theyre high he said Being a teenager a male teenager and being involved in reckless behavior could explain both at the same time  not necessarily marijuana causing getting into accidents but a general reckless behavior leading to both conditions at the same time Sofuoglu told jurors In 2012 just over 10 percent of high school seniors said they had smoked pot before driving at least once in the prior two weeks according to Monitoring the Future an annual University of Michigan survey of 50000 middle and high school students Nearly twice as many male students as female students said they had smoked marijuana before driving A roadside survey by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2007 found 86 percent of drivers tested positive for THC but its not possible to say how many were high at the time because drivers only were tested for the presence of drugs not the amount A marijuana high generally peaks within a halfhour and dissipates within three hours but THC can linger for days in the bodies of habitual smokers Inexperienced pot smokers are likely to be more impaired than habitual smokers who develop a tolerance Some studies show virtually no driving impairment in habitual smokers Two recent studies that used similar data to assess crash risk came to opposite conclusions Columbia University researchers compared drivers who tested positive for marijuana in the roadside survey with state drug and alcohol tests of drivers killed in crashes They found that marijuana alone increased the likelihood of being involved in a fatal crash by 80 percent But because the study included states where not all drivers are tested for alcohol and drugs most drivers in fatal crashes were excluded possibly skewing the results Also the use of urine tests rather than blood tests in some cases may overestimate marijuana use and impairment A Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation study used the roadside survey and data from nine states that test more than 80 percent of drivers killed in crashes When adjusted for alcohol and driver demographics the study found that otherwise sober drivers who tested positive for marijuana were slightly less likely to have been involved in a crash than drivers who tested negative for all drugs We were expecting a huge impact said Eduardo Romano lead author of the study and when we looked at the data from crashes were not seeing that much But Romano said his study may slightly underestimate the risk and marijuana may lead to accidents caused by distraction Many states do not test drivers involved in a fatal crash for drugs unless there is reason to suspect impairment Even if impairment is suspected if the driver tests positive for alcohol there may be no further testing because alcohol alone may be enough to bring criminal charges Testing procedures also vary from state to state If states legalize marijuana they must set clear limits for impairment behind the wheel and require mandatory drug testing following a crash said Deborah Hersman former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board Right now we have a patchwork system across the nation regarding

PhotoMatilde CampodonicoThe Associated Press Uruguays President Jose Mujica walks into his home followed by his dog Manuela at the end of an interview on the outskirts of Montevideo Uruguay Friday May 2 2014 Mujica said Friday that his countrys legal marijuana market will be much better than Colorados where he says the rules are based on fiction and hypocrisy because the state loses track of the drug once its sold and many people fake illnesses to get prescription weed Mujica says this wont be allowed in Uruguay where the licensed and regulated market will be much less permissive with drug users AP PhotoMatilde CampodonicoThe Associated Press MONTEVIDEO Uruguay  Uruguay has finally released its rules for the legal marijuana market it is launching this year detailing how the government plans to get very involved in every aspect of the business But anyone hoping the South American nation will become a potsmokers paradise should probably head to Colorado instead President Jose Mujica suggested on Friday Its a complete fiction what they do in Colorado in terms of controlling the sale and use of legal marijuana Mujica said in an Associated Press interview     Colorado licenses sellers and producers but allows any adult to buy up to 28 grams at a time   and then go down the street and buy 28 grams more In Uruguay consumers must be licensed as well and each purchase will be tracked to ensure they buy no more than 10 grams a week he said Mujica and his ministers plan to sign the regulations on Monday and theyll take effect on Tuesday In two weeks the government will take applications from businesses hoping to become one of a handful of growers supplying marijuana to the state By early December a network of pharmacies will be ready to supply the weed to registered consumers at less than a dollar a gram presidential spokesman Diego Canepa said late Friday As with tobacco the pot will come in packages warning of health risks and smoking will be prohibited everywhere but private homes and openair locations As with liquor motorists will be subject to testing by police to make sure theyre not driving under the influence The state will sell five different strains containing a maximum level of 15 percent THC the substance that gets consumers high Each bag will be barcoded radiofrequency tagged and registered in a genetic database that will enable authorities to trace its origin and determine its legality Canepa said  The rules limit licensed growers to six plants per household    not per person as some pot enthusiasts had hoped And while people who buy in pharmacies will be identified by fingerprint readers to preserve their anonymity every users pot consumption will be tracked in a government database Mujica predicted that many will call him an elderly reactionary once they see this fine print but he says his government never intended to create a mecca for marijuana lovers No addiction is good he said We arent going to promote smokefests bohemianism all this stuff they try to pass off as innocuous when it isnt Theyll label us elderly reactionaries But this isnt a policy that seeks to expand marijuana consumption What it aims to do is keep it all within reason and not allow it to become an illness With bona fide plants registered at the molecular level police can test for illegal weed wherever they encounter it and arrest anyone with pot that lacks the proper genetic markers the rules say Mujica says the system is more transparent and honest than the medical marijuana laws passed by 21 US states and the District of Columbia which he called brutal hypocrisy because people can fake illnesses to get prescription weed There are places where there are forms already filled out with a doctors signature So you go you say that you need marijuana because your ear hurts they fill out the form you prescribe it yourself and with the signature of a doctor he said Mujica who is preparing to visit President Barack Obama in the White House on May 12 predicted that Uruguays system will be much tougher on drug users and more effective in combatting illegal drug trafficking Mujica says his government will license and regulate the entire marijuana business enforcing pot possession rules as well as limits on production and sales so that violators get punished and addicts get help Uruguays leader sat down for a wideranging AP interview in his garden after a quick ride in his Volkswagen Beetle with his wife Sen Lucia Topolansky to the butchers shop to buy some meat for dinner He answered questions surrounded by chickens cats and dogs at the small farm on a hill overlooking Montevideo where he lives and grows flowers for sale Its a critical time for Mujica and the ruling Broad Front coalition which has staked its reputation on outcompeting traffickers and treating marijuana more as a problem of public health than law enforcement Mujica also is negotiating with Obama over Guantanamo He says he wants to help close the US detention center by taking some prisoners but wont agree to Washingtons demand to keep the former terror suspects inside Uruguay They will be able to move freely They can leave But theyve been turned into walking skeletons Theyve been destroyed by what theyve gone through physically and psychologically Mujica said He declined to say more to avoid complicating the talks Weve made our proposal Its the United States that has to decide Mujica is a former guerrilla who led the armed Tupamaro movement before Uruguays 19731985 dictatorship He was jailed throughout the junta years mostly in solitary confinement Now he not only leads his country hes an international celebrity after making passionate speeches against the consumerism and greed Those speeches    and the

towering marijuana plants and checked the buds for the telltale spots of white indicating they are ready for harvest By September much of the crop has been picked and left to dry on the roofs of the stoneandwood huts that dot the Rif valley the heart Moroccos potgrowing region Benabdallah openly grows the crop despite the risk We are regularly subject to blackmail by the gendarmes he said as he scythed through stalks and wrapped them into a bundle     Moroccos marijuana farmers live in a strange limbo in which the brilliant green fields are largely left alone while the growers face constant police harassment A new draft law may bring some reprieve It aims to legalize marijuana growing for medical and industrial uses in a radical step for a Muslim nation that could alleviate poverty and social unrest But it faces stiff opposition in this conservative country as well as the suspicions of farmers themselves who think politicians can do nothing to help them Morocco is joining many other countries as well as some US states in reexamining policies toward drugs and looking to some degree of legalization But Moroccos Islamic faith creates a strong taboo toward drugs despite the centuriesold tradition of growing the plant in the north Morocco is one of the worlds top suppliers of hashish The World Customs Authority reports that in 2013 65 percent of hashish seized at customs worldwide came from Morocco with most of that going to Europe Estimates vary wildly for how much the business is worth but legalization would certainly provide a substantial boost to farmers and to Moroccos anemic economy which will grow by just 25 percent this year But the farmers who cultivate the marijuana plants remain suspicious of any measures by politicians who they claim have never done anything for their poor neglected region They fear that legalization might depress the already low price of 8 a kilogram they receive If legalization happened for all of Morocco we could never compete with the other farmers that have lots of land and the price of cannabis wouldnt be any different than that of carrots said Mohammed Benabdallah an activist in the village of Oued Abdel Ghaya While customers pay top dollar for hashish and marijuana in the famed coffee shops of Amsterdam the Moroccan farmers who produce it make on average just 3000 to 4000 a year Farmers also complain about having to dodge police and avoiding the major towns for fear of arrest   unless they are ready to pay bribes But there are few alternatives The valleys rocky soil is poor and the only crop that seems to thrive is marijuana It was legal to grow under royal mandate in certain regions of the Rif until 1974 when the government passed a blanket ban on the cultivation and consumption of all drugs The securitycentered approach to the problem has failed argued Mehdi Bensaid a lawmaker with the opposition Party of Authenticity and Modernity that has presented parliament with the legalization law If Morocco has a crop that could produce these medicines that could be sold today in the US Canada and France it is an employment opportunity for citizens living in a miserable situation Bensaid told The Associated Press Its a winwin for the state because there is tax and for the citizens because they are in an illegal situation Mustapha Khalfi Moroccos government spokesman and communications minister refused to discuss the proposed draft law when asked by The Associated Press pointing only to government efforts to combat drug smuggling and reduce the amount of acreage under cultivation It remains to be seen if the law will be scheduled for a debate in parliament when the new session begins Oct 10 The government has repeatedly tried but failed to persuade farmers to substitute other crops By 2010 most alternative crop programs had been suspended Walking along terraces of rocky earth 63yearold Mohammed Fathi said he tried to grow other crops and was part of a cooperative that grew olives

RIO DE JANEIRO  With its Carnival reputation and skinbaring beach life Brazil may look like a liberal bastion But unease over a worsening economy and deteriorating public safety plus a backlash against recent gayrights gains are propelling a conservative rise that will shape the next administration regardless of who wins the presidency The general election held earlier this month saw a greater share of Brazils National Congress seats go to various conservative caucuses which now control nearly 60 percent of the 513 seats in the lower house They include evangelical lawmakers who oppose gay marriage or access to abortion ruralistas whose proagriculture positions counter environmentalists and indigenous groups and a lawandorder faction that demands a crackdown on crime     Ahead of the presidential runoff Oct 26 theres no doubt such conservatives are giving greater support to centerright challenger Aecio Neves over leftleaning President Dilma Rousseff But its also clear that neither presidential candidate is as socially conservative as the increasingly powerful elements of Congress Brazil is one of the very few Latin American countries where the parliament is more important than the president in terms of overall power in the decisionmaking process said Thiago de Aragao a political analyst for the Brasiliabased Arko Advice consulting firm The parliament in an armwrestling contest against the presidency would win  because the parliaments main weapon is just crossing their arms and not voting on matters that are of strong interest to the government Despite its anythinggoes appearance Brazil is like many predominantly Roman Catholic nations in Latin America socially conservative In recent opinion polls for example more than 80 percent of Brazilians said they oppose loosening their restrictive abortion laws or legalizing marijuana and just over half oppose gay marriage However since Brazils return to democracy in 1985 the nations presidents and its judiciary have pushed through progressive projects either by decree or rulings   such as protecting huge swaths of jungle as indigenous reserves a highcourt ruling permitting samesex civil unions and the creation of Bolsa Familia a program that gives monthly cash payments to Brazils poorest families Some predict such changes could be rolled back by the growing conservative forces The evangelical caucus votes in lockstep on hotbutton social issues and is willing to block projects put forth by the presidency because its members know they represent a growing segment of the electorate While Catholics remain the majority in Brazil since 1970 their portion of the population has fallen from more than 90 percent to 65 percent while those identifying as Protestants have grown from 5 percent to 22 percent according to the Pew Research Center In Rousseffs first term the evangelical caucus blocked her effort to promote gaytolerance teaching in schools and managed to have their most outspoken antigay legislator Deputy Marco Feliciano named head of the bodys human rights commission    a move that provoked condemnation from Amnesty International and other activist groups In the Oct 5 election Feliciano was reelected to his Sao Paulo district with nearly double the votes he won four years ago The ruralista caucus also grew and now has about 200 members who support its agenda These lawmakers showed their strength in 2012 forcing weakening of environmental protection laws which critics say contributed to a 29 percent jump in the number of Amazon acres deforested over the last year And while the lawandorder block is small with only about 20 members it wields influence on security issues The caucus members defend tougher penal codes for young offenders and want to block the sort of drug liberalization seen in neighboring countries even as Brazil copes with overcrowded prisons and years of failed efforts to suppress powerful drug gangs But its the evangelical lawmakers who are at the heart of Brazils growing conservatism and theyve shown an ability to rally the other groups behind their main cause defeating any attempt to legalize gay marriage or advance protections for LGBT communities Toni Reis who heads the gay rights advocacy group Dignidade noted it took a landmark Supreme Court decision to legalize samesex civil unions in 2011 following years of congressional stalling on the matter Now he said gay rights groups are focused not on gay marriage but on advancing legislation to criminalize discrimination against gays Given the new legislative reality Reis acknowledged it will be an uphill battle Were going to have to work twice as hard he said Jean Wyllys Brazils first openly gay congressman said progressive lawmakers wont give up Theres no doubt its going to be more difficult said Wyllys who represents Rio de Janeiro state But I also have my allies  We are a political force capable of blocking their the evangelicals legislative projects But Brazils most influential evangelical pastor Silas Malafaia who campaigned for several Pentecostal politicians says the conservatives dont intend to impose stances out of step with the electorate I am against gay marriage Lets hold a referendum and let society decide Malafaia said in a recent interview If the people decide that they want abortions to be legalized I will always be

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/10/07/marijuana-and-your-health-what-20-years-research-reveals/, People who drive under the influence of marijuana double their risk of being in a car crash and about one in 10 daily marijuana users becomes dependent on the drug according to a new review Marijuana use has become increasingly prevalent over the years and the review of marijuana studies summarizes what researchers have learned about the drugs effects on human health and general wellbeing over the past two decades     In the review author Wayne Hall a professor and director of the Center for Youth Substance Abuse Research at the University of Queensland in Australia examined scientific evidence on marijuanas health effects between 1993 and 2013 He found that adolescents who use cannabis regularly are about twice as likely as their nonuser peers to drop out of school as well as experience cognitive impairment and psychoses as adults Moreover studies have also linked regular cannabis use in adolescence with the use of other illicit drugs according to the review published today Oct 6 in the journal Addiction Researchers in the studies still debated whether regular marijuana use might actually lead to the use of other drugs Hall wrote in the study However he pointed to longerterm studies and studies of twins in which one used marijuana and the other did not as particularly strong evidence that regular cannabis use may lead to the use of other illicit drugs Marijuana vs Alcohol Which Is Worse for Your Health The risk of a person suffering a fatal overdose from marijuana is extremely small and there are no reports of fatal overdoses in the scientific literature according to the review However there have been case reports of deaths from heart problems in seemingly otherwise healthy young men after they smoked marijuana the report said The perception that cannabis is a safe drug is a mistaken reaction to a past history of exaggeration of its health risks Hall told Live Science However he added that marijuana is not as harmful as other illicit drugs such as amphetamine cocaine and heroin with which it is classified under the law in many countries including the USA The risks of using marijuana Marijuana use carries some of the same risks as alcohol use such as an increased risk of accidents dependence and psychosis he said Its likely that middleage people who smoke marijuana regularly are at an increased risk of experiencing a heart attack according to the report However the drugs effects on respiratory function and respiratory cancer remain unclear because most cannabis smokers have smoked or still smoke tobacco Hall wrote in the review Regular cannabis users also double their risk of experiencing psychotic symptoms and disorders such as disordered thinking hallucinations and delusions  from about seven in 1000 cases among nonusers to 14 in 1000 among regular marijuana users the review said And in a study of more than 50000 young men in Sweden those who had used marijuana 10 or more times by age 18 were about two times more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia within the next 15 years than those who had not used the drug Critics argue that other variables besides marijuana use may be at work in the increased risk of mental health problems and that its possible that people with mental health problems are more likely to use marijuana to begin with Hall wrote in the review However other studies have since attempted to sort out the findings he wrote citing a 27year followup of the Swedish cohort in which researchers found a doseresponse relationship between frequency of cannabis use at age 18 and risk of schizophrenia during the whole followup period In the same study the investigators estimated that 13 percent of schizophrenia cases diagnosed in the study could be averted if all cannabis use had been prevented in the cohort Hall reported As for the effects of cannabis use in pregnant women the drug may slightly reduce the birth weight of the baby according to the review More THC The effects of euphoria that cannabis users seek from the drug come primarily from its psychoactive ingredient called delta9tetrahydrocannabinol better known as THC Hall wrote in the review During the past 30 years the THC content of marijuana in the United States has jumped from less than 2 percent in 1980 to 85 percent in 2006 The THC content of the drug has also likely increased in other developed countries Hall wrote in the report It is not clear however whether increased THC content may have an effect on users health the report said The Drug Talk 7 New Tips for Todays Parents Some argue that there would be no increase in harm if users adjusted their doses of the drug and used less of the more potent cannabis products to get the same psychological effects they seek Hall said However the limited evidence suggests that users do not completely adjust dose for potency and so probably get larger doses of THC than used to be the case Hall said Studies on the use of alcohol  and to a lesser extent other drugs such as opioids  have also shown that more potent forms of these substances increase

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/04/28/medical-marijuana-may-treat-symptoms-ms-ineffective-for-other-brain-disorders/,Reuters As medical marijuana makes its way into mainstream clinical use there is still much mystery surrounding the drug as not much is known about the its effects on the brain or nervous system disorders To gain a better understanding of the benefits  or downsides  of medical cannabis researchers from the American Academy of Neurology conducted a systematic review of available research analyzing the use of marijuana for the treatment of brain diseases      Through their analysis they found that medical marijuana can help alleviate some symptoms of multiple sclerosis MS but the drug was not very successful at treating druginduced movements from Parkinsons disease Additionally there was insufficient evidence to support whether or not marijuana can treat motor problems in Huntingtons disease tics in Tourette syndrome or seizures in epilepsy According to the researchers they were interested in reviewing medical marijuanas effects on brain disorders as so many patients have started using it as a form of treatment  without a prescription Ive known my patients for a long time they use it and some will tell me which symptoms they thought it was helpful for review author Dr Barbara Koppel of New York Medical College and fellow of the American Academy of Neurology told FoxNewscom So we wanted to find out the actual facts  what studies have shown because that can be a lot different than patient testimonial For their review published in the April 29 print issue of the journal Neurology Koppel and her team analyzed 35 research papers that delved into the effects of medical marijuana use on symptoms of certain neurological disorders Koppel noted that research on this topic is very limited and most of the studies utilized came from Europe since marijuana is still so highly regulated in the United States The review found that medical marijuana in pill form and in oral spray form could help treat symptoms of MS  notably spasticity certain types of pain and overactive bladder Only a few studies analyzed the benefits of medical marijuana when smoked but there was not enough to evidence to support its effectiveness Koppel said its likely that medical marijuanas effectiveness lies in one of its main ingredients cannabidiol When the drug was in the pill form of pure synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol THC the active ingredient in marijuana it wasnt effective for relieving abnormal movements related to brain disorders But the pills and spray which contained a combination of both cannabidiol CBD and THC were found to be the most beneficial for users The THC thats what makes you high when you smoke marijuana Koppel said We have different receptors in our brain for THC and cannabidiol and the THC works on the ones in the limbic system they effect memory give you hallucinations but on the other hand they can make you feel happy The other receptors are in the brain that control abnormal movement spasticity and motor control So the results are depending on what part of the brain youre trying to activate The AAN review concluded there is no definitive proof to suggest that medical marijuana is effective for Parkinsons disease Huntingtons disease Tourette syndrome cervical dystonia abnormal neck movements or seizures from epilepsy Additionally the researchers noted that users of marijuana reported a number of dangerous side effects  including nausea increased weakness mood changes suicidal thoughts hallucinations dizziness and fatigue and feelings of intoxication Two seizures were also reported in relation to the drug These warnings also coincide with a study recently published in the Journal of Neuroscience which found that casual marijuana use  using cannabis just once or twice a week  may cause significant abnormalities in certain key brain structures Koppel said her study strictly looked at medical marijuana which is created to be far less damaging than recreational pot Its nothing like what theyre selling on the streets Koppel said Weve known about that end of the spectrum for a long time Its not safe cognitively and it can have some permanent harm But its one of the reasons Im glad we can put the whole discussion on the table With so few studies to choose from Koppel hopes her review will inspire more researchers to study the effects of medical marijuana on the brain Although they didnt find much evidence to suggest cannabis can treat these neurological disorders Koppel noted the drug still has the potential to help Theres a place for it especially for people whose spasticity is not controlled by anything else Koppel said If their main symptom of MS is spasticity this might benefit them,2014-04-28T16:00-04:00,drugs

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/10/07/president-obama-committed-fight-against-isis/,This is a rush transcript from The Five October 7 2014 This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE COHOST Hello everyone Im Kimberly Guilfoyle along with Bob Beckel Eric Bolling Katie Pavlich and Greg Gutfeld The 5 oclock in New York City and this is The Five     Our commander in chief says Were going to degrade and destroy ISIS but if he really committed to the fight Airstrike havent stopped the terror network from just raising its black flag near the Syrian city of Kobani John McCain calls the presidents campaign so far reckless BEGIN VIDEO CLIP SEN JOHN MCCAIN RARIZ Theres a town called Kobani surrounded by ISIS and if it falls theres gonna be a mass slaughter And there will be no one better indication of the ineffectiveness and recklessness of this air campaign were now seeing END OF VIDEO CLIP GUIFOYLE Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters agree that hes accusing President Obama of just launching strike for political reasons BEGIN VIDEO CLIP LTCOL RALPH PETERS FOX NEWS STRATEGIC ANALYST Our president who launched this phony air campaign basically to absolve him of any blame to get him through  his party through in November elections This air campaign has been paltry from the start he warned them were coming he hit empty buildings in the dead of night he doesnt want casualties not only civilian casualties he doesnt even want a lot of dead terrorists END OF VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE And its not just critics from the right taking the president to task for the continued rise of ISIS his former defense secretary says he should have followed through on that red line he set for Syria BEGIN VIDEO CLIP LEON PANETTA FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY The most important thing that the president has is the credibility of our word when he drew the red line in Syria I think it was the right thing to do But once you draw that line and he did then I think the credibility in the United States is on the line that really somehow began to pull back I sent a mixed message not only to Assad not only to the Syrian but to the world END OF VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE There we have it Leon Panetta you take KATIE PAVLICH GUEST COHOST Well I think that the president needs to take a hard look at what the point of this is I mean hes clearly made a huge mistake by telling the enemy that they  were not gonna implement ground troops because now they have readjusted their strategy right Theyre going into these areas in a way that we cant get to and we have that the question of Is this really going to work in a way he says If we hold on to account to his own statements which is to degrade and destroy ISIS First of all were not degrading them really and were certainly not destroying them theyre on the march And so until President Obama start to treat them like theyre not the JV team theyre not gonna act like the JV team And blowing up a couple of trucks here and there certainly isnt stopping them and were starting to see them marching as close to Turkey as theyre gonna get much we do something else GUILFOYLE Given what we have been doing in air campaign you would expect at least some better results been said theyre taunting 21 ISIS militants are deceased so is that we were supposed to clapped about and applaud PAVLICH Right out of 31000 right And thats the other thing if theyre still recruiting people are going over theyre recruiting something like 5000 fighters at a time and were touting this idea that were killing a couple here and there I mean this is a huge problem and if the United States doesnt want to have a long war like Philip ph always complains about then we need to get in there and get the job done and get out BOB BECKEL COHOST OK So now  unless you guys are right we got two trucks and 21 big one I was from campaign for 60 days I just want to sure your facts right GUILFOYLE Bob BECKEL Peters by the way with all due respect is the most ridiculous comment Ive heard anybody make Because I could not understand it very well but it is probably called and could be forgiven but the point here is to suggest that the commander in chief will do something like that to get you through a fall election its one of the  its just  well its somebody thats been out of the military too long GREG GUTFELD COHOST But OK Two things President Obama is a political magic 8ball Whenever you go to him every answers there was gonna be political However we are talking about American lives and I dont think that hes doing this for political reasons But when you talk about what critical things are said about Obama you got to remember what was said about President Bush during the Iraq war and how vile that was to make anything said about President Obama look like a butterfly kiss This stuff is mile compared to the stuff that was a  CROSSTALK GUTFELD Preminisce to call Bush Bush Hitler But I do think there is point to be made that the issue is trepidation and war was supposed to be waged its not supposed to be manicured like a Zen garden And because of this procrastination the campaign has become less efficient were bombing vacant buildings I called it airaoke its karaoke air strikes they  which are seem more perfunctory than they actually are substantive and I think thats the problem BECKEL You dont believe thats the strategy do you That they picked out empty CROSSTALK ERIC BOLLING COHOST And that is the problem Look Im gonna agree with what the president is doing with the exception of he has no strategy Whats the end game if you add  GUILFOYLE So what are you agreeing with LAUGHTER GUTFELD Eric campaign GUILFOYLE Thats it BOLING Look Muslims have been fighting for Jihad for 1500 years Were not going to wipe out ISIS well turn ISIS into another form of Jihad but they will continue to fight it theyll continue to hate the west theyll continue to hate anybody who frankly doesnt ascribe to their call of faith So what is the strategy Isnt to degrade and destroy May be thats a little bit too aggressive may be it should be punish these people for what theyre doing Look we have two beheaded Americans GUILFOYLE I dont understand this So you want to put ISIS in the corner like on a stool and say youve got a time out Thats not gonna work BOLLING Heres I wanna do as of at GUILFOYLE Its punish BOLLING At the beginning of June the ISIS  against ISIS in Iraq and Syria weve hit Syria 104 times air strikes and in Iraq 265 for a total of 1000 about 1100 bombs dropped on this group in that period of time Thats not enough you just go after them you hit them hurt them and if they behead another American hit them again and hurt them even more But I just  I dont know that we have had one American death We have had one marine who I believe is considered a casualty of this war so far of this portion of the war Im  I like that number low GUILFOYLE Well sure but you know but do you like terror better I mean this is the problem BOLLING You never gonna get strategic war and never gonna eradicate terror were fools if you think the war on terror is a winnable war its a manageable war but not a winnable war CROSSTALK BECKEL Your approach is to recognize its rules are put on the ground here right GUILFOYLE My approach is to do whatever it takes to get it done I dont want to hear their name again I want do their job right so that other generations dont have to suffer from it And we have the military that has the wherewithal to do it and get it done right And theyre frustrated marching straight over to Turkey to the border CROSSTALK BECKEL This start was out in the empire 2000 years ago PAVLICH OK But were in a position now Were not just talking about a terrorist group here a terrorist group there were talking about a terrorist group that is 40000 strong now they are an army and they have two countries that they have taken over and theyre not going to stop Theyre going to continue on GUILFOYLE Bob I want to see your eyeballs roll like that PAVLICH Exactly so there  were not talking about some terror group and stopping a small cell here were talking about a huge portion of the Middle East thats been taken over And to Kimberlys point what is the point here I mean the president complained and actually pulled the troops out of Iraq in the first place because he said we had been there too long Why then are we engaged in a campaign that is going to take a long time to get the job done And this idea that were gonna take a year to train the moderate Syrians to fight out ISIS when be trained Iraq army couldnt do it The only people that are capable of doing it is the US military with forces and maybe some of these coalition forces GUILFOYLE I dont think we have a year to wait and waste time PAVLICH Yeah and they have already taken so much land BOLLING Whats ends goal if we win in full force as many boots under as many troops as we needed The end goal will we defeat Al Qaeda and Khorasan and ISIS and all the forms of terrorism in the Middle East least Or do we just shoot them to another country Thats  rebirth PAVLICH I think taking out tens of thousands of them is a good start stopping the recruiting and President Obama listening to his military leaders when they say all of them pretty much including people who have left the administration who worked under both Bush and Obama saying this is what youve sweet done ph what youre doing is mission impossible that is something that we can start with BECKEL I dont want to give you a geography lesson Katie but if you say the whole chunks of the Middle East that is ridiculous It probably less PAVLICH You dont think Syria and Iraq are huge chunks of Middle East BECKEL No no not the Middle East BOLLING But they  they have been won and they been lost and they been won over countless tens of centuries CROSSTALK GUILFOYLE I dont know what happened here GUTFELD No but were actually GUILFOYLE This table is getting sauce and I thank Katie wore her boots LAUGHTER GUTFELD We can agree on one thing and that is terror is at a minimum a 30 year war Panetta is right on that But that shouldnt keep us for want him to destroy them completely HGUILFOYLE Thank you GUTFELD So I think  I think you could be right and said this thing is  is this thing is ongoing but so was it like getting up in the morning and going to the gym That killing terrorists is just like going to the gym you get up you do what every day to make your life a little better And we have this  we have the best killing machine ever created in the history of the world this is what it is made for to eradicate evil and evil will always be here thats the nature of the world CROSSTALK BECKEL Are we supposed to take care of the Middle East GUILFOYLE And by the way and by the way theyre ready to answer the call GUTFELD Its our responsibility to eradicate those were a threat to America And they are a threat to America CROSSTALK BOLLING Can I agree to Greg GUILFOYLE Theyre a direct threat to the United States of America and our military is ready willing and able to serve We dont have a draft in this country We dont have to force people to serve CROSSTALK BOLLING I said we all agreeing on the same thing or were just debating on what method of doing it GUILFOYLE So if you think OK BOLLING We all feel terror GUILFIYLE What Is not air strike then what BOLLING I said air strikes CROSSTALK GUILFOYLE The military commanders have said thats not gonna work BOLLING We have done 400 air strikes in six months 400 How about 200 a day I mean when we went into Iraq we  there I think GUILFOYLE Eric BOLLING There were more than 100 air strikes the first day in Iraq We have done 400 in six months GUILFOYLE But all the credible experts agree that this is not working it is woefully insufficient to get the job done PAVLICH The former head of the marine corps the head of central command I mean Leon Panetta has said this Oliver north has said this I mean all of the attend ph military commanders who are both retired and currently serving have said a Martin Dempsey came in front of congress and said if ground  if air force are strikes do not work we will have to send in ground troops and the American people have said we support air strikes and if they fail which they are failing  BECKEL How do you know that How do you say that GUILFOYLE Bob are you paying attention Are you paying attention of whats going on CROSSTALK GUTFEL They are moving on I mean they are about to take another city GUILFOYLE Marching and raising the flag Theyve got this open BECKEL I tell you if I was in New Jersey I would be worried about it GUILFOYLE You know what You can make a joke about this but this is a real threat to the United States BECKEL This is American  these Americans men and women have to go and fight a war that they should be fighting CROSSTALK GUTFELD But they want to GUILFOYLE Give them a chance GUTFELD I think the military is more than happy to hear the media concerned about them but they are happy to do this this is the volunteer army and then are trained to do this and theyre looking for who  It may be a holy war for our military as well not just for them GUILFOYLE But thats what Ive been trying to say I dont understand They have taken those and theyve signed up they want to be part of this they believe in this country they want to fight for freedom and liberty and for the gains that we achieved in the Middle East CROSSTALK BOLLING In the Middle East thats what this fight is about And thats part of the problem GUILFOYLE Alright OK lets talk about them lets have Bobs favorite suggest the administration President Obama Biden once again Biden is the new Bob and this is what he had to say suggesting last week that Turkey the UAE and the Saudi support the extremist in Syria Were gonna take it around BEGIN VIDEO CLIP VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN Our allies in the region were our largest problem in Syria The Turks were great friends the Saudis the Emiratis etcetera They were so determined to take down Assad and essentially we have a proxy SunniShia war what did they do They poured 100000000 and 10000 tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad expect to the people who were being  who were being supply were all in Syria ph and Al Qaeda END OF VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE Alright Bolling BOLING Well he was right GUILFOYLE About the money BOLLING He was right about a lot of things I mean we dont really know who we were supplying we dont know who we were arming and thats part of the problem It offended some of the Arab coalitions so he had to make the official anthology but look he was  he was right Look you know how I feel about this You say what you mean you mean what you say and ifs  if you have to apologize I guess GUTFELD There will never a yell whats interesting though I have been on this planet for a long time 20 years No one ever apologizes to America nobody says hey guys sorry about those terrorist that came from our country I dont get the apologize  we apologize for everything including the good stuffs we do When you grade things into this world and then we have to apologize for exporting values that make you live longer BECKEL And thats it  it is a good point but I mean lets also say that what Biden said if anybody here can factually suggest us that Saudi Arabia has not funded terrorism I mean is what Joe said was the truth the problem is he shouldnt have said it because it was  GUKFOYLE Well it doesnt help the coalitions that a love sandwich trying to make this work out PAVLICH What Bob I actually completely agree with you I was surprised that these countries were offended that we would  even accuse them of funding terrorism And of Bin Laden came from Saudi Arabia lets be real So the fact were apologizing now to these countries who  not only a funded terrorist a Harvard ph terrorist I think its right BOLLING If he doesnt apologize exactly what happens Im not sure PAVLICH The coalition falls apart And they go back to their BOLLING Will they really fall apart PAVLICH Of course theyre looking for any reason to leave the coalition They wanna leave so bad GUILFOYLE It should be stronger than that its unfortunate isnt it Once again calling America Ahead on The Five an American teen is arrested for trying to join ISIS Greg thinks the fed should let him go GUTFELD Yeah GUILFOYLE Hes gonna tell us why COMMERCIAL BREAK GUTFELD So imagine youre throwing a party and some obnoxious guest wants to leave Do you stop him or do you jail him in your garage Of course not you toss him out like the stinky garbage he is which is common sense I like how we treated the Chicago team busted on OHare for trying to join ISIS Muhammad Hassan Khan no doubt a tea party or Mr Affleck was arrested before heading to Istanbul If convicted hell face 15 years in jail which really means two and thanks to prison when he leaves hell be lean and lawyerly He can sue you and do 100 pushups simultaneously and while in jail I doubt hell convert to Buddhism So I say you let the dude go and follow him to Jihadist land then blow that places with the rings ph Its obvious a Western Jihadist is an amazing tool for Intel a tracer that lead you to the target hes the skeet More important the straw ph had an express a hatred for western values so we should be grateful that he is leaving Unlike those who come here and stay with Sharia in mind we need a martyr exaltation program where we encourage the mawps ph to migrate And as the self appointed Sally Struthers of infidel support Ill buy the first oneway ticket to paradise myself Think about it for just pennies a day you too can eliminate a dirt bag and well send you a picture of your adopted martyr once hes achieved nirvana although its probably not suitable for framing So I think I mean there is  I guess Katie there is  there is a logic to keeping him here because theres a fear that if he goes hell come back But arent we smart enough that when he goes we can follow him PAVLICH Apparently not Because the problem that were facing is that we cant keep these guys from coming back to United States The way the law is written they cant  you cant just stripped off their passport because they havent run out their citizenship Ted Cruz introduce legislation about two weeks ago GUILFOYLE Right PAVLICH That would have allowed for the stripping of citizenship and therefore the passports and they couldnt come back So I dont mind letting him go but we need to work on keeping them there aspect of this but yeah following them right away knew the drone can fire it its from the airplane That will work out pretty well GUILFOYLE Yeah I mean why do you put a GPS and put some take their phone put something on there trace some drone them something charming like that GUILFOYLE Youre the James Bond to this show PAVLICH Love it GUILFOYLE I mean honestly Im about so constrained perhaps to sit here from 5 to 6 the things I could do GUTFELD But Bob why didnt we stop them I dont know BECKEL Listen an example of the guest being thrown out of the party I was many many times LAUGHTER And they should have let me keep going I agree with you completely Look what it is done heres the good news about all this we disagree on how to deal with this right now but all the major Jihadists in the world are gathering for their conventions in a relatively small area by the way and what now we have to  whether you decide you want to do it with troops I dont think we you should do we can leave it aside get let him go GUTFELD Yeah BECKEL I mean I dont  the idea that we cant track these guys is silly BOLLING Youre making a very very good point Why not track him Especially this guy was gonna go  the flight he was boarding was gonna go to Turkey I mean at least the Turks could follow him GUTFELD Yes yeah BOLLING Its not like hes going to find his way into Pakistan or Afghanistan and get lost somewhere We hope that they would pick them up on there on the side But look what he say he left a note to his parents saying He wanted to fight for ISIS because US taxes were being used to kill Muslim his Muslim brothers At that point Im going to agree with Katie and Ted Cruz well you just  you relinquish your citizenship at that moment If youre treasonist you should probably be sent to Gitmo ph and then go ahead water board the torch CROSSTALK GUILFOYLE Any other country they dont have this problem They dont unlock the moral will to be able to do something and say Listen you have committed not to treason against this country Im not gonna be worried about hurting your legal feelings give me your passport your citizenship is revoked so be it BECKEL Well that every European country is like that Thats why treason got the problem they got VAT ph GUILFOYLE No they dont let people in guess what BECKEL But they dont GUILFOYLE They dont let everybody come back Anybody is coming from Liberia BECKEL I know I know youre a worldwide travel because I been in terrorist line and its more Muslim there than they are PAVLICH Well they did it and then they learned their lesson and they GUTFELD Yeah but it is too late The genie is out of that bottle CROSSTALK PAVLICH You know the FBI is tracking these people theyre just tracking them after they go fight for ISIS and come back to the United States and theyre saying that they cant necessarily arrest them GUILFOYLE What about a porous border I would have to say I would just walk right on over from Mexico BOLLING Its easy to do If anybody else concerned that  call me on 60 minutes on Sunday night we have our eye on 12 PAVLICH Exactly BOLLING And I got to do this a lot more on 12 GUILFOYLE Thats the 12 that they know about BOLLING But he said he knew about all of them and there are 12 CROSSTALK BECKEL Its not like congress would not know about them and they got out of the country so they can back on test GUTFELD Well heres  theres this other interesting weird development This is got to be the first I guess engagement were  its also an online war Catherine Herridge reported this morning that their ISIS and their sympathizers were threatening an air force pilot and his son on Facebook theyre sworn by sympathizers This is a new thing and I dont know how serious you take it but given the fact that they are encouraging followers to go to military homes and slaughter them this is just an internet troll PAVLICH Right BECKEL Its proven it is proven already that somebody is listening in and this is something  this guy is Oklahoma all of a sudden then youll find out that he probably got a lot of his information from those terror networks and web pages But and by the way before we leave segment I wanted to be very clear I have been the toughest one on this show on Muslims That anybody GUTFELD Radical Muslims BECKEL And nobody said anything about it GUILFOYLE Radical Muslims Jihadists BECKEL As I said before let me say today Jihadist LAUGHTER I was talking about this thing when nobody else was talking about it And what I wasnt doing was leading the military campaign to get over there I want you to do that because you would be great at it GUILFOYLE Im all got it PAVLICH Can be a done and out if Kimberly was in charge GUILFOYLE And I also would like to military families to stay off of social media and Facebook we goes go dark GUTFELD Really GUILFOYLE Yeah GUTFELD That isnt right That I think they should GUILFOYLE I want them to be safe GUTFELD Why run from trolls GUILFOYLE You know why because be fell ph find a way to serve find a way to get after them theyll make it GUTFELD They have to use Facebook to talk to their  to their husbands and wives who are away you know PAVLICH Privacy settings Change them CROSSTALK GUTFELD Screw these people Screw these people that are harassing them GUILFOYLE Or Skype GUTFELD Dont let them stop you from what youre doing BOLLING Alright I think we have it GUILFOYLE Why dont we eliminate them so we dont have this problem anymore Thats what Im saying BECKEL Every one of them GUILFOYLE Greg GUTFELD Alright Coming up is one of Americas most popular TV shows Islamophobic What some politically correct critics are saying about homeland when he come back COMMERCIAL BREAK BOLLING Well you all know by now homeland is one of my favorite TV shows Watch BEGIN VIDEO CLIP UNKWON We should go UNKNOWN Wait Wait END OF VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Well season four kicked off Sunday The lead character is a CIA agent now stationed in Pakistan Most critics love Homeland but others are panning it calling it Islamophobic One writer in The Washington Post just said its the most bigoted show on television riddled with basic errors about Islam and filled with absurd stereotypes I want to bring it around Greg Its a TV show GUTFELD Yes it is Can I point out the writer is an activist who writes for The Socialist Worker So its not even about Islam Its not about Islam its about being antiwest This is somebody that is accusing this show which is approximately for the United States of racism In fact she says actually Homeland perpetuates racist ideas that have real consequences the accusation of bigotry always arrives as a defense against hate facts These are the facts that you hate because you cannot dispute them She cannot dispute so she has to call everybody racist BOLLING Katie four seasons now theres a lot of things that are very very close to whats really going on in the world and maybe thats what scares people who are worried about things like Islamophobia PAVLICH I think that they just need to distinguish that this is a television show This is fiction as you mentioned at the top of the segment And if there are exaggerations or things that are not true its because the show isnt true and its written by people based on maybe world events but that doesnt necessarily mean its true Are Brad Thor ph books homophobic  Islamophobic as well I mean theres plenty of literature you can look at that is based on world events and pull any of these things out whether its Islam or other situations So I just think its ridiculous BOLLING Thats part of the problem Its so close to reality that they feel that PAVLICH Maybe its  maybe its so close to reality that theyre uncomfortable as Greg said with maybe some of the truth coming out about what theyre all about BECKEL That wouldnt be  if it wasnt for whats going on at the same time is not an issue It is a TV show But its going on at a time of Kimberlys ph war So youre going to get this BOLLING All right Listen yesterday we showed you Ben Affleck on a panel with Bill Maher arguing over public criticism of radical Islam Last night Bill OReilly weighed on in that debate BEGIN VIDEO CLIP BILL OREILLY FOX NEWS ANCHOR Militant Islam continues to draw worldwide terrorism and there are plenty of sanctuaries from which to commit their evil Ben Affleck should well understand that he himself would be beheaded in a heartbeat by these ISIS animals and that even though they are the most extreme element of the Jihad theyre not that far away from their fanatical cousins END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING KG GUILFOYLE I mean heres the problem I have Islam is a religion And people keep saying Oh youre racist Race is talking about a religion I mean they dont even understand the terminology Theyre making these blanket statements getting hysterical throwing it out there instead of understanding the history understanding the cause the news whats going on and the different facets of it So theyre speaking in a way that I find to be very ignorant BOLLING Along these lines of something KG just said People are saying if youre  if you have a big issue with this you could be racist instead of Islamophobic Is one worse than the other BECKEL No The racist part floors me You have to keep in mind that this is a religion that these people follow that are killing a religious people Christians who were there before many of them GUILFOYLE And theyre GUTFELD But theyre also killing Muslims Muslims are killing more Muslims than Christians The interesting thing about the writer The Washington Post article and Ben Affleck is they dont mention radical Islams attacks on women And interesting thing also about the article in The Washington Post is the woman mentions that one of the creators is Jewish and I wonder why she puts that in there PAVLICH Yes well I think if were going to be consistent with western values both liberals and conservatives that people like Ben Affleck if theyre really going to be out there parading for gay rights and womens rights then they should probably speak up against radical Islam where theyre hanging gays off bridges and stoning women in the street for going out without the proper headgear GUILFOYLE And this is all in the name of a religion of using Sharia law and their interpretation of the Koran to justify these heinous crimes that are being committed BOLLING Did you see  after we talked about this yesterday did you see Bill Maher explain to Salon what he was really saying He literally didnt walk back his comment but he wanted to explain to all his fans I guess who are giving him a hard time why he just seemed so weak and so shallow GUTFELD I think his point is that if youre a liberal you should defend liberal beliefs BOLLING Right Above all Above all GUTFELD And also if you wanted to make clear that he thinks all religion is stupid he just finds at the moment Islam is the most potentially harmful or radical Islam is the most potentially harmful of the religions BECKEL Heres the good news Finally the Muslim community is beginning worldwide to speak out and thats a good sign BECKEL All right Were going to have to leave it there Up next is Colorados governor secondguessing his states decision to legalize pot Well have that Democrat coming up on The Five COMMERCIAL BREAK PAVLICH A lot of folks in Colorado are happy the state became the first to legalize marijuana in 2012 But its Democratic governor isnt one of them John Hickenlooper actually says it wasnt such a good idea and is warning other governors to think twice BEGIN VIDEO CLIP UNIDENTIFIED MALE A number of other states are looking at what Colorado has done when it comes to recreational marijuana Was Colorados move a mistake GOV JOHN HICKENLOOPER D COLORADO To do that without having all the data there is not enough data and to a certain extent you could say it was reckless Im not saying it was reckless because Ill get quoted everywhere But if it was up to me I wouldnt have done it Ive opposed it from the very beginning Oh what the hell Ill say its reckless END VIDEO CLIP PAVLICH Hes going to say its reckless So Bob there are three other states  well Washington DC isnt a state  but Washington DC Alaska and Oregon who are considering  theyre putting this on the ballot next month for legalization What do you think theyre going to heed his warning Or do you think theyre going to go through BECKEL No I dont think  the problem with studies and facts about drugs and alcohol is that there are so many varying studies that you can find The idea that theres a definitive study on the impact of marijuana and that it is addictive which having been down that road myself many times it is not Whether it does corrode certain parts of your brain a lot of things do Kimberly does to me once in a while GUILFOYLE I definitely improved your brain BECKEL But I just  Im a little bit  this guy said he was  we needed more facts Well facts are facts are facts Greg youre the fact guy GUTFELD Well theres a lot of  theres a lot of studies that come out and its true with Bob like the percentage of drinkers who become alcoholics is higher than the percentage of pot smokers who become heavy users You dont hear about that Pots effect on IQs theyve been saying it lowers your IQ But it may be the behavior the fact that somebody who tends to smoke a lot of dope misses the key information from school that would help you in an IQ test It has to do with the fact that its stealing time from education The fact is pot does affect your brain and thats why you shouldnt do it all day just like booze sugar and cable TV All of them will destroy you if you do it 247 PAVLICH Yes I want to bring up the study that its actually one of the most expensive studies done on marijuana in the past 20 years Its a 20 year study on the longterm effects of cannabis by professional Wayne Hall And its  hes an advisor to the World Health Organization He found that one in sixteen  one in sixteen marijuana users become dependent on marijuana if they use it on a regular basis Intellectual development is impaired for heavy using teens It doubles the risk of developing psychotic disorders including schizophrenia So this is a 20year exhaustive study when all of the other studies weve seen Kimberly have been very GUTFELD I hate to use a pun its a rehash PAVLICH A rehash GUTFELD Its a rehash I just went through some of the things that disprove what he said Im sorry go ahead GUILFOYLE No no no this is a great debate Youre engaged in it Im happy to hear your voice GUTFELD The percentage of drinkers that become alcoholics is higher If you look at percentage of who die in car crashes 31 percent are from drinking Maybe 18 percent had pot but they also might have been drinking at the same time So you cant even put that on pot Can I just add one little weird theory Its Jacob Stallen ph whos a brilliant writer Marijuana impairs driving less dramatically than booze If it is substituted for booze you might actually see less traffic fatalities if more people smoked marijuana than drink In fact total traffic fatalities as marijuana consumption increases Its gone 20 percent fewer from 2012 inks back perhaps to the fact that maybe more people are smoking GUILFOYLE But when you think about driving though think about the other crimes that are committed or people using it as a gateway drug into other more serious or harder drugs Its the first step CROSSTALK GUILFOYLE In the study they GUTFELD Youve been smoking havent you BOLLING  and I dont But let me give you the fiscal side of things PAVLICH Numbers Yes numbers BOLLING Tax revenue has gone up in Colorado It probably would go up in any state that legalized it And if you dont go so far as legalizing it you probably are going to see a push to decriminalize it in states which means youll save a ton of money with overoccupied prison systems jail systems at the state level GUILFOYLE Thats the Democraticlibertarian argument BECKEL Can I make one fast point This guy says this it is addictive Being an addict myself addiction means when your drug of choice is removed you have a physical reaction to it You have to have it or you have to go through the DTs or you have to go through whatever to get through it I have yet to see in all my years of both rehabs and working with alcoholics and working with drug addicts I have never seen anybody go  getting the Jones off of marijuana BOLLING But you have seen people step up from marijuana when they cant get high any more from marijuana GUILFOYLE This is all insane Not so innocent GUTFELD I think alcohol is the biggest gateway drug there is I never did anything bad until I started drinking PAVLICH Well were all going to need a drink after the show Im sure GUTFELD Im buying PAVLICH Coming up next who are the most generous people in America The wealthy or the poor And where do they live in red states or blue states The answers may surprise you coming up on The Five COMMERCIAL BREAK BECKEL That is an awful song I apologize Americans are generous people And according to a new analysis of IRS data its not just the wealthy who are charitable in this country From 2006 to 2012 poor Americans actually increased donations to charity while their incomes were going down The rich decreased their donations The study also shows which states as a whole gave the most The top ones all happened to be red ones Yes The top five are Georgia Tennessee Alabama Mississippi and Utah is No 1 Eric you were suggesting about Utah what BOLLING I think the people you saw there theyre  its a heavily Mormon population and they tithe They give a lot of money of their incomes BECKEL Twenty percent BOLLING Surprising though the top 1 percent the top even 1 to 5 percent have done very well in the last couple of years Im surprised to see them back off their giving GUILFOYLE Why do you think that is BECKEL Because they BOLLING Its probably a raw number in other words theyre probably giving the same percentage but its not  theyre not giving  Im sorry theyre giving the same amount but not the same percentage of their income so as their income is going up GUILFOYLE Theyre not investing it Theyre not investing BECKEL That was a good try Theyre just not giving as much money PAVLICH This is the number that actually caught my eye was the 200000 number So Americans who make more than 200000 a year are typically people who own small businesses So the way that they offer charity isnt through donating money its through creating jobs And theyre maybe not donating the extra money they had to charity because now theyre dealing with a lot of government regulations Obamacare is a big one So I dont think thats really fair to say theyre not being generous considering what they have to spend the money to BECKEL You just hijacked my segment GUILFOYLE Did you see how amazing that was How she tied in Obamacare BECKEL I mean what  right away PAVLICH They dont have the money BECKEL My entire  what is it called the Stockholm Syndrome Youre taking hostage my story  block here So be quiet I dont want to talk about Obamacare No it was a good point I think Now Greg your giving has gone up GUTFELD Yes Heres my theory on the difference between income  the richer you get the more it might be reflective of an education And the more educated you are you tend to be less religious and we see that trend happening Charity is often a product of a community which is often bound together by faith And that raises the question what happens when religion declines Who replaces what replaces religion in terms of tying a community together and encouraging charity Somebodys got to figure that out because it doesnt look good BECKEL You know thats what Greg was saying  or Eric was saying about Mormons They do tithe 15 to 20 percent of their income goes to the church and to charity They do wonderful things GUTFELD That Mitt Romney was a terrible person GUILFOYLE Horrible Thirty million dollars a year BECKEL I was trying to support your point GUTFELD No no I was saying that he was such a good man but it didnt matter GUILFOYLE I know I was so upset about it We miss you Mitt BOLLING And I just  you notice the other four in the top five were all southern states BECKEL Yes BOLLING The people in the south right BECKEL Always have been BOLLING Fantastic GUILFOYLE Oh Bobs BECKEL It was the war of northern aggression and dont suggest that its over Theyre simply waiting for resupplies PAVLICH What are you talking about BECKEL Just what you were talking about which is take my whole segment and taking it into Obamacare So now Im going to take mine into something else PAVLICH Im just saying people who make that much money 200000 number are typically people who are giving others jobs And when they have extra money think have extra charity money BECKEL Thats not the point of this segment OK GUILFOYLE Yes it is BECKEL Its a good point yes But I mean GUILFOYLE Gee Bob She made a good point Heres the deal thats what happens BECKEL That was a very tough thing to say right there I mean it was just  that was a gut shot that one And I really dont appreciate it OK now GUILFOYLE Im not sorry BECKEL You know were struggling here Im going to tell you why Normally my blocks last 90 seconds and today its four minutes GUILFOYLE Now you know what to do Please adjust the timing You see BECKEL I got to put up with you guys all week long being outnumbered GUILFOYLE Couldnt we find a better way BECKEL What OK now lets go One More Thing is up next COMMERCIAL BREAK GUILFOYLE Well its time now for One More Thing Are you excited I am Did you guys check out Jimmy Kimmel Because as always he is very very funny And he asked Americans went to people and said Hey who is Joe Biden These answers are hilarious Take a look BEGIN VIDEO CLIP UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE Who is Joe Biden UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE I have no idea UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE Want to take a guess UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE A man UNIDENTIFIED MALE Joe Biden I dont know A terrorist group I guess UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE Who is Joe Biden UNIDENTIFIED MALE No comment UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE Joe Biden is he a movie star UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE Who is Joe Biden UNIDENTIFIED MALE Joe Biden I dont know who that is END VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE All right do they all vote Thats my concern Bolling what do you got for me Youre agreeing over there BOLLING OK So 272 points down in the Dow today a lot going on over there on the FOX business network you should check it out if you get a chance to Europe getting a little bit weak China also saying their growth projections may back off a little bit Take a look at the chart very quickly The SP over the last year and a day on the SP Watch some important numbers got taken out of the downside rate there You know what Basically it turns into the stock market probably has a little bit more to go south maybe 500 to 1000 points So if youre an investor or looking to invest pull up Give it a little time to breathe GUILFOYLE And if you dont have FBN demand it BOLLING Right GUILFOYLE OK Greg GUTFELD All right Its time for BEGIN VIDEO CLIP GUTFELD Gregs Sports Corner END VIDEO CLIP GUTFELD And is this a good one Weve got the International Kangaroo Street Fighting Championship which took place in Perth Check this out Theyre not booing him theyre rooing him Kangarooing him that is In a typical ritualized fight where you have high standing posture with pawing direct at the chest and head locking forearms and wrestling By the way they were fighting over a parking space Harsh Anyway GUILFOYLE You sure that wasnt in LA GUTFELD The  lets come back to me An interesting kangaroo fact A kangaroo releases no flatulence which is methane Scientists are now interested in transferring the bacteria in kangaroos to cattle because the gases effects of cattle are 23 times greater than carbon dioxide Kangaroos because they cant pass wind may save our planet ladies and gentlemen BECKEL Youre about to make me throw up GUILFOYLE This is like the weirdest show Bob BECKEL And Im following up your kangaroos with my One More Thing Theres a lot of dog lovers around here Im not one of them But I want to show you what happens when these cute little dogs you all like so much   look what they do to this poor old guy Like he comes in there to pet those puppies They bring him down that ones got his ear Thats a gut shot right in the middle That ones got the hand And theyre little puppies Imagine when they get big Theyre going to ruin the whole neighborhood This poor guy look at him Hes dying GUILFOYLE OK This has now become Animal Planet PAVLICH Well I have a public service announcement Winter is coming it is flu season It is cold season If youre going to cough or sneeze either in your home in public or on public transportation you do not do this into your hands You sneeze into your elbow and your biceps Youre helping everyone stay clean Youre helping everyone stay healthy GUTFELD You just offended somebody PAVLICH Just make sure you sneeze in your elbow and not in your hand Thank you very much GUILFOYLE Like a kindergarten class BOLLING What do you do if your bicep is too big GUILFOYLE I dont know Bolling Guns and UNINTELLIGIBLE Before we go were celebrating an anniversary here today at FOX Thank you to big boss Roger Ailes who launched this network

picture of life under his administration listen BEGIN VIDEO CLIP PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA Were coming out of this recession would be best educated the most diverse the most digitally fluent generation of adults American history The good news is that despite some of the gridlock in Washington were making progress and when I come to places like this it inspires me and reminds of  why Im chronically optimistic about the future of America END OF VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Well hes doing everything he can to appeal to those in Millennials Even get this rolling out in Emoji campaign on the economy But how

They relate to him he relates to them theyre his group Thats his layup Thats his easy shot GREG GUTFELD COHOST Right You know the liberal philosophy is based on a desire for acceptance I think we know that desire to be cool which is why President Obama and Millennials work together so well They have little choice but to embrace Obama because if they dont theyre met with criticism by their academic  their academic BECKEL Superior GUTFELD Professors and also GUILFOYLE Hollywood GUTFELD They feel compelled to do it because celebrities make it cool to do that But we you know we can knock Millennials for subscribing to the shallow impulses  in shallow impulse to belong But we need to devote our energies to  something better which is to articulate a vision that they would like The left is really really good at selling bad ideas but the right is lousy at selling good ideas and the right needs to be able to learn from the left or theyre keep losing and losing and losing BOLLING And Bob we  we

digitally connected and so they have learned to communicate in a way that youre right Obama understands that language I didnt know what an emotion  what that thing is it its until my nephew told me what it was But if you think about during this campaign in it he understood how his campaign as to how to get these people GUILFOYLE Yeah BECKEL The other thing is the future is in technology and jobs are not gonna be blue collar jobs anymore there adversely not existence GUTFELD But isnt it correct though that an Emoji basically represents feeling Feelings  if feelings for Obama mean more than that TANTAROS But he has slipped the numbers Eric with the Millennials if you dig deep And I think its probably 13 percent use on employment I mean Bob youre absolutely right they do care about giving back in charity and thats have the thing But he has lost BOLLING Lets move on CROSSTALK BOLLING Agree to President Obama he took time out of his busy schedule to hit the fundraising circuit again and swing by Gwyneth Paltrows house the actress welcomed him with a gushy love fest ph telling him quote Youre so handsome that I cant speak properly and then there was this to see ph It would be wonderful if we were able to give the man all of the power that he needs to pass the things that he needs to pass GUTFELD Yes GUILFOYLE Oh boy BOLLING Alright Greg you mentioned celebrity boy celebrities gushing for the guy GUTFELD Well he  Gwyneth Paltrow is a metaphor for all of Hollywood They look at it  President Obama is kind of a left wing version of One Direction Justin Bieber and Menudo all rolled into one He turns every  member of the media into a teen beat editor And whats interesting is GUILFOYLE So were true GUTFELD And what happens is  this is what a cult does it takes people who are considered liberal and open minded and says  We would like a dictator thats a cult When somebody says You know what Itll be great if I  if he just made all the decision That is a definition of a cult when somebody says who believes theyre open minded says I would rather have him make all the decisions for everyone Thats a pretty scary thought BECKEL Thats somebody who one of those like Richard Nixon CROSSTALK TANTAROS But that is the basis of liberalism it is saying that the government knows better than the people so were letting is government take all the power and make all the decisions And by the way we did give President Obama all the power to make all the decisions then look how it turned out hes over recount less ph the number of that BECKEL It didnt give him all the power because remember the Republican control the House probably will control the Senate TANTAROS Bob He circumvented Congress how many times now BECKEL I wish he do it more But GUILFOYLE

it I didnt say anything negative that was actually pretty nice and said this is was what makes them feel better this great today CROSSTALK BOLLING Lets do this Lets move on to this In the latest point to get Millennial votes it supposedly nonpartisan Rock the Vote campaign releases a celebrity filled music video featuring the lives of Lena Dunham and Lil Jon to tell young voters what they think they should be turning out the vote for watch this BEGIN VIDEO CLIP UNKNOWN Im EJ and Im turning out for marriage equality UNKOWN My name is Lil Lena and Im turning out for reproductive rights UNKNOWN Whats up this is Lil Jon and Im turning out for the legalization of marijuana END OF VIDEO CLIP BOLLING So Lil Jon wants to smoke weed and Lil Lena Dunham want to take her pants off GUILFOYLE Wow

this is clever BECKEL I dont know who sing along all those voice I have no chance BOLLING Yeah What about using music and you know culture to get people to vote it worked BECKEL It worked for them for

right It didnt Lena Dunham to that ad comparing voting to losing your virginity so they figure lets run the same play and this time lets have her do without her pants on CROSSTALK GUTFELD Remember this is a  this is I suppose  this is Rock the Vote its not rock the liberal vote But however every issue that is mentioned in here skews liberal If you think about it whether it is a pot or per virtual whatever its a video celebration of issues that cater to the self These are things that I want its not about what makes the country better its that I want my  I want my pot or I want this or I want that Thats the way of the world CROSSTALK BOLLING But thats good though right I mean  GUTFELD There are single issues that theyre voting for BOLLING Right vote vote your mind vote what you want BECKEL On a serious note what the Republicans need to take a page out of this thing here because this is a way to get to the youth vote The Republicans have been notoriously been bad at it think on how to get their message through not just run order to its up to younger voters and theres no reason to this has to be on one side TANTAROS Well they dont have to put anything about Obamacare in there because President Obama made it accessible you can stay on your parents health care Today were 26 that was the way for them to get the youth votes and they can take that off the list But  I think they have hypocrisy though Lena Dunham talking about reproductive rights I mean the whole polite of feminism was that women didnt a man to pay their bills and these are women encouraging young girls to step up and get the government get President Obama to pay your bills BECKEL Whos the TANTAROS Remember all the talked Bob that your body being a personal issue BECKEL Yup TANTAROS But out this is between me and my doctor now its  no not until theres a 9 birth control bill and then I need the government  I need the government Im a victim CROSSTALK TANTAROS Its like a 4year old maturity and it just warn you BOLLING We have this believe button that the producers hover around waiting with that moment to press that button CROSSTALK BOLLING The kids who go to Harvard are supposed to be the

QUESTION What is the bigger threat to world peace America or ISIS UNKNOWN To world peace well America UNKNOWN As a western civilization were to blame for a lot of the problems we are facing know UNKNOWN American imperialism and our protection of oil interests in the Middle East are destabilizing the region and allowing groups like ISIS to gain power END OF VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Great Bob There

BOLLING By the way youre welcome to bring any of that information to the table any time you want to BECKEL Id be happy to LAUGHTER BOLLING Speculate on whether its there or not GUTFELD Its a pretty amazing scam that you can get parents to pay 60000 a year to make someone dumber And if this idiot virus is deadlier than Ebola and we give professors tenure to spread it throughout the world its incredible CROSSTALK GUTFELD Statistically Bob statistically BECKEL Youre right youre right I think Im gonna shut all the university college CROSSTALK GUILFOYLE Theyre just laying down one kind of knowledge thats the problem its not opening minds its closing them if parents pay a lot of money and sacrifices to send BECKEL How about university ph professors GUILFOYLE Why not Fine BECKEL Well go GUILFOYLE How about having some balance in the curriculum instead of brainwashing kids CROSSTALK BOLLING Is this possibly President Obama in June of 2009 student in  at Cairo University it started apologizing for American exemptionalism This is how it faster six years down the road TANTAROS Yeah he said in his Cairo speech that the US has been downright oppressive in its approach to foreign policy and thats when he was apologizing basically to the Middle East So yeah this isnt just college kids President Obama has said similar things Last night when we where hosting a rally factor Allan Combs said the same similar thing and hes an adult but I think we should take some of these liberal policies and we should start to tax schools like Harvard or their endowments You know this is where the richest 1 percent sent their kids how would they feel about taxing those professors that were really high tax right but they preach in their classes and again taxing their universities and their very very lucrative endowments Id love to see what the Harvard professors think about that BOLLING Can you come up with a devils advocate ph explanation for these kids saying that America is a threat to work peace GUTFELD Well I wouldnt equate ph President Obama because this kind of sensibility has been around for decades and I think its drown  its born from the success of America that your ability to criticize it We  you know we won these great wars that allowed people to raise families and raise children but then look back at the greatness of America and go well this sucks because I feel really guilty Its white liberal guilt BOLLING Leave it there GUILFOYLE Were good Were good Lets go CROSSTALK LAUGHTER BOLLING Alright coming up why wont a Democratic Senate candidate admit if she

COMMERCIAL BREAK TANTAROS Well its been a tough week for President Obama and its starting to seem like nobody has his back anymore BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JIMMY CARTER FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Hes been delayed sometimes he draws red lines in the sand and it is then when the time you feel that he doesnt go through with it LEON PANETTA FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY Barack Obama by virtue of whatve seen when the time I was there has the guts to do the right thing the real question is will he make the decision to do it We govern either by leadership or crisis and today we are largely governing by crisis UNKNOWN What Democrats told me today is that the President Obama however much they loved him his an albatross around their necks right now his poll numbers are so bad JOE BIDEN VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA The president is a drag on Democrats Democrats try to localize these elections make it between them and their opponent not between Obama  you know them and Obama and their opponent END OF VIDEO CLIP TANTAROS And you know things are bad when Democratic candidates dont even want to be seen with him Alison Lundergan Grimes from Kentucky wont even admit that she voted from him Chuck Todd things are back in sink phher campaign Watch this BEGIN VIDEO CLIP QUESTION Who did you vote for President Obama for 20082012 ALISON LUNDERGRAN GRIMES KENTUCKY SENATE CANDIDATE You know this election it isnt about the president CROSSTALK GRIMES I respect the sanctity of the ballot box And I know that the members of this editorial board do as well CHUCK TODD MEET THE PRESS HOST In Kentuckians expect her to cast a tough vote on anything Is she ever gonna answer a tough question on anything You wanna be a US Senator I think she disqualified he herself END OF VIDEO CLIP PERINO She cant even admit Bob that she voted for President Obama And in fact she said I was a delegate for Hillary Clinton BECKEL Yeah you know its amazing to me I have been in that business for 20 years and having some candidates that just dont get it I mean what did she think she was gonna do Hide that and somebody was going to buy into that notion that she doesnt want to more pay attention to it This is another case of example of where the campaign manager should said give me the shovel and stop digging TANTAROS Kimberly why GUILFOYLE Why you cant managing control here You seems to be very gap now that I cant even believe that the race is as close as it is BECKEL Well I mean it closes in because you said its a lousy impropriate incumbent GUILFOYLE Well a lot of money TANTAROS But why would she just say OK I voted for him but guess what I wouldnt vote for him now I mean now she looks shady She looks like shes trying to hide something to the constituents shes trying to represent GUILFOYLE No excuse honest looks like she lacks credible and shes a waiver and my kid affair weather fan like its all bad I dont see how any of this could come back to her BECKEL But I want to make one test to one about that too You can I confront ph GUTFELD Yeah BECKEL OK Its you need a lot of black votes in Kentucky in order to win in that state And its gonna pretty to say its black BOLLING You need a lot of coal votes is what you need CROSSTALK BOLLING But no but heres part of the promise she painted herself into the corner because she put the edge saying Im against President Obama cult ph policies to be gone And you shot the target with a rifle and so what  my guess is that she didnt want to be on tape staying I voted for him but then had this big ad saying I dont agree with any of his policies So she painted herself into that corner CROSSTALK BOLLING Look I believe in this but if my candidate this isnt the nominee I will vote for our side no matter who that is and she will paint  unpainted herself in the corner TANTAROS Greg doesnt it the curse GUTFELD Yeah before I talk about Grimes everybody always says like President Obama is an albatross around the neck of  whoever put albatrosses around necks I dont understand what that means Somebody write to me about that I dont know Grimes is like a guy who distanced himself from a friend whos throwing up at the bar hes I  Im not with him Im not with him The fact is if she  in order to run youre running away from a van that you knew to be true to your principles and that means youre actually running from your own principles  away from your own principles you see shes actually running from herself which is mindboggling TANTAROS How weird weird BECKEL Lets just say shes not running away from Obama these candidates look what happened to Bush in last year  any president whose popularity is low candidates are not gonna get near them TANTAROS Well by the way if she really was running away from them I wonder if she accepted campaign money I guarantee it from President Obama whos been raising it hand over fist CROSSTALK BOLLING This is the same one who had staffers or advisors operative  Democrat operatives saying No she doesnt really believe all the stuffs about coal that shes saying in her ad Shes pretty much cut I mean shes down by four now BECKEL Shes  the final kick ph vote is 45 percent CROSTALK GUTFELD But the most important point though is the Democrats Parties is the only one we have to wear disguise to win BECKL Can I answer that and so LAUGHTER TANTAROS To look a disguise moving from Kentucky to Texas Check out this ad you remember Wendy Davis very controversial candidate She took out this ad against her opponent Greg Abbott who is a paraplegic Watch this BEGIN VIDEO CLIP A tree fell on Greg Abbott he sued and got millions since then hes spend his career working against other victims Abbott argued a woman whose leg was amputated was not disabled because she had an artificial limb He ruled against a rape victim who sued a corporation for failing to do a back ground check on a sexual predator he sided with a hospital that failed to stop a dangerous surgeon who paralyzed patients Greg Abbott hes not for you END OF VIDEO CLIP TANTAROS OK Featuring Greg Abbott wheelchair Bob in an ad when Wendy Davis has already  shes already been hit on a string of thing this is   this is what a Hail Mary BECKEL Yeah this not a Hail Mary it is  this is a Hail Mary in loose Yeah maybe because it is like were running the other way with the ball I mean this is the kind of thing that you never ever do is take advantage some of your opponents physical or mental  in my case was generally public mental condition But in to do this in to do this is almost certain to back fire in every direction you can possibly imagine Whose sick  I dont know whose the consultant on this campaign for boys whoever you are resigns TANTAROS Greg GUTFELD I did  I mean its I  two things its a strong ad I mean we  its a strong ad with a very clear point of view and a very clear perspective However it is a sign of desperation that  it is a sign that is  they held it for so long it said We got to do this And so they threw it and BECEKL Strong effort and effort in tea funds GUTFELD Yeah But I was saying GUILFOYLE It is a strong ad But it is too uncomfortable that it may come backfire CROSSTALK BOLLING Could she have done same ad and leave the wheelchair out just speak out that he would  he got an injury million dollars GUTFELD Youre actually right CROSTALK TANTAROS Yeah I mean that shes been a very controversial candidate I think u youre right Bob I think that shes probably speaking of candidates who are cooked like the last one I think shes probably cooked too BECKEL She said something  I would want to go try and bail that already TANTAROS Yeah alright Coming up on The Five if Baghdad about to fall to ISIS the terrorist are closing in until will America stop them And also ahead its Facebook Friday you can post your questions for us at FacebookcomTHEFIVEFNC and you may hear us answer it stay tune COMMERCIAL BREAK GUILFOYLE Well remember last month when Joe Biden issued this warning to ISIS BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JOE BIDEN VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES When people harm Americans we dont retreat We dont forget They should know we will follow them to the gates of hell until they are brought to justice Because hell is where they will reside END VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE That still works for me But does America still plan to chase them there Well the terror network is now reportedly just eight miles from Baghdad If Baghdad falls then the entire country wont be far behind Whats our plan Jonah Goldberg thinks that campaign so far is really just for show BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JONAH GOLDBERG NATIONAL REVIEW Its not an air campaign It is something slightly less than a PR campaign Its essentially a political operation It is a way to say Were doing something to take the heat off of him through the midterms to make it seem as if hes doing what he needs to do as commander in chief when in fact it  its essentially a glorified light show at this point GUILFOYLE All right well lets see if theres some evidence to the contrary Theyre certainly doing the air strikes Theres criticism that that is insufficient and evidence such as Baghdad you know theyre eight miles away Bolling what does this tell us about the efficiency and the lethalness of this operation BOLLING Well they could step it up I know I think the numbers we looked at a couple of days ago and there were 400 total air strikes in several months They could be doing 400 in a day Again its expensive though I mean were dropping 4 million bombs on 20000 trucks But look GUILFOYLE But spend more I mean whats the point  I mean whats the point if its not going to make a difference BOLLING Theres 200000 Iraqi soldiers who should be protecting Baghdad right now 200000 Iraqi soldiers up against 30 or 35000 ISIS soldiers They need to step up too Peshmerga could get them from both sides Look again you guys get so ticked off at when I say I dont want to put American troops in harms way on the ground there GUILFOYLE No No but listen be fair because youve got  youve the Peshmerga Theyve basically got like switchblades Theyve got knives and youve got ISIS who has incredible weaponry against that It is not a fair fight BECKEL Baghdads  Baghdads army is the most sophisticated GUILFOYLE But guess what If its not getting it done but what do we say Oh I wish they were better fighters Were the ones that are going to BECKEL Two hundred thousand people who cant hold off ISIS GUILFOYLE Thats just like politically BECKEL Thats why we never should have been in this war in the first place GUTFELD That doesnt help now Bob The fact is  the fact that were doing this segment tells us that the presidents strategy is not clear that nobody knows whats going on I said it last week its airaoke which is airstrike karaoke Its symbolic its not substantive And you know weve seen where this goes If you dont play to win you lose GUILFOYLE But thats the point And Andrea so heres the deal When you do the airstrikes then everyone feels like clean safe buttoned up about it But if its not working were doing more harm than good I mean this is  this is ridiculous Weve got to do more airstrikes but also arm the right people with the right weapons Otherwise we cant complain about it if theyre shooting slingshots TANTAROS Yes You cant be halfhearted in war Thats the surest way that youre going to lose if youre halfhearted And we are being half hearted Now I do agree no American boots on the ground I dont think the president should have said it However but look whats happening Kobani in Syria is about to fall GUILFOYLE Right TANTAROS This is an issue for Syrian President Bashar alAssad and his army to deal with And the Turkish military But guess what The Turkish military doesnt want to do anything They want to plant their tanks along the border just in case ISIS flows into Turkey So I agree Look this is their fight Its terrible I hate to see anything happen to those civilians on the ground but its not our fight Two in Iraq it would be incredibly embarrassing  embarrassing for this administration to have the Baghdad airport fall And by the way a really bad idea to give the terrorists an air force GUILFOYLE Is Bob concerned that we could be giving them an airport I am concerned about it And my point is the reason why you have to understand from the you know strategic standpoint is the way youre able to target and make these airstrikes more thick and more deadly is by having information manpower on the ground to tell you specifically where theyre hiding You know bombing empty space is not going to help anything Youve got to hit the right targets BECKEL We dont know that We do have boots on the ground And the other thing is theyre not going to take the Baghdad Airport And the other thing that drives me crazy I know that Jonah Goldberg is in the family Were not supposed to dump on the family I wont dump on Greg because hes my friend But that  the idea of suggesting that this is some PR campaign that Goldberg said that the president of the United States would put people airport pilots in harms way for our election is disgraceful disgusting and uninformed and sophomoric GUILFOYLE I dont think he said that BECKEL Thats exactly what he said GUILFOYLE No he didnt But what are you yelling at me for BECKEL Im sorry I didnt mean to GUILFOYLE Because Ill meet you after the show TANTAROS The problem with the Kurds relying on those other boots is that the Kurds were going to help us last year but we drew that red line and we never enforced it They were waiting for the US to help just like theyre waiting now And we havent given them anything to help them be the boots on the ground So were failing on all levels BECKEL Yes but  we trained 200000 troops GUILFOYLE Theres more that we can do I think we can all agree at the table perhaps we differ on exactly what that should be fair enough BOLLING Fair enough GUILFOYLE Bobs friend ph All right You dont go away because Facebook Friday oh yes its going to get crazier Its next COMMERCIAL BREAK GUTFELD Its Facebook Friday Your

undergoing a rebirth in a state at the forefront of efforts to reclaim it as a mainstream crop Researchers and farmers are producing the first legal hemp crop in generations in Kentucky where hemp has turned into a political cause decades after it was banned by the federal government Republican US Sens Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul advocate for it as does state Agriculture Commissioner James Comer a Republican who is running for governor next year The comeback is strictly small scale Experimental hemp plots more closely resemble the size of large family gardens Statewide plantings totaled about 15 acres from the Appalachian foothills in eastern Kentucky to the broad stretches of farmland in the far west said Adam Watson the Kentucky Agriculture Departments hemp program coordinator The crops reintroduction was delayed in the spring when imported hemp seeds were detained by US customs officials The states Agriculture Department then sued the federal government and dropped the case Friday after reaching an agreement on importing the seeks into Kentucky The seeds were released after federal drug officials approved a permit Since then test plots have shown the crop to be hardy and fast growing   and a potential moneymaker with a remarkable range of traditional uses including clothing mulch hemp milk cooking oil soap and lotions What weve learned is it will grow well in Kentucky Comer said It yields a lot per acre All the things that we predicted At Murray State University about 180 miles southwest of Louisville plants have sprouted to at least eight feet tall turning a shade of green and yellow as they reached maturity Harvest is approaching Its had a good growth period said Murray State agriculture dean Tony L Brannon It appeared to tolerate the extremes in weather from extremely wet to extremely dry pretty well Hemps roots in Kentucky date back to pioneer days and the towering stalks were once a staple at many farms Weve got an excellent climate for it excellent soils for it Watson said Its a good fit for Kentucky producers The ultimate question is going to come down to economics Is there a market and can Kentucky capture that Growing hemp without a federal permit was banned in 1970 due to its classification as a controlled substance related to marijuana Hemp and marijuana are the same species Cannabis sativa but hemp has a negligible amount of THC the psychoactive compound that gives marijuana users a high Legal production of the crop has been gone for so long that it was a virtual blank slate in modern Kentucky agriculture Teams of researchers and farmers are studying which seed varieties and soil types are best suited and how much moisture or fertilizer are needed There are a lot of unknowns Watson said Its those sorts of answers that producers are going to need before they can turn it into an economically viable crop on their farms For now growing hemp is strictly limited The federal farm bill enacted this year restricts hemp production to research projects designated by agriculture departments in states that allow the crop to be grown But commercial uses are also emerging Fifteen states have removed barriers to hemp production according to Vote Hemp a group that advocates for the plants legal cultivation Licensed growers were able to secure seeds in three states    Kentucky Colorado and Vermont the group said but  difficulties in obtaining seeds limited production  According to Eric Steenstra president of Vote Hemp the biggest obstacle was gaining approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration to import hemp seeds for planting In Vermont about 12 farms registered to grow hemp said Alison Kosakowski a spokeswoman for the states Agency of Agriculture Food and Markets The agency doesnt know how many producers ended up planting a hemp crop The intentions were much bigger in Colorado There were 56 registrations for commercial hemp production and 76 more for research and development according to Ron Carleton the states deputy agriculture commissioner Unavailability of seed likely kept a fairly significant number of applicants from getting hemp in the ground he said Some farmers able to produce a crop this year may harvest the seeds to grow next years crop he said In Kentucky the crop is being studied by researchers at a halfdozen Kentucky universities Eastern Kentucky University researchers recently harvested their small hemp plot Those plants reached seven feet tall It seems to be fairly easy to grow said EKU agriculture professor Bruce Pratt The plants got established so quickly that they shaded out the weeds A 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service pegged hemp imports at 115 million in 2011 a tiny sum relative to other imported crops If widespread US production is someday allowed states able to attract processors close to where the crop is grown will be the winners said University of Kentucky agricultural economist Will Snell Its a small niche market but its

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/10/18/brazil-seeing-conservatives-gain-more-power-in-congress-amid-shaky-economy/,"RIO DE JANEIRO AP  With its Carnival reputation and skinbaring beach life Brazil may look like a liberal bastion But unease over a worsening economy and deteriorating public safety plus a backlash against recent gayrights gains are propelling a conservative rise that will shape the next administration regardless of who wins the presidency The general election held earlier this month saw a greater share of Brazils National Congress seats go to various conservative caucuses which now control nearly 60 percent of the 513 seats in the lower house They include evangelical lawmakers who oppose gay marriage or access to abortion the ruralistas whose proagriculture positions counter environmentalists and indigenous groups and a lawandorder faction that demands a crackdown on crime Ahead of the presidential runoff Oct 26 theres no doubt such conservatives are giving greater support to centerright challenger Acio Neves over leftleaning President Dilma Rousseff But its also clear that neither presidential candidate is as socially conservative as the increasingly powerful elements of Congress Brazil is one of the very few Latin American countries where the parliament is more important than the president in terms of overall power in the decisionmaking process said Thiago de Aragao a political analyst for the Brasiliabased Arko Advice consulting firm The parliament in an armwrestling contest against the presidency would win  because the parliaments main weapon is just crossing their arms and not voting on matters that are of strong interest to the government Despite its anythinggoes appearance Brazil is like many predominantly Roman Catholic nations in Latin America socially conservative In recent opinion polls for example more than 80 percent of Brazilians said they oppose loosening their restrictive abortion laws or legalizing marijuana and just over half oppose gay marriage However since Brazils return to democracy in 1985 the nations presidents and its judiciary have pushed through progressive projects either by decree or rulings  such as protecting huge swaths of jungle as indigenous reserves a highcourt ruling permitting samesex civil unions and the creation of Bolsa Familia a program that gives monthly cash payments to Brazils poorest families Some predict such changes could be rolled back by the growing conservative forces The evangelical caucus votes in lockstep on hotbutton social issues and is willing to block projects put forth by the presidency because its members know they represent a growing segment of the electorate While Catholics remain the majority in Brazil since 1970 their portion of the population has fallen from more than 90 percent to 65 percent while those identifying as Protestants have grown from 5 percent to 22 percent according to the Pew Research Center In Rousseffs first term the evangelical caucus blocked her effort to promote gaytolerance teaching in schools and managed to have their most outspoken antigay legislator Deputy Marco Feliciano named head of the bodys human rights commission  a move that provoked condemnation from Amnesty International and other activist groups In the Oct 5 election Feliciano was reelected to his So Paulo district with nearly double the votes he won four years ago The ruralista caucus also grew and now has about 200 members who support its agenda These lawmakers showed their strength in 2012 forcing weakening of environmental protection laws which critics say contributed to a 29 percent jump in the number of Amazon acres deforested over the last year And while the lawandorder block is small with only about 20 members it wields influence on security issues The caucus members defend tougher penal codes for young offenders and want to block the sort of drug liberalization seen in neighboring countries even as Brazil copes with overcrowded prisons and years of failed efforts to suppress powerful drug gangs But its the evangelical lawmakers who are at the heart of Brazils growing conservatism and theyve shown an ability to rally the other groups behind their main cause defeating any attempt to legalize gay marriage or advance protections for LGBT communities Toni Reis who heads the gay rights advocacy group Dignidade noted it took a landmark Supreme Court decision to legalize samesex civil unions in 2011 following years of congressional stalling on the matter Now he said gay rights groups are focused not on gay marriage but on advancing legislation to criminalize discrimination against gays Given the new legislative reality Reis acknowledged it will be an uphill battle Were going to have to work twice as hard he said Jean Wyllys Brazils first openly gay congressman said progressive lawmakers wont give up Theres no doubt its going to be more difficult said Wyllys who represents Rio de Janeiro state But I also have my allies  We are a political force capable of blocking their the evangelicals legislative projects But Brazils most influential evangelical pastor Silas Malafaia who campaigned for several Pentecostal politicians says the conservatives dont intend to impose stances out of step with the electorate I am against gay marriage Lets hold a referendum and let society decide Malafaia said in an interview If the people decide that they want abortions to be legalized I will always be against it but I will respect those decisions Were not evangelical extremists trying to impose what we think with an iron fist Follow us on twittercomfoxnewslatino

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/07/29/bill-oreilly-great-marijuana-ruse/, By Bill OReilly Over the weekend the New York Times called for the USA to legalize marijuana all over the place No surprise that papers far left on its editorial page so its stance is predictable     But the real reason  the real reason many liberals want to legalize pot is not to put another intoxicant in the marketplace although they generally dont object to that The real reason the unspoken marijuana play is contained in The Times editorial quote The social costs of marijuana laws are vast the result is racist falling disproportionately on young black men ruining their lives and creating new generations of career criminals unquote There you have it The left believes American law enforcement targets AfricanAmericans for drug prosecutions Therefore they want drug sales to be categorized as nonviolent offenses and marijuana to be legalized Its about race not drugs Now some facts According to the US Sentencing Commission about 5000 criminals were sentenced for marijuana offenses in 2013 at the federal level almost 98 percent of them for sale Average prison time 41 months and here is the kicker 63 percent of those convicted on the federal level were Hispanic Just 11 percent black The legalization of marijuana still full of unintended consequence sends a signal to children that drug use is an acceptable part of life Thats big The Times says marijuana is not a gate way drug That it does not lead to other drug use that is false According to a recent study by the Yale School of Medicine adolescents who use pot or alcohol are three times more likely to abuse hard drugs than children who do not use intoxicants As for the poor precincts in America does it make any sense at all to make intoxicants more available in those places Drug use and sales have devastated poor neighborhoods in this country Lets take New York City for example In 1990 there were 2245 homicides in this town  an average of six per day In 2013 there were 335 homicides So what happened Under Mayor Rudy Giuliani the New York City Police cracked down on open drug use and sales And those convicted of selling drugs were given much harsher sentences by the state of New York No one disputes the murder rate was driven by the drug trade as gangs shouted out all over the city But now the left wants to go soft on drug use and criminal sentencing Apparently the New York Times and others want to go back to the good old days where there were six murders daily in the nations largest city Thats just insane Drug use is a public menace It helps no one Same thing with alcoholism Same thing with smoking tobacco But you dont add to those problems by legalizing pot Thats stupid What the authorities should do is decriminalize pot use You want to do it in your house Not bother anyone Fine Go outside with a joint or a pipe you pay a fine A hefty one if Im running the show But sell marijuana You go to jail America used to have standards of behavior in public But today theyre collapsing all around us And thats The Memo OReilly Factor hosted by Bill OReilly airs on Weekdays at 8PM ET on Fox News Channel,2014-07-28T00:00-04:00,drugs

raised joints pipes and vaporizer devices to the sky Sunday at a central Denver park in a defiant toast to the April 20 pot holiday a onceunderground celebration that stepped into the mainstream in the first state in the nation to legalize recreational marijuana The 420 pm smokeout in the shadow of the Colorado capitol was the capstone of an Easter weekend dedicated to cannabis in states across the country Although it is still against the law to publicly smoke marijuana in Colorado police only reported 63 citations or arrests on Sunday 47 for marijuana consumption     It feels good not to be persecuted anymore said Joe Garramone exultantly smoking a joint while his 3yearold daughter played on a vast lawn crowded with fellow smokers The Garramone family came from Hawaii among the tens of thousands who crowded into various cannabisthemed extravaganzas from a marijuana industry expo called the Cannabis Cup at a trade center north of downtown to 420themed concerts at the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater Acts included Slightly Stoopid and Snoop Dogg At 420 pm an enormous plume of marijuana smoke wafted into the sky above downtown Denver as rapper BoB belted out his song Strange Clouds with the hook And all we do is light it up all nightAll you see is strange cloudsStrange clouds strange clouds The Civic Center Park event is the most visible sign of the pot holidays transformation It started as a defiant gathering of marijuana activists but this year the event has an official city permit is organized by an events management company and featured booths selling funnel cakes and Greek food next to kiosks hawking hemp lollipops and glass pipes Gavin Beldt one of the organizers said in a statement that the event is now a celebration of legal status for its use in Colorado and our launch of an exciting new experience for those attending Denver is just one of many cities across the country where 420 marijuana celebrations were planned Sunday In Trenton NJ speakers urged a crowd of about 150 gathered at the statehouse to push state and federal lawmakers to legalize or decriminalize marijuana and called on Gov Chris Christie to do what he can to help medical marijuana patients Among those at the rally was Jawara McIntosh the youngest son of noted reggae musician and promarijuana activist Peter Tosh In San Francisco thousands of revelers gathered at Golden Gate Parks Hippie Hill which has become the goto spot for the unsanctioned festival every year City officials said they would be cracking down on illegal parking camping drug sales underage drinking and open alcohol containers Hippie Hill was covered in canopies as dozens of people sold potlaced cookies brownies and other items Some vendors told the San Francisco Chronicle that sales were slow because so many people were peddling the treats Officer Danielle Newman said at least eight people face possible felony charges but she didnt elaborate on the reasons for their arrests In Washington thousands celebrated in the only other state to legalize marijuana Events included an event sponsored by Seattles Dope Magazine with a 99 judges pass available that included 10 marijuana

how to increase safety regulations Marijuana festivities got off to a slow start on Easter Sunday But as the clock counted down to 420 and crowds surged into Civic Center Park festivalgoers noted the big changes from previous years  more merchandise and more police Last years rally was cut short by a shooting that wounded three All attendees this year had to pass through security screening and a heavy police presence ringed the park I still feel a little like a teenager Garramone said as he eyed police patrolling the park Just as striking was the proliferation of merchandise from cannabisrelated gear and Tshirts to 9 roast turkey legs and 4 water bottles I can just imagine how much money is being made right now said Tina Crockett 34 of Wichita The commercialism disappointed Bob Glisson 27 who was attending his fourth 420 celebration in the park Its all about the money now the Denver resident complained Still the scene was wonderfully surreal for Bud Long 49 from Kalamazoo Mich who recalled taking part in his first 420 protest in 1984 Nationwide itll be decriminalized he predicted on Saturday the first day of the twoday festival and well be doing this in every

If one race reveals the depth of the divisions between Democrats this cycle it is in Kentucky where the partys Senate nominee still refuses to say whether she voted in 2012 for President Obama whom she endorsed and served as a convention delegate But on Monday Alison Lundergan Grimes took the next step forward into the chasm when a debate moderator asked her the difference between her a selfstyled Clinton Democrat and an Obama Democrat Grimes was quick to respond Its growing the middle class in the right way Whoa And this is a woman who is hosting Obamas longtime intraparty rival Hillary Clinton at a rally on Wednesday  an appearance that was announced the same day last week that the story of Grimes Obama denials blew up It is no wonder that liberal outlets are among the most exercised about Grimes treatment of the president As a segment on Rachel Maddows MSNBC televisions show Monday said Democrats at a crossroads
