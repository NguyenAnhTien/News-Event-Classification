CNN,topstories, CNN  If past votes are any guide turnout in this years midterm elections could be about 40 of the voting age population Australia and some other democracies take steps to require citizens to vote CNN Opinion invited several political experts to discuss whether the United States would be better off if it had mandatory voting The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors  William Galston James Madison would be smiling  Lets imagine a future in which Americans must vote or face a penalty Its April 2021 Media outlets around the country headlined major agreements between Democrats and Republicans on the longstalled issues of tax and immigration reform Commentators marveled at the momentous shift in American politics away from the polarization and gridlock of the previous two decades What happened Although opinions differed observers agreed on one key point The decision to follow the lead of countries such as Australia and institute mandatory voting in national elections transformed the political landscape As turnout rose from 60 to 90 citizens with less intense partisan and ideological commitments flooded into the electorate Campaigns could no longer prevail simply by mobilizing core supporters Instead they had to persuade swing voters to come their way They soon discovered that these new voters preferred compromise to confrontation and civil discourse to scorchedearth rhetoric Candidates who presented themselves as willing to reach across the aisle to get things done got a boost while zealots went down to defeat Both political parties soon realized that they had a stake in a nominating process that produced the kinds of candidates the expanded electorate preferred They eliminated party caucuses dominated by intense minorities and opened up their primaries to independents They discovered that maximizing participation in their primaries was the best way of preparing for the general election Individual donors who wanted to invest in winners favored candidates who could command broad support Once in office members of the House and Senate tried hard to keep faith with the expanded electorate that had sent them to Washington They spent less time in party caucuses and more doing serious legislative work Congressional leaders returned power to the committees where members relearned the art of compromise across party lines And somewhere James Madison was smiling Reforming institutions to change incentives is always the most effective course and once again it had worked William Galston is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and holds the Ezra K Zilkha Chair in its governance studies program  Gretchen Helmke and Bonnie Meguid Motive is not what you think  With roughly 40 of eligible citizens voting turnout in US midterm elections is notoriously low Compulsory voting offers one possible if radical solution Like any political institution laws on it have multiple if disputed consequences Today compulsory voting exists in roughly a quarter of all democracies in the world ranging from Western Europe and Australia to Latin America and Asia Yet few believe that it stands any chance of being adopted in the United States Why Our research suggests that the decision to adopt compulsory voting is largely strategic While proponents often couch their arguments in terms of public benefits it appears that parties around the world have been more likely to adopt it when such laws stand to favor their candidates and hurt their opponents Changing the electoral rules is not a riskfree proposition however Governing parties are unlikely to modify the rules that elected them Only governing parties with relatively undermobilized electorates and a growing opposition find compulsory voting an attractive option Interestingly conservatives in the late 19th and early 20th century in Western Europe and Latin America were the first to champion compulsory voting Expansion of suffrage dramatically shifted the composition of the voting population while industrialization swelled the ranks of the working class and created new political identities During this period the lefts organizational ability to mobilize voters was unmatched Parties on the right countered with mandatory voting which aimed to bring out their natural constituencies Today the situation in the United States is just the opposite With unions in decline Democrats are disproportionately hurt by abstention A recent George Washington University poll shows that in the coming election Republicans are fully 7 percentage points more likely to vote than Democrats In other words the politicians that will likely determine the rules of the game have no incentive to change them Gretchen Helmke is associate professor and chairwoman of the political science department at the University of Rochester Bonnie Meguid is associate professor in the same department  Haydon Manning In Australia politics as usual continue   Technically speaking Australian citizens are not compelled to vote Instead they are required to attend a polling station and upon receipt of their ballot decide to vote or discard it Granted the failure to attend to ones democratic duty may incur a small fine if insufficient excuse is offered This approach goes back decades having been adopted in 1924 for national elections But the idea itself is even older having been debated in 19th century colonial parliaments While views vary as to the ultimate cause of its introduction there is no doubt that concerns over low voter turnout in a nation only two decades old drove the decision Shepherding people to vote in this way might seem odd to some but government loomed large in colonial Australia  in sharp contrast to the American experience This tradition of state paternalism did not wane when the Federation of Australia was formed in 1901 ie when the six separate colonies became one nation So it was not surprising that the decision to compel voters to attend to duty was ultimately a bipartisan decision How successful has this approach been In recent decades about 5 of voters are typically asked to explain their absence on polling day Surveys consistently indicate that about 70 say they favor compulsory voting and 80 say they would still vote even if voting was not compulsory A decade ago the conservative coalition government of John Howard controlled both houses of parliament and its Senate leader proposed abolishing compulsory voting In the end old habits die hard and the proposal failed to gain traction Political parties here may have good reasons to keep the current system After all mandatory voting makes it easier for politicians to keep the focus on attacking opponents without being distracted by the task of encouraging a sometimes disillusioned party base to turn out Ive been a supporter of compulsion But in the contemporary campaign setting I doubt its virtues Turning the vote out might not be a problem but wooing disengaged citizens now requires banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising To me this can diminish the democratic experience for those who take the time to think through the issues Haydon Manning is an associate professor at Flinders Universitys School of Social and Policy Studies in Adelaide South Australia  Ari Ratner Illsuited for America now   Should voting be compulsory No Should voting be far easier Absolutely The arguments for compulsory voting seem persuasive At least 38 countries have or have had some form of mandatory voting laws US turnout in contrast falls short of most advanced democracies Low turnout imposes real costs on our political system It both reflects and helps drive an eroding sense of democratic legitimacy It negatively impacts the representation of groups with low turnout levels like younger voters and minorities And it magnifies the power of special interests Yet mandatory voting is illsuited to Americas current realities First its impractical Congress is currently incapable of passing a mandatory voting law The federal bureaucracy and court system moreover are unlikely to be able to enforce any such law Would we impose sanctions on those who fail to vote Would there be an exemption system Is the voting system even equipped to handle a rush of new voters Remember the long lines of 2012 and the butterfly ballots of 2000 Mandatory voting would be a bureaucratic and legal nightmare Not to mention that refusing to vote itself can be an important form of protest Far more important than the red herring on mandatory voting would be to make it far easier to register and cast a ballot Options available to facilitate voting include making election day a national holiday or a weekend expanding early voting and sameday voter registration both of which Republicans have cut back in many states creating an optout rather than an optin voter registration system and increasing opportunities for remote voting via absentee ballots votebymail or online voting Voting rights remains an important issue especially given the rising cacophony about largely nonexistent voter fraud One recent investigation found 31 credible incidents of voter impersonation in 1 billion ballots But the way to increase voter participation isnt to mandate it Its to build a system capable of accommodating our citizens voting needs Ari Ratner is a fellow at New America Foundation You can follow him on Twitter amratner Donna Brazile You have to pay taxes so why not have to vote   Mandatory voting requires citizens to present themselves at the polling place and either cast their votes on the candidates and issues or spoil a ballot indicating their disgust with the entire lot Ive come to favor mandatory voting It will sink the role of big money in our elections Campaign spending is becoming a scourge and a scandal in our selfgovernment Millions are even spent for the antidemocratic purpose of reducing voter turnout for the opposition All that money from secret contributors  guaranteeing greater influence for those who have money over those who do not  cannot possibly have a healthy effect on the candidates on whom it pours Are things better since the Supreme Court allowed big money to be introduced In the United States voter turnout for midterm elections has been under 50 since the 1940s This means that less than half of the American electorate gets to decide which party will control Congress This cant be a good thing In places that have mandatory voting like Australia there are indications of less polarization and dissatisfaction in the electorate I know some bristle at the idea of having to cast a vote even a protest vote for Lassie Yet voting is the essential central and indispensable feature of democracy We require jury attendance paying taxes and public education attendance because those are also essential functions Is voting less important

CNN,topstories, Editors note Ronald M Green is a professor for the study of ethics and human values at Dartmouth College The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author CNN  I strongly support Brittany Maynards impassioned efforts to expand everyones access to physicianassisted suicide It is tragic that she died so young but her life has made an important contribution to us all I am an adamant opponent of physicians ever becoming agents of death The lessons of the Holocaust which began with a euthanasia program are that once medical professionals become accustomed to administering death we have created a frightening corps of people whose very medical prestige facilitates mass killing of the vulnerable Hence I oppose physician involvement in capital punishment via lethal injection and all forms of euthanasia in which physicians are actively involved But physicians are not actively involved in physicianassisted suicide In jurisdictions where physicianassisted suicide is permitted and where proper safeguards are in place to prevent depressed or otherwise ineligible people from access to lethal drugs physicians play a standard medical role of ascertaining applicants eligibility for the appropriate medications Then the physicians get out of the way  It may seem strange to say this but the reason that you and I as free individuals cannot access lifeending drugs is because governments have imposed rules that require prescription approval by physicians for such drugs Hence it is governments and doctors acting on their behalf who normally  and wisely  block our access to dangerous medications Maynards mourners grieve on social media Where physicianassisted suicide is allowed physicians withdraw from this role  they stop blocking our free access to the drugs we need to end our life They are not administering death by writing a prescription Just the opposite they get out of our way as free people and allow us to do what we want to do Physicians cease their active blocking role and literally do nothing We are the ones who act to end our lives I feel this is appropriate In addition I believe that people who are facing the end of life  terminally ill patients such as Maynard  and those suffering grievous and irreversible pain should be free to end their life This is a simple expression of respect for human freedom autonomy and dignity and it is also an expression of compassion to allow them to do it Experience with physicianassisted suicide has shown that many people who go through the process of applying for it do not finally avail themselves of the right to do so This tells us that physicianassisted suicide plays an important role in providing comfort and assurance that one will not be forced to suffer beyond what one can bear There are many who on religious or other grounds oppose suicide in any form I respect their beliefs and I would defend their right to refuse to end their lives by their own hand But mutual respect here also requires that we allow others who believe differently to end their lives in the way they see fit as Brittany Maynard has now courageously done Read CNNOpinions new Flipboard magazine Follow us on Twitter CNNOpinion Join us on FacebookcomCNNOpinion ,0.4
CNN,topstories, Editors note Jeff Yang is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal Online and can be heard frequently on radio as a contributor to shows such as PRIs The Takeaway and WNYCs The Brian Lehrer Show He is the author of I Am Jackie Chan My Life in Action and editor of the graphic novel anthologies Secret Identities and Shattered The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author CNN  Millennials that burgeoning category of young people who currently clock in between the ages of 17 and 35 are probably the most overanalyzed and overhyped generation in American history I write this from the eyerolling vantage point of a gen Xer  a member of a generation that tends to get ignored Even so Ill begrudgingly admit that theres steak behind the sizzle With a headcount of 78 million theyre the biggest cohort in our nations history and collectively have the latent spending power and political clout to radically transform America But great potential invites great skepticism Thats why millennial naysaying is so popular in the media with pundits regularly chiming in on their sense of entitlement their propensity toward selfindulgence their lack of direction and their resistance to rules and authority One of the most common refrains is that millennials dont spend The Atlantic even wryly dubbed them The Cheapest Generation which Im sure would come as a huge shock to the 70 and 80somethings who grew up during the Great Depression and came of age during World War II Of course in our consumptiondriven culture failing to buy enough stuff is tantamount to being unAmerican Remember in the days after 911 what thenPresident George W Bush advised the grieving nation to do Participate in the economy Materialism is patriotism So what use is this giant population of young people if they dont consume As the Atlantics Derek Thompson and Jordan Weissmann noted millennials dont buy cars and they dont buy houses and that they suggested could be an omen of looming fiscal catastrophe The largest generation in American history might never spend as lavishly as its parents did  nor on the same things they wrote Since the end of World War II new cars and suburban houses have powered the worlds largest economy and propelled our most impressive recoveries Millennials may have lost interest in both But is the lack of desire to have two of the three things that require large outofpocket expenses and then encumber you with longterm debt  the third being children  really equivalent to being cheap To get to the heart of this question are the deeppocketed millennials of marketers dreams in truth the stingy millennials of marketers nightmares An analysis of data that focuses specifically on millennial values and attitudes suggests that the cheap millennial premise is fundamentally flawed  and quite possibly entirely false For one as Thompson and Weissmann acknowledged a big reason why millennials spend less is because they earn less being both younger and more likely to be unemployed due to the Great Recession Furthermore as the economy has recovered millennials are beginning to open up their wallets according to the report TRU Youth MONITOR Consumers and Commerce published by the Futures Company Full disclosure I am a consultant for the company Nearly twothirds of millennials say theyre more open to spending money now than they have been in the past few years versus less than half the population as a whole And millennials like generations of young Americans before them say they use shopping as therapy with almost threequarters agreeing that Buying myself something new helps me feel better if I am feeling down or unhappy versus 59 of the general population Finally over half of millennials say that if they really want something price is no object  versus just 40 of Americans overall But what they really want isnt cars or homes Millennials are spending and spending plenty when it comes to the things theyre passionate about Its just that these often arent things at least not in the way we think about things Millennials are much more likely to spend money on things they can share with friends whether its a nice dinner out a weekend road trip or a oneofakind experience says my colleague Christian Ruzich millennial consumer expert and vice president of consulting at the Futures Company In short millennials spend on creating lasting memories rather than owning big expensive objects that end up being anchors  or albatrosses So what are they dishing out the dollars for Lets call them the three Ts 1 Travel  Millennials travel for pleasure more than any other group  taking on average nine leisure trips a year  and are more likely to have specific experiential goals such as visiting every continent Theyre keenly focused on unique encounters and cultural immersions and seek to collect truly transformative moments rather than just resortbased fun David Chapman director general of the World Youth Student and Educational Travel Confederation notes that research shows the nature of youth travel has changed enormously over the past decade Young travelers today want more than ever to enrich themselves with cultural experiences to meet local people and to improve their outlook for when they return home 2 Technology  Millennials may be cutting back on living room media  they make up 44 of households that dont own televisions  but theyre redeploying that spending on mobile devices and the services apps and platforms that power them Fortyseven percent of teens and 45 of twentysomethings say it is important to them to have the latest features or styles in smartphones just 39 of teens and 32 of twentysomethings say the same for clothes About a third of millennials say that if they like expensive brands of smartphones the best then thats what they usually buy They dont see the smartphone just as a gadget  for them its the primary means by which they connect with friends family and the outside world making it a vital gatekeeper of their private information and personal relationships 3 Training  Millennials are spending more on education than any prior generation to date Of course a good percentage of this goes toward paying down loans on schooling theyve already obtained The average millennial graduates with a 30000 student loan burden But even being in debt doesnt stop them from investing in advanced degrees not to mention supplemental certification and enrichment courses The thing is while theyre in school they arent earning money theyre less likely to need to purchase a house of their own and theyre more likely to live lifestyles where transportation means riding a bus or a bike Thats a big factor in millennial cheapness regarding home and auto purchase right there But the education that this generation is getting is likely to result in bigger salaries down the road the socalled college premium So a great deal of millennial spending is likely not being suppressed only delayed Which means that the naysayers who continue to warn that millennial antimaterialism will bring down the republic can rest easy Americans arent done living beyond their means just yet After all where would the red white and blue be without a healthy amount of red ink Read CNNOpinions new Flipboard magazine Follow us on Twitter CNNOpinion Join us

CNN,topstories, Editors note David Gergen is a senior political analyst for CNN and has been an adviser to four presidents A graduate of Harvard Law School he is a professor of public service and director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard Universitys Kennedy School of Government Follow him on Twitter at david_gergen The opinions expressed in this commentary are his CNN  If Republicans regain control of the Senate on Tuesday night they will have good reason to gloat They recruited much stronger more sensible nominees this year  no more candidates riding broomsticks or hurling insults at women They also smartly accepted President Barack Obamas implicit challenge to make his record their centerpiece But when they wake up from their celebrations top GOP strategists such as Karl Rove will surely warn them Dont overread this election Yes it opens up great opportunities for the next two years but it does not open a clear path to seizing the White House and Congress in 2016 Beware the blue wall  Nobody has talked much about the blue wall in this years election cycle No reason to Looking ahead however it looms increasingly as one of the most important features of Americas new political terrain It is certainly a huge boulder standing in the way of a full Republican resurgence in 2016 and giving protection to Democrats The blue wall is a powerful phalanx of 18 states and the District of Columbia that have voted for the Democrats in every single presidential election for 20 years  six straight Some states have been in the Democratic column even longer Its not just the number of blue states but how huge an advantage they provide for the Democratic presidential nominee Altogether these 18 states plus the District of Columbia account for 242 electoral votes  just 28 shy of the 270 magic total required to win the White House If the wall holds firm the Democratic nominee only has to win a handful of purple states to go over the top Floridas 29 electoral votes alone would seal the election The Republicans have their own red wall and it actually includes more states 21 plus a major chunk of Nebraska They are the GOP bulwark voting consistently for the Republican presidential nominee in each of the past four presidential elections But they tend to have much smaller populations than the Democratic states so that they account for only 179 electoral votes  91 shy of 270 leaving a huge hill to climb John McCain  a valiant candidate in 2008  won the red wall but nothing else The blue wall states dominate New England every state but New Hampshire the midAtlantic the upper Midwest and the far West California Oregon and Washington By contrast the red wall runs through the South and up into the Plains and mountain areas In this midterm cycle the blue wall has proved so durable that no one has paid it much attention Ten Senate seats are at stake in this blue territory and Democrats look safe in nine of them the one Republican who will win is Susan Collins of Maine popular in part because she works across the aisle By contrast all of the 13 Senate races that are in play this year are outside the blue wall  some in purple others in red states Mitt Romney won 10 of them and Obamas approval ratings are in the low 40s or below in every one of them In other words this election has been extremely important for Republicans in the short term  and for governing over the next two years  but in significant ways it is also an anomaly a year when red and purple state Democrats who rode into office in 2008 on the coattails of a fresh popular Obama became highly vulnerable for reelection when his coattails frayed In 2016 the tables will turn It is the GOP that will have the more vulnerable Senate candidates in blue and purple states If the Democrats field a strong presidential candidate they could well retain the White House and win a majority in the Senate too Then there are the demographic differences between a midterm and presidential electorate This years voters will be older and whiter than in 2016 favoring the GOP in an era when partisan voting trends are more divided by age and race than ever In 2016 the pendulum swings back to the Democrats when their base  younger more racially diverse  flocks to the polls Note Republicans will continue to have a builtin advantage in House races until at least the next census in 2020 when new district lines will be drawn None of this is written in stone of course parties can redefine their futures if they come up with good ideas and good candidates In Massachusetts the bluest of the blue the Republicans this year are likely to seize the governors office from Democrats because they have nominated a smart winsome candidate Charlie Baker seen as better in creating jobs and economic growth Republicans looking to 2016 can also take heart because voters often sour on parties that have had the same president in the White House for two terms Indeed a party keeping the White House after a twoterm presidency has occurred only twice in the past century  with Franklin D Roosevelt and after Reagan So it is possible that these 2014 midterms will be a turning point for Republicans opening a way back to control of both White House and Congress in 2016 But to use a George W Bushism They shouldnt misunderestimate how tough it will be As they say Beware the blue wall   Read CNNOpinions new Flipboard magazine Follow us on Twitter CNNOpinion Join us on FacebookcomCNNOpinion ,0.4

CNN,topstories, Washington CNN  Now at last America gets to decide Millions of people are casting votes nationwide in an election that could hand Republicans the Senate after a nasty negative campaign that cost nearly 4 billion Voters are encountering some problems as they head to the polls In Georgia home to a competitive Senate and governors race a state website that provides poll location information was down Connecticut Gov Dan Malloy is seeking to extend voting hours after problems were reported at Hartford polling stations READ A viewers guide to the election Meanwhile a winter storm in Maine prompted a state of emergency and left 85000 customers without power on Tuesday morning Heavy rain is expected in Texas Oklahoma and Arkansas where Democratic Sen Mark Pryor is in a tough battle for reelection Republicans need a net gain of six seats to claim the Senate and polls consistently suggest momentum is moving in their favor A GOP win would give the party full control of Congress for the first time since George W Bush was in the White House Republican dominance on Capitol Hill could quickly transform President Barack Obama into a lame duck constantly at war with Congress on everything from health care to energy and spending And it would set the tone for the 2016 presidential election by pitting the competing priorities of both parties against each other What we are seeing around the country from one coast to another is a lot of Republican momentum a lot of desire for change in Washington Republican National Committee Communications Director Sean Spicer told CNNs New Day on Tuesday Spicers Democratic counterpart Mo Elleithee took comfort in the fact that many Senate races despite being in traditional Republican territory are still up for grabs A couple of months ago people thought Republicans were going to run away with this thing in these states but we are finding them too close to call he said Republicans sought to turn the election in which they are also expected to fatten their majority in the House of Representatives into a referendum on Obamas unpopularity amid criticism of his handling of crises over Ebola ISIS and the sluggish economic recovery Democrats hammered Republican candidates on local issues and their record on womens health and workplace equality while branding their foes as oblivious to the struggles of the middle class All eyes this evening will be on seats currently held by Democrats that Republicans need to capture to flip the Senate including in Iowa New Hampshire North Carolina Arkansas Colorado and Alaska READ Second guessing the avoidObama strategy There could be many tensionpacked hours before the fate of the Senate is decided In Alaska for example where Democratic Sen Mark Begich is in a tight race polls will not close until 1 AM on the east coast Runoff elections meanwhile will be needed in Georgia and Louisiana if no candidate gets to the 50 threshold That means that if things remain tight the fate of the Senate could be in limbo for weeks Final polls in the decisive states showed Republican Joni Ernst in a dead heat in Iowa with Democrat Bruce Braley  although one Des Moines Register survey over the weekend electrified Republicans by putting her up seven points In Colorado which Obama also won twice Democratic incumbent Sen Mark Udall is behind after apparently failing to define his GOP opponent Cory Gardner as an enemy of young women In New Hampshire Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen is in a dead heat with Republican challenger Scott Brown and Pryor will lose his Arkansas seat if the polls prove accurate READ How presidential contenders are spending Election Night In Kentucky Mitch McConnell expects to wake up on Wednesday morning as the next leader of the US Senate after a scorched earth reelection race against Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes But Democrats hope to turn the tables on Republicans in Georgia where Michelle Nunn mounted a strong campaign for a Senate seat that has been in GOP hands since 2002 Still she hasnt cleared the 50 threshold in polls that would be needed to avoid a runoff Sen Kay Hagan of North Carolina may also be in position to defy her Republican foe after a nail biter of a campaign Republicans are also sweating the race in Kansas where a stumbling reelection bid by Sen Pat Roberts risks being overtaken by independent Greg Orman Orman hasnt said which party he would caucus with in Washington and his win could set the GOP back in its bid to win a majority I am not going there to represent the Democratic Party or represent the Republican Party he told CNN Tuesday I am going there to represent Kansas Senate races in West Virginia Montana and South Dakota meanwhile are considered Republican locks Even if Republicans win Senate control they will fall short of the 60 vote supermajority needed to overcome likely Democratic obstruction tactics But there could be a small window for possible compromise on issues like trade deals and tax reform before the presidential campaign shakes up the political environment Some fascinating gubernatorial races will also be decided Tuesday including in Florida where former Republican Gov Charlie Crist is running as a Democrat against Gov Rick Scott In Kansas Gov Sam Brownback is in danger of losing amid a backlash against his hard core conservatism Liberal Massachusetts could elect a Republican governor and Ohios John Kasich is expected to be reelected ahead of a potential presidential bid READ Dems put up brave face The 2016 race effectively gets under way on Wednesday morning and potential candidates mounted marathon midterm campaign swings to road test their messages New Jersey Republican Gov Chris Christie proved his political stamina during the election season while Jeb Bush eased himself back into the spotlight and Rand Paul was everywhere Wisconsins Republican governor Scott Walker must endure a nerve jangling reelection bid before he can dream of the White House For Democrats Bill and Hillary Clinton threw themselves into the midterm races ahead of her likely 2016 campaign But one man was largely absent from the fray  the president himself Obama will watch results tonight from the White House and a Republican triumph would inevitably be seen as a repudiation of his presidency and pose tough questions for his administration The elections are contesting a third of the seats in the 100 member Senate all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and there are also 36 gubernatorial races on the ballot READ 7 things that will almost definitely happen on Election Night ,0.4
CNN,topstories, Washington CNN  Happy Election Day America Things have changed since the last time everyone went to the polls Then Barack Obama was reelected to a second fouryear term Now hes been largely benched by his party spending less time on the campaign trail than his much more popular wife first lady Michelle Obama former president Bill Clinton and potential future presidential candidate Hillary Clinton Midterm elections are more local affairs and the issues vary from contest to contest But midterms have national consequences and what happens Tuesday will help determine what President Obama can get done in his final two years in office It will tee up the coming 2016 presidential contest and give Americans the chance to try on a more powerful GOP as they start to think about who should be the next president But first comes Tuesday and here is whats going to happen 1  There will be a surprise  Something were listing below wont end up happening This is an election and it isnt over yet Voters are fickle and polls arent perfect and predictions are even less so So tune in to CNN Politics all day and night Tuesday We will be here and it will be exciting Related Sound like a political junkie with these 2014 midterm facts 2 Most Americans wont take part  Really it will be exciting on Tuesday But most Americans wont have taken part in the election Somewhere between 55 and 65 of eligible Americans vote in a presidential election about 130 million people in 2012 Far fewer  between 39 and 42 of Americans take part in a midterm election about 90 million in 2010 A recent focus group of moms conducted by a group affiliated with Walmart suggested they would bone up for their votes by Googling candidates the night before Voter excitement is actually down from 2010 the last midterm election according to the most recent CNN  ORC Poll That poll also suggested voters are angry at their political process and at Washington DC either because they see their votes as not accomplishing change or they see the current logjam in Washington as intractable Either way less than half the eligible population is likely to show up and let their voices be heard in this election Related Key 2014 races 3  Democrats will lose the Senate  Okay this one is not a sure thing And Vice President Biden at least is still saying Democrats will keep their majority in the Senate on Tuesday But all indications are that the GOP will gain seats and most likely enough for a slim Senate majority Republicans need to gain six seats to win the majority in the Senate There are three seats that were long held by retiring or already retired Democrats in which a Republican is now heavily favored  South Dakota West Virginia and Montana Among the rest of the races that CNN considers to be tossup or leaning toward the GOP 7 of them are held by Democrats Just three are held by Republicans Republicans have eaten away at Democrats majority in each election since Democrats had a filibuster proof majority when President Obama was first elected in 2008 Related Pivit  95 percent chance Republicans take Senate control Related Senate math seems impossible to some Democrats 4  Republicans will elect an AfricanAmerican senator in the South  Tim Scott is already a senator He was appointed after Sen Jim DeMint retired from office to lead a GOP think tank So it will be overlooked as an historical moment Tuesday night but when he wins the race  he is heavily favored  Scott will become the first African American elected by popular vote as a senator from the South and only the fifth African American elected to the Senate ever Scotts election while historic is not expected to change the fact that minorities generally support Democrats although Republicans to great fanfare have made public efforts to rebrand themselves and draw in more support with new demographics Look to some of the younger leading GOP voices  Sens Rand Paul and Marco Rubio both leap to mind  to carry this effort forward 5  There will be a runoff  Two states with tight Senate races create the possibility for runoff contests In both states if no candidate gets more than 50 of the vote the top two candidates head to a runoff In both states there are three or more candidates and in neither state is any candidate getting more than 50 in recent polling In Louisiana the runoff would take place Dec 6th In Georgia the runoff would take place Jan 6th Both races are extremely tight and with a slim Senate majority in the balance it is possible to not know who controls the Senate for two months But it bears mentioning the conventional wisdom that Republicans could do better in a twoperson race on a nontraditional election day in those two Southern states In 2008 for instance Sen Saxby Chambliss got just shy of 50 on Election Day In the December runoff he got more than 57 Related Louisiana cooks up spicy Senate race  with a side of alligator Related Georgia Senate race a dead heat 6  Not too much will change  Yes there might be a new Senate majority Yes Republicans will likely control both houses on Capitol Hill They will control the schedule of the Senate floor and theyll control what hearings will be held in both the House and the Senate It will be even more difficult for President Obama to get a potential Supreme Court nominee a confirmation vote if a vacancy should arise But Democrats will still have well more than the 40 votes theyll need to block just about any legislation they want If what angers you about Washington  remember voters are angry  is that nothing seems to get done this election isnt likely to make you very happy Related The why bother election Related Ted Cruz poised to make life miserable for Mitch McConnell Related Mr President meet Mitch McConnell 7  It will be a nail biter for incumbent governors  There hasnt been a Democratic governor in Florida since 1999 So this year Democrats ran a former Republican The main storyline for Election Night has and will be control of the Senate but there are a host of interesting governors races and voters could send a strong message to incumbents and incumbent parties Perhaps the closest and most interesting race of any kind is the Florida governors race where RepublicanturnedIndependentturnedDemocrat Charlie Crist is in the hunt to get his old job back with a new party There are potential upsets brimming elsewhere Republican Gov Scott Walker is neck and neck to to keep his job in Wisconsin So is Democrat John Hickenlooper in Colorado and Republican Nathan Deal in Georgia Polling is very dismal for Republican Gov Tom Corbett in Pennsylvania and Paul LePage in Maine It wouldnt be a total shock to see Republican governors in blue states like Maryland and Massachusetts and Democratic governors in red states like Kansas and Georgia Related Florida debate turns bitter over executions ,0.4

CNN,topstories, CNN  An iron gate with the notorious Nazi slogan Arbeit Macht Frei has been stolen from the former Dachau concentration camp in Germany officials said The slogan which translates as Work sets you free became emblematic of the forced labor camps of World War II in which so many inmates died The gate was stolen overnight from Saturday to Sunday officials at the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial said in an online statement While this is the first such theft at Dachau its not the first time that the slogan has been targeted by thieves The famous Arbeit Macht Frei sign at the AuschwitzBirkenau concentration camp in Poland was stolen in 2009 It was discovered shortly afterward cut into three pieces The Dachau centers director Dr Gabriele Hammermann described this weekends theft as a deliberate reprehensible attempt to deny and obliterate the memory of the crimes committed in this place The gate is of highly symbolic importance he said and its removal is an attempt to demolish the memorial at its very core Hammermann said it was no coincidence that the theft occurred at a time when the number of survivors of the camps was dwindling due to their age  and stressed that efforts to protect such historic sites and educate the public must continue especially in the face of farright radicalization Its not yet known who was behind the theft Police and state security services are investigating the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial statement said Dr Max Mannheimer a Holocaust survivor and vice president of the International Dachau Committee said he was horrified that Nazis apparently so desecrated the memorial to those murdered here and violated the reverence due to such a place The Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial museum said While we do not know who is behind the theft of the sign the theft of such a symbolic object is an offensive attack on the memory of the Holocaust Germany charges 93yearold as accessory to 300000 Auschwitz murders According to the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial the gate was forged by inmates in one of the camps workshops after it first opened in 1933 for political prisoners A Communist inmate was ordered by the SS to fashion the lettering Arbeit macht frei which was removed after the war and replaced by a reconstruction when the memorial was established in 1965 it said The propaganda slogan reflects Nazis attempts to appear harmless by presenting the concentration camp as a work and reeducation camp it said Tens of thousands of Jewish Sinti and Roma prisoners were also sent to the camp many of whom died before it was liberated by US Army troops in 1945 Playing to live Pianist survived Holocaust by performing for Nazis ,0.4

CNN,topstories, CNN  On Sunday Raquel and Pedro Alvarado buried three of their children  Erica Alex and Jose Angel  in the Mexican village of El Control just five miles south of the Texas border The final resting place for the youths  all in their 20s  is the place where their family originated But this small community administered by the larger border city of Matamoros merely provides bookends to the lives these three Americans had north of the Rio Grande The siblings were born in the United States grew up in Progreso Texas and continued to make their lives there They disappeared on October 13  kidnapped witnesses say  as they returned to Texas from a trip to visit their father in El Control Their bodies were found last week Each was bound at their hands and feet the Tamaulipas State Attorney Generals Office said and each had a gunshot wound to the head A fourth victim Jose Castaneda met the same fate Castaneda was Ericas boyfriend her family said All four were killed the same day they disappeared a spokesman for the State Attorney Generals Office said without elaborating Some witnesses told investigators that the armed men who confronted and took the youths belonged to a new security force known as Grupo Hercules State Attorney General Ismael Quintanilla Acosta told reporters Grupo Hercules was created one month before the disappearance of the youths It is touted as an elite security force under the direction of the mayor of Matamoros 37yearold Leticia Salazar In parts of Mexico like this stretch of border where drug cartels battle each other and law enforcement things arent always what they seem Drug gangs have been known to pose as cops Cops have been known to be on cartel payrolls Cases of mistaken identity have had deadly consequences But what troubles Pedro and Raquel Alvarado is that no one has offered a motive or theory about why their children and Castaneda were killed No one has accused the Alvarado siblings of being involved in criminal activity And while nine members of Grupo Hercules were interrogated by investigators no arrests have been made Salazar the Matamoros mayor has neither defended nor disciplined her security forces  at least publicly Contacted by CNN Salazar referred questions to the citys public affairs team which earlier said it did not have any comment on the allegations against Grupo Hercules and could not confirm why the group was created or even its size In a news release announcing the groups unveiling Grupo Hercules is described as being tasked with combating crime and made up of forces capable of carrying out intelligence and highrisk operations A week ago the attorney general said his investigators would call in the mayor for questioning but that has not happened I dont know why they took them Pedro Alvarado said They didnt start trouble with anyone They were quiet not aggressive If her children were mixed up in something criminal there should be a record of their arrests or charges against them but those are nonexistent Raquel Alvarado said If I knew they were doing something wrong I would have recognized it as their mother she said And until someone proves otherwise I will continue defending them Pedro Raquels former husband was the one to identify the remains of his children which were in an advanced state of decomposition the State Attorney Generals Office said He identified them by their clothing shoes and some tattoos The US Consulate in Matamoros has been assisting the family We have been in contact with Mexican officials both in Washington and in Mexico to find out further details of the case and will take appropriate action if necessary once more is known about the circumstances a State Department official said An FBI spokeswoman said the agency is assisting Mexican officials with any part of the investigation on the US side of the border Three lives The final Facebook post that Erica Alvarado shared  at least publicly  is a fitting if unplanned goodbye It is a collage of photos of her four children atop a backdrop with the words I love you She was born in Florida and like her siblings grew up in Progreso a Texas town on the border and about as close as you can get to El Control on the US side of the boundary She was a dedicated mother Pedro Alvarado said and was planning to enroll in a nursing program Her brother Alex loved his Chevy Tahoe his father said Alexs social media postings reflect that photos of the Tahoe muddied photos after a paint job the Tahoe as a profile picture The same armed men who took his children took the Tahoe Pedro Alvarado said The 22yearold had a prominent tattoo on his left arm  an image of St Jude the saint of lost causes  the father said By now Alex and his brother Jose Angel should have been in Missouri doing seasonal agricultural work Pedro Alvarado said Jose Angel was born in Houston and Alex in Harlingen during Pedros own days as a seasonal migrant worker in the United States their father said Routine visit The siblings visited their father in El Control each week Pedro Alvarado said On their short drive back to Texas the Alvarado siblings stopped at La Curva Texas a small restaurant underneath the last major overpass before the Los Indios International Bridge Pedro Alvarado said They arrived separately Raquel Alvarado said According to what witnesses have told her Alex and Jose Angel arrived at the restaurant to find armed men beating up their sister and her boyfriend The brothers intervened and the armed men overpowered all four and placed hoods over their heads before escorting them away the mother said It was there he said that they were last seen before their bodies were found 16 days later Raquel Alvarado said she and Pedro have told all this to authorities but she accuses investigators of moving slowly The facts that are known she said are thanks to the investigative work of Pedro who tracked down witnesses There was an outpouring of support at the funeral Raquel Alvarado said Family from across Texas and Mexico attended and when the funeral procession moved from the church to the burial ground they found that the crowd wouldnt fit in the cemetery On Monday the mother was back in Progreso hoping to get some sleep to recover from the whirlwind of mourning frustration and media spotlight I hope when I wake up I will learn this was all a nightmare

CNN,topstories, Washington CNN  The fate of endangered Democrats vulnerable Republicans and control of the Senate will be decided in a matter of hours Tuesday as voters across the country head to the polls to chart the direction of the country for the next two years That is of course assuming control of the Senate does not hinge on razorthin victories that trigger recounts and possibly runoff elections in two states Election Night will deliver clarity as well as confusion There will of course be individual winners and losers and the GOP is expected to easily hold if not build upon its majority in the House But the great unknown is which party will control the Senate  an important detail that will greatly influence President Barack Obamas final two years in office Republicans need a net gain of six seats to win control of the Senate and momentum seems to be in their direction With polls opening across the country Election Day could also offer fresh evidence that the angry antiincumbent mood extends well beyond Washington as the fate of several embattled governors will be decided on this night We may also witness the rebirth of a handful of political dynasties as well as the crushing defeats of two highprofile and muchhyped Democratic candidates Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis and former American Idol star Clay Aiken who is seeking a congressional seat in North Carolina And as the dust settles in the early morning hours of Wednesday attention will turn to the next presidential and congressional elections that will occur just two years from now Thats assuming control of the Senate will not hinge on recounts and runoffs in Georgia and Louisiana To help guide you through the day and night here are key moments to watch for to help make sense of an evening that can be equally overwhelming and exciting All Day Controversy is the fuel that powers politics It sparks discussions excites activists and forces change Yet it has a dark underside on Election Day  especially when there are charges of voter intimidation In the past supporters of both political parties have been accused of strong arm nefarious tactics Long lines an insufficient number of ballots at polling locations and possible calls for judicial intervention to keep polls open could make for a messy confusing and frustrating Election Day 5 pm ET We will start receiving results from the exit polls  surveys that people take at designated polling locations after voting as well as phone surveys among millions of early voters The preliminary data will likely provide a window into voters thoughts about the most important problems facing the country and what specifically they think about key issues such as the economy health care immigration and terrorism 6 pm ET Polls begin to close in Kentucky which holds one of the most watched Senate races of this midterm election Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell is locked in a competitive reelection battle with Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes a candidate Democrats hope can topple the minority leader 7 pm ET A dual focus on Kentucky and Georgia which features the two best pick up opportunities for Senate Democrats Winning one of these seats would take a little pressure off of Democrats who are playing defense for the remainder of the night Knocking off McConnell would provide an added psychological boost for Democrats but public polling shows that he has a single digit lead at this point in the race In Georgia there are two Democrats hoping to build upon their families political legacies Michelle Nunn daughter of former Sen Sam Nunn is running for the Senate seat vacated by GOP Sen Saxby Chambliss Jason Carter grandson of former President Jimmy Carter is seeking the governors office  the launching pad for his grandfathers successful presidential bid But both contests are so close there is a belief that each race could go to a runoff if the candidates fail to receive more than 50 of the vote If this happens Carter would face off again against Gov Nathan Deal on Dec 2 Nunn and her Republican opponent David Perdue would face the voters again on January 6 730 pm ET Republicans have their first real solid opportunity to win a Democratic seat in the open race to succeed Sen Jay Rockefeller Republican Rep Shelley Moore Capito and Democratic Secretary of State Natalie Tennant are the respective nominees for their political parties North Carolina will be closely watched as Sen Kay Hagan a Democrat is trying to hold off an attempt by House Speaker Thom Tillis to send her home after one term A victory by Republicans in North Carolina would be one of many critical building blocks the GOP is looking for to take back the Senate majority As a pop culture side note Aiken will learn if his American Idol stardom can transform into a congressional victory Spoiler alert its unlikely 8 pm ET  9 pm ET Polls across the country are closing in this hour and in terms of the Senate majority the focus broadens to New Hampshire and Arkansas In the Granite State polls close at 8 pm ET and Democratic Sen Jeanne Shaheen is facing former Massachusetts GOP Sen Scott Brown in what has turned into an ugly campaign Polling shows the race to be tight and a Republican victory would be devastating to Democrats A half hour later polls close in Arkansas where Democratic Sen Mark Pryor is battling Republican Rep Tom Cotton Arkansas is one of several seats that the GOP has a chance of winning In this hour we may begin to see the antiincumbent mood spread to the states Governors in five states  Connecticut Florida Illinois Maine and Pennsylvania  are in danger of losing reelection And we may see a Republican reclaim the governorship in deep blue Massachusetts a position Mitt Romney once held 9 pm ET Voting will end in Kansas a state Republicans should not have to be defending Embattled Sen Pat Roberts is trying to win a fourth term but questions regarding his Kansas residency has put him on the political ropes The twist in this race is that the Democratic candidate dropped out in order to give Independent Greg Orman a chance to win It is unclear if Orman will align himself politically with Senate Democrats if he defeats Roberts but it is one of the most intriguing contests of the night In South Dakota it appears as if Republicans have turned around Gov Mike Rounds campaign  a needed victory in their quest for six seats Colorado is another seat Democrats need to win in order to maintain their majority but Sen Mark Udall is in danger of losing to GOP Rep Cory Gardner The Louisiana Senate race features eight candidates including Democratic Sen Mary Landrieu  and it is unlikely to be decided until the Dec 6 runoff Davis high profile low polling bid to be the next Texas governor is likely to end in defeat But the first legacy victory of the night is expected to happen when George P Bush son of Florida Gov Jeb Bush grandson of former President George H W Bush nephew of former President George W Bush wins the race to become the next Texas Land Commissioner And we have another chance to see if the antiincumbent mood is pulsating beyond the Beltway as four more governors in Colorado Kansas Michigan and Wisconsin are in danger of losing reelection Keep an eye on Wisconsin Gov Scott Walkers race  a defeat would all but end any plans he may have in running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination 10 pm ET Republicans are expected to easily win the Montana Senate seat and have a shot of picking up the Iowa Senate seat Both seats are currently held by retiring Democrats A loss in Montana is expected while a defeat in Iowa would be a major blow to the Democrats ability to keep the Senate 11 pm ET Polls in the most populous state California close and Gov Jerry Brown is expected to easily win reelection Oregon begins releasing real vote totals and Democratic Sen Jeff Merkley is expected to defeat GOP challenger Monica Wehby Polls begin to close in Alaska 1 am ET Voting ends in the US as the final Alaska polls close Depending on what happens earlier in the evening the fate of the Senate majority may come down to who wins the competitive race between Democratic Sen Mark Begich and GOP challenger Dan Sullivan CORRECTION An earlier version of this story misstated who was the governor of Georgia

CNN,topstories, Washington CNN  Will pot politics push Florida Democrat Charlie Crist to victory on his quest to regain the governors mansion Thats what some Democrats are hoping Polls show Crist and his GOP rival current Gov Rick Scott are neckandneck A Quinnipiac University survey released Monday has Crist at 42 Scott with 41 Libertarian candidate Adrian Wyllie with 7 and 9 of likely voters still undecided Public Policy Polling released Sunday had the Crist and Scott at 44 each Crists law partner John Morgan spent millions to get an amendment to legalize medical marijuana on the ballot on Tuesday  a move some say was meant to help Crist win by boosting turnout from Democraticleaning groups Democrats in Florida privately hope that having a medical marijuana initiative on the ballot can bring out a set of voters who arent otherwise likely to vote in a midterm election said Reid Wilson a Washington Post reporter who closely follows state politics Its very political calculation and one that frankly Charlie Crists allies have put a lot of money into In a sign of a growing trend 23 states and the District of Columbia have already legalized medical marijuana Florida is not the only state where pot is on the ballot this year  voters in Alaska Oregon and Washington DC have a chance on Tuesday to approve measures legalizing recreational use of marijuana following in the footsteps of pot pioneers Washington and Colorado where weed has proved to be big business State records show marijuana sales brought in an average of roughly 332000 a month to Colorado communities in the first eight months of the year There has been some big money behind the ballot battle in the Sunshine State According to the Center for Public Integrity an estimated 47 million has been spent on television ads supporting both sides of the debate Most of that money  39 million  has been spent by opponents of the ballot measure who are financed in large part by conservative casino magnate Sheldon Adelson In contrast after a massive effort to get the measure on the ballot Morgan and his supporters have spent just 828800 on television ads urging voters to pass the amendment  a disadvantage that could prove decisive in a race that will come down to the wire That means it could be anybodys game Holder cautiously optimistic on legal pot The campaign against the amendment has been pretty aggressive and I think pretty effective based on the polls so there are a lot of people who are now actually kind of mobilizing to vote against medical marijuana initiative because they think its just problematic too many loopholes too easy for people to basically be selling marijuana out in the open said Adam Smith the political editor of the Tampa Bay Times So theres at least some speculation that rather than driving young people who are inclined to vote for it to the polls its going to motivate people who are against it to turn out which could help Rick Scott The amendment needs 60 to pass and while many polls show strong support for the initiative it is not clear that there is enough to pass it  a sign that Democrats high hopes the ballot measure could sway the race for their guy could go up in smoke Writein candidate smokes what she says is marijuana in political ad ,0.4
CNN,topstories, Editors note Alex Castellanos a Republican strategist is the founder of Purple Strategies and NewRepublicanorg You can follow him on Twitter alexcast The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author CNN  Politicians are running for office again Despite our best efforts there is nothing we can do stop them Tuesday there will be an election Here are 10 things to look for as the election returns come in 1 Did voters choose the least recent of two evils To adapt a quote often borrowed by my friend Mark Shields Mae West said that when faced with a choice between two evils she usually picked the one she had not tried lately If Republicans win even by large margins Tuesday night was it only because they were a less recent evil Will the GOP get the message that they are not being embraced for who they are but only given a shot because who they are not If Republicans dont get that message they can write off 2016 2 The war on women distraction Michael Goodwin writes that President Barack Obamas commitment to a more powerful government at home and abdication of American leadership around the world is being exposed as a historic calamity Whether you agree with Goodwin or not it is hard to dispute that Americas challenges are overwhelming American leadership Under Democrats watch polls show that most Americans believe our economy has fossilized like an Egyptian mummy The Middle East has caught on fire ISIS has grown from JV team to Super Bowl contender Russias Vladimir Putin strides the Earth unchecked Obamacare turns out to be Medicaid and Ebola is threatening to become a pandemic Yet the Democratic theme this cycle is that a Republican Party dominated by old white men does not understand the concerns of modern women Seriously Is this obvious distraction the best the Democratic Party can do Who would have thought that when the world is burning down it would be Democrats advising women not to worry their pretty little heads about anything other than gender issues Tuesday night we will learn whether the Democratic campaign was too small for the times insulting and demeaning 3 Will Tuesday night empower Elizabeth Warren On Election Night count the number of Democrats in swing or purple states who lose their Senate seats An untold story in Washington is that Democrats like Republicans are becoming a much less moderate party It is unlikely the Democratic base will react to Senate losses by calling for moderation instead of purity Fewer moderates means that extreme elements in the Democratic base will be able to raise an even larger voice Losses in purple states such as Iowa Colorado New Hampshire and North Carolina will empower Warrens shrill populism Wednesday morning Hillary Clinton may have to apologize for apologizing for saying that businesses dont create jobs 4 Does success divide Republicans Republicans have been split between establishment types libertarians neoisolationists tea party supporters social issue conservatives and a small group that fears trigonometry One man has brought them all together however Barack Obama Who would have thought that if only in this perverse way Obama would succeed George Bush as a uniter and not a divider No GOP faction will be credited for Tuesday nights victories or blamed for defeats because Republicans actually are if only temporarily united Instead the GOPs challenge will be to hold these factions together if Republicans gain a majority in the Senate Tuesday night if Republicans such as Ted Cruz are talking about repealing Obamacare or social issues they are inviting division If instead they explain that this election has given them an opportunity to lead an economic renewal it will be a sign that Republicans are trying to hold the party together and have actually smartened up a bit 5 Does defeat kick off WWIII within the Democratic Party Bill Clinton is all that is left of a Democratic Party that once had a sense of humor declared the era of big government is over and understood we have to create prosperity before we share it The partys base however enjoys none of these fine qualities Its heart beats with Warrens populism and Obamas postClinton liberalism Tuesday night look to see who blames whom for Democratic losses and keep an especially sharp eye on progrowth probusiness Democrats and big Democratic contributors Will they engage in any serious selfreflection If Democrats only blame the consumer voters or the marketers the consultants instead of the team who made the product Obama Sen Harry Reid Warren et al they are whistling past the graveyard New Democrats need to start a war and pull their party back to the center for 2016 6 Does Obamas presidency effectively end Tuesday night  Recently when weve seen someone wearing a hazmat suit on the news it may have been a medical professional protecting us from Ebola Or it could have been a Democratic candidate trying to protect themselves from a presidential visit President Obama has deluded himself that he is not a plague upon Democratic candidates but Tuesday evening two East Coast states may set him straight If Republicans win early on the East Coast in tight races such as New Hampshire and North Carolina denial will no longer be an option and the President may be put in quarantine With a bad night in these states Jimmy Carter may have a better chance of getting invited to speak at the 2016 Democratic convention than Barack Obama Why does that matter Because politicians with huge egos rarely fade gracefully from public view especially while still in office Obama is the man who said Im LeBron baby told us his policies were on the ballot and made sure this midterm election was all about him A President without the support of his country caged in his own White House bouncing off the walls like a wounded animal can do great damage to his party and his country Tuesday night will shape Obamas final two years 7 Has the Republican Party seen its future The most important race for Republicans Tuesday night will be the Senate race in Colorado where the next generation of Republican has been born Cory Gardner a sunny optimistic selfdeclared new kind of Republican may show his GOP companions how they can seize the future if they are more than the grumpy old party of no and explain how their principles can renew our economy and our country In Gardner Republicans may see the difference between a merely acceptable and a desirable alternative to todays Democrats Colorado matters Watch this state to see what the Republican Party can be 8 Is the Democratic turnout machine still the difference  In states such as North Carolina and Georgia Democrats have a home field advantage big urban areas with large concentrations of targetable voters We should get a good read on the power of the Democratic turnout machines in the North Carolina and Georgia Senate races If Sen Kay Hagan hangs on in North Carolina credit the Democratic ground game Alert for Republicans There is no reason your adversaries cant squeeze two or three extra points out of their superior ground game not only this cycle but in 2016 My bet Hagan is trapped with about 45 of the vote and 3 points from a superior ground game wont be quite enough But this is one of the closest races to watch Tuesday evening 9 Is demography destiny The Democratic Party is building its future on demography not ideas Shortterm their strategy is to turn around elections they might otherwise lose by driving minority and youth turnout to above average levels Longterm they hope to build an emerging majority as their targeted groups become larger parts of the electorate All this of course requires that Democrats remain the overwhelming preference of minority and younger voters Any cracks in these elemental building blocks of the Obama coalition would not augur well for Democratic strategy long term Tuesday night however will we see new fissures here When first elected Obamas messianic candidacy brought masses of rapturous millennials to the Democratic Party Now they find themselves in a stagnant economy bearing massive student debt living in their parents basements facing decades of work to pay for debt racked up by their profligate elders and for their parents retirement The higher you lift someones hope and dreams the further they may fall Now millennial voters are up for grabs Tuesday will give us a glimpse into the future of the Democratic Partys emerging majority 10 Is Tuesday nights big loser Washington For years both Republicans and Democrats have found electoral success promising solutions from Washington The Five Point Plan for This or That Act the Jobs Bill that Helps Politicians Keep Their Jobs and the everpopular Equal Pay for the Job You Dont Have Act Tuesday night will measure the breadth of the chasm between what Washington promises and what voters actually see it deliver If Republican Sen Pat Roberts loses in Kansas we will know that heartland Americas patience with Washington has been exhausted Washingtons currency is its ability to promise That currency has been immensely devalued What happens when Americans are no longer willing to accept it in exchange for their votes We may have reached a tipping point where voters look at promising Washington politicians and say The emperor has no clothes And thats the good news for perhaps at that point real change will become possible And for political junkies wondering what to do after this election the 2016 presidential campaign will be starting right after this commercial break We cant stop them either Read CNNOpinions new Flipboard magazine Follow us on Twitter CNNOpinion Join us on

CNN,topstories, CNN  At first its hard to tell what these extraordinary works are made from Kate Rohdes giant glowing sculptures resemble backlit jewels as if they have been carved out of phosphorescent rock A luminous green box appears to be crafted from fine jade even if its large size and intricate detail make this implausible Another piece labeled a crystal marsupial is a translucent purple figure which twists to reveal what looks like a glittering core of amethysts In fact all of these objects are sculpted from a resin which has become Rohdes signature medium as an artist and jeweler These synthetic resins are so versatile that they can be molded into huge structures or cut and polished to achieve the luster of gems Over the past decade Rohde has shaped this material into fantastic sculptures including a fluorescent garden filled with jewels and creatures and a pair of turquoise crystal horns which can be worn as a headpiece Rohde is fascinated by the morphology of animals and minerals and her works often have the air of natural history specimens given a psychedelic twist with their rainbow pigments and exaggerated shapes One of her characteristic installations is a baroque display case stuffed with a variety of dazzling incongruous objects a neon skeleton an artificial heart a bright stalactite READ The man who turns Lego into art For the Australian artist there is an excitement about reinventing organic forms and traditional tableaux in dayglo colors resulting in a mashup of historical styles She admits that she is always drawn to an eclectic mix of influences things which are aesthetically excessive and colorful and blingy These display cases are a combination of 19th century diorama and modern fashion editorial in which scientific models are imbued with futuristic glamor In addition to her acclaimed gallery work Rohde has had a long association with fashion and jewelry design In 2010 she collaborated with fashion designers Anna Plunkett and Luke Sales of the Sydney label Romance Was Born to produce a Jurassicthemed collection called Renaissance Dinosaur featuring models in crystalstudded breastplates and multicolored antlers She also worked with Romance Was Born to produce a series of fabrics  and even a line of wallpaper  depicting a maze of flora and fauna in acid colors READ Is biology the future of design For Rohde it makes sense to move between exhibitions high fashion and readytowear items since it allows her to work with vastly differing scales and functionality Different fields bring unique challenges but resin is quite a forgiving material with flexibility and wide scope for experimentation It can be built up and cut down in extreme ways Working on jewelry enables Rohde to perfect the precise cutting she uses for her gallery pieces while ambitious sculptural ideas often find their way into her accessories A crystal bird perched on a cuff functions as both a bracelet and a freestanding sculpture Rohdes jewelry line ranges from chunky bangles in cartoon colors to striking but ethereal pieces such as a cluster of rosepink shards jutting out from the wrist An iridescent blue ring with two bugeye gems foregrounds the artists sense of humor while a pair of shimmering earrings with scalloped edges is both delicate and flashy Resin allows multiple color changes to be incorporated into one piece so that a ring graduates from milky white to translucent pink and a cuff shows shades of blue seeping into yellow READ The worlds most frustrating objects  It is important to Rohde that the transition to wearable art is made without losing the outlandish and distinctive quality of her style Her designs for jewelry often draw on the same techniques as her sculptures in particular the use of acrylic icing to give an opalescent sheen to surfaces as seen in her pearlcolored rings At the same time she is able to embrace the contradictions of working in both the art world and the luxury market making sumptuous designs out of faux gems and applying painstaking modeling to synthetic materials Some of Rohdes fashion collaborations can currently be seen at the National Gallery of Victoria In the meantime she is busy researching ideas for new sculptures Her next exhibition at Melbournes Karen Woodbury Gallery will have a geological focus combining crystal structures with mixed media such as technicolor hair extensions she sources in Japan and a kind of plastic which can be dyed in hot water She also intends to work the geological theme into her accessories I think of my jewelry as smallscale sculptures like a threedimensional print with a small edition run The only difference is that with jewelery there has to be some serious consideration of the function and how its worn whereas a sculpture can be much more impractical Striking photos reveal hidden history of black Britons in the Victorian era The most spectacular buildings of 2014 10 works of art that shocked the world ,0.4

CNN,tech, CNN  The technology sounds simultaneously fake and dangerous Strap on a headset and send targeted electrical currents into your brain for about 15 minutes to get more energy improve your focus or calm down Brain stimulation is a very real but still unproven area of technology for tinkering with the human brain For decades scientists have experimented with sending electrical currents through subjects skulls to their brains to do everything from treating serious mental disorders like depression to improving memory and learning Now Silicon Valley is hoping it can turn brain stimulation tech into sleek wearable devices for consumers Is it really possible to make the jump from the lab to Best Buy shelves The latest company to attempt to create a consumer brain stimulation product is Thync a startup with a serious pedigree Founded by entrepreneur Isy Goldwasser and neuroscientist Jamie Tyler who has a PhD in psychology and behavioral neuroscience Thync has been working on its device secretly for the past three years Its a portable headset that will offer three settings to start energy relaxation and focus For some people it would be their third cup of coffee for some people it would be their afternoon nap said Goldwasser One of the primary technologies Thync is based on is transcranial direct current stimulation or tDCS which uses a weak electrical current to change the sensitivity of neurons in the brain Neurons are cells in the brain that send electrical signals to each other resulting in the release of chemicals that impact what a person is thinking or feeling When targeted to the right area the tDCS currents can create changes in how a persons brain is functioning With the potential to replace everything including a soda habit yoga class or pharmaceuticals for mental disorders the market for brain stimulation devices that are proven to work is potentially huge The US military has even experimented with it as a way to improve pilot training Thync is focusing on small improvements for already healthy minds The users are going to be people who really have busy lives and really need tools besides chemicals drugs or alcohol said Goldwasser Theyd like another approach to change their mental state Its not the first commercial product to use tDCS Focus is a 250 headset that uses tDCS to help gamers increase focus and performance while playing video games There is an expansive community of people who experiment with doityourself tDCS headsets they make using tutorials found online and equipment found at a local Radio Shack Even with a number of respected studies on brain stimulation its still not clear if these techniques have an impact I think most people would agree that the jury is still out about whether tDCS  has any proven therapeutic or cognitive enhancement effects said Charan Ranganath a professor at the Center for Neuroscience at the University of California Davis Research into the effectiveness of tDCS and other brain stimulation methods is still considered to be in the early stages and there are doubts in the neuroscience community about early results Some of the published studies have small sample sizes dont adequately address placebo effects and they often use weird measures of memory or cognition that can be hard to interpret said Ranganath There is also a tendency to only publish studies that have positive results while ignoring the ones with negative results If tDSC does work creating the same desired effect in different people is difficult even in tightly controlled laboratory studies where the equipment is set up and handled by experts To make tDCS work the currents must hit specific target areas in the brain which vary greatly for each person Everyones head is shaped differently and if its off by a small amount a tDCS device could have a drastically different impact Even if it does hit the right spot theres no guarantee a signal will impact people the same way For example some people function really well after a morning cup of coffee while others have the opposite reaction to caffeine The idea that the same method will achieve enhancing effects on everyone is probably over simplistic said Ranganath To counter those concerns Thync is taking its science safety and testing seriously In addition to tDCS it is using an emerging new technique called transcranial pulsed ultrasound along with custom algorithms and proprietary neurosignaling waveforms It took us years to find these effects said Thyncs Tyler You cant just slap it on your head and jolt your brain  there is real science Thync has already tested its product on more than 2000 people in as many trials After using Thync the subjects answer questions about how they feel and the researchers measure their vitals If it wants FDA approval down the line Thync will need to go through extensive clinical trials Thync plans on having its first product ready by 2015 The Californiabased company recently secured 13 million in venture capital funding Its still too early to know how effective Thync or other future brain stimulation devices will be when they are released But supporters of the technology think were just at the beginning of a consumer neurotechnology revolution Tyler thinks soon these products will be commonplace It is inevitable ,0.4
CNN,tech, CNN  For the past 25 years the Web has opened up unprecedented possibilities for human communication But it has a dark side too  sometimes a very dark one Four out of 10 of Web users have been harassed online according to a survey released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center And about 73 of the Web users surveyed said theyve witnessed someone being harassed online The harshest forms of abuse  physical threats stalking and sexual harassment  are often reserved for women With responses from 2849 Web users the Pew study appears to be the most detailed of its kind looking at abusive behavior on the Web And it comes at a time when high profile cases of online abuse many of them targeting women have bubbled up from the Webs darker corners into the full light of public scrutiny Theres a pretty broad spectrum of these actions said Lee Rainie director of Internet Science and Technology research at the center And some of it is quite severe Online harassment breaks down into two categories according to Pew One is minor and one more severe The first includes things like namecalling and humiliation The second category targets a smaller segment of Web users and includes actions like stalking harassment over a long period of time and violent threats Its that sort of abuse that has made headlines in recent months Most prevalent has been GamerGate a movement that purports to be about defending videogaming culture and demanding responsible journalism from gaming websites But it quickly turned into a wave of vicious online attacks on journalists game developers and others  almost all of them women Several women have been subjected to violent rape threats detailed death threats hacking and doxxing in which documents with personal information are stolen and posted online At least two women have been forced to leave their homes after receiving specific threats of violence as a result of GamerGate In other highprofile incidents actor Zelda Williams left social media for several weeks in August after she received graphic abusive messages on Instagram and Twitter about the death of her father comedy legend Robin Williams And earlier this month actor Milla Jovovich announced on Twitter that shed stopped interacting with fans because she and her family had been threatened by a stalker from the site After contacting authorities I was told to absolutely stop talking to people I dont know on social forums she wrote Now that sucks for all the cool people I got to know on here but my family comes first and I cannot take any chances when it comes to them Its that sort of intense abuse that concerns Sara Baker coordinator of Take Back the Tech a campaign aimed at ending online violence against women In our work we see how the effects of online violence play out in the physical world all the time she said Whether or not such abuse results in physical violence  and it sometimes does  it always results in real harm According to the Pew study women experience the more severe types of abuse at disproportionately high levels when compared to men Among women age 1824 26 said theyd been stalked online and 25 said theyd been sexually harassed online Sponsored by members of womens groups from around the world Bakers organization recently gave a failing grade to Facebook Twitter and YouTube in a report saying the Webs largest socialmedia sites dont do enough to prevent abuse of women on their networks The Pew report suggests that social media is in fact where a lot of online harassment takes place Two out of three respondents who said theyd been harassed online said the most recent incident happened on a socialmedia website or app Other sites where people said they encountered harassment included the comments section of websites 22 online gaming 16 in email 16 on a discussion site such as Reddit 10 and on online dating sites or apps 6 Part of what makes online abuse so rampant is the anonymous nature of some Web forums Half the people who said theyve been harassed online said they didnt know their attacker But theres good news Just as the Web can be used to harass people it can be used to rally people against hurtful speech as well The Internet has expanded our ability to respond to such violence by finding community exchanging knowledge and building solidarity Baker said ,0.4

CNN,tech, Editors note Tomorrow Transformed explores innovative approaches and opportunities available in business and society through technology CNN  Ever since two men first laid a bet on two flies climbing up a cave wall gambling has struck at the core of the human condition the future is uncertain And while games of chance like dice and cards have been with us for centuries bar room wagers on matters of abstract speculation have often been lost to history disappearing as fast as the hot air that produced them Until now that is Novelty bets Thanks to websites like Longbetsorg and professional gaming sites like Paddy Power oddball bets on everything from the next pope to the life expectancy of the universe have a running book In the case of Longbetsorg they are the source of heated debate about the shape of the future These bets become an interesting tool to understand how we think about the future and even if we are really arguing about the right things said Alexander Rose director of the Long Now Foundation which backs the Long Bets project Betting exchanges that take novelty bets are nothing new  Paddy Power has a longrunning book on whether it will snow on Christmas Day and the next pope  but what makes Long Bets different is that it will only accept bets that advance our understanding of science and the future The winner also must donate their winnings to a charity of his choice Predicting the future So far Long Bets has taken longterm bets on whether drones will do battle as part of protests whether commercial flights will become pilotless and on the future of level of the worlds population People need to have an opposing argument and come to an agreement about the terms which actually turns out to be quite tricky Rose told CNN Someone will make a bet for instance that we will find extraterrestrial intelligence in the next 50 years then theres often a long philosophical discussion about what constitutes extraterrestrial intelligence or even life If we are talking about something as strange as that we dont know even if wed recognize it Often he said the parties have already bashed out the terms before they come to Long Bets Buffetts million dollar gamble In the case of its current highest profile bet  a million dollar bet between billionaire investor Warren Buffett and alternative investment group Protg Partners LLC  the two parties had already agreed the terms and had come to Long Bets to find a platform for the wager For a simple 50 fee anyone can make a prediction which then becomes a bet when someone takes up the challenge Nothing is too outlandish said Rose as long as it is well argued Often the results can be surprising We had one bet on the cost of energy five years into the future and the parties had used a very good source which was the report of the US Department of Energy he said However when it came time to adjudicate that bet it was found the government had pulled its report in the wake of the 74 billion Enron scandal in 2001 Enron had sufficiently skewed the energy market that the government had to unwind all the Enron trades out of its report to know the true cost of energy Rose said It was enough to flip the results of the bet Changing parameters Often the future is so unpredictable that the parameters of the debate change entirely Once such argument over whether the top 10 news stories would come from a blog or the Wall Street Journal was at the time surprisingly eclipsed by Wikipedia which was little known in 2002 We often find that its not so much whether someone was right or wrong but that what was being argued about was not even relevant Rose said Our main goal is that they create an interesting discussion about the future And we try to keep them away from celebrities and sports and more on arguments about the world Weve taken a few bets on sports but only when theyve been arguments about globalization Some have time scales so long that no one will ever collect on them Turing test A bet on whether the universe will keep expanding is unlikely ever to see a winner but a 20000 bet between Googles director of engineering Ray Kurzweil and Lotus Development founder Mitchell Kapor on artificial intelligence passing the Turing test comes up in 2029 To pass the test a machine or computer program must convince a human judge that it has a level of intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human being For mainstream punters meanwhile betting exchanges like Paddy Power have been taking novelty bets on everything from the next pope  more than 300000 450000 was placed after Pope Benedicts resignation  to parents betting on their sons becoming soccer World Cup football captains For us its really a fraction of our business less than 1 but its very good for our profile and we like doing it Paddy Power told CNN And anyway who knows One day well all be caught with our pants down when Elvis comes back into town Read more from Tomorrow

CNN,tech, Editors note Smart Business explores the ways companies are thinking smart to thrive in our digitized world  CNN  In the narrow winding lanes of Old Delhi the knotted masses of electrical wiring hanging across the streets are sometimes so thickly entwined they blot out the sun In the streets of Bangkok electricity wires loop and run in chaotic bundles from concrete power poles In the slums of Mumbai to the townships of South Africa electricity infrastructure is a triumph of make and mend For power utilities in emerging markets collecting the bills from this tangled skein of wiring is a nightmare and slow payment  even outright energy theft  remains a powerful disincentive for new investment in the sector Smart solutions One company however says smart meters may hold the answers to the power problems of the worlds emerging markets While smart meters have been in use in the United States and Europe for more than a decade in markets such as Africa they are set to encourage muchneeded investment in the sector The devices not only record electricity consumption but relay information back to the utility for monitoring and billing purposes Critically they also require prepayment which means that utilities that produce the power can be sure they will be paid for it Alain Bollack director at the Global Power  Utilities Centre of Ernst and Young said the company worked with the city of Tshwane outside Johannesburg in South Africa to install prepaid smart meters to solve endemic problems of late payment longterm debtors and electricity theft The city had two major problems Bollack told CNN The first was they couldnt collect the cash from customers  either businesses or individuals They had 800000 customers that were an average 500 days in arrears The second was that a lot of clients were stealing electricity and thats very common in emerging markets Chaotic infrastructure He said the chaotic nature of the electricity infrastructure in places like Africa or India means that stealing energy is easy Often its as easy as hooking onto a line bypassing the meter and getting free energy The first major problem of energy in emerging markets is getting access to it i the first place the second problem is that when there is access it gets stolen He said cities such as Mumbai had worked hard over the past 10 years to reduce the opportunity for consumers to steal electricity Over ten years ago some 65 of the energy produced in Mumbai was not paid for Bollack said Smart meters he said require customers to pay before they consume and also relay information back to the utilities if the meters are tampered with in any way Legislation is key So far some 3000 smart meters have been rolled out in Tshwane particularly among high consumers of energy At the core of the solution however is legislation and Bollack said that the city government passed laws to enforce the new rule That might not be very pleasant for many consumers but at the end of the day if you provide a service its quite normal to pay for it Bollack said If you have asked nicely for many many years and people still wont pay then you have a right to enforce that by law He said the value proposition extended to consumers in that they also gained a better picture through smart metering of what and how they consumed electricity Ultimately however energy theft is not a sustainable business model leading to underinvestment more costly production and higher prices Bollack said that Tshwanes foray into smart meters was now being viewed with interest from countries throughout the region including Ghana Zimbabwe Mozambique and parts of Nigeria They are looking at it as a possible way of resolving the financing problem of energy infrastructure in Africa Bollack said If you are lucky if youve got investors from China or the US or Europe who are happy to put billions on the table but dont have any guarantee of return on investment Holy grail He said that smart meters in Africa are fast becoming the holy grail for energy sector investors and ultimately could accelerate investment that would provide power for millions more people in the region While critics might argue that consumers have gone from free albeit stolen electricity to electricity they now cant afford Bollack said smart meters for the first time could reverse the vicious circle created by energy theft The business case for the city of Tshwane is interesting he said Energy is one of the citys main sources of revenue and what they are saying is that smart meters are not being introduced to balance the books but to collect the cash to reinvest it into the community Even though theres a lag between when you collect the cash and reinvest what you ultimately create is a virtuous circle Read this Is this the end of the 95 working day Read this Driverless vehicles The end of the road for the trucker ,0.4

CNN,tech, Editors note In celebration of International Day of the Girl October 11 and Ada Lovelace Day October 14 Leading Women is devoting the month of October to women and girls in STEM science technology engineering and math CNN  Robots can be many things  knowledgeable dexterous strong But can they ever be genuinely laughoutloud hilarious If you prick us in our battery pack do we not bleed alkaline fluid asks Ginger the Robot haltingly throwing up its arms in its best impression of a reallife comedian Truth be told if Ginger were a human itd be dying on stage The cute little machines monotone voice has all the drama of a conveyer belt while its expression is as vacant as a doll Comedic timing is hard to master  particularly when you have no emotions Luckily for Ginger sitting beside it is comedy sidekick  and programmer  Heather Knight  The living breathing 31yearold engineer heads a theater and robotics collective called Marilyn Monrobot The group runs everything from a Robot Film Festival to Cyborg Cabaret and standup alongside poor old Ginger I fell in love with the idea that we could collaborate between the arts and robotics explains Knight originally from Boston and now a doctorate student at Carnegie Mellons Robotics Institute in Pittsburgh I was looking for a way to do a performance with a robot and I was like hey what about a comedy routine on stage That way you could make jokes and get realtime feedback along the way she says with infectious fasttalking enthusiasm Funny business The unlikely partnership between researcher and robot is not without friction  at one stage Ginger informs us Knight has been cheating on it I caught her collecting videos of other robots says the kneehigh Nao robot created by French robotics company Aldebaran and popularly used as a learning aid in universities I dont feel pain says blankfaced Ginger But still that does not compute I confronted her and she claims she needs to do research with other machines to improve my response capabilities Theres only one way to win Knight back it seems And thats through some aptly robotic dance moves Indeed Gingers charm lies in its very robotness  which has more in common with human comedy than you might think When it talks about its perception capabilities still being in development  that gets a laugh almost every single time explained Knight who programs all of Gingers dialogue and movements herself People love when it goes all supertechy and acts like a real robot One of the things Ive learned from interviewing comedians over the years is that part of what makes a performance compelling is authenticity If youre going to be a comedian you need to bring material from yourself Intelligent interaction  And like all good comedians Ginger must read the crowd In this case that involves programming the machine to pick up on social cues like clapping and even smiling Things like laughter applause these are symbolic things that we all do says Knight So when youre in a theater you can have hundreds of people that are also data points In the past Ive given the audience feedback cards that were red on one side and green on the other so they could explicitly tell the robot through its vision whether something was working or not Regardless of Gingers comedic powers the adorable bot could one day influence the personalities of other machines For example if you had a robot thats delivering juice boxes in a preschool then youd want it to be pretty warm explained Knight But if you have a robot thats a security guard in a garage at night with some suspicious people hanging around then being a little intimidating can totally be appropriate Sweet science While other engineers compete to create the most humanlike robot ever Knight says they might be better off making machines that we just really like having around Theres all these different relationships we have with technology now  frustration with our software updates or bonding with our cars to the point of naming them she said So it can be refreshing to have a piece of technology actually making fun of its self rather than just inconveniencing us when its supposed to be improving our lives Gingers unique comedy act isnt just a research project  its an important teaching tool with Knights Ted talk attracting over 600000 views online When the robot makes fun of me it means I can tell you about my research and its like my own selfdeprecation explained the bubbly engineer and you get the feeling her popularity is not just down to Ginger but her own charismatic stage presence Its the spoonful of sugar that makes the education go down One things for sure science class would have been a whole lot more interesting with these two at the front They call me Ginger the Robot gosh I love saying that It makes me feel like some sort of super hero says the miniature machine with a jerky swivel of the head But actually I am just a mediocre robotic comedian Boom Boom Quiz

CNN,tech, CNN  Its the most controversial issue since people started filming videos in portrait mode Should tablets be used as cameras Whipping out a tablet to take a photo is a practice that like it or not is going mainstream Once primarily the domain of dads who dont mind embarrassing their children tablet photography has become so common that Apple added serious camera features to its new fullsized iPad Why when its very likely they have a smartphone with a better camera do people use tablets to take photos and videos I think people look a little silly doing it but I can understand why said Amit Gupta founder of Photojojocom Its like the worlds biggest viewfinder Traditional cameras have small viewfinders that when you put your eye to them fill your entire view with a scene Smartphone screens are dinky in comparison Someone who struggles to see a phone screen especially when holding the device in outstretched arms may enjoy the extra real estate of a tablet Editing is also much easier on a tablet On a smartphone postproduction is usually limited to a few tweaks and an Instagram filter but a tablet is large enough to be a decent canvas for editing Guptas site is a popular shop for mobile photography accessories Since the iPad debuted he has seen a jump in the number of people buying tabletspecific photography tools like the iOgrapher iPad Video Rig For critics a better view isnt enough to justify pulling out a tablet instead of a phone or real camera Aside from the camera quality there are a number of reasons for the stigma against tablet photography  including what professional photographer and instructor Steve Simon calls the dorky factor  Wielding a large flat rectangle to take a photo is awkward The thin smooth frame is made for gripping with two hands or resting on a surface not holding it above your head while you tap to focus a shot Light bouncing off the large glossy screen can create unfortunate glare especially outdoors The shape and size can also have an impact on a final photo Cameras have an effect on their subjects A person will act differently in front of a large professional DLSR setup versus a smartphone or tablet As a street photographer where keeping a low profile is hugely helpful to capture real moments using a large tablet is the opposite of stealthy said Simon who teaches a course on street photography I find the tablet photographer looks a bit invasive and aggressive holding that big device in front of whatever or whoever they aim it at Its not just the person theyre photographing that might be put off Events like concerts are already turning into obnoxious seas of smartphones being held in the air The only thing worse is the person who holds up a tablet blocking other peoples views Early tablet photographers clearly arent too concerned about what other people think or the hardwares limitations Apples upgrades mean the practice could catch on with more people and shed some negative associations Remember there was resistance to smartphone photography at first too but it took off because people always had the devices in their pockets and sharing was instant The photos werent great quality but using a phone was convenient and the best camera is the one thats with you became a rallying cry The iPad Air 2s main camera is now competitive with the iPhone 6 It has an eight megapixel sensor and a number of camera features previously only found on iPhones including timelapse video slowmotion and burst mode Apple says its new iPad Air screen has been redesigned and given an antireflective coating to reduce glare by more than half Inside theres a more powerful graphics processor which makes the tablet a great tool for editing The number of fullfeatured photo and video editing apps for the iPad is growing Apple demonstrated the new Pixelmator iPad app at its press event using it to remove an unwanted oryx from a desert scene There are still many valid reasons for not using a tablet as a camera but the upgraded iPad camera chips away at some of them The increased range in sizes for mobile devices is also helping blur the lines between phones and tablets Theres going to be less stigma because everyones toting around these bigger phones said Gupta Its going to become a little easier to justify pulling out the iPad ,0.4

CNN,tech, CNN  The technology sounds simultaneously fake and dangerous Strap on a headset and send targeted electrical currents into your brain for about 15 minutes to get more energy improve your focus or calm down Brain stimulation is a very real but still unproven area of technology for tinkering with the human brain For decades scientists have experimented with sending electrical currents through subjects skulls to their brains to do everything from treating serious mental disorders like depression to improving memory and learning Now Silicon Valley is hoping it can turn brain stimulation tech into sleek wearable devices for consumers Is it really possible to make the jump from the lab to Best Buy shelves The latest company to attempt to create a consumer brain stimulation product is Thync a startup with a serious pedigree Founded by entrepreneur Isy Goldwasser and neuroscientist Jamie Tyler who has a PhD in psychology and behavioral neuroscience Thync has been working on its device secretly for the past three years Its a portable headset that will offer three settings to start energy relaxation and focus For some people it would be their third cup of coffee for some people it would be their afternoon nap said Goldwasser One of the primary technologies Thync is based on is transcranial direct current stimulation or tDCS which uses a weak electrical current to change the sensitivity of neurons in the brain Neurons are cells in the brain that send electrical signals to each other resulting in the release of chemicals that impact what a person is thinking or feeling When targeted to the right area the tDCS currents can create changes in how a persons brain is functioning With the potential to replace everything including a soda habit yoga class or pharmaceuticals for mental disorders the market for brain stimulation devices that are proven to work is potentially huge The US military has even experimented with it as a way to improve pilot training Thync is focusing on small improvements for already healthy minds The users are going to be people who really have busy lives and really need tools besides chemicals drugs or alcohol said Goldwasser Theyd like another approach to change their mental state Its not the first commercial product to use tDCS Focus is a 250 headset that uses tDCS to help gamers increase focus and performance while playing video games There is an expansive community of people who experiment with doityourself tDCS headsets they make using tutorials found online and equipment found at a local Radio Shack Even with a number of respected studies on brain stimulation its still not clear if these techniques have an impact I think most people would agree that the jury is still out about whether tDCS  has any proven therapeutic or cognitive enhancement effects said Charan Ranganath a professor at the Center for Neuroscience at the University of California Davis Research into the effectiveness of tDCS and other brain stimulation methods is still considered to be in the early stages and there are doubts in the neuroscience community about early results Some of the published studies have small sample sizes dont adequately address placebo effects and they often use weird measures of memory or cognition that can be hard to interpret said Ranganath There is also a tendency to only publish studies that have positive results while ignoring the ones with negative results If tDSC does work creating the same desired effect in different people is difficult even in tightly controlled laboratory studies where the equipment is set up and handled by experts To make tDCS work the currents must hit specific target areas in the brain which vary greatly for each person Everyones head is shaped differently and if its off by a small amount a tDCS device could have a drastically different impact Even if it does hit the right spot theres no guarantee a signal will impact people the same way For example some people function really well after a morning cup of coffee while others have the opposite reaction to caffeine The idea that the same method will achieve enhancing effects on everyone is probably over simplistic said Ranganath To counter those concerns Thync is taking its science safety and testing seriously In addition to tDCS it is using an emerging new technique called transcranial pulsed ultrasound along with custom algorithms and proprietary neurosignaling waveforms It took us years to find these effects said Thyncs Tyler You cant just slap it on your head and jolt your brain  there is real science Thync has already tested its product on more than 2000 people in as many trials After using Thync the subjects answer questions about how they feel and the researchers measure their vitals If it wants FDA approval down the line Thync will need to go through extensive clinical trials Thync plans on having its first product ready by 2015 The Californiabased company recently secured 13 million in venture capital funding Its still too early to know how effective Thync or other future brain stimulation devices will be when they are released But supporters of the technology think were just at the beginning of a consumer neurotechnology revolution Tyler thinks soon these products will be commonplace It is inevitable ,0.4

CNN,tech, CNN  Car safety testing has come a long way since the days of dropping cadavers down unused elevator shafts in the 1930s That we enjoy greater peace of mind on the road  with fatal accidents in the US at historic lows  is largely due to the evolution of crash test dummies Vehicle manufacturers must prove their safety with dummies before they can be legally sold in the US and Europe and these unsung heroes have developed into extraordinarily sophisticated tools for collecting data and assessing risk The newest dummies can have over 130 channels of information says Chris O Connor CEO of Humanetics the worlds leading producer of dummies So the amount of data is up four or five times what it could years ago Humanetics work with insurance and academic institutions to analyze the everincreasing data This allows them to establish and prioritize the most common injuries but also the most common victims Obese people are 78 more likely to die in a crash says O Connor The reason is the way we get fat We get fat in our middle range And we get out of position in a typical seat To accommodate the increasing numbers of overweight drivers Humanetics are developing an obese dummy One prototype has already been produced that weighs 273 pounds with a body mass index of 35 The analytics also reveal that risk of a serious injury increases by 20 in 50yearold drivers by 40 at 80 and steadily higher thereafter Replicating age in a dummy is an ongoing challenge but the company hope to have a prototype by 2015 Humanetics are also rolling out their next generation THOR Test device for Human Occupant Restraint for median range occupants with the most advanced sensitivity yet The idea of these new dummies that they start to measure new types of load such as shoulder loads they interact with restraints better says Dr Joel Stitzel director of the Center for Injury Biomechanics They have more measurement capabilities so they can do a better job of predicting injury But Stitzel believes the timehonored crash test dummy could be challenged by a new concept The way the industry is going is more towards computational modelling THOR is the future of dummy development but auto manufacturers are looking to develop virtual scenarios they can run on computerswhich allow them to look at more specific anatomy It allows manufacturers to see things that dummies cant tell them and they can more easily modify virtual models such as adding subcutaneous fat to simulate larger people Such systems are already being tested in Europe While the new model would require a significant initial outlay the value increases with each use relative to dummies that can cost 500000 each in addition to writing off expensive vehicles Read more from Make Create Innovate Beyond Pistorius rise of the Cyberathletes Turn your kitchen into an orchestra with this magic device An end to all airport security lines ,0.4
CNN,tech, CNN  For the past 25 years the Web has opened up unprecedented possibilities for human communication But it has a dark side too  sometimes a very dark one Four out of 10 of Web users have been harassed online according to a survey released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center And about 73 of the Web users surveyed said theyve witnessed someone being harassed online The harshest forms of abuse  physical threats stalking and sexual harassment  are often reserved for women With responses from 2849 Web users the Pew study appears to be the most detailed of its kind looking at abusive behavior on the Web And it comes at a time when high profile cases of online abuse many of them targeting women have bubbled up from the Webs darker corners into the full light of public scrutiny Theres a pretty broad spectrum of these actions said Lee Rainie director of Internet Science and Technology research at the center And some of it is quite severe Online harassment breaks down into two categories according to Pew One is minor and one more severe The first includes things like namecalling and humiliation The second category targets a smaller segment of Web users and includes actions like stalking harassment over a long period of time and violent threats Its that sort of abuse that has made headlines in recent months Most prevalent has been GamerGate a movement that purports to be about defending videogaming culture and demanding responsible journalism from gaming websites But it quickly turned into a wave of vicious online attacks on journalists game developers and others  almost all of them women Several women have been subjected to violent rape threats detailed death threats hacking and doxxing in which documents with personal information are stolen and posted online At least two women have been forced to leave their homes after receiving specific threats of violence as a result of GamerGate In other highprofile incidents actor Zelda Williams left social media for several weeks in August after she received graphic abusive messages on Instagram and Twitter about the death of her father comedy legend Robin Williams And earlier this month actor Milla Jovovich announced on Twitter that shed stopped interacting with fans because she and her family had been threatened by a stalker from the site After contacting authorities I was told to absolutely stop talking to people I dont know on social forums she wrote Now that sucks for all the cool people I got to know on here but my family comes first and I cannot take any chances when it comes to them Its that sort of intense abuse that concerns Sara Baker coordinator of Take Back the Tech a campaign aimed at ending online violence against women In our work we see how the effects of online violence play out in the physical world all the time she said Whether or not such abuse results in physical violence  and it sometimes does  it always results in real harm According to the Pew study women experience the more severe types of abuse at disproportionately high levels when compared to men Among women age 1824 26 said theyd been stalked online and 25 said theyd been sexually harassed online Sponsored by members of womens groups from around the world Bakers organization recently gave a failing grade to Facebook Twitter and YouTube in a report saying the Webs largest socialmedia sites dont do enough to prevent abuse of women on their networks The Pew report suggests that social media is in fact where a lot of online harassment takes place Two out of three respondents who said theyd been harassed online said the most recent incident happened on a socialmedia website or app Other sites where people said they encountered harassment included the comments section of websites 22 online gaming 16 in email 16 on a discussion site such as Reddit 10 and on online dating sites or apps 6 Part of what makes online abuse so rampant is the anonymous nature of some Web forums Half the people who said theyve been harassed online said they didnt know their attacker But theres good news Just as the Web can be used to harass people it can be used to rally people against hurtful speech as well The Internet has expanded our ability to respond to such violence by finding community exchanging knowledge and building solidarity Baker said ,0.4

politely ask if its too late to call or to bike to a neighbors and ring his doorbell with no preconceived notions of his whereabouts You wont understand what its like to have to yell for your dad to come to the basement to settle the argument over whether a loofah is an animal or a plant or whether one could in theory set ones farts on fire The humor of the scene in Clueless where Cher and Dionne find each other in the high school hallway midcell phone conversation is probably lost on you You havent even seen Clueless We understand While we cant really imagine our adolescence playing out so heavily on pixelated screens were able to sympathize Thats why our pleas to you come from a place of wisdom and concern not of outdated notions or clinging vicelike to the past Really we older humans fully aware that you find 93 of us very to extremely annoying just dont want you to miss out on the vivid colors and poignant moments and slowburn stories of the next seven decades of your existence That and were terrified youre going to make us obsolete as soon as you hit the job market With that place of loving care in mind we give you our pleas Stop sexting By its broadest definition  sending explicit texts  about half of 18 to 24yearolds are doing it according to recent research from the University of Michigan And 28 of teenagers are texting fully nude photos of themselves according to another new report But to quote every mother of a teenager ever If everyone else jumped off a bridge would you do it too Seriously those 28 of people are dumb Theyre risking public humiliation should they later realize they want to own a company or run for office cough cough way too many male politicos cough and whats more their digital dalliances may meet the legal definition of child pornography Plus anyone teachers parents principals nearby can read a new text when it pops up on your smartphone  how mortified will you be when your boyfriend leaves his phone on the kitchen counter Play it safe and text in sweetsounding code words only Stop texting so much In 2010 the average teen was sending more than 3000 texts a month according to a study from Nielsen Three Thousand Thats 3000 moments when youve got your head ducked away from your surroundings fingers flailing tongue protruding from the lower right side of your mouth ever so slightly sending someone an obviously inane missive when you could be just interacting with the people or nature or cityscape or whatever around you It may feel natural but when youre around anyone over 25 in particular it comes off as very very rude Nobody enjoys being put on hold while the person 3 feet away from him or her taps all over a screen And when the tapping goes on for hours on a 45second loop in response to every ding of a response We promise if you text your friend back just once to say you cant talk right now no one will spontaneously implode If anything your buds callused finger pads will appreciate the muchneeded break Get over your fear of the phone Our parents couldnt believe how much time we spent on the phone in the early 2000s lounging on pink carpet and twirling the phones cord while parsing exactly what Darren meant by writing his and Janices initials as the points on the vector on the chalkboard in geometry class It probably seemed like a colossal waste of time moments we should have spent doing homework while wearing our dental headgear or something But voicetovoice communication is becoming a lost art and thats kind of a huge bummer Nowadays just 14 of teens say they talk daily with friends on a landline down from 30 in 2009 And 31 of teens say they never talk on a landline with friends Similarly 26 of teens say they talk daily with friends on their cell phone down from 38 of teens in 2009 according to the Pew Research Center And yes the amount of time that adults spend on the phone overall is probably declining too thanks to wondrous inventions such as Seamless and ZocDoc that prevent us from actually having to deal with other human beings But these are teens  gabby detailobsessed beings with the intricate social structure of a clan of bonobos who can spend seven hours together at school and still find material to cover in a fourhour phone conversation in the evening As weve said before the phone offers unparalleled access to the thoughts and feelings of the person

CNN,tech," Big data is everywhere 

Its created on farms factories and phone lines Its gathered in homes hospitals and warehouses Youre even contributing to data pools by reading this article on your mobile phone tablet or computer

Tech geeks have long discussed the potential of capturing the data we create to drive new efficiencies target services more directly and provide the complex calculations that can underpin exciting new technologies

According to author Rick Smolan big data is opening up a completely new dimension as information from mobile phones smart devices internet browsers ATM cards medical equipment desktop devices in the workplace and much more is gathered and analyzed This is affecting all manner of industries including health transportation and entertainment and is like watching the planet develop a nervous system Smolan says

Yet the sheer scale and complexity of these developments can often be lost in a neverending well of digits and decimal places

Did you know for example that the amount of data captured globally is estimated to reach 40 zettabytes more on which later by 2020 Sure that sounds like a big number but can you visualize what it actually means

No Its hardly surprising

Never fear weve put together seven simple graphs to highlight the monumental scale of data being created saved and processed and how this new field will come to define much of our lives in the future ",0.4

CNN,tech, Editors note Tomorrow Transformed explores innovative approaches and opportunities available in business and society through technology CNN  Ever since two men first laid a bet on two flies climbing up a cave wall gambling has struck at the core of the human condition the future is uncertain And while games of chance like dice and cards have been with us for centuries bar room wagers on matters of abstract speculation have often been lost to history disappearing as fast as the hot air that produced them Until now that is Novelty bets Thanks to websites like Longbetsorg and professional gaming sites like Paddy Power oddball bets on everything from the next pope to the life expectancy of the universe have a running book In the case of Longbetsorg they are the source of heated debate about the shape of the future These bets become an interesting tool to understand how we think about the future and even if we are really arguing about the right things said Alexander Rose director of the Long Now Foundation which backs the Long Bets project Betting exchanges that take novelty bets are nothing new  Paddy Power has a longrunning book on whether it will snow on Christmas Day and the next pope  but what makes Long Bets different is that it will only accept bets that advance our understanding of science and the future The winner also must donate their winnings to a charity of his choice Predicting the future So far Long Bets has taken longterm bets on whether drones will do battle as part of protests whether commercial flights will become pilotless and on the future of level of the worlds population People need to have an opposing argument and come to an agreement about the terms which actually turns out to be quite tricky Rose told CNN Someone will make a bet for instance that we will find extraterrestrial intelligence in the next 50 years then theres often a long philosophical discussion about what constitutes extraterrestrial intelligence or even life If we are talking about something as strange as that we dont know even if wed recognize it Often he said the parties have already bashed out the terms before they come to Long Bets Buffetts million dollar gamble In the case of its current highest profile bet  a million dollar bet between billionaire investor Warren Buffett and alternative investment group Protg Partners LLC  the two parties had already agreed the terms and had come to Long Bets to find a platform for the wager For a simple 50 fee anyone can make a prediction which then becomes a bet when someone takes up the challenge Nothing is too outlandish said Rose as long as it is well argued Often the results can be surprising We had one bet on the cost of energy five years into the future and the parties had used a very good source which was the report of the US Department of Energy he said However when it came time to adjudicate that bet it was found the government had pulled its report in the wake of the 74 billion Enron scandal in 2001 Enron had sufficiently skewed the energy market that the government had to unwind all the Enron trades out of its report to know the true cost of energy Rose said It was enough to flip the results of the bet Changing parameters Often the future is so unpredictable that the parameters of the debate change entirely Once such argument over whether the top 10 news stories would come from a blog or the Wall Street Journal was at the time surprisingly eclipsed by Wikipedia which was little known in 2002 We often find that its not so much whether someone was right or wrong but that what was being argued about was not even relevant Rose said Our main goal is that they create an interesting discussion about the future And we try to keep them away from celebrities and sports and more on arguments about the world Weve taken a few bets on sports but only when theyve been arguments about globalization Some have time scales so long that no one will ever collect on them Turing test A bet on whether the universe will keep expanding is unlikely ever to see a winner but a 20000 bet between Googles director of engineering Ray Kurzweil and Lotus Development founder Mitchell Kapor on artificial intelligence passing the Turing test comes up in 2029 To pass the test a machine or computer program must convince a human judge that it has a level of intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human being For mainstream punters meanwhile betting exchanges like Paddy Power have been taking novelty bets on everything from the next pope  more than 300000 450000 was placed after Pope Benedicts resignation  to parents betting on their sons becoming soccer World Cup football captains For us its really a fraction of our business less than 1 but its

CNN,tech, CNNs coverage of Web Summit in Dublin looks at how technology is changing the world CNN  Cybercrime costs the global economy an estimated 400 billion a year and as it grows in scale and sophistication law enforcement is having to do the same The US secret service helped prevent over 1 billion in fraud losses from cybercrime last year but it is up against skilled and organized international crime networks Ed Lowery a special agent at the US Secret Service Investigative Division has witnessed the criminals becoming increasingly sophisticated What weve seen develop over the last 10 to 15 years has been cartel behavior from individuals who  have developed a very very intricate criminal conspiracy or criminal consortium to commit crimes against assets of the United States exfiltrate data and then monetize that data around the world he says With hackers driven by a desire to make a fast buck or by political motives cybercrime and geopolitical tension often go hand in hand Whether it is China or Russia this is a major challenge for law enforcement Weve developed our expertise dealing with the East European Russianlanguage speaking cyber criminals says Lowery Over the course of the last decade its become very apparent that those individuals are the highest caliber the most prolific and probably the most damaging cyber criminals that are out there They are operating from many places where the US and international law enforcement does not have the same level of cooperation Watch The world of Hackonomics Rob Wainwright the director of European law enforcement agency Europol agrees Its fine for the US and Europe to work together but where a lot of cybercriminals work according to the community themselves is in other parts of the world where relations are much more tense with the West he says From its base in the Netherlands Europol is spearheading Europes cyber policing Its Cybercrime Center which opened in January 2013 aims to be a focal point for gathering data and developing tools to detect and prosecute cybercrime But much more needs to be done to tackle what has become a truly global problem according to Wainwright We need to up our game in terms of developing our digital forensics skills and certainly in terms of our international coordination he says Here at Europol weve succeeded in bringing together some of the major agencies across the globe including those in the United States to help us fight the biggest syndicates here but we need much greater international cooperation He adds Its not the first time of course that certain geopolitical circumstances can impede the way in which we can operate against criminal terrorist groups Thats a fact of life and its something we rely on our political leaders to deal with and its important we establish effective policetopolice channels of cooperation One way that policing can stay ahead is through consistency  one set of laws for everyone who uses the Internet Theres one other thing thats very important here and thats making sure that we have an uptodate and modern legislative framework that can allow us to fight criminals online in the same way that police fight criminals in the real world says Wainwright At the moment the legislation which allows us for example to detect the criminals online and allows us to decrypt the way in which theyre working is pretty deficient actually and certainly not aligned across different jurisdictions The challenge for policing isnt just at the macro level of international cooperation and legal frameworks a shortage of law enforcement officers with the right expertise in specialized cyber skills is still a problem This is obviously a unique skillset and it takes years to develop that skillset says Lowery But even in this world of hightech criminality matched by hightech policing oldfashioned investigative skills still have their part to play You need a very highly skilled cadre you still need to be able to develop evidence that will stand up in a court of law says Lowery We have to be sure that the individual that we are going to charge with that crime is absolutely the individual that committed the crime To do that takes a lot of oldschool detective work ,0.4

CNN,us, Editors note Loren Stanford shared her personal story in response to Brittany Maynard a 29yearold with an aggressive form of terminal brain cancer who took medication on Saturday to end her life A version of this piece first appeared on CNN iReport before Maynards death CNN  As a woman whose parents had cancer I have quite a few things to say about dying with dignity In 1984 my mother was diagnosed with stage four cancer of the ovaries uterus ureters small intestine bladder and kidney I was 8 She was given six months to live She refused to accept that and sought treatment in Tampa Florida Her condition improved until two years later when she was diagnosed with a brain tumor Her body was mangled from all the surgeries She had to wear an ostomy bag which I learned how to change because she was so weak She had to give up her nursing career She had to give up the fun things in life she enjoyed doing because her body couldnt take it She no longer had the quality of life that she deserved My father no longer physically attracted to her satisfied his physical needs with other women She was too sick to give him what he physically wanted In 1988 when she was well enough to be at home full time my parents separated and filed for divorce Cancer broke their foundation of love and trust The pain didnt stop there In 1992 she was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer and lost her breasts The only part she felt that still identified her as a woman was taken away The same year my father was diagnosed with brain cancer He died quickly three weeks after his diagnosis He simply collapsed and died My right to death with dignity at 29 For years she suffered Its hard watching your mother cry over the pain Its hard watching your mother break down piece by piece For years she fought a pain pill addiction She wanted to live so she could raise her children but in reality she spent her time in the hospitals operating rooms and doctors offices Her hopes took a horrible turn She suffered greatly for 17 years until 2001 when doctors found cancer on her spine She killed herself three days later The person who died was not my mother She was not the funny intelligent strong and fierce woman I knew The person who died was sad and had lost all hope My last memory of my mother is of this person Lying on the bed with a bottle of pills next to her and her eyes half open There is no justice in her lasting legacy She deserved better She deserved to go in a more dignified way Dying with dignity is more than just for the person who is dying Its for their loved ones If it meant my mother leaving this world the way she was in 1984 and not in 2001 then I would have supported her decision to do so My last memories of her should have been when she was still full of life on the outside even though she was dying on the inside She chose to take her life anyway except it was without her loved ones surrounding her saying their final words and making peace She died alone My sister found her Her death was treated like a crime scene because she killed herself at home There were no final words No goodbyes Nothing but the unimaginable guilt I carry with me every day because maybe I could have done something better for her The danger of assisted suicide laws Its not fair to throw stones at someone because they are through fighting No one person or disease is the same so its unfair to judge and compare Just because a person decides they are done does not make them weak or selfish Dying with dignity is a brave decision to make Its a decision that involves everyone and its one of the greatest gifts of love that person can give to those left behind When assisted suicide is not the answer Some say she beat cancer She was given six months to live but lived for 17 years But what kind of life was it Was it a life worth living She had so much to live for but at what cost What kind of life was it for her children I can tell you it was hard I was robbed of a childhood It was years of struggles and tears I would never wish what I had lived through on anyone No child should have to see their parents suffer so much Today Im happily married and have a 4yearold son I would never want him to watch either one of his parents suffer If a diagnosis is final and the options are there I just may choose to die with dignity and end my life on my terms If you have to explain death how hard is it to include dying before the suffering becomes too great Sure the experiences built me up to be strong and be able to handle some serious stress and in part made me the person I am today but I would gladly trade it back if my mother could have done things her way when she really should have Whats your reaction Stanford answered some of your questions in the comments below The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Loren Stanford ,0.4

CNN,us, CNN  Teams of investigators were out at daybreak Wednesday examining damage to NASAs Wallops Flight Facility after an unmanned rocket exploded shortly after launch on the Virginia coast NASA spokeswoman Rachel Kraft told CNN via email NASA is warning people in the area not to touch debris if they find any The Antares rocket built by NASA contractor Orbital Sciences Corp and its Cygnus cargo spacecraft suffered a catastrophic failure shortly after liftoff Tuesday evening the company said The crash caused a huge fire and scattered debris over a large area Orbital Sciences told CNN it would issue a statement on the status of the investigation later Wednesday The cargo module was carrying 5000 pounds of supplies and experiments meant for the International Space Station Officials say no one was injured or killed in the explosion but NASA says debris may be scattered around the launch area and some may have fallen into the ocean Rocket explodes in fireball What happened The public is being warned to forget about grabbing up rocket debris as souvenirs It had a lot of hazardous materials on board that people should not be looking for or wanting to collect souvenirs over said Frank Culbertson a former NASA astronaut and now a manager at Orbital Sciences Corp If you find anything that washes ashore in the local area or came down on your farm or in your yard  definitely do not touch it and keep people away from it There may be a possibility of debris washing up onto some of the beaches into some of the areas surrounding the island Bill Wrobel director of NASAs Wallops Flight Facility said a news conference Tuesday If people do find any debris theyre being urged to call NASA at 7578241295 NASA says teams started assessing damage to Wallops at daylight Wednesday Damage was contained to kind of the south end of Wallops Island Wrobel said Thats predominately where many of the pieces came down Opinion Rockets blow up we move on You see a big fireball The rocket lifted off at 622 pm ET but about six seconds after launch there was an explosion and the rocket fell to the ground engulfed in a huge fireball It seemed to be going perfectly when Ed Encina saw the launch brighten up the sky from his vantage point about 3 miles away And then all of a sudden you see a big fireball said Encina a Baltimore Sun reporter He recalled a loud boom that caused your feet to shake a little bit as well as flames enveloping a roughly 100yard area around the launchpad in a marshy area with brush CNN iReporter Dymetria Sellers who watched from a drawbridge because the NASA visitors station was full recalled a breathtakingly beautiful sight when the rocket ascended followed by mass confusion as flames lit up the early nighttime sky moments later About 30 seconds later we could hear and feel two booms reach us and it was apparent the rocket had exploded she said Did you witness the rocket explosion Please share your images Mark Kelly a former NASA astronaut said such a colossal fire was to be expected after the launch failure It takes a lot of propellant to take a spacecraft of that size moving 25 times the speed of sound Kelly told CNN explaining how fast the rocket should have gone on its way to the space station So when it fails its usually pretty catastrophic Orbital Sciences will lead the investigation into the explosion NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration will assist What we know so far is pretty much what everybody saw on the video Culbertson said The ascent stopped there was some lets say disassembly of the first stage and then it fell to Earth  We dont really have any early indications of exactly what might have failed and we need some time to loo,0.4
CNN,us, Editors note In celebration of International Day of the Girl October 11 and Ada Lovelace Day October 14 Leading Women is devoting the month of October to women and girls in STEM science technology engineering and math CNN  Just one in seven engineers are female only 27 of all computer science jobs are held by women and women have seen no employment growth in STEM jobs since 2000 reports Forbes Women who work in the fields of science technology engineering and math and those who campaign for higher numbers of women in these fields think they have some solutions to this growing problem 1 The toys and games that young girls play with mold their educational and career interests they create dreams of future careers says Andrea Guendelman cofounder of Developher Extensive research shows that certain toys and games can help young children develop the spatial logic and other analytical skills critical to science technology engineering and math A huge part of the reason women are not entering these fields and huge part of the solution starts at the very beginning 2 Introduce girls early to role models of other women In STEM suggests Regina Agyare founder of Soronko Solutions These women will mentor them and introduce them to STEM through games and practical learning experiences 3 Its important to engage girls in STEM at an early age and keep them interested adds Patty L Fagin PhD Head of School at Stuart Country Day School of the Sacred Heart Girls start out as strong in math and science as boys but lose interest along the way we call this the leaky pipeline Grow the pipeline keep girls engaged and well increase the number of women in STEM Create opportunities for success and safe environments in which to fail Theyll learn to persevere and develop a growth mindset so critical to success in STEM fields  instead of this is hard I cant do it they will believe I can try another way Girls want to make a difference so give them handson realworld problemsolving activities to show STEM is relevant and fun Expose girls to the different areas of STEM and provide women mentors for girls and young women so they in turn will mentor other girls 4 Theres no magic recipe for getting girls into STEM but we know early and positive exposure makes an impact Karen Horting CEO and Executive Director at the Society of Women Engineers told CNN Our Invent it Built it program Oct 25 in Los Angeles will expose girls in the sixth to eighth grade to the creative collaborate nature of a rewarding career in engineering Registration continues through Oct 11 and additionally provides educators and parents with the tools they need to nurture the future engineers in their lives 5 Start them young is Michelle Sun Founder and CEO of First Code Academys advice STEM fields are often thought of as a career path for the boys globally and no less common in Asia We observe brothers in a family are more likely to be enrolled to our kids coding classes However the amazing thing we found with students from 8  11 years old is that our female students come to our programs with minimal preconception of what programming is about They approached it with much enthusiasm and confidence just as any other hobbies or subjects By starting them young we provide them a chance to experience the STEM field first hand 6 I believe one on one mentoring programs with accomplished female STEM professionals will help bring girls in to the STEM field says Adeola Shasanya who recently cofounded AfroTech Girls and works at the Lagos State Electricity Board as an Electrical Engineering and Renewables Consultant Fun technical workshops could also help spark a STEM interest for girls I believe work shadowing a female stemist in a typical work environment could enlighten the girls on what work would be like as a STEMist 7 Haiyan Zhang Innovation Director at Lift London Microsoft Studios believes confidence is key Insatiable curiosity and the self confidence to make change in the world  two qualities that are key to instil in the female innovators of the future Science technology engineering and mathematics become the tools with which to explore curiosity and to create change 8 Women are the future of technology and todays technology is fun and cool says Weili Dai President and Cofounder of Marvell Technology Group Its not just about developing nerdy stuff its about turning technology into fashionable and userfriendly smart solutions A womans natural talent is design and the look and feel and making these things fit into our lifestyles I believe by embracing STEM and leveraging inherent strength of women  the sense of responsibility passion compassion and pride we dedicate to family and community  and applying it to business can make women the X factor in the new era of global growth and prosperity for the Smart Life and Smart Lifestyle 9 Time and again I hear from women who chose their STEM career because they were inspired by a successful woman who proved it could be done adds Suw CharmanAnderson Founder of Ada Lovelace Day Role models are incredibly important both to girls and to women and we need to show girls just how exciting fulfilling and enjoyable a career in STEM can be We must prove that there is a path for them to tread by telling the stories past and present of the women whove built invented discovered and explained the world around us but who so often go unmentioned 10To get more girls in STEM lets go for collective action says Julie Kantor Chief Partnership Officer at Million Women Mentors Of 368000 high school girls who want to pursue STEM only 4 said they had a mentor encouraging them Commit to mentoring a girl or young woman in STEM skills Or offer an internship with a designated mentor at your company Ladies and gentlemen lets get a million STEM mentors by 2018 Read 12 inspirational quotes from women scientists Relive Twitter chat as it happened How can we get girls into STEM Quiz10

CNN,us, CNN  Car safety testing has come a long way since the days of dropping cadavers down unused elevator shafts in the 1930s That we enjoy greater peace of mind on the road  with fatal accidents in the US at historic lows  is largely due to the evolution of crash test dummies Vehicle manufacturers must prove their safety with dummies before they can be legally sold in the US and Europe and these unsung heroes have developed into extraordinarily sophisticated tools for collecting data and assessing risk The newest dummies can have over 130 channels of information says Chris O Connor CEO of Humanetics the worlds leading producer of dummies So the amount of data is up four or five times what it could years ago Humanetics work with insurance and academic institutions to analyze the everincreasing data This allows them to establish and prioritize the most common injuries but also the most common victims Obese people are 78 more likely to die in a crash says O Connor The reason is the way we get fat We get fat in our middle range And we get out of position in a typical seat To accommodate the increasing numbers of overweight drivers Humanetics are developing an obese dummy One prototype has already been produced that weighs 273 pounds with a body mass index of 35 The analytics also reveal that risk of a serious injury increases by 20 in 50yearold drivers by 40 at 80 and steadily higher thereafter Replicating age in a dummy is an ongoing challenge but the company hope to have a prototype by 2015 Humanetics are also rolling out their next generation THOR Test device for Human Occupant Restraint for median range occupants with the most advanced sensitivity yet The idea of these new dummies that they start to measure new types of load such as shoulder loads they interact with restraints better says Dr Joel Stitzel director of the Center for Injury Biomechanics They have more measurement capabilities so they can do a better job of predicting injury But Stitzel believes the timehonored crash test dummy could be challenged by a new concept The way the industry is going is more towards computational modelling THOR is the future of dummy development but auto manufacturers are looking to develop virtual scenarios they can run on computerswhich allow them to look at more specific anatomy It allows manufacturers to see things that dummies cant tell them and they can more easily modify virtual models such as adding subcutaneous fat to simulate larger people Such systems are already being tested in Europe While the new model would require a significant initial outlay the value increases with each use relative to dummies that can cost 500000 each in addition to writing off expensive vehicles Read more from Make Create Innovate Beyond Pistorius rise of the Cyberathletes Turn your kitchen into an orchestra with this magic device An end to all airport security lines ,0.4

CNN,us, Orange California CNN  Ian Chung is nestled in darkness Born just 24 weeks into gestation he weighs scarcely more than a pound He can hear the faint sounds of the outside world mingling with the soothing sound of his mothers voice His spindly arms and legs shake as he lets out a warble Oh my love coos his mother Julie Chung 31 Youre going to be OK Julies hands descend  one landing lightly on Ians chest while the other pushes against his jerking legs She is using touch and light pressure to simulate for her premature son her own womb A few moments later Ian stops crying When he was born he was so tiny said Chung It was like Oh wow can a baby even survive outside the womb this early Medical advances are improving outcomes for even the tiniest babies Experts say fewer than 1 are born in the micro preemie category at the hospital where Ian is being treated Childrens Hospital of Orange County in California that means born before 28 weeks or born weighing less than 22 pounds Survival rates among micro preemies have been improving said Mindy Morris a neonatal nurse practitioner at Childrens Hospital So they may survive to discharge But then growing up as children they have a lot of complications Doctors and nurses at a specialized unit at Childrens Hospital have implemented a system they say is dramatically reducing disability and infection rates among this rare preemie population Aptly named the Small Baby Unit the staff work under the cover of darkness and quiet in a separate wing of the hospital Here stimulation is kept to a minimum speaking is only done in hushed voices The overall effect is one of relative calm an attempt to mimic what babies would experience if they were still safely tucked in utero We try to keep it low sound low lights so that it is as close to the womb as we can get said Morris coordinator of the Extremely Low Birth Weight Program at Childrens Hospital We try to minimize the intrusion to them In 2009 before the Small Baby Unit was up and running 45 of babies were discharged with chronic lung disease In 2012 after the unit had been operating for three years the rate was down to 27 Infection rates from 2009 to 2012 dipped from 41 to 15 and feeding weight and head circumference have also improved Dr Kristi Watterberg chairwoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on the fetus and newborn said that developing processes to treat extremely low birthweight babies is  broadly speaking  a good thing But since Childrens Hospitals data are selfreflexive she questions what exactly is contributing to the units success When someone starts focusing on something it tends to trend better said Watterberg What made it happen We dont know Watterberg said that some elements of what is being done at Childrens Hospital including various forms of touch therapy can be beneficial to premature infants A large study published in 2004 found 21 to 48 greater weight gain among infants undergoing moderate massage therapy they also were discharged sooner from the hospital Other studies suggest that specific types of massage therapy stimulate production of growth hormones and promote bone development At the Small Baby Unit parents act as therapists and partners with the staff so they are engaged fully with their childs progress Studies show that mothers who massage their infants experience decreased depression and anxiety It can hurt to be touched Chung is learning about the thin line between stimulating and overstimulating her son For preemies it can hurt to be touched because their skin isnt ready for it explained Karin Mitchell a developmental therapist working with Chung Mitchell grabs Chungs hand Let me show you on your hand she said pressing on Chungs palm to show her how firmly to touch Ian Its not heavy but its also not superlight Remember when he was inside the womb there was amniotic fluid and there was a feeling of that moving across every skin cell of his body Mitchell said Thats what helps babies know Where do I start and where do I stop When babies are born early like Ian they dont have that option so now they have to learn their body in the midst of air Its a lot different Soon Ian will lie  tubes and all  skintoskin on his mothers chest for an hour or more something referred to as kangaroo care Painful medical interventions like intubation extubation and blood draws are performed while a baby is skintoskin with a parent whenever possible In those situations touch is thought to mitigate pain Kangarooing as mothers here refer to it also helps with bonding and regulating things like respiration and sleep among babies For mothers it may stimulate breast milk production It calms me when hes kangarooing with me and I notice hes more calm said Chung She pauses as tears roll down her face Its nice to know that those things help him You cling to those little things that can ease things for him Ians care here is in stark contrast to what he got during his first few days of life in a traditional NICU at another local hospital There according to his parents the lights and noise were blaring This unit is a laser focus on this very specific patient population I think that is what makes this so unique said Dr Kushal Bhakta medical director of the Extremely Low Birth Weight Program at Childrens Hospital Other places Ive worked you will have a tiny premature baby next to an older child who has a heart condition next to another child who may be crying he continued So theres  a lot of other stimuli to this little tiny preemie and its not done purposely Its just the layout of whatever unit theyre in Watterberg of the American Academy of Pediatrics said it is important to strike a balance adding that theories and approaches regarding noise in the ICU are constantly evolving We used to think it should be quiet so when these babies came into the world too soon wed turn off the lights and make it quiet said Watterberg a professor of pediatrics and neonatology at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine Turns out babies were hearing a fair amount of noise in utero and that maybe if its too quiet they are not hearing the kind of language they need She cites recent research that suggests too little sound could interfere with a babys acquisition of speech and language and that exposure to speech can enhance brain development in babies Similarly she said too much darkness could be counterproductive to a babys development since in utero a baby would be exposed to a stream of information from its mother reflecting her own changing circadian rhythms We know that what happens in the ICU affects babies long term said Watterberg So Im pleased that this group is working on it but the information we have is always in process Numbers  In the Small Baby Unit numbers mean a lot When Ian was born they went something like this 47 chance hed survive and if he did survive only a 31 chance he would escape serious neurodevelopmental problems Chung and her husband Ryan Chun,0.4
CNN,us, CNN  What started as an expose of the harassment women face in public has turned into fodder for death and rape threats against the woman in the viral video There are people whove said a lot of things but Im not reading what they are saying Shoshana Roberts told CNNs Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night We hit a nerve Roberts didnt say a word as she walked through the streets of Manhattan for 10 hours for the video She didnt have to How should men approach women Over 100 passersby spoke up with catcalls and phrases such as God bless you mami Damn and Hey look it there My nonverbal cues were saying Dont talk to me No eye contact No friendly demeanor she said But they were ignoring my nonverbal cues Accurate depiction Roberts said the video is an accurate depiction of what she faces daily For instance there was a time when her grandfather died and someone told me that they liked the way I looked It is all day long It is every day she said Thats a typical day It doesnt matter what you wear Where are the white men in the catcalling video The 10 hours of footage was edited down to a 156 public service announcement for the antistreet harassment group Hollaback It was shot by filmmaker Rob Bliss who was wearing a hidden camera in his backpack I have multiple experiences of sexual assault which is why I wanted to be involved in this project Roberts said in a separate interview with HLN Scary feeling Perhaps the most nerveracking part of the video was when a man started walking alongside Roberts and continued following her for five minutes I have been doing martial arts since I was nine and I have a black belt in tae kwon do  and I am scared Roberts told Cooper The video has been viewed more than 12 million times on YouTube Despite numerous threats of violence against Roberts many have been supportive ShoshanaBinya thank you for participating in that hollaback video too many women go through the same thing Andrea_Misho said on Twitter ShoshanaBinya thank you for participating in that hollaback video too many women go through the same thing It needs to stop Street harassment disproportionately impacts women people of color LGBTQ individuals and young people Hollaback says on its website Although the degree to which Shoshana gets harassed is shocking the reality is that the harassment that people of color and LGBTQ individuals face is oftentimes more severe and more likely to escalate into violence the group said Roberts said shes perplexed by why so many people harass when there is seldom a good outcome We dont put up with harassment in schools at work or at home so why should we on the street httpstcohfHLNKUDCP I dont know what they expect people to do she said I mean this is happening to so many women and my story is not unique It needs to stop she added We can change hearts and minds CNNs Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report ,0.4

CNN,us, CNN  The first indication that something was wrong was a phone call from his daughters Denver area school to let Assad Ibrahim know that she had not come to class He dialed her cell And she answered But officials say she didnt tell him that she was on her way to Syria to join ISIS She was just late for class thats all Ibrahims daughter told him on Friday according to the Arapahoe County Sheriffs Office which filed a runaway report The American girl of Sudanese descent also kept quiet about her two girlfriends Americans of Somali descent who were flying with her to Turkey by way of Germany Two more girls sisters Those two had told their father Ali Farah that they were going to the library But when Farah got home from work a visitor came calling according to the documents Apparently it was Ibrahim Farah should check to see if his daughters passports were missing the visitor told him  just like his daughters passport was Sure enough they were gone along with 2000 in cash The two families called the FBI They said they thought the girls were on their way to Turkey The agency put out a notice on their passports German authorities intercepted the trio ages 15 15 and 17 at Frankfurt airport and put them on a plane back to the United States where they were greeted by FBI agents The three girls were questioned and released Two US officials say they had planned to join militants with ISIS the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria A former jihadist speaks out Out of the blue The girls parents say they had no idea their children planned to travel None of them had ever run away before Their disappearance hit them out of the blue the way other ISIS related incidents are popping up in the Western world Two more turned up in tandem with the girls runaway attempt On Monday a radical convert to Islam in Canada ran down two soldiers in his car killing one of them Martin Rouleau Couture 25 then led police on a chase before his car rolled into a ditch in the town of SaintJeansurRichelieu southeast of Montreal He exited the car and police shot him dead Back in July Couture too had tried to join foreign jihad and Canadian police arrested him on his way to Turkey But they could not charge him and had to let him go And this week a video turned up of a 17yearold Australian boy standing with ISIS fighters and threatening to behead Western leaders including President Obama then fly the ISIS flag over the White House Colorado teen pleads guilty in plan to join ISIS ISIS draw ISIS has for an antiWestern organization been surprisingly attractive to young recruits from the West as well as to some young women More than 100 of the foreign fighters have come from the United States according to intelligence estimates hundreds more from Europe which is geographically closer to the fight Every week five more people from the UK alone join ISIS a British police commissioner said Tuesday And thats a conservative estimate We know that over 500 British nationals traveled to join the conflict said Sir Bernard HoganHowe from the Metropolitan Police Five a week doesnt sound much but when you realize there are 50 weeks in a year 250 more would be 50 more than we think have gone already he said To put things into perspective though thousands more come from the Middle East and Africa More than 3000 have joined from Tunisia Sense of belonging Its more than just a radical interpretation of Islam that is drawing teens to the extremely bloodthirsty militant group a former CIA officer says Theyre often times searching for an identity because what the jihadis are actually pushing is a specific narrative which is Your people Muslims are being oppressed in this place called Syria your government is doing nothing were the only ones who are actually going to help you out said Aki Peritz Why dont you join the fight Richard Barrett of The Soufan Group says many of the teens lack a sense of belonging where they live and they believe ISIS can give it to them The general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in Syria suggests camaraderie good morale and purposeful activity all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own selfesteem he says And ISIS constantly cranks the PR machine making expert use of slick videos and social media Echoing back West ISIS global digital reach has terror experts in the United States worried about security at home as well There are terrorist groups in Yemen and in Syria with stated ambitions of striking on American soil but another threat is more probable says counterterrorism expert Matt Olsen I would say the most likely types of attack is one of these homegrown violent extremists or lone offenders in the United States and with the rise of ISIS and the number of people going to Syriathe likelihood does go up Selfstyled attackers like the Boston Marathon bombers could be the result The use of the Internet makes terrorists more vulnerable to tracking but that has become more difficult since Edward Snowden revealed secret US surveillance programs Opinion What lures Americans to Syria fight Girls online activities In Denver the 17yearold girl was apparently the instigator of the trip having planned it for months two US officials said But all three researched the plan online visiting websites where extremists discuss how to get to Syria The online activity didnt set off any tripwires the FBI typically uses to flag possible jihadist sympathizers the officials said The FBI is combing all of their communications to see if anyone was helping them Their parents think ISIS was behind the trip Investigators are also not sure the girls had even worked out the final goal for their travel As was the case with the Canadian Couture the investigation into the travel will probably not lead to charges especially because the girls are minors the two US officials said On Monday Sheriffs Deputy Evan Driscoll visited the two girls of Somali descent in their home and had a conversation with them The girls explained that they stole the 2000 and their passports from their mother he wrote in the

CNN,us, Chapel Hill North Carolina CNN  For 18 years thousands of students at the prestigious University of North Carolina took fake paper classes and advisers funneled athletes into the program to keep them eligible according to a scathing independent report released Wednesday These counselors saw the paper classes and the artificially high grades they yielded as key to helping some studentathletes remain eligible Kenneth Wainstein wrote in his report He conducted an eightmonth investigation into the scandal which has plagued the university for nearly five years Four employees have been fired and five more disciplined because of their roles One other former employee had honorary status removed Chancellor Carol Folt said Wednesday Wainstein a partner with Cadwalader Wickersham  Taft is the former federal prosecutor hired by UNC to independently investigate the academic fraud brought to light in recent years In all the report estimates at least 3100 students took the paper classes but the figure very likely falls far short of the true number For the first time since the scandal first came to light five years ago UNC admitted that the wrongdoing went further than academics and involved its athletic programs Gerald Gurney president of the Drake Group whose mission is to defend academic integrity in higher education from the corrosive aspects of commercialized college sports said the findings should provide fodder for the NCAA to levy one of its most severe charges against UNC lack of institutional control I can safely say that the scope of the 20year UNC fraud scandal easily takes the prize for the largest and most nefarious scandal in the history of NCAA enforcement The depth and breadth of the scheme  involving counselors coaches academic administrators faculty athletic administrators etc  eclipses any previous case Gurney said By comparison in 2009 Florida State had an academic scandal that was considered huge Sixty athletes were involved a far cry from the numbers involved at UNC he said A stellar reputation comes crashing down UNC has long been a place where it was believed that athletics and academics went hand in hand It has enjoyed a stellar reputation producing basketball greats such as coach Dean Smith and player Michael Jordan Now that reputation has been stained According to the report one former head football coach John Bunting admitted to knowing of the paper classes and his successor Butch Davis also admitted some knowledge Current mens basketball coach Roy Williams is steadfast that he did not know Wainstein said The detailed 131page report is being shared with the NCAA and could have huge implications for the university UNC has won three national championships for college basketball  in 1993 2005 and 2009  that could be in jeopardy along with countless wins And it wasnt just the revenuegenerating sports that benefited The report says that athletes in a wide range of sports were involved and it notes a noticeable spike of enrollment of Olympicsport athletes between 2003 and 2005 UNC in January We failed students for years Report spreads the blame around For five years UNC has insisted the paper classes were the doing of one rogue professor the department chair of the AfricanAmerican studies program Julius Nyangoro Wainsteins report spread the blame much farther It also revealed that it was Nyangoros assistant Debbie Crowder who actually created the paper classes out of sympathy for athletes and other students who were not the best and the brightest Nyangoro went along with them when he figured them out Crowder was such a fan of UNC sports particularly basketball that she would sometimes miss work after a loss the report says It was wellknown on campus that Crowder was a lax grader and gave high grades without regard for content Wainstein said emphasizing that she never gave a grade unless a student submitted a paper and did not change grades that were already given Wainstein did find that five counselors actively used paper classes calling them GPA boosters and that at least two counselors one in football suggested to Crowder the grade an athlete needed to receive to be able to continue to play Nyangoro was more hands off He had initially held legitimate independent studies classes Wainstein said but was accused of being an ass by counselors who felt he was too hard on athletes Crowder then took it upon herself to create the first paper classes naming Nyangoro as the instructor even though she was managing all aspects of them Sending out paper topics giving grades and assigning no meeting times It is not clear whether Crowder ever got Nyangoros explicit approval to arrange these irregular independent studies It is clear however that he ultimately learned about these classes and acquiesced in them by taking no action to put a halt to them When Crowder announced she was retiring there was a spike in enrollment in the last year of her classes because football counselors urged student athletes to sign up Crowder actively tried to cover her activities according to the report Jan Boxill the former womens basketball academic adviser is also implicated in the report which says she suggested grades to Crowder and helped athletes write papers When the scandal was first reported on a much smaller scale Boxill came under fire for writing an email obtained by The News  Observer newspaper in Raleigh that suggested the removal of Crowders name from an internal report on the fraud Boxill who was also chairwoman of the faculty and director of the universitys center for ethics wrote that it would raise further NCAA issues the paper reported Its not known if she was one of the nine people disciplined for her role When CNN requested emails from Boxill and other staff members who were named in the Wainstein report the university did not respond Jim Woodall the Orange County District Attorney who had charged and then withdrew prosecution of Nyangoro told CNN today that it is very very unlikely any charges will come of the Wainstein revelations Though unethical and highly improper Woodall said there was nothing criminal about the actions of the staff involved in paper classes at UNC Nyangoro had been charged with fraud for accepting money for classes he didnt teach But that charge was dropped after Nyangoro cooperated with the Wainstein investigation UNC fake class scandal and NCAAs response wind their way to Washington A strategy to keep players eligible Bunting the former head football coach admitted that he knew of the paper classes and said Cynthia Reynolds the former director of football told him they were part of her strategy to keep players eligible Reynolds who is now an academic program coordinator at Cornell University in Ithaca New York was one of four employees who refused to cooperate with Wainsteins investigation The report shows that during Buntings years as head coach there was a steady rise of enrollment of football players in the paper classes Davis who succeeded Bunting as coach and was eventually fired in the wake of the scandal in 2011 also admitted to knowing there were easy classes Wainstein said Basketball coach Roy Williams maintained he had no knowledge of the fraud Wainstein said which was supported by a drop in enrollment in the suspect classes by basketball players during his tenure There were no findings regarding Smith the renowned coach who is ill with dementia For health reasons the Wainstein team was also unable to interview his longtime No 2 and eventual successor Bill Guthridge The report does say that Smiths longtime academic adviser the late Burgess McSwain and her successor Wayne Walden knew about the paper classes McSwain who died of cancer in 2004 was a very close friend to Crowder the report says During the Smith years 1961 to 1997 the report says there were 54 basketball players enrolled in paper classes although the paper classes started in the spring of 1993 the year of Smiths final championship A whistleblowers saga Many of the academicathletic staff who were named and implicated by Wainstein were also named by university learning specialist Mary Willingham who went public with detailed allegations about paper classes and who after an assault on her credibility by the university has since filed a whistleblower suit CNN interviewed Willingham in January about her years working with studentathletes She said that she had worked with dozens of athletes who came to UNC and were unable to read at an acceptable level with some of them reading on par with elementary schoolchildren She also said there were many members of the athletic staff who knew about the paper classes and her revelations contradicted what UNC had claimed for years  that Nyangoro acted alone in providing the paper classes Whistleblower in UNC paper class case files lawsuit Willingham said paper classes were openly discussed as a way to keep athletes eligible to play and former football player Michael McAdoo told CNN he was forced into majoring in AfricanAmerican studies the department at the heart of the paperclasses scandal Underpreparedness is reflected in emails from advisers particularly those from Boxill who suggested grades and at least once acknowledged that a paper was plagiarized Yes a D will be fine thats all she needs one email from Boxill to Crowder says I didnt look at the paper but figured it was a recycled one as well but I couldnt figure from where In another email Boxill wrote that one athlete was only taking two real courses Willingham and McAdoo who played at UNC for two years shared their reactions to the report on Wednesday I didnt need Wainstein to validate me because the truth is validation enough but I feel like what Ive said for the last five years is in the report Willingham said I gave Chancellor Folt credit she did a good job Willingham also said she believes it took so many years and six previous investigations because this is the flagship of the university system and of the state and to admit we did anything wrong was too difficult There is a level of arrogance here and thats part of the culture McAdoo said it was just crazy that Wainstein traced it back 18 years and he noted that people accused him of concocting his story two years ago For them to own up thats great but that doesnt help my situation said the free agent who was drafted and released by the NFLs Baltimore Ravens before signing with a Canadian Football League team last year An apology would be good for me or being able to enroll back in college he said I lost an education I lost trust in the school  someone I thought had my best interest I definitely lost out on two seasons of football which would have put me in a better situation than I am now Refused to help in investigation Folt would not say who was fired or being disciplined Wainstein however named those who refused to cooperate  Octavus Barnes academic counselor for football from 2002 to 2009  Carolyn Cannon associate dean and director of academic advising from 1999 to 2010 was the principal adviser for the mens basketball team  Cynthia Reynolds director of football from 2002 to 2010 was called a critical witness  Everett Withers interim head football coach in 2011 who is now at James Madison University Scandal has been unfolding for years The first hints of scandal began in 2010 with allegations that some athletes were having improper contact with agents As the university investigated it found academic irregularities and finally announced under pressure from The News  Observer that there were classes where little work was required For the next five years the UNC administration was on the defensive admitting only to allegations as they surfaced and never digging to the root of the problem CNN analysis Some college athletes play like adults read like fifthgraders Wainstein said he found no evidence that administrators tried to cover up anything He attributed the fiveyear delayed response to insufficient appreciation of the scale of the problem Six previous internally commissioned reports had stopped short of systemic accusations Folt said that when she took the job as chancellor in October 2013 she decided to hire Wainstein because there were still too many unanswered questions I wanted to be sure that we wouldnt have to do this again and again she said ,0.4

CNN,us, Watch San Francisco Shaken 25 Years After the Quake Sunday at 7 pm ET  CNN  It was rush hour on a Tuesday and Dorothy Otto was sitting in traffic in her Pontiac Bonneville on the lower level of the Cypress Freeway in Oakland California when the voice on the radio said Were having an earthquake Suddenly the concrete around her began to ripple There was a giant crash and a large heavy beam dropped on the front of her car crushing the engine barely missing her face The car dropped 20 feet and when it settled Ottos left foot was trapped The doubledecker freeway had collapsed pinning motorists in their cars Otto found a pen and decided to write a note to her husband just in case Jack earthquake hit while I was under concrete worst happened she wrote It collapsed on car Im alive just my left foot is stuck under the car Hope they dont kill me getting me out Love you lots good luck to us both  Firefighter Lorenzo Frediani was running out of time as he struggled to free Ottos foot and get her to safety Each aftershock lowered the upper deck bringing it closer to crushing Otto and Frediani Then Frediani was able to nudge the crushed dashboard just enough Otto was free Her section of the Cypress collapsed 20 minutes later That was October 17 1989 The magnitude 69 earthquake now called Loma Prieta killed 63 people 42 of them on the Cypress freeway The quake caused 10 billion in damage ultimately inspiring California and the rest of the region to reexamine their safety measures for earthquakes Nearby Oregon sits on a huge fault line that separates two of the Earths tectonic plates One plate lies beneath the Pacific Ocean off Oregons coast and it is being shoved beneath the North American continent according to Ian Madin a geologist and chief scientist at Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries Are earthquakes on the rise The fault line known as the Cascadia Subduction Zone could one day cause an even larger quake As the two plates collide Madin says the fault gets stuck eventually slipping when enough stress builds up to produce a great earthquake With ultraaccurate GPS Madin says scientists know that the collision is still going on because they can measure the movement Oregon actually moves about 1 inches every year typical for a region near a subduction zone These megaquakes can cause strong shaking over large areas for several minutes They can also lead to landslides tsunamis and widespread liquefaction turning soil to soup After the deadly 90magnitude quake and tsunami that struck Japan in March 2011 Oregon legislators commissioned a study on the impact a comparable quake could have on the state Madin was one of the authors of the Oregon Resilience Plan which is aimed at reducing risk and improving recovery for the next Cascadia earthquake and tsunami Oregon is not prepared for a megaquake and few areas are Madin says He says Japan is the most prepared and look at the results of their megaquake The 2011 earthquake and tsunami resulted in more than 15000 deaths Before 1974 there were no specific building requirements in Oregon to make sure structures were built to withstand major quakes and design codes have only been adequate for the megaquake since 1993 so many structures are not designed to resist such a large earthquake Madin says Earthquake fast facts On top of that we have a lot of mountainous terrain that is highly susceptible to landslides large areas that are susceptible to liquefaction and 300 miles of coast that will be inundated by tsunamis that will arrive within 15 to 20 minutes of the earthquake and may locally reach elevations of 100 feet above sea level he says It is these factors that led the Oregon Resilience Plan to conclude that in a worstcase scenario 10000 people could be killed and large areas of Oregon could be without transportation electricity water and sewer for several months to several years The damage could result in 30 billion in economic losses Madin says 30 billion is almost certainly an underestimate and death estimates could also be off Based on the study of geologic features that record prehistoric earthquakes scientists generally agree that there have been 42 megaquakes along the Cascadia fault in the last 10000 years with the most recent in January 1700 Using historic data scientists like Dr Chris Goldfinger a marine geologist and professor at Oregon State University can forecast the probability of another great quake,0.4

CNN,us, Lynchburg Virginia CNN  Cassandra Morton never became a household name like some of the other women Not like Morgan Harrington Or Hannah Graham Even for the people in the historically black Tinbridge Hill neighborhood of Lynchburg where sense of community and oral history thrive memories of Morton are hazy Wasnt she the girl whose body they found up on the mountain people ask Morton went missing on October 10 2009 Several weeks later a hiker discovered the 23yearolds decomposed body on Candlers Mountain near Camp Hydaway a retreat owned by Jerry Falwells Liberty University Lynchburg police and the Campbell County Sheriffs Office hunted for Mortons killer in vain A year after her death authorities admitted their leads had gone cold As the years wore on Mortons family learned to live without knowing who committed this heinous act Or why she was robbed of life Their hope of learning the truth diminished with time Until recently One night last month University of Virginia student Hannah Graham disappeared after going out with friends The arrest of a suspect in that case has prompted authorities to take another look at Mortons death and several other unsolved cases of women who were murdered raped or went missing Police have charged Jesse L Matthew Jr with abduction with the intent to defile in Grahams disappearance They said forensic evidence also links Matthew to at least two other cases the death of Morgan Harrington whose body was discovered in Albemarle County in 2010 and a 2005 rape of a 26yearold woman in Fairfax City Matthew was also accused of a 2002 rape at Liberty University in Lynchburg though charges were not pressed The Campbell County Sheriff s Office is investigating any possible connection between Matthew and Morton Sheriff Steve Hutcherson declined further comment on an ongoing investigation The result of all this has been that suddenly almost five years after her death Mortons face is all over the media again It has meant torture all over again for her mother Catherine Morton She again felt the kind of shock that jolted her when police showed up at her doorstep several days after Thanksgiving 2009 They showed her a photograph of the body She recognized her daughters moccasins and beige jacket They told her they had matched Cassandras dental records to the body that was discovered Catherine fell to the floor She hasnt been right ever since says her husband and Cassandras stepfather Rawleigh Myers Police seize cab of man linked to 2009 death Overshadowed by a damsel in distress Cassandra Mortons cremated remains rest in an urn her mother keeps by her bed Its a constant reminder of the daughter she lost a reminder that her killer remains unpunished Every morning Catherine Morton prays for her daughters soul She takes comfort in knowing that 250 people showed up at her daughters funeral at the Tree of Life Ministries a few blocks up the road from her rented duplex on Campbell Avenue She swallows eight or nine pills a day to treat her depression and hypertension Theres not much she can do about the anger that rises within Why did her daughters death not make national headlines like Graham or Harrington Why did no one from the state come to help her in her hour of grief and pain Mortons death was never big news And it was always overshadowed by news about Harrington who went missing six days after Morton vanished In fact when Mortons body was discovered some headlines wondered if it might be that of Harrington whose parents had been vocal from the first day about their daughters strange disappearance from a Metallica concert at the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville They appeared on television and created a website to seek justice for their daughter Theres been so much publicity about Morgan about Hannah Myers says He is blind in his left eye and suffers from high blood pressure He used to work for the school system then performed odd jobs here and there But these days he and Catherine Morton barely survive by collecting disability The Harringtons can afford a reward to find their daughters killer he says sitting on a small front porch cluttered with things Were poor and black Nobody cares His stepdaughter Myers says didnt fit the profile of missing women who make headlines Like Elizabeth Smart Laci Peterson and Natalee Holloway Or Harrington and Graham Its hard to deny that race has something to do with the fact that attractive young white women get vastly more coverage when they disappear says A Barton Hinkle an editorial writer at the Richmond TimesDispatch who wrote about the socalled Missing White Woman Syndrome in a recent column The Washington Posts Eugene Robinson first described the media fascination in a 2005 column in which he described Damsels in Distress A damsel must be white This requirement is nonnegotiable It helps if her frame is of dimensions that breathless cable television reporters can credibly describe as petite and it also helps if shes the kind of woman who wouldnt really mind being called petite a woman with a good deal of princess in her personality She must be attractive  also nonnegotiable Her economic status should be middle class or higher but an exception can be made in the case of wartime Put all this together and you get 247 coverage Robinson wrote The disappearance of a man or of a woman of color can generate a brief flurry but never the full damsel treatment Similar comments were made in Cleveland after the bodies of 11 black women were found in a house of horrors in 2009 In all their coverage sympathetic as it may be the Cleveland Plain Dealer never raises the bigger issue What made these women such easy targets was being black being women and being from the highly segregated and desperately poor east side of Cleveland Angie Schmitt founding editor of Rust Wire wrote a year after the bodies were discovered Nobody was going to tear up the city looking for a few black women from the east side with sketchy pasts Justice for everyone Morton grew up in and around Lynchburg one of three siblings Her parents separated and when Catherine Morton married Myers about 12 years ago he embraced her as his own Myers never had much contact with his own daughter from a previous relationship Cassandra filled that void He loved to hear her call him Daddy Myers adjusts the baseball cap hugging his head Relax it says God is in control But he is far from relaxed talking about Cassandra Catherine Morton decided she had had enough of journalists after Grahams case made the news She had agreed to speak with me but changed her mind She makes it clear shes upset her daughters name has been dredged up again She tells her husband to keep it short But Meyers wants to talk He wants to keep Cassandras memory alive At a vigil last year organized by Help Save The Next Girl a group started by Harringtons parents Myers spoke publicly about Cassandra She was loved he told the crowd among them the families of nine Virginia women whose cases remain unresolved Myers says his stepdaughter wasnt perfect She had fallen in and out of trouble moved from one home to another She was arrested in 2005 for theft The photo that was used in newspapers and television when she went missing was ironically a police mug shot She dabbled with drugs and men Meyers says She got pregnant and gave birth to two daughters She was supposed to check into a rehabilitation facility two days after she went missing She did not fit the picture of the allAmerican girl next door But that says her family doesnt mean she should go without justice Authorities have not said anything about the evidence they have on Matthew Cassandra Mortons family has no idea whether she Hannah Graham and Morgan Harrington are linked in some chilling way They know only this For the first time in years they harbor hope again of learning the truth however brutal that might be ,0.4

CNN,us, Editors note Brittany Maynard worked as a volunteer advocate for the nations leading endoflife choice organization Compassion and Choices She lived in Portland Oregon with her husband Dan Diaz and mother Debbie Ziegler Watch Brittany and her family tell her story at wwwthebrittanyfundorg The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author CNN  On New Years Day after months of suffering from debilitating headaches I learned that I had brain cancer I was 29 years old Id been married for just over a year My husband and I were trying for a family Our lives devolved into hospital stays doctor consultations and medical research Nine days after my initial diagnoses I had a partial craniotomy and a partial resection of my temporal lobe Both surgeries were an effort to stop the growth of my tumor In April I learned that not only had my tumor come back but it was more aggressive Doctors gave me a prognosis of six months to live Because my tumor is so large doctors prescribed full brain radiation I read about the side effects The hair on my scalp would have been singed off My scalp would be left covered with firstdegree burns My quality of life as I knew it would be gone After months of research my family and I reached a heartbreaking conclusion There is no treatment that would save my life and the recommended treatments would have destroyed the time I had left I considered passing away in hospice care at my San Francisco Bayarea home But even with palliative medication I could develop potentially morphineresistant pain and suffer personality changes and verbal cognitive and motor loss of virtually any kind Because the rest of my body is young and healthy I am likely to physically hang on for a long time even though cancer is eating my mind I probably would have suffered in hospice care for weeks or even months And my family would have had to watch that I did not want this nightmare scenario for my family so I started researching death with dignity It is an endoflife option for mentally competent terminally ill patients with a prognosis of six months or less to live It would enable me to use the medical practice of aid in dying I could request and receive a prescription from a physician for medication that I could selfingest to end my dying process if it becomes unbearable I quickly decided that death with dignity was the best option for me and my family We had to uproot from California to Oregon because Oregon is one of only five states where death with dignity is authorized I met the criteria for death with dignity in Oregon but establishing residency in the state to make use of the law required a monumental number of changes I had to find new physicians establish residency in Portland search for a new home obtain a new drivers license change my voter registration and enlist people to take care of our animals and my husband Dan had to take a leave of absence from his job The vast majority of families do not have the flexibility resources and time to make all these changes Ive had the medication for weeks I am not suicidal If I were I would have consumed that medication long ago I do not want to die But I am dying And I want to die on my own terms Brittany Maynard advocate for death with dignity dies I would not tell anyone else that he or she should choose death with dignity My question is Who has the right to tell me that I dont deserve this choice That I deserve to suffer for weeks or months in tremendous amounts of physical and emotional pain Why should anyone have the right to make that choice for me Opinion When assisted suicide is not the answer Now that Ive had the prescription filled and its in my possession I have experienced a tremendous sense of relief And if I decide to change my mind about taking the medication I will not take it Having this choice at the end of my life has become incredibly important It has given me a sense of peace during a tumultuous time that otherwise would be dominated by fear uncertainty and pain Now Im able to move forward in my remaining days or weeks I have on this beautiful Earth to seek joy and love and to spend time traveling to outdoor wonders of nature with those I love And I know that I have a safety net Dying young and on her own terms I plan to celebrate my husbands birthday on October 26 with him and our family Unless my condition improves dramatically I will look to pass soon thereafter I hope for the sake of my fellow American citizens that Ill never meet that this option is available to you If you ever find yourself walking a mile in my shoes I hope that you would at least be given the same choice and that no one tries to take it from you When my suffering becomes too great I can say to all those I love I love you come be by my side and come say goodbye as I pass into whatevers next I will die upstairs in my bedroom with my husband mother stepfather and best friend by my side and pass peacefully I cant imagine trying to rob anyone else of that choice Share your personal essays with CNN iReport Read CNNOpinions new Flipboard magazine Follow us on Twitter CNNOpinion Join us on

CNN,us, Editors note Kelly Wallace is CNNs digital correspondent and editoratlarge covering family career and life She is a mom of two girls Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter CNN  When news first broke about a month ago about enterovirus D68 also known as EVD68 with hundreds of children hospitalized across the United States with respiratory illnesses I definitely took notice I clicked on a few news stories like Im sure many other parents did especially since my girls ages 6 and 8 were back at school and school while wonderful can also be a petri dish for young people But then I must admit I kind of put the issue out of my mind worrying instead about homework the fall routine and whether my girls are getting enough sleep Their mom certainly isnt That was until I heard about a New Jersey 4yearold who died in his sleep September 24 It is the first death health officials are directly linking to the virus Tests have also shown EVD68 in four other people who have died but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the role the virus played in those deaths is unclear at this time As of Monday the CDC has confirmed 594 cases of enterovirus D68 in 43 states and the District of Columbia READ What parents should know about EVD68 When I put out a query to parents across the country on social media asking if they are growing more anxious about the virus many like Cecily Kellogg said they definitely are I am way more interested and worried about enterovirus than Ebola said Kellogg a mom of an 8yearold daughter in Philadelphia and host of the blog Uppercasewomancom  While my daughter is blessedly healthy as could be with completely healthy lungs and goes to a smaller school with fewer virus exposures I still worry particularly since I sadly do have unhealthy lungs and while this is not an adult virus I am still hyperaware Avital Norman Nathman whose son is 7 said her childs elementary school recently sent an email to parents letting them know a few students were home with a respiratory illness and one was hospitalized The school did not make it clear if any of the children had enterovirus she said But despite that alert she said shes not in the freak out camp about the illness READ Enterovirus My son was like a goldfish gasping for breath  In the large picture there are really only a small number of cases of the virus across the country but I think the media focus causes people to panic and worry about it said Norman Nathman editor of the motherhood anthology The Good Mother Myth and host of the blog The Mamafesto Its definitely a scary illness but Im not all that worried about my son contracting it Doctors urge parents to keep things in perspective First few people who contract EVD68 develop symptoms other than a runny nose and a cough said Dr Andi Shane associate professor of pediatrics and global health at Emory Universitys School of Medicine and Childrens Healthcare of Atlanta Secondly the impact of EVD68 is quite modest as compared to the flu said Dr Andrew Pavia chief of pediatric infectious diseases and epidemiologist for Primary Childrens Hospital which is part of Intermountain Healthcare in Utah Flu kills several hundred children in an average year said Pavia This is dramatically more than the impact of EVD68 but we are familiar with flu while EVD68 is something that seems new and noteworthy So who is most at risk It appears that children with asthma are more likely to develop significant symptoms than children without a history of breathing issues doctors said The most important sign that parents should be on the lookout for is trouble breathing READ Enterovirus D68 found in four patients who have died including 10yearold girl Children who may need medical attention may breathe fast use their neck or chest muscles to breath and feel as if they cannot catch their breath after coughing said Shane who is also the Marcus Professor of Hospital Epidemiology and Infection Control at Emory Children who may not be able to drink well may also require medical attention she added as well as any child who is not acting like his or herself Many parents are heading to the doctors office earlier than usual because of fears of enterovirus Said a parent on Twitter My child was sick last night At dr today just to rule it out Normally I would just keep close eye 4 a day Another concern for parents is figuring out when to keep children home from school to keep them safe Pavia said he would not let fears a child will get the virus guide that decision Many children will never catch it and most wont become seriously ill if they do he said Plus he said the dangers may be decreasing By this time in many cities the virus is on the wane so the risk is going down In fact many children have probably already been infected and are now immune but because the symptoms were not remarkable no one knew The only reason to keep a child home said Shane is if the child is sick or if school officials advise children to stay home because other children in the school are hospitalized READ CDC investigates kids limb paralysis  The best prevention is exactly what you likely tell your children every day They should wash their hands frequently and carefully especially after using the bathroom before eating and after they come into contact with people who have cold symptoms Pavia said There has been some speculation that hand sanitizers dont work with this virus and that may be partially true he added Enteroviruses are somewhat more resistant to alcoholbased sanitizers than another viruses he said so soap and water is the best first choice and hand sanitizers are a good backup if you cant wash your hands Doing something to wash your hands is better than doing nothing he said Norman Nathman said while she is not worried about her son getting the virus shes taking advantage of all the attention Its a good opportunity to do what we can to boost our childrens immune systems get flu shots and remind about best practices when it comes to hand washing etc Are you growing more concerned about enterovirus D68 Tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook ,0.4

CNN,us, Meet the progeny of the socalled genius sperm bank on This is Life with Lisa Ling The Genius Experiment Sunday October 12 10 pm ETPT only on CNN CNN  It sounds like the plot of a Hollywood movie An eccentric millionaire creates a sperm bank with donations from only extraordinary men  Nobel laureates an Olympic athlete and geniuses with offthechart IQs The mission To create a generation of smarter healthier more productive members of society But this was no movie plot This actually happened Robert K Graham  a businessman who made his fortune after inventing shatterproof eyeglasses  founded the Repository for Germinal Choice in 1980 It operated until 1999 two years after his death Graham was very clear about his motives He wanted to improve the human gene pool The better the human gene pool the better the individuals who will come out of it Graham said And the poorer the human gene pool the more useless and detrimental individuals will come out of it Not surprisingly the socalled Nobel Prize sperm bank attracted controversy and accusations that Graham was a racist resurrecting the ideas that gave rise to Nazi Germany  something he denied On Sunday some of the men and women who were born as a result of Grahams project reveal how their lives have evolved on this weeks episode of This is Life with Lisa Ling Here are some interesting facts about the Repository for Germinal Choice It didnt cost that much  Women who applied for Grahams genius sperm only had to come up a 50 application fee and 10 a month for storage and shipping costs according to a 1984 New York Times article on the sperm bank The moms didnt have to be geniuses They had to be married although there was an exception made for at least one single mother but the mothers did not have to take an IQ test or go through any genetic screening Donors were recruited on college campuses Julianna McKillop who worked for the repository from 1980 to 1985 recalls traveling up and down the West Coast visiting elite college campuses looking for sperm donors Id take the tanks of liquid nitrogen in Dr Grahams Cadillac and drive up to CalTech and talk to the students and professors she told Lisa Ling If someone was willing she provided him a cup and some private time Shed store the donation in the back of the Cadillac with the liquid nitrogen Can you imagine doing that It wasnt easy to get a donor theyd kind of go like Why are you in my office And I said Well you have some genetic material and theres some people out there that can use that they would like to have a child All the donors were white  While most of the donors remain anonymous Graham did acknowledge that they were all white according to David Plotz author of The Genius Factory The Curious History of the Nobel Prize Sperm Bank But Graham strongly denied that he was a racist or a Nazi We arent thinking of a superrace Graham said at a 1980 news conference according to Plotzs book We are thinking in terms of a few more creative intelligent people who otherwise might not be born The sperm bank produced some 215 children  and many lead quite ordinary lives today,0.4

CNN,us, CNN  Every so often a boy shows up to school at Garden Oaks Montessori in Houston wearing nail polish or a headband When that happens children  and sometimes parents  ask questions But Principal Lindsey Pollock is confident her staff knows what to do They have been trained to support children who deviate from gender norms whether its a boy in girls clothes or a child who was born a girl and wants to be called a boy And they know its school policy Diversity is a good thing We all benefit from the unique characteristics that we all have Pollock said Our goal is to build a culture of inclusivity and understanding and a mindset of being welcoming to everyone Across the country schools are adopting similar mantras for transgender and gender nonconforming children in their mission statements and policies Advocates say the efforts reflect growing support for research showing the negative effects of enforcing fixed ideas of what it means to be a boy or a girl on children especially in learning environments This is the reality in which we live Gender is a continuum not a box said Graciela SlesaranskyPoe dean of Arcadia Universitys School of Education in Pennsylvania Her experience with a gendernonconforming child led her to become a consultant who has helped schools across the country learn to accommodate children who are opening up about gender identity as early as kindergarten We need to be sure we dont create structures and artifices to reinforce binaries that limit and constrain the ways in which we behave and express ourselves The right to an education free of discrimination based on gender identity is protected by federal state and local laws The US Department of Education in April reaffirmed a 2010 declaration that Title IXs sex discrimination prohibition extends to claims of discrimination based on gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity Massachusetts and California are among the growing number of states with strong legal protections for transgender and gender nonconforming students At least 160 cities and have passed laws prohibiting gender identity discrimination according to advocacy group Gender Spectrum Wisconsins Madison Metropolitan School District is one of many districts to issue guidance to administrators for creating a welcoming environment for transgender and gender nonconforming students The efforts are not always welcomed by the community Opponents of California AB 1266 are working to get it on the ballot for veto referendum This week a Nebraska parent raised objections over training for Lincoln Public School staff about lesbian gay bisexual and transgender issues In an email to parents the mother cited handouts including one called 12 easy steps on the way to gender inclusiveness that recommended against gendered expressions such as boys and girls the Lincoln Journal Star reported The mother and school district did not respond to CNNs request for comment By sidelining academic teacher training and replacing it with social reengineering the LPS administration has placed a higher priority on social reformation than on education the mother said in an introductory speech prepared for an upcoming school board meeting according to documents obtained by the Journal Star Advocates say improving school climate and legal protections are important because transgender and gender nonconforming children are frequent targets of bullying A 2012 survey found that 42 of gender nonconforming students feel safe at school compared to 62 of their gender conforming counterparts More than 40 of students who participated in a 2005 National School Climate Survey felt unsafe at school because of their gender expression 26 said they were physically harassed the previous year because of their gender expression The work that we do is not to make schools safer just for transgender students but to make schools safe for everyone regardless of where they fall on the gender spectrum said Kim Westheimer director of the Human Rights Campaign Foundation Family Projects Welcoming Schools initiative The program helps schools such as Garden Oaks Montessori create an inclusive climate through staff training policy recommendations and bullying prevention approaches Creating a welcoming environment is an ongoing process that involves various stakeholders from the school community Here are some steps that educators parents and advocacy groups recommend for creating a gender inclusive school community 1 Dont separate children by gender When its time to work in groups experts recommend coming up with alternatives for separating children The first letters of their last names birthday months clothing colors or types of pets they own are just some ways to do it but many more exist Separating by categories other than gender helps children identify and build relationships based on common ground  or at the very least start conversations In other words it helps them learn to relate to others based on similarities and differences other than gender 2 Start the day with inclusive language and stick with it  Instead of saying good morning boys and girls experts recommend using broader language to convey a sense of equality and togetherness Again a variety of alternatives exist such good morning class or good morning everyone Using inclusive language throughout the day reinforces the idea that boys and girls are not limited by their biology to succeed in the same arenas said Rhonda Thomason with Welcoming Schools Often we imply that boys or girls are only good at specific things through the subtle and notsosubtle things we say or the activities we nudge them toward 3 Feature diversity in books posters and other workbooks Welcoming Schools Gender Spectrum and TransYouth Family Allies offer bibliographies and other resources for classroom materials featuring diversity in various forms A wide selection of childrens books feature transgender and gender expansive children Many more feature men and women in nonstereotypical roles of all races and sexual orientation the same goes for posters that hang in classrooms 4 Create a professional development plan to help educators Some schools devote several administrative prep days to familiarizing staff with issues surrounding transgender and gender variant children After all teachers set classroom tone through language and lesson plans They also can intervene in instances of bullying or namecalling and when appropriate use them as teachable moments In order to act experts say educators need to develop a shared understanding of gender identity and language to be able to communicate with students and parents But they need to know what to look for and they need to believe that they have the support of the school which leads to the next suggestion 5 Have strong policies to support transgender students Some schools may not know what do if a child who was referred to by male pronouns now uses female pronouns What does that mean in the classroom or on their transcript Policies should address how to handle names and pronouns bathroom use extracurricular activities student records and confidentiality said Westheimer with Welcoming Schools These issues can be complicated so best to consult an expert in your area or national organizations such as Welcoming Schools Gender Spectrum or TransYouth Family Allies 6 Engage the entire school community Each school approaches this differently One school in Maine sent a letter home to parents informing them that a secondgrader who identified as a girl the previous year would be recognized as a boy this year Others incorporate the discussion into class or schoolwide meetings The goal is the same to set community norms for whats expected and create a platform for people to ask questions ,0.4

CNN,us, CNN  New York is famous for its singular residents Loudmouthed taxi drivers Hirsute Brooklyn hipsters Upper East Side patrons of the arts Now the city is welcoming an unlikely new breed of denizen a newly discovered species of frog A team of scientists has identified the unique critter dubbed the Atlantic Coast leopard frog in the marshes of Staten Island  beside New York Harbor and not far from the Statue of Liberty The frogs habitat stretches from Connecticut to North Carolina but its the discovery of an exotic animal species in one of the worlds most densely populated urban areas that has scientists buzzing It is incredible and exciting that a new species of frog could be hiding in plain sight in New York City said Joanna Burger a biology professor at Rutgers University and a coauthor of a research paper about the frog published this week in the scientific journal PLOS One The finding confirms research done more than 75 years ago by Carl Kauffeld former director of the Staten Island Zoo who wrote many books about amphibians and was considered an authority on the subject Kauffeld published a paper in 1937 in which he claimed to have discovered the new frog species but his research was dismissed for lack of evidence Kauffeld died in 1974 at age 63 His cause was taken up six years ago by Rutgers doctoral candidate Jeremy Feinberg lead author of the new paper Feinberg and other researchers said they were able to employ modern technology to examine the genetics and mating calls of leopard frogs and determine that the amphibians in the wetlands of Staten Island were in fact distinct from two closely related other species inhabiting the northeast US We had the benefits of genetic testing and bioacoustic analysis that simply werent available to Kauffeld to prove that even though this frog might look like the two other leopard frogs in the area it was actually a third and completely separate species Feinberg said In giving the scientific name Rana kauffeldi to the new frog Feinberg and a team of seven other researchers chose to honor Kauffeld and his work After some discussion we agreed that it just seemed right to name the species after Carl Kauffeld Feinberg said We wanted to acknowledge his work and give credit where we believe it was due even though it was nearly 80 years after the fact Despite its trademark urban canyons of steel glass and concrete New York actually is home to a wide variety of animal life The 843 acres of Central Park for example contain raccoons and opossums many types of migratory birds and a rare species of centipede And of course lots and lots of pigeons No word on whether the Staten Island frog ever swims across the harbor to Manhattan for a little sightseeing But given the public fascination with the Bronx Zoo cobra that briefly escaped its enclosure in 2011 it may be only a matter of time before the new frog gets its own Twitter account ,0.4

CNN,crime, CNN  South African prosecutors will appeal the verdict and the sentence in the Oscar Pistorius case a spokesman for the countrys National Prosecuting Authority told CNN on Monday A judge sentenced Pistorius to five years in prison last week after finding the doubleamputee track star guilty of culpable homicide or negligent killing in the shooting death of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp Pistorius acknowledged shooting Steenkamp in February 2013 Prosecutors claim he wanted to kill her Pistorius said he mistook her for an intruder and her killing was a tragic accident The appeal doesnt necessarily mean either the verdict or the sentence against Pistorius will be thrown out said CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps And its even less likely he will be freed at the end of whats likely to be a sixmonth process she said Theres no real prospect of his acquittal out of this she said Prosecutors are arguing that Judge Thokozile Masipa misinterpreted a complex South African standard defining a technical form of intent that proved to be a central aspect of the case Phelps said As a result prosecutors argue he should not have been convicted on the culpable homicide charge chosen by the judge Prosecutors originally took Pistorius to trial on a murder charge In explaining her sentence Masipa concluded that Pistorius did not intend to kill Steenkamp But critics of the verdict have argued the judge didnt correctly apply the intent standard which is broader in South African law than what it typically means in casual conversation Phelps said In their appeal of the sentence prosecutors would have to prove the five years given by Masipa is shockingly inappropriate in light of sentencing guidelines and similar cases according to Phelps Prosecutor Gerrie Nel called for a minimum sentence of 10 years saying the negligence in Pistorius actions borders on intent If an appeals court finds that five years is shockingly inappropriate the court could set the sentence aside and issue a new one she said But appeals courts in South Africa are reluctant to get involved in sentencing decisions Phelps said Pistorius uncle Arnold Pistorius told CNNs Robyn Curnow We take note of the announcement made by the state The legal process must take its course CNNs Eliott C McLaughlin and Brent Swails contributed to this report,0.4

CNN,crime, Follow us at WorldSportCNN and like us on Facebook CNN  Should a convicted rapist who has served their time in prison be allowed to resume their old job What if that job was as a highprofile football player In the early hours of Friday Ched Evans was released from a British prison  a Category C facility for sex offenders  after serving half of a fiveyear sentence for raping a 19yearold girl in a hotel room A blackedout silver Mercedes 4x4 apparently whisked him out of sight of the waiting photographers before dawn had even broken In another life photographers had trained their lenses on the 25yearold Evans for very different reasons  he was the prized player of thirdflight English league club Sheffield United signed for 3 million 48 million in 2009 Three years later that privileged existence came to an abrupt end after the Wales international striker was found guilty of rape  a conviction he denies He might have done the time but not everyone believes Evans should be allowed to tie up his bootlaces and start scoring goals again with almost 150000 people signing a petition against his return to the League One team A lot of the backlash has been over the fact that hes not accepted his guilt despite having served his sentence lawyer and Football Association agent Shehneela Ahmed told CNN But where does it say that a convicted criminal who has served their time cannot go out to work Role model As an elite football player earning the sort of money most people can only dream of Evans does not have your average job The Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg who is also an MP in Sheffield said Evans position as a role model for young boys needed to be taken into consideration by his future employers He has done his time but I just dont believe that the owners of a football club can somehow wish away the fact that that has happened Clegg told LBC Radio You are taking on a role model particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on a football pitch in a team like that and he has committed a very serious crime Club statement With the media furore increasing Sheffield United took the unusual step Saturday of denying a report in an English newspaper that Evans has been offered a contract by them to play again An article in The Sun today that Sheffield United has offered a contract to former player Ched Evans is false and damaging to the club read a statement on its official website We have made a statement on this matter previously and the lack of credibility and substance from this latest media report does not warrant any expansion from previous comments apart from noting that we are continuing to deliberate on any long term decision about Ched Evans Polly Neate chief executive of charity Womens Aid asked what message would be sent out if Evans played for United again The club has a responsibility to look at who it is hiring in highprofile positions and consider whether a convicted rapist who continues to protest that hes done nothing wrong and whose case has attracted widespread victimblaming language is someone that they want to be representing their brand she told CNN Its important that high profile institutions take a stand about the seriousness of rape as a crime and do not in any way condone the blaming of victims of rape or participate in a culture which trivializes violence against women Playing fair Ahmed argued that much of the fury over Evans possible return to football was related to footballers relatively high earnings I think people are angry because normally a lot of the criminals who are sent to prison once theyve served their sentence in relation to a heinous crime have to start from scratch trying to get employment she explained But this is a young lad who has committed a crime never admitted his guilt and despite that he comes out of prison and walks into a job which is so well paid Evans was never sacked by the Sheffield club which instead allowed his contract to expire while he was in prison So far Evans has not revealed if he intends to return to football at all Though all eyes will be watching his next move closely Media scrutiny They will have to wait until next week when Evans has promised to make a very personal and profound statement by video on his website Natasha Evans girlfriend and the family never asked for this media intrusion but it was thrust upon them following events of that night in Rhyl where the incident took place coupled with an insatiable and hungry media society said Evans referring to the northern Welsh town All they have ever asked for is for the media to report fairly help raise the concerns that there are from the vast section of society about Cheds conviction and have a sensible debate He wasnt the only one apparently tormented by the media with Neate saying the victims life was made hell after being identified by Evans supporters Not only was the original trial covered extensively in the media but the victim was harassed and unlawfully identified by Ched Evans supporters and her life has been very badly affected she said He has shown no remorse and his former employer  Sheffield United  has not said anything to condemn the crime he committed What next Sheffield United boss Nigel Clough has said only that he has had talks with club officials about the possibility of Evans returning according to the BBC But as Ahmed argues If Sheffield United dont take him whats there to say another club wont sign him Whether its in the UK or abroad What impact could his return have on their brand Thats something Sheffield United is going to have to look into Ultimately Evans may have left jail but his conviction remains and his future remains uncertain ,0.4

CNN,crime, CNN  At five months pregnant Jennifer Cramblett and her samesex partner Amanda Zinkon learned that Cramblett had been inseminated with the wrong sperm and that the donor was of a different race Two years later Cramblett and Zinkon are moms to a mixed race AfricanAmerican girl named Payton whom they love unconditionally But even that bond hasnt been enough to protect them from the emotional and social challenges they admittedly were not prepared for There are things I dont feel I have the background to even know It is things we have to go out and research and talk to people and figure out how to do as simple as a daily chore of doing your hair Cramblett told CNN Last week Cramblett sued Midwest Sperm Bank with the goal to force them to change the policies that led to the mixup and to obtain the funds her family needs to receive ongoing counseling and relocate to a more diverse community The mixup Cramblett said her shock came when she called Midwest Sperm Bank in April 2012 to secure more vials for a second pregnancy When I called to order that sperm and the vials I asked them for donor 380 and they came back on the line and said I do believe we have sent you donor number 330 are you sure thats not what you asked for said Cramblett They came back on the line and then had asked me if I had requested an AfricanAmerican donor At that point I said no 380 was blondhaired blueeyed resembling my partner Amanda They said we believe 330 is an AfricanAmerican donor We can no longer talk to you anymore said Cramblett The mixup stemmed from Midwest Sperm Banks recordkeeping procedures according to a complaint filed in Circuit Court in Cook County Illinois where the companys main office is located The sperm banks records are kept manually inkonpaper not electronically according to the lawsuit To the person who sent Jennifer vials of sperm in September 2011 the number 380 looked like 330 the complaint stated CNN called Midwest Sperm Bank A woman who answered the phone and refused to identify herself said sorry we have absolutely no comment CNN also reached out to the sperm banks attorney Marc Groedel and received no response Attorney Scott Bakal listed on the complaint hung up the phone with a quick goodbye The basis of the lawsuit and why we are doing what we are doing is so that somebody is held accountable This isnt going to happen to anybody else said Cramblett Utah university investigates suspected sperm switch Lack of racial diversity in their town With the birth of Payton Cramblett and Zinkon were confronted with raising their mixed race child in Uniontown Ohio a rural community south of Akron that according to the last census is 98 white Cramblett suffers from stress and anxiety just thinking of Payton having to attend and allwhite school and being stigmatized or unrecognized I want my child to be raised around people that maybe look like her and unfortunately we are not going to get all of those assets there in Uniontown Ohio she said We want her to grow up in a community where she feels accepted feels like its normal to be who she is But in spite of their strong wish to relocate Cramblett and Zinkon dont have the financial means to do so Crambletts attorney Timothy Misny told CNN Uniontown is a wonderful town wonderful people but there are no biracial children and no mixed marriages We need to relocate Jennifer and her family to a town that offers that type of diverse culture Misny said And since the sperm bank is responsible for the mixup the bank should be held financially accountable said Misny We are asking they change policy so it never happens again Misny said The lawsuit also seeks compensation to receive the kind of counseling they will need going forward and also to relocate to an area that is more demographically in tune with their family he said At times she Cramblett feels that she is underwater She loves her child to death But what she needs is assistance in handling it properly Misny said Timelapse video reveals secret life of an embryo helps women conceive Cramblett received a refund from the bank for the insemination vials she purchased but the bank kept the payment for the insemination procedure In spite of the complicated legal means she has been forced to adopt Cramblett said her daughters future is whats really at stake Shes going to know what she is and where she came from and how all this happened Shes going to know that we love her unconditionally Everybody around her loves her So I think shes going to know why we did what we did 11 myths fertility doctors hear ,0.4
CNN,crime, CNN  In Alabama a recently fired man walks into a UPS facility hed worked at shoots dead two people then takes his own life In Oklahoma another man  also just after being laid off  allegedly heads to his former food processing plant beheads the first person he sees then attacks another In Illinois police say a man walks into his air traffic control center in the early morning starts a destructive fire then slices his own throat In all three instances all from this week seemingly safe workplaces transformed instantly into danger zones Why How might these or other cases of workplace violence have been prevented And are these events signs of a larger growing possibility of death in the average Americans place of employment  where many spend more waking hours on a given week than inside their own homes 3 dead in Alabama UPS shooting Air traffic control suspect warned of sabotage FBI probing past of Oklahoma beheading suspect  While every case is different a lot of work has been devoted to try to answer these questions and ideally prevent more such attacks from occurring Workplace violence isnt new The Occupational Safety and Health Administration FBI and US Bureau of Labor Statistics  the latter of which released a study on this topic earlier this month  have all studied it extensively providing statistics and guidelines about who is most at risk and what can be done about it Here are some of their key findings How many instances of workplace violence are homicides In 2013 397 fatal workplace injuries in the United States were classified as homicides which works out to 9 of all workplace deaths To put this in a little perspective the US population is nearly 320 million People are more likely to die in transportation accidents which accounts for about 40 of all workplace deaths falls or trips or after getting hit by an object or equipment than by homicide Fourfifths of the homicide victims died from gunshots which makes both the Oklahoma beheading and Illinois incident relative outliers Is the number increasing It doesnt look like it While the 2013 data is still preliminary and thus could go up or down workplace homicides decreased 16 compared to the previous year Suicides went up 8 yeartoyear Does it matter whether were talking about males or females Yes Homicide is the secondleading cause of death for women in the workplace right behind roadway accidents In 2013 22 of the 302 fatal work injuries to women were homicides compared to 8 for men The sample sizes are very different Men made up 93 of all workplace deaths with 4101 total last year What are risk factors for workplace violence Here are some things to keep in mind when it comes to the potential that someone is physically attacked while on the job according to the FBI  Is money exchanged Then theres a greater risk that someone will use violence to come and take it A convenience store clerk bank teller or pizza delivery man are some jobs that come to mind  Are volatile unstable people around Think of someone who works in a mental health facility or in law enforcement where their job partly involves dealing with people who might be prone to violent outbursts  Are services or care to people provided If so you may never know whether someone youre trying to help is on the edge  Is alcohol served A person who is drunk may not control him or herself  and could hurt someone in the process  Is it a late shiftIn a place with a high crime rate Both things could make it more likely youll be victimized especially by someone you dont know Thats because violent crime is more likely to occur then and in those places whether youre at work or not  Does a person work alone or in small groups This boils down to safety in numbers When you dont have people you trust around you watching your back you might be seen as a target by wrongdoers What jobs are most dangerous when it comes to workplace homicides The one profession that jumps out Taxi drivers According to OSHA they are more than 20 times more likely to be slain on the job than others Some jobs  such as construction worker farmer or truck driver  are more likely to die violently on the job in other ways besides homicide But there are certain occupations in which a higher percentage of workplace deaths are due to homicide according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  13 of top executives deaths the percentage is double for operations specialties managers  33 of business and financial operations occupations  36 of legal occupations  19 of health diagnosing and treating practitioners  31 of law enforcement workers  41 of food preparation and servingrelated occupations  with an even higher figure 48 for their supervisors  46 for sales and related occupations  66 for retail sales workers Who is likely to be the attacker It depends on the job and the situation An FBI report points out those responsible for nearly 80 of workplace homicides dont have anything to do with the workplace at all These may be people who use a gun while trying to rob a gas station or convenience store or who perhaps try to rob someone they see out working alone There are also instances in which ones personal life spills into their job The Department of Labor for instance notes 27 of all violent events in a workplace are tied to domestic violence And there are plenty of examples of customers patients or others lashing out  be it a nurse or a store clerk or a corrections officer On top of all this there are also those who inflict violence on their coworkers Violence in this category is no less or more dangerous than any other violent act the FBI notes But when the violence comes from an employee or someone close to an employee there is a much greater chance that some warning sign will have reached the employer in the form of observable behavior What are the warning signs Sometimes people snap Its hard to know everything thats going on in their minds in their private lives or outside of work that might lead to something Authorities say that people  both colleagues and supervisors  should keep their eyes open for things like  Actions and emotions Watch out if a person appears increasingly belligerent hypersensitive extremely disorganized or generally has changed his behavior noticeably  Personality conflicts Is someone angry at a coworker or boss If so how is he or she dealing with it Conversely one should also be mindful if a person seems to have become obsessed with a supervisor or coworker for better or worse  Onthejob disputes Is he or she upset about something that happened at work including how they might have been disciplined  Offthejob issues Another possibility is that an employee is having a tough time outside of work like going through a divorce or dealing with money problems  Talk of weaponsviolence If someone may be unstable itd be good to know if they have access to a gun or another weapon at work The same goes with if he or she has expressed a fascination with weapons violent themes or recent highprofile killings What can be done about it If youre worried tell someone  perhaps a supervisor internal security or law enforcement But theres more that can be done Companies might look at things like  Are workers overloaded or mistreated  Can management be improved  Do they have counseling available  Are people being reorganized or laid off In the latter case police may be called in before and as someone learns they are losing a job which is exactly the kind of thing that could set off a volatile person It is notable that all three people suspected of workplace violence this week  at the Alabama UPS facility Oklahoma food processing plant and Illinois air traffic control facility  had either been fired or told they were being transferred What are the costs of workplace violence The federal government doesnt bother to give any precise costs beyond saying it runs somewhere in the billions of dollars citing the many unseen as well as seen effects  from lost workers to public relations hits to the psychological toll on surviving workers But it does spell out some types of damage including

Cooper in the car Harris caused the boy cruel and excessive physical pain the cruelty to children charges allege The criminal attempt to commit a felony and dissemination of harmful materials charges are not related directly to Coopers death They involve allegations that Harris requested a nude photo of a minors genitalia and sent the same minor descriptions of sexual excitement and sexual conduct according to the indictment A Cobb County detective testified at an earlier probable cause hearing that while Cooper was in the car at his fathers workplace Harris was sexting with numerous women and sent one of them who was underage a photo of his erect penis Harris pleaded not guilty to murder and child cruelty charges in June Cobb County Chief Magistrate Frank Cox signed off on the charges stating Harris wouldve had to notice that the stench in the car was overwhelming when he got in it as he left work and drove it for some instance before stopping to check on the boy Charges filed in an indictment supersede the previous charges Harris has been held without bond since Coopers death this summer Authorities have painted Harris as a terrible father who after admittedly looking up online how hot a car needed to be to kill a child purposely strapped his son into his sweltering SUV to die His motivation The prosecutor has characterized Harris as an unfaithful husband who wanted a childless life Kilgore has argued his client tragically forgot his child in the car Friends described Harris as a doting dad not a malicious one who loved to show off his blond brighteyed boy and talked about him incessantly It all started simply enough Harris left home with Cooper in a rearfacing car seat in the back of his 2011 Hyundai Tucson then headed to his job as a Web developer for Atlantabased Home Depot after making a quick stop at a fastfood restaurant for breakfast But he didnt follow through on his routine of stopping to drop the boy off at daycare Instead according to a criminal warrant Harris drove to work and left Cooper strapped in his car seat He went back to his SUV during lunch put something in the car then returned to work All the while the vehicle got increasingly hotter with records showing the temperature topped 92 that day  which can make the heat inside a closed vehicle soar past 100 degrees quickly Sometime around 415 pm seven hours after hed arrived at work Harris got back into his Hyundai and left work Witnesses told police that soon thereafter they heard squealing tires as the vehicle came to a stop in a shopping center Cobb County Police Detective Phil Stoddard testified at the probable cause hearing that Harris got out of the car yelling Oh my God what have I done He then stood with a blank look going to the other side of his SUV to make a phone call after someone told him that his son needed CPR a witness told police according to Stoddard Witness Leonard Madden testified that upon leaving a restaurant he noticed Harris was distraught and crying He was hollering Madden testified recounting the father saying Oh my God Oh my God My son is dead Harris had to be physically restrained once it became clear Cooper wouldnt make it  at which time it was 88 degrees  according to police Leaving his son alone in the car wasnt the only thing Harris did that day authorities say While at work he messaged six women besides his wife and exchanged explicit texts with some of them  including the lewd photo that he sent to an underage female Stoddard testified Yet even after these allegations surfaced his wife Leanna Harris stood by her man She sat calmly through the probable cause hearing and at Coopers funeral flatly insisted she was absolutely not angry with her husband Ross is and was and will be if we have more children a wonderful father Leanna Harris said at the funeral in Tuscaloosa Alabama a gathering that her husband also addressed via phone from the Cobb County Jail Ross is a wonderful daddy and leader for our household Cooper meant the world to him Given the district attorneys comments Thursday about whether anybody else will be charged in connection with the case the attorney for Leanna Harris said he was surprised Reynolds was still contemplating charges I am surprised that the district attorney is still contemplating after almost three months of reviewing the evidence whether or not to charge my client if that is who he was referring to in his press conference attorney Lawrence Zimmerman said By now I would think they would have been able to make a final decision and clear her from

CNN,crime, CNN  With a ruined centuriesold castle looming up on the hill above the Slovakian village of Cachtice could easily take a starring role in a Gothic horror film However exactly 400 years ago on August 21 the horror was all too real as the life of the most prolific female mass murderer of all time  a noblewoman by the name of Countess Elizabeth Bathory  came to a grim end Its not an anniversary theyre likely to celebrate in Cachtice where Bathorys reign of terror still haunts locals but for some  me included  theres a strange fascination In the lovely Slovakian town of Trencin my friend Martin and I are joined by two guides Ivan Kralik and Peter Pastier who work in the local tourism office They drive us to the town of Cachtice 30 kilometers away recounting the story of the Blood Countess The macabre name came from her apparent tendency to bathe in the blood of her victims Shes said to have believed the blood of virgin girls would maintain her youthfullooking skin Bathorys life has been the subject of films books and online websites  and is thought by some to have influenced Bram Stokers 1897 novel Dracula  but seems to have been forgotten west of Vienna Highborn and unaccountable she was the absolute ruler of a patch of what is now Slovakia and with the help of three of her servants sadistically tortured to death between 100 and 650 girls Well never know the exact number MORE Beyond Prague  8 undiscovered European cities Missing daughters She was married to a nobleman Ferenc Nadasdy a Hungarian national hero of the wars against the Turks Although there were reported killings before his death in 1604 afterward she seems to have become totally unhinged She settled in Cachtice and more and more girls started disappearing from the surrounding villages It was said she eventually ran low of girls to satiate her habit and she began to lure victims of higher born families who began to notice their missing daughters By 1610 rumors of her horrible deeds had reached the Hungarian king who sent his second in command Palatine Georgy Thurzo to investigate In December 1610 Bathory was arrested along with three of her servants who were tortured and burned at the stake She wasnt put on trial but walledin at Cachtice Castle where she died on August 21 1614 Castle restoration Cachtice today is a welloff village with large houses sporting high hedges satellite dishes and topend SUVs parked in the driveways We could be anywhere in Central Europe but for a large wooden statue of Elizabeth Bathory in the main square A sign points us to the castle which stands 25 kilometers away in the middle of a thickly forested nature reserve Its a pleasant 40minute walk up the narrow stony path under oak beech and chestnut trees through mulberry bushes and wild strawberries The castle is a ruin but pictured alone against a blue sky looks majestic and aloof It reopened in June 2014 after a much needed twoyear restoration One tower collapsed in the 1980s leaving only two towers standing an eastern defensive tower with a chapel and a southfacing residential tower where Countess Bathory died Amazingly its still possible to walk around her living quarters the likely location of her imprisonment and death The roof has long disappeared but the wall shows the sign of a ceiling I reckoned its four meters 13 feet high in a fourbyfive meter room I shiver as I see the remnants of what looks like a brickedup window MORE Staking out Draculas castle in Romania Sense of shame What do the locals think of the Countess today The older generation seems ashamed of her There were some protests when Bathorys statue was erected in the square says 18yearold Adam Pisca who has a summer job as a castle guide The younger generation doesnt view the past so bad We know she murdered women but she is not important to us Before the castle reconstruction we had barbecues inside and camped in tents overnight Back in the village we step into the 14thcentury church of St Ladislav where Father Vladimir Ondas shows us around Elizabeth Bathory was buried here but no one has found her grave Her body was probably moved later to Nagyesced the Bathory ancestral seat in todays Hungary Father Vladimir has a surprise for us however He unlocks the Gothic chapel outside which boasts three painted wooden panels from Cachtice Castle They are the only items remaining from the castles interior decoration Next to the church theres a small but interesting museum with portraits of Elizabeth Bathory and the people in her life a reproduction of her clothes old castle gravures and photos as well as a range of heraldic insignia and local costumes But its the local wine coop we really want to see and not just for the wine The building stands on the site of the old Bathory manor house Its here that the Countess conducted most of her torture sessions Today only an external wall still stands but the original cellars that have seen so much pain and anguish are intact and are now used to store several wine barrels Jozef Carada one of the coop owners provides us with a tasting The wines are uniformly excellent Some bear a Bathory Blood label The brand was discontinued in 2010 but after customer pressure it was reintroduced in 2014 along with a special vintage celebrating the 400th anniversary of her death Its ruby red of course MORE 15

CNN,crime, Watch CNNs special series Deadly Fix this week on CNN Newsroom at 9 am and 2 pm ET Denver CNN  Cynthia Scudo is a portrait of an allAmerican mom of eight and grandmother of 18 who survived an extraordinary journey lasting a decade She became addicted to prescription painkillers and then to heroin Youd never guess it Trim petite with a bob and easy smile Scudo had enough energy to work fulltime and preside over a large family in Denver She had it all  until it crumbled Her dark secret about a taboo drug is not as isolated as it seems especially with the revelations of public figures whose early deaths involved heroin such as actor Philip Seymour Hoffman who overdosed on a cocktail of legal and illegal drugs Prescription drug abuse is now a health epidemic in America worse than crack in the 1980s and Scudos story is one example Her addiction to a handful of prescription drugs with OxyContin as first and foremost led to heroin because it gave her the same high at a cheaper price Both are opiates In the beginning it was a feelgood said Scudo 55 At the end it was black Scudo didnt shoot heroin Rather she smoked it using a straw tinfoil and a lighter to inhale a smaller than peasized pinch of black tar heroin She exhaled the smoke through a fan vent in the basement bathroom of her home sometimes at 2 am so her children wouldnt smell anything Theres such a stigma about heroin that its dirty and its IV users under the bridge and homeless people and that is so not the case Scudo said Heroin crosses all borders all socioeconomic groups Scudos addiction was far from unique The path from prescription drugs to heroin is well traveled according to Dr Patrick Fehling a psychiatrist at the University of Colorado Hospitals Center for Dependency Addiction and Rehabilitation That is very common I have a lot of patients that ask me Are prescription opioid painkillers gateway drugs towards heroin Fehling said Absolutely Scudos drug use while extreme shouldnt obscure one reality Prescription drug abuse is a massive problem in the United States Fehling said How it began For Scudo her addiction began  as they all do  innocently enough She sought relief from hip pain possibly caused by scarring from cesarean sections she had delivering several of her children Her thenhusband recommended a physician There was no physical therapy offered she said of the doctors visit The first reaction was lets give you some drugs He put her on OxyContin By the second week she was physically addicted She was popping so much of the painkiller and other drugs such as antianxiety Valium that they equated to a dosage for three men A second doctor reduced her prescription causing Scudo to experience withdrawal symptoms or become dopesick When you start withdrawing from opiates it focuses in your lower back and your legs and it is like somebody has clamped a vice on both sides of your hips and is just smashing you Hitting my back with a baseball bat would have been more comfortable Scudo said She was desperate for more OxyContin Some people are not addicts and can take drugs as prescribed she explained But for the few people who are addicts its a whole different ball game To feed her cravings Scudo leveraged her maternal authority She found drug dealers who were friends of her eldest children When you have eight children she said youre bound to know people It was so easy But it was also so expensive One OxyContin pill cost 80 on the street One OxyContin wouldnt last me at all she said I could never take just one OxyContin That wouldnt even keep the dopesick away So she turned to heroin Why Her fear of withdrawal was greater than her fear of the drug Living fearlessly Like OxyContin heroin was abundant on the street In Denver In the suburbs Once you bought from one dealer several more approached you she said She bought seven balloons  or seven grams  of heroin for 100 she said That kept her high for up to three days I would do some crazy stuff to get drugs she said Like 2 oclock in the morning Im making a run to downtown Denver Like picking up my grandkids in the car to go to a drug deal praying that I was not going to get busted No risk was too great Never did she think of what she had to lose Not once she explained Thats the addict in me After almost 10 years of heroin addiction she wondered how much her family knew Her children stopped bringing the grandchildren to visit her She pawned family heirlooms Her second marriage failed and she stole from her exhusband I know they knew that I was struggling but they didnt know how to help Im sure that they were scared to death for me she said and the sad part isI didnt care She fooled herself After all she was good at lying Her job was going well The bosses promoted her a few times Everything was manageable except when she got home from work at 4 pm and was in bed for the night at 430 pm I didnt want to think I didnt want to feel Actually I didnt care if I lived or died she said The only person she couldnt fool was her alcoholic mom in recovery who noticed Scudos weight loss and asked her Are you ready for help Scudo responded with an I got this mom I got it I went from heroin addict to PTA mom What the mirror told her The breaking point came one morning after taking a shower Scudo looked at herself in a fulllength mirror naked for the first time in six months I looked like an Auschwitz survivor she said I was a skeleton I had this lovely green glow going so I knew my liver was shutting down The skin was hanging literally hanging off my body And something about that moment when I saw myself triggered something in my head she said The next day her exhusband called her at work in a confrontation about a problem Scudo had enough She wanted to

CNN,crime, Editors note John C Jennings is president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author  CNN  On Monday a federal court struck down Alabamas medically unnecessary law that singles out doctors who provide abortions and requires them to secure admitting privileges at a local hospital The court called the justification for the law exceedingly weak As an obstetriciangynecologist I couldnt agree more This decision is an important win for American women and for the practice of medicine Let me be clear We all want women to receive safe medical care But these laws a number of states have adopted them do not make women safer In fact they have quite the opposite effect as they will make it harder for women to access medical care potentially forcing them to seek abortion services later in their pregnancy These laws also jeopardize womens safety by forcing qualified physicians to stop providing abortions for reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with medical safety That is why leading medical groups like the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association oppose them Whether a physician who provides abortions has hospital admitting privileges is not a reflection on the physicians ability to provide quality abortion care While hospital privileges in theory should be awarded based on physician competency they in fact are often denied for reasons unrelated to the physicians medical qualifications For example to obtain privileges hospitals often require physicians to admit a certain number of patients each year But doctors who provide abortions will likely never admit the minimum number of patients because complications are very very rare Heres what is important to remember Abortion is already extremely safe and for the vast majority of abortions hospitals do not need to play a role in the patients care Abortion has a more than 99 safety record with a less than 03 risk of complications that could merit hospital treatment More than 90 of abortions in the United States are performed in outpatient settings and almost all the complications that do arise can be treated on an outpatient basis Its one of the safest medical procedures performed in the United States today period In the exceedingly rare event of a complication womens health centers have procedures in place to ensure that a woman gets the care she needs Admitting privileges  or lack thereof  dont have any effect on a womans ability to receive emergency care if she needs it In our modern care delivery model emergency room physicians hospitalists and hospital staff are trained to identify and treat all these types of patient situations Even procedures with much higher rates of complication and mortality such as colonoscopy are not subject to these burdensome requirements because its clear that they are not needed to keep patients safe These baseless restrictions serve solely to prevent qualified competent physicians from providing safe abortion care to women who need it To put it simply there is no medical reason to treat abortion providers any differently than other medical professionals As the Alabama court found the law would have forced all but two health centers in the entire state to stop providing abortions A similar law in Mississippi would force the last remaining clinic in the state to shut its doors leaving women in the state with no place to safely end a pregnancy Similar requirements have devastated women and families in Texas and threaten to close clinics in Oklahoma Louisiana and Wisconsin These laws are clearly not motivated by womens safety but by making access to safe legal abortion difficult  even impossible Mondays court opinion recognizes that a woman is safest when she can make the decision about abortion with her family in consultation with her doctor free from political interference It clears one obstacle in the path of women  and their doctors  in Alabama In states across the nation legislators who truly care about womens safety would do well to work to eliminate unfounded restrictions to abortion instead of continuing to introduce them Read CNNOpinions new Flipboard magazine Follow us on Twitter CNNOpinion Join us on FacebookcomCNNOpinion ,0.4

CNN,crime, Editors note Mark OMara is a CNN legal analyst and a criminal defense attorney The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author CNN  In March single mother Shanesha Taylor destitute and effectively homeless was arrested on charges of leaving her children in her car during a 40minute job interview The children were unharmed but Taylor then faced two counts of thirddegree felony child abuse  charges that sparked outrage across the country It sparked outrage with me as well and Ive worked with Taylors attorney to help handle the media attention surrounding the case My involvement in the story opened my eyes to a number of cases where parents have been arrested for behavior that just a generation ago may have raised eyebrows but would certainly not have risen to the level of criminal charges For example In a split decision this month an appellate court in Florida upheld the conviction of Jovita Ibeagwa who served a year in jail for two counts of aggravated manslaughter of a child following the drowning deaths of her children aged 6 and 3 Ibeagwa left her children unsupervised while she went to work at her secondshift job During that time her children tragically drowned in a neighbors pool Debra Harrell a South Carolina mother found herself under arrest this month when a bystander discovered her 9yearold daughter playing in the park alone Harrell had been allowing the girl to play there while she worked at a McDonalds a mile and a half away Here are some more recent examples In North Carolina a mother was arrested after leaving her 5 and 11yearolds alone for 2 hours A Connecticut mother was arrested when her 7yearold who wasnt wearing a helmet suffered head injuries after falling off his scooter In Pennsylvania a mother died in jail while serving a 48hour sentence after she couldnt pay fines incurred for the truancy of some of her seven children In Ohio a father was arrested when his 8yearold gave the church bus the slip and played with neighborhood friends instead of going to youth group And then just this week a mother in Florida was arrested after allowing her 7yearold to walk half a mile to a neighborhood park The boy even had a cell phone to call home if he got into trouble Whats going on here From one perspective were criminalizing poverty Some of the parents I mentioned above clearly acted out of economic necessity In our postrecession economy good jobs are hard to come by and child care is expensive For lowwage earners child care costs can easily eclipse earning potential In Taylors case she had previously been offered a fulltime job but child care costs would have left her with less income than she was able to earn by picking up a few hours here and there A news report in the Harrell case quoted another parent who said I understand the mom may have been in a difficult situation not having someone to watch the child but at the same time youve got to find somebody It sounds as though she is suggesting that having some unqualified person to stay home alone with the daughter would somehow be better than letting her play in the park surrounded by other children and parents Im not a parent but I am a boardcertified family law attorney and I frequently deal with families facing difficult decisions The truth is that too many parents are finding themselves having to make a desperate choice between providing for their children and caring for their children Unless youve been put in that situation I dont think youre entitled to judge I grew up in Queens in the 60s  during a time when crime in New York was notoriously on the rise My father was a battalion chief for the New York Fire Department and he worked two other jobs to support our family My mother worked hard to keep my two sisters my two brothers and me in line She was an amazing mother but didnt always succeed in keeping us out of hot water We were allowed to play unsupervised in our neighborhood and sometimes we got in trouble But my mother knew we were with other neighborhood kids She knew other adults in our neighborhood kept tabs on us and would look out for us She expected that if we got into real trouble wed encounter a police officer and that officer would deliver us home  and it did happen from time to time Im concerned that in the average neighborhood today  where the crime rate is far lower than it was in the 1960s  adults are not looking out for neighborhood kids Instead of helping a youngster who may be in trouble theyre calling the cops And the police instead of bringing children home theyre handing them over to child services and arresting the parents Last week prosecutors offered Taylor a deal After she completes a parenting plan which includes six months of counseling they will drop the felony charges But Taylor now has to fight to regain custody of her children In South Carolina Harrell has been reunited with her daughter but still faces criminal prosecution and she lost her job as a result of the arrest In Florida Ibeagwa is out of jail now  after suffering the double tragedy of losing her children and enduring incarceration for her role in the misfortune Elsewhere other children are being taken from their parents and families are being torn apart I have to wonder if my mom who I think was a wonderful mother would face criminal charges if she were alive and raising children in todays world  if she raised them the way she raised my brothers and sisters and me  Read CNNOpinions new Flipboard magazine Follow us on Twitter CNNOpinion Join us on

CNN,crime, Editors note Brianne Gorod is appellate counsel at the Constitutional Accountability Center a progressive law firm and think tank Gorod is a former law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer and was an attorneyadviser in the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel She is one of the authors of friend of the court briefs the Constitutional Accountability Center filed on behalf of members of Congress and state legislatures responding to two challenges to the Affordable Care Act CNN  On Tuesday morning the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit killed a regulation that is key to making Obamacare work Its decision in Halbig v Burwell if it were the last word on the matter would have significant  and damaging  consequences for millions of Americans who purchase health insurance on exchanges established and run by the federal government Fortunately it wont be the last word on the matter And the decision issued later Tuesday by another federal appellate court  the 4th Circuit  in King v Burwell makes clear why The DC Circuits decision got basically everything wrong It misunderstood the text structure and purpose of the Affordable Care Act The Justice Department has already indicated that it will ask the entire DC Circuit to review the Halbig v Burwell decision and when it does it will no doubt reverse it These two cases are both part of what Judge Harry Edwards the dissenting judge in Halbig termed a notsoveiled attempt to gut the Affordable Care Act As the members of Congress who led the enactment of the law made clear in a friend of the court brief they submitted to both courts this year the fundamental purpose of the statute was to achieve universal health care coverage and the Internal Revenue Service providing tax credits that act as subsidies so low and middleincome Americans can pay for health care is central to doing so The plaintiffs in these challenges argue that these tax credits should not be available to people who buy insurance in the 36 states with exchanges operated by the federal government  that is who got their subsidized health coverage through HealthCaregov not a staterun exchange Its a position thats not only completely without legal merit  tortured and nonsensical according to one of the 4th Circuit judges  its also one that would critically undermine how Obamacare works What the Obamacare court decisions mean for you But rather than looking at the law as a whole and considering what it was attempting to accomplish the DC Circuit judges focused on one small provision of what is a long and complicated statute Edwards called the plaintiffs argument illogical when cast in the context of the statute as a whole Indeed the plaintiffs themselves appeared to recognize how flawed their argument based on the statutes language was and thus manufactured an explanation for why Congress would have written the statute to eliminate the tax credits on federally facilitated exchanges According to the plaintiffs Congress wanted to encourage the states to set up their own exchanges The only problem as Edwards noted is that the claim is nonsense made up out of whole cloth The legal reasoning in the majoritys opinion is so weak it is difficult to understand it as anything but a political decision And that is what makes particularly galling the judges professed reluctance to reach their conclusion These judges assert that their hands were tied by the limited role of judges in our democratic system In other words they imply their decision  which could have massive consequences for millions of Americans  was actually an exercise of judicial restraint Appeals courts differ on Obamacare Theres nothing restrained about misreading a laws text disregarding its structure and ignoring its purpose In fact it was the 4th Circuit judges who exercised true judicial restraint Two of those judges concluded that the statute was unclear and that they should therefore defer to the agencies charged with implementing the law  in this case the IRS which would provide the tax credit subsidies The other judge concluded that the statute is unambiguous but in the other direction and requires that tax credits be available on federally facilitated exchanges As those judges recognized where a law is unclear the proper role of a judge is generally to defer to a reasonable construction offered by the executive branch agencies charged with implementing the statute The judges in Halbig seemed so determined to undermine the Affordable Care Act that they ignored this bedrock legal principle Fortunately they wont have the last word on the subject Read CNNOpinions new Flipboard magazine Follow us on Twitter CNNOpinion Join us on FacebookcomCNNOpinion ,0.4

CNN,crime, Is ayahuasca a natural remedy for anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder or just another drug fad Lisa Ling goes inside an ayahuasca ceremony in the Amazon on this weeks episode of This Is Life With Lisa Ling Jungle Fix Sunday October 26 at 10 pm ETPT CNN  Kyle Nolan did his research  his mother made sure of that She didnt want her 18yearold son heading to the Amazon jungle at all  let alone without learning everything he could about the supposed medicine with the bizarre name that he insisted would help him turn his young life around I really tried to discourage him  I kept telling him over and over there are no easy answers in life Ingeborg Oswald said But she knew she couldnt stop him Overshadowed by his overachieving triplet brother and sister Oswald said Kyle was going through this teenage crisis not knowing what he wanted to do with his life He had dropped out of junior college and was living with his mother when he somehow discovered ayahuasca pronounced eyeuhWAHSkuh a psychedelic brew that some believe can help users achieve a higher state of consciousness He went online and started reading all these positive things about ayahuasca which is something I had never heard of before Oswald said Apparently theres a huge positive movement toward ayahuasca And he thought that that would help him maybe discover who he was His research led him to the Shimbre Shamanic Center in a remote corner of the Peruvian Amazon region Oswald said the centers website made its ayahuasca experience sound very individualized It wasnt cheap Kyle paid more than 2000 in cash to take part in the ritual Despite the promises of the centers website a very different experience awaited Kyle Nolan in Peru A death then a coverup Kyle arrived in Peru in August 2012 a rare overseas excursion for a young man who was more of a homebody than a world traveler He journeyed deep into Perus Amazon with hopes of experiencing a spiritual transformation On the third night of Kyles ayahuasca session he never returned from his hut Days later when he didnt arrive home Oswald called the Shimbre Shamanic Center and spoke to an interpreter for Shaman Mancoluto who led the centers ayahuasca sessions He told me Oh well Kyle just decided he wanted to leave he took off down the road and hes left Oswald said And I said I dont believe you My son would never ever do that So she and her daughter flew down to Peru to help local police search for Kyle For three to four days they searched hospitals and bars and talked to taxi drivers asking if anyone had seen Kyle No one ever saw him Oswald said So Oswald and her daughter returned home to northern California while the Peruvian police continued their investigation About a week later Oswald said she learned from her contact with the Shimbre center that the shaman admitted to police that he had lied about Kyle leaving the center They had found him dead outside under a bush Oswald said They panicked and covered him up and told everyone that he wasnt feeling well that he was in his cabin The shaman told authorities that he and two other men had buried Kyles body according to Oswald and Peruvian newspaper El Comercio They said they put him in a wheelbarrow took him about a mile down the road dug a pit buried him and burned all his belongings Oswald said She returned to Peru where she had to identify her sons body An autopsy in Peru was inconclusive The shaman whose real name is Jose Pieda and the two other men were arrested Pieda was eventually convicted of homicide and lying to authorities and sentenced to five years in prison according to local Peruvian media Kyles body was eventually brought back to California where Oswald said another autopsy also came up inconclusive and he was cremated According to El Comercio the shaman told police that Kyle Nolan took too much ayahuasca Theres no conclusive evidence of what killed Kyle Oswald said The only thing there is possibly out there is maybe the toxicology results but I cant get that unless I go back to Peru An unregulated drug Its still unclear how ayahuasca can kill someone Very little is known about ayahuasca and its effects and many shamanic centers including the Shimbre Shamanic Center require participants to cleanse their bodies for several months before taking ayahuasca  a regiment that Oswald said her son followed very closely Ethnobotanical organizations are trying to raise money to study ayahuasca and its medicinal qualities as well as create a health guide for tourists interested in traveling to shamanic centers in the Amazon Theres a growing concern that as more Western tourists head to the Amazon looking for a psychedelic experience more flybynight shamans will pop up looking to cash in on the boom There have been other reported deaths as well as reports of physical and sexual assaults Six things to know about ayahuasca Oswald admits she still struggles with grief and agreed to talk to CNN about her sons death because she hopes it might help warn young people like her son who are seeking ayahuasca treatment in the Amazon If youre going to do this you really really really need to research it and make sure wherever you find is properly supervised and theres medical supervision there she said And maybe even staying in the United States if you need to do it She remains suspicious about the whole ayahuasca tourism boom saying I just think its become a fad maybe its like the LSD of the 60s But she said she would support some sort of regulation of the ayahuasca tourism industry if it ensured that participants would be monitored by medical professionals I definitely think it needs to be monitored somehow Its a hallucinogenic drug  They call it a medicine but it is a hallucinogenic drug she said Obviously theres side effects to everything Anyone can have an adverse reaction to something You dont leave someone alone with a hallucinogenic drug in their system Oswald says shell probably return to Peru one day when shes ready She is not considering any further legal action because as she said I cant put myself in that position to continue hating someone I just have to try to get this

CNN,crime, CNN  The use of deadly force by two Utah police officers involved in the fatal shooting of a 22yearold man carrying a sword was reasonable the Utah County Attorney said Monday Darrien Hunt was killed in the city of Saratoga Springs in September Prosecutors had said Hunt had lunged at police officers with a samuraitype sword before he was shot But Hunts family has contested the official version of events saying that race played a role in his death and that he was shot from behind as he was running away Utah County Attorney Jeff Buhman said at a news conference Monday that after an investigation into the shooting no criminal prosecution would be brought against the two officers Cpl Matt Schauerhamer and Officer Nicholas Judson The two officers were placed on paid administrative leave while the shooting was investigated Responding to assertions that Hunt had been killed because he was black Buhman said he found there was absolutely no evidence that race was a factor in the shooting He described the deadly encounter which he said lasted a total of 37 seconds based on the accounts of the two police officers and two other people who witnessed events Official Sword unsheathed abruptly The initial interaction between Hunt and the police officers who had been dispatched in response to a report of a suspicious person carrying a sword in public began as a nonthreatening type of conversation Buhman said Hunt was calm and nonconfrontational other than the fact that he had sword in a public place he said The sword was in its sheath But as Hunt was speaking with the police officers he abruptly and without any apparent provocation withdrew the sword from its sheath and immediately swung or stabbed it toward least one of the officers Buhman said The police officers responded by firing a total of three shots at Hunt probably hitting him once or twice the investigation found Hunt then turned and ran still holding the sword Buhman said the officers belief that deadly force was necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury was reasonable given the fact that Mr Hunt was swinging or stabbing at them with a threefoot sword and was in close enough proximity to them that one of the officers physically retreated  and one jumped back  to avoid being hit by that sword blade More shots during chase The officers then gave chase during which time Schauerhamer who was nearer to Hunt fired more rounds one of which was probably the fatal shot that struck Hunt in the right side of his back Buhman said Schauerhamer told investigators that because Hunt was running toward a retail area where employees and customers were present he was worried he would hack the first person he saw according to the county attorney Buhman said he found the corporals actions reasonable given Hunts previous behavior the fact he was still carrying the sword his lack of response to a verbal command to stop and Schauerhamers belief that multiple people were at risk Hunt was shot a total of six times according to the investigation Family lawyers unanswered questions remain His family reportedly said they were unsatisfied with Buhmans findings Robert Sykes the attorney for Hunts mother and Karra Porter the attorney for his father said the decision left many unanswered questions was based on questionable grounds and that their clients intend to file a civil lawsuit against Saratoga Springs The Salt Lake Tribune reported There are some unmistakable facts that are not in dispute Sykes told the newspaper I reread the states autopsy this morning Every one of the six shots came from behind The county attorneys decision comes a week after the autopsy report by the medical examiner was concluded The report found that Hunt was shot six times including once in the back The other gunshot wounds were to his upper right arm and right forearm left upper arm and two wounds to the left hip The findings in the medical examiners autopsy followed an independent autopsy last month A lawyer for the Hunt family said the independent autopsy showed Hunt was shot six times from behind but did not release the document The family claims that Hunt was running away when he was shot by police Sword sharp enough to cut The Utah case has drawn some comparisons to the police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson Missouri although Brown was unarmed when he was shot Hunts mother has said she believes race played a role in her sons death They killed my son because hes black Susan Hunt told CNN affiliate KSL in September No white boy with a little sword would they shoot while hes running away She also said that the sword was purchased at a local Asian gift shop and that it could not actually cut anything Buhman disagreed with that assessment on Monday Its over threefeet long its metal the tip is sharp and the blade  maybe its not sharpened to Ginsu standards or chef standards  but its sharp enough to cut he said It is not dulled as you might expect a souvenirtype sword to be CNNs Mariano Castillo contributed to this report,0.4

CNN,crime, Washington CNN  The US Supreme Court on Monday searched desperately for ways it could avoid a sweeping ruling in what one justice called a tinderbox legal fight over perhaps the most vexing diplomatic issue  unrest in the Middle East Menachem Zivotofsky 12 and his family want the American citizens passport to say he was born in Jerusalem Israel But the US State Department ignoring a congressional law will not allow the boy to list his country of birth on the document only Jerusalem The Obama administration maintains a strict neutrality policy over the holy citys sovereignty Both Israelis and Palestinians claim Jerusalem as their capital but the international community does not recognize either position The Zivotofskys framed the case as a small gesture for a boy which does not implicate the US governments ongoing efforts to secure a binding lasting peace settlement for the troubled region Supreme Court to decide if boy can list Israel as passport birthplace At issue is a classic tug of war between the executive and legislative branches of government  specifically whether a federal law that explicitly directs the State Department how to record the birthplace of an American citizen on a passport impermissibly infringes on the presidents power to recognize a foreign sovereign More than 50000 Americans were born in Jerusalem since the law was passed in 2002 In a brisk hour of oral arguments the nine justices seemed especially torn about how to decide the case many looking for a way perhaps to rule narrowly Many on the bench were at odds over whether this mix of politics diplomacy and religion will result in de facto recognition of Israels unilateral sovereignty over Jerusalem You say that this isnt recognition Justice Anthony Kennedy told the Zivotofskys attorney So the ultimate conflict is not before us and therefore the governments policy which says that this is recognition should be given deference and it trumps Justice Antonin Scalia said Congress is entitled to do what it is authorized to do under the Constitution even when that contradicts with the views of the executive branch And as far as the passport issue the fact that the State Department doesnt like the fact that it makes the Palestinians angry is irrelevant Case heard during growing unrest in Jerusalem The debate comes during a week of unrest in Jerusalem with daily protests near sacred sites and fears of a third intifada or Palestinian uprising Temple Mount crisis fuels unrest in volatile Jerusalem The case could have broader implications over US foreign policy The justices raised ongoing debates over those born in Britishcontrolled Northern Ireland whether Taiwan should be recognized as independent of China and the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine over disputed territory including Crimea Jerusalems Old City is the heart of the region a holy symbol to the three major Abrahamic religions  Christianity Islam and Judaism That tiny area  just a third of one square mile  contains the Temple Mount Western Wall Church of the Holy Sepulcher Dome of the Rock and AlAqsa Mosque It has been destroyed twice  and attacked besieged and captured more than 100 times Canaanites Hebrews Arabs Greeks Romans Persians Crusaders Turks and the British have all laid claim to the land Its status today remains one the thorniest issues blocking a comprehensive Mideast peace agreement with both Israel and the Palestinian people claiming sovereignty During the 1948 war the western part of the city was annexed by the newly formed nation of Israel and the eastern part annexed by Jordan Israel then captured the eastern part during the 1967 SixDay War It considers East Jerusalem part of its undivided capital but most of the international community deems the annexations illegal and a part of Palestinian land The Israeli government is based there but no foreign embassies are The city is home to Ari and Naomi Zivotofsky The couple and their two oldest sons were born in the United States but the family migrated to Israel a decade ago and in October 2002 the youngest Menachem Binyamin was born Were very proud of the fact that he was born in Israel and that we live in Israel and its the modern state of Israel Ari Zivotofsky told CNN Religiously and historically thats very significant The father said his son  who has been at the center of this legal fight for 11 of his 12 years  frequently reminds his siblings he is the one Zivotofsky born in their current home The boy is preparing for his bar mitzvah Bushs signing statement Three weeks before Menachem was born Congress gave American citizens born in Jerusalem the individual discretion to ask that Israel be listed on passports and consular reports where it says Place of Birth President George W Bush signed the bill but issued an executive signing statement indicating he would not comply The law he said impermissibly interferes with the presidents constitutional authority to conduct the nations foreign affairs and to supervise the unitary executive branch The State Departments official Foreign Affairs Manual still reads For a person born in Jerusalem write Jerusalem as the place of birth in the passport Do not write Israel Jordan or West Bank for a person born within the current municipal borders of Jerusalem It is not the first time Congress and the White House have clashed over the region The American Embassy remains in Tel Aviv over US lawmakers objections Competition to speak among justices During Mondays oral arguments in the case Zivotofsky v Kerry there was much competition on the bench to speak Chief Justice John Roberts at one point had to referee and allow Kennedy with his seniority to go first You want us to say in our opinion that this is not a political declaration Kennedy asked attorney Alyza Lewin of the 12yearold congressional law When told that was true Well then Im not sure why that Congress passed it then Kennedy offered a compromise suggesting what a select number of US passports might say The place of birth on this Jerusalemborn citizens passport has been listed as Israel at the holders request This designation is neither an acknowledgment nor a declaration by the Department of State or the President of the United States that Jerusalem is within the borders of the State of Israel But Justice Elena Kagan  who along with Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor seemed most supportive of the administrations assertions  wondered if Congress then passed a law saying that hypothetical statement had to come off the passport could Congress do that Why is it that its OK for Congress to say something that hasnt happened meaning to say that someone born in Jerusalem is actually born in Israel Sotomayor added I mean they can selfidentify all they want but can they do that Representing the government Solicitor General Donald Verrilli framed the issue in larger terms saying the congressional law in effect would force the executive branch to issue official diplomatic communications that contradict the position of the United States Justice Samuel Alito asked But is that really true Could Congress pass a law saying that every passport issued to an American citizen must list the place of birth including country and that for this purpose the country is the nation that issued the birth certificate to that individual Could Congress do that Zivotofskys attorney Lewin concluded by saying granting the boys request would be a nonissue and have no longterm effect since the Jerusalem passports  by simply listing Israel would be indistinguishable from those who were born elsewhere in Israel This seems a particularly unfortunate week to be making this kind of Oh its no big deal argument said Kagan referring the recent violent protests in Jerusalem History suggests that everything is a big deal with respect to the status of Jerusalem And right now Jerusalem is a tinderbox because of issues about the status of and access to a particularly holy site there And so sort of everything matters doesnt it A ruling in the case is due by the spring ,0.4

CNN,world, CNN  As Faith Gonsalves walks through the dusty streets of a slum on the outskirts of New Delhi she passes pigs rummaging through piles of trash and colorful saris hanging out to dry In a nearby doorway a girl and a boy sit with furrowed brows The 26yearold is on her way to a makeshift classroom where she runs regular music workshops for the communitys children Once inside the expressions on the faces of her skinny pupils couldnt be more different than those worn by the pair outside The children sing their bright eyes fixed on Gonsalves as three musicians accompany them with a ukulele keyboard and rhythm eggs India is home to some of the richest but also some of the poorest people in the world The country has the sixthlargest population of billionaires worldwide and yet more than 300 million Indians or around a quarter of the population lives on 125 or less a day according to the World Bank The children who live in the lowincome communities of New Delhis sprawling metropolis have more worries than most  poverty malnutrition disease  but above all says Gonsalves they feel an overwhelming sense of powerlessness In 2008 Gonsalves founded Music Basti an arts education program that seeks to inspire New Delhis underprivileged children to share their dreams and aspirations through music and teaches them important life skills that they may not get from formal schooling Music is a really powerful way of communicating and its a really powerful equalizer she says It also brings with it a whole host of learning and developmental benefits  whether its learning math and rhythm learning language and singing or learning how to work together with other children Over the last six years the program has worked with at least 600 young people  children who Gonsalves says would never have a chance otherwise to hold a public platform or stand on a stage Her goal is to raise awareness of the importance of creative learning for childrens development especially for the socalled at risk children such as orphans abuse victims and beggars that Music Basti supports More than 200 musicians and artists have contributed to the program and yet persuading teachers to make a longterm commitment to working with these communities can be as challenging as raising funds Gonsalves says Music and arts are often relegated from the education system as much as the people we work with and the communities that live on the fringes of the city she says But attitudes in New Delhi are gradually changing and with them the lives of the children are transforming too The biggest positive change that we see in the children and the communities that we work in is  how learning music and performing music gives children a sense of achievement but also of confidence and that goes a huge way in many other aspects and areas of their lives Last year the students wrote and recorded an album and held a concert in the center of Delhi in front of 500 people Around 170 children are taking part in the program this year Music has played an important role in Gonsalves own life She grew up listening to her mother sing old folk songs and her brother is now a professional pianist Gonsalves was heavily involved in music at school and as a student at Delhi University Her deep belief in the transformative power of music is the source of her passion for the work she does now Seeing the program in action its always deeply encouraging and deeply motivating especially to see children enjoying the process of learning not being afraid by it she says But it also reminds me that we have a really long way to go in trying to take this model of education to many many more children in our city but also in our country ,0.4

years in office And tensions flared last week when the White House denied Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon meetings with Vice President Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry The administration tried to contain the fallout from Goldbergs story on Wednesday Alistair Baskey a spokesperson for the National Security Council said Obama and Netanyahu have forged an effective partnership and consult closely and frequently Still irritants have long tested the alliance between Washington and the Jewish state  over peace talks wars in Lebanon and Gaza settlements and Israeli military action in places like Iraq and Syria But the dislike between Netanyahu and Obama is particularly acute  and personal Goldberg lists a stunning string of insults he has heard officials fire off at Netanyahu over the years including recalcitrant myopic reactionary obtuse blustering pompous and Aspergery OPINION USIsrael quarrel doesnt point to a divorce The NetanyahuObama relationship has played out in a series of awkward photoops anonymous quotes in US and Israeli media and tense body language White House officials were apoplectic in 2011 when Netanyahu lectured Obama in the Oval Office about the history of peace talks and warned him not to fall prey to illusions The same year Obama was caught on an open mic telling thenFrench president Nicolas Sarkozy Youre fed up with him I have to deal with him every day The White House for all its official praise for the unshakeable bonds between the US and Israel blames what it sees as Netanyahus intransigence over Jewish settlement policy and his playing to a domestic political gallery for the collapse of John Kerrys peace drive with the Palestinians Key officials fumed at Netanyahus open backing for Republican Mitt Romney during Obamas reelection campaign and over what they see as interference in American politics through his strong ties to hawks in Congress But the roots of the animosity lie deeper  in sharply differing perceptions of the threat posed by Iran  an issue coming to a head with a deadline looming for a deal between Tehran and world powers next month For Obama the Iranian nuclear challenge is another crisis to be managed and a test case of his doctrine that the United States should be prepared to talk to its enemies But people familiar with Netanyahus worldview say he believes history has handed him the role of delivering the Jewish state from an existential threat posed by Tehrans nuclear ambitions Israel worries that the agreement that emerges will leave Iran as a nuclear threshold state with the materials and expertise to quickly break out and build a nuclear weapon I fervently hope that under your leadership that will not happen Netanyahu told Obama in a White House photoop this month READ US PalestinianAmerican minor killed by Israeli military The Obama administration says the kind of perfect deal envisioned by Israel which would strip Iran of centrifuges and nuclear infrastructure is not realistic and says its goal is to ensure that Tehran does not have a nuclear bomb The disagreement is likely to provoke a new political showdown over Iran in Congress where a bipartisan coalition is mulling a number of steps including further sanctions which the White House warns could scupper a deal and lead to war While the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu deteriorates it does not so far appear to be harming the fundamental relationship between their two nations That has not always been the case in the past In 1981 the Reagan administration instructed UN ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick to back a resolution criticizing Israel for an air attack on an Iraqi nuclear reactor Relations became so frayed between President George HW Bush and the administration of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir that his secretary of state James Baker told lawmakers that if Israel wanted to talk peace it should call the White House switchboard Personal relations may be fraught now with Netanyahu but Obama has never suggested watering down or delaying mostly military US aid to Israel which amounts to 3 billion a year Indeed the Obama administration asked Congress for hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for the Iron Dome antimissile system which shielded Israel from Hamas rockets during the latest Gaza war this summer Senior officials from both sides also say privately that the security relationship between the allies has never been better Miller said that Obamas spats with Netanyahu will cause hurt feelings But what do they amount to It is confined and contained to a soap operalike exchange that never leads to anything of consequence he said What this latest soap opera may amount to for the White House is an unwelcome new political row with Congress over its Israel policy  just as it is gearing up for a fight over Iran When the president discusses Israel and Iran it is sometimes hard to tell who he thinks is Americas friend and who he thinks is Americas enemy House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it was a bit rich to get a lecture by Boehner on salty language He insisted that the remarks by the official about Netanyahu did not represent the view of the administration but pledged to continue to air differences with Israel on illegitimate building That will all but ensure another bitter spat with Netanyahu soon ,0.4

CNN,world, Every week Inside Africa takes its viewers on a journey across Africa exploring the true diversity and depth of different cultures countries and regions CNN  For the past five years Austriabased art historian and photographer Alfred Weidinger has traveled across Africa in search of royalty His photography project The Last Kings of Africa is his attempt to capture the beauty and mystique of the regions most powerful sovereigns So far he has photographed 220 tribal kings and leaders with many more to go I have a sort of deadline for myself  which is the end of next year Its not a question of the amount of kings or tribal leaders its just a question of countries says Weidinger who plans to visit Africa twice this year and six times in 2015 There are still countries I definitely want to visit for example Swaziland and the southern part of Sudan Weidingers photographic endeavors in Africa started in 1979 but the cumbersome equipment typical to that era quickly deterred the photographer Fast forward 30 years and a chance commission for a photographic exhibition sparked a longterm project where the lavish culture of Africas dynasties became the focus Weidinger had no definitive guide to help him locate all of Africas royals and tribal leaders Armed with only two cameras and a tripod his trips were mostly improvised There is no list there is nothing So you just have to go there says Weidinger The most important thing is to find one king  when I have one he will guide me to the others The power game There are hundreds of African monarchies scattered across the continent but in most cases governing power is either restricted or nonexistent Government officials however know its best not to overlook the influence these leaders possess over their respective communities Some countries put the monarch system back into the constitution they give power to the traditional leaders says Weidinger In effect some politicians use it because every tribal leader represents an ethnic group and they still follow the words of the elder or the tribal leader they are not following what is happening with the politicians in the capital According to Richard Dowden the director of The Royal African Society and author of Africa Authored States Ordinary Miracles monarchies tend to flourish in countries with a weak government structure or lacking a formal constitution In these instances tribal leaders and monarchs are deemed more trustworthy for getting things done Niger Sierra Leone Burkina Faso and Benin are a few examples of countries with a strong tribal leaders some of whom occasionally tackle government functions Fon Ndofoa Zofoa III for example makes official decisions over hereditary land in his chiefdom in Babungo in Cameroon Other leaders like Sarauniya Aljima the queen of Lougou in Niger weigh in on private matters such as marriage When there is a marriage to be made in the village monarchs will return to sort it out In these sorts of matters they do retain a lot of power says Dowden Weidinger found that one thing that seems to distinguish African monarchs from royals across the globe is a keen religious focus Their power is in spirituality and this makes African monarchs so unique The danger of cell phones,0.4

CNN,world, Editors note Shin Donghyuk is a human rights advocate and subject of the bestseller Escape From Camp 14 which tells his story about being born and raised in a brutal political prison camp in North Korea Shin is the only man known to have been born in and to have escaped such a facility Hes the founder and executive director of the group Inside NK where he raises awareness about North Koreas human rights abuses The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer CNN  In North Koreas utopian society the very words human rights do not need to exist  because its so perfect the regime maintains The North Korean regime controls and monitors the usage of the very words The concept is not even taught I had never even heard of the term human rights when I was in North Korea It also strongly denies the existence of the political prison camp system throughout the country It maintains this position even though I was born in the most infamous political prison camp in North Korea Camp 14 Even now there are people who are born into a life of an inmate in a political prison camp READ Escape from Camp 14 a survival story North Korea also denies committing human rights violations threatens and intimidates defector activists working to raise awareness of human rights issues and attacking and criticizing those who have testified during the United Nations Commission of Inquirys investigation calling these defectors human scum North Korea has also launched personal attacks on me labeling me human scum and releasing a statement that my testimony is all based on lies The dictatorship in North Korea has never been honest or truthful for more than six decades it has been in existence Could North Korea change The North Korean dictatorial regime should not just emptily deny that these political prison camps exist If they are truly honorable and fair they should immediately allow an international inspection delegation comprised of myself and organizations such as Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch or the United Nations to be able to conduct ontheground visitations to the political prison camps These delegations must include political prison survivors like myself and other defectors READ Defectors describe horror heartbreak of labor camps Only recently did they concede that labor detention centers exist but solely for the incarcerated to have their lives improved through their mentality and to look on their wrongdoings Earlier this year the UN published a report on the human rights situation in North Korea through the Commission of Inquiry that was established last year It was followed by a special North Korean human rights side event during the recent UN General Assembly in New York in which US Secretary of State John Kerry the newly appointed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein and the Foreign Ministers of Japan and South Korea demanded improvements in North Koreas human rights record To counter this and perhaps fearing a challenge to its stability and of losing the initiative the regime adamantly opposed and obstructed any discussions at the UN of a resolution regarding its rights record as well as the issue being brought up at the Security Council I believe ultimately the regime is using diplomatic tactics to deflect pressures from the international community regarding its nuclear ambitions missile tests and human rights violations Regime travels freely as North Koreans starve Some say that the most recent actions and conciliatory gestures on the part of the North Korean regime can lead to the revival of sixparty talks and progress on the nuclear issue But these talks have happened many times before and the regime still goes ahead and conducts nuclear tests in a bid to become a nuclear power This has showed the abject failure of the objectives of the sixparty talks to denuclearize the peninsula Even if negotiations were to be restarted the attitude of the regime must change first  most importantly by ceasing its provocative behavior PHOTOS The scale of Norths camp system However though there may be a temporary dtente in tensions if the regime were to participate in restarted talks it would be difficult to expect a fundamental change in attitude on the part of the North Korean regime Also the human rights issue must be on the same level as the nuclear issue and dealt with together and for this to happen the human rights issue must be included as an integral part of sixparty talks The international community must show continued interest and become actively involved The dictators family travel freely while ordinary North Koreans cannot enjoy any freedom of travel People are dying of hunger while the North Korean dictator wastes money on building a useless golf course and earns money from Western tourism which both angers and saddens me The dictatorship in Pyongyang says its citizens chose the system in North Korea through their own will and that they are happy But there is no place no country on this Earth where the people would knowingly choose a system that starves and kills its own citizens and be happy READ Abundant evidence of crimes against humanity Footnote  The North Korean government website Uriminzokkiri released videos about Shin Donghyuk this week calling his testimonies lies The video featured a man Sin Kyong Sop whom Shin recognized to be his father In the video which has English subtitles Sin denies they lived at a prison camp In response Shin Donghyuk released this statement My only sin against the North Korean dictator is that I told the entire world about the suffering of the political prison inmates in the political prison camps My only crime against the dictator is that I escaped from the political prison camp I love my father Through this I seek my fathers forgiveness The dictator is holding my father hostage No matter what the dictator does to my father they cannot cover my eyes no matter what the dictator does they can not cover up my mouth ,0.4
CNN,world, Editors note Fareed Zakaria is the host of Global Public Square which airs Sundays at 10 am and 1 pm ET on CNN  CNN  When the news flashed last week that a man had shot and killed a Canadian soldier in front of the National War Memorial in Canada what most people were wondering  but not saying out loud  was Is it another radical Muslim And it was As was Martin Rouleau Couture the man who ran over two Canadian soldiers in Quebec As was Zale Thompson who attacked four police officers in Queens New York also last week Its why I have said before  we have to be honest there is a problem in the world of Islam today Some people have found in it an ideology of opposition and violence against the modern and Western world The three jihadis who burst onto the news last week represent that ugly phenomenon But lets dip deeper into these three people to understand what moved them to become terrorists None of them was born and brought up a religious Muslim A profile of Michael ZehafBibeau in The New York Times suggests someone who went from a life of partying as a 16yearold to repeated arrests for drug possession and stealing a credit card He was once sentenced to prison for two years for possessing a weapon in a robbery In the Times article one of the counselors at a Salvation Army shelter described his battles with addiction thus He was doing heroin to take the edge off crack Amidst this turmoil the Times says he converted to Islam got radicalized sought to go to Syria to fight in the jihad and finally ended up trying to wage his own version of it in Ottawa and died after killing a soldier The man who ran over the soldiers in Canada last week reportedly converted to Islam only a year ago The New York Police Department says the man who attacked its officers with a hatchet also clearly disturbed converted to Islam two years ago These are not people steeped in Islam  people for whom the religion has shaped their worldview over decades people who were motivated by their immersion in the religion On the contrary these were unstable young men prone toward radicalism and violence They were searching for an ideology that would fit their disturbed worldview and in the radical and jihadi interpretations of Islam they found it It is always worth remembering that these people represent a tiny minority After all think of it this way Terror groups such as Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and al Qaeda have been calling on Muslims to engage in terrorism in Western cities for over 10 years now But of the some 16 billion Muslims worldwide the number who have responded to these calls is a small small small percentage If all Muslims were radicals we would have more than three to worry about last week And yet there is a problem within Islam It is not enough for Muslims to point out that these people do not represent the religion They dont But Muslims need to take more active measures to protest these heinous acts They also need to make sure that Muslim countries and societies do not in any way condone extremism antimodern attitudes and intolerance towards other faiths Muslims are right to complain that there is antiMuslim bigotry out there But they would have a more persuasive case if they took on some of the bigotry within the world of Islam as well ,0.4

CNN,world, Every week Inside Africa takes its viewers on a journey across Africa exploring the true diversity and depth of different cultures countries and regions CNN  In Namibia the question of who owns the wildlife has often been fraught with difficulties In 1967  one year after the United Nations demanded South Africa leave Namibia  the ruling South African apartheid government gave ownership of the local fauna to predominantly white landowners Shortly afterwards the indigenous Namibians were pushed out onto the formerly protected Kaokoveld wildlife reserve where they were given a strip of land on which to farm For those living on the communal lands poaching springbok and zebra was often seen as the only way a family could stay fed When John Kasaona was a young boy his father did what many men did at the time he poached He used to catch everything from springbok to lion recalls Kasaona There was constant food in our family The practice was of course illegal and the landowners often came down hard on poachers It was a very awkward situation says Kasaona The colonial governments department of conservation started opening up pots in the local communities to see what was in those pots Though the authorities arrested perpetrators poaching remained rampant in the 1970s and 1980s as bad droughts and a war for independence ravaged local livestock As a result many species in Namibia were facing extinction In the private lands wildlife was doing quite well notes Chris Weaver head of the World Wildlife FundNamibia WWFNa On the communal lands though it was at near historic lows In 1983 Kasaonas father was asked by the village headman to stop poaching From now on he would no longer hunt wildlife he would protect it He was one of the first poachers turned game guards in the country The novel idea  to protect wildlife by enlisting those most skilled at tracking it  was the brainchild of the Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation IRDNC an NGO of which Kasaona is now the director One of the founders of IRDNC a conservationist named Gareth OwenSmith formed the idea for the game guard system in tandem with the local Herero herdsmen He discovered that these elders didnt want to see the end of wildlife any more than he did remarks IRDNCs cofounder Margaret Jacobsohn It might not make sense from an outside perspective but from a local perspective these are the men who know and enjoy being in the bush But now theyre earning an income from being there When Namibia gained independence in 1990 the government recognized the successes achieved by the game guard system and enlisted IRDNCs help in rolling it out on a national scale By 1996 the idea had matured rather than merely paying local communities to look after wildlife the government used ownership as an incentive In exchange for forming a community conservancy a community was given the rights to the animals on their land If people feel they really own a resource if they feel they have responsibility for it theyre going to be accountable and theyre going to look after it notes Jacobsohn Its just a very logical thing If you rent an apartment youll treat it one way If you own it you might treat it slightly better The initial funding came from the government and NGOs including IRDNC and the WWF who with USAid has invested 48 million into the conservancy program since 1993 Looking at the numbers today its clear its been a huge success The country currently hosts the worlds largest population of free roaming cheetahs and black rhinos where once they teetered on the edge of extinction In the last decade the elephant population has risen from around 13000 to 20000 In the northwest of the country where lions were down to under two dozen they now total roughly 130 The goal though has always been for conservancies to become selfsufficient as owning wildlife isnt enough to ensure its protection In order for the conservation scheme to really work people on the land had to recognize they could benefit more from the animals alive than  as Jacobsohn says in their cooking pots When the conservancy system started in 1996 there were four areas pulling in a negligible income Today there are over 74 earning a combined total of more than 48 million Most of the money is derived from joint venture tourism with trophy hunting following in at a distant second Many conservancies have used the influx of money to better develop their local schools provide support programs for individuals with HIVAIDS and improve infrastructure and a range of other rural development projects It brought a very big change when we went into the tourism business recalls Bennie Roman the manager of the Torra Conservancy one of the oldest in the country and the first to become fully financially independent Roman recalled how before Torra was set up the only jobs available were in teaching and farming Young people would go out to urban areas and the elders would stay back to manage the land he says In 1995 the Damaraland Camp ecoresort moved in nearby At first Roman says the community looked at it with suspicion We saw them as competition he admits They were generating an income from the resources we were living with However since then Torra has become the first conservancy to partner with a private business The Damaraland Camp pays rent to the conservancy and hires locals from within the community  one from every household There are other effects of the conservancy program some that dont follow strict principals of conservation The practice of trophy hunting has proved controversial invoking ire from various animal rights activists Yet Weaver sees it as beneficial to preservation From my perspective were trying to conserve the species not the individual animal and this creates a benefit when its done in a wellregulated fashion and the benefits go to the local community he says Another issue is that conservancies have done their job too well The numbers of zebras and elephants have increased but so have the numbers of lions cheetahs and hyenas notes Kasaona Its become a big problem for our farmers Conservancies have responded in a number of ways Most offer a small sum to farmers to offset their losses Some use GPS tracking devices on the predators to alert farmers when theyre heading over to their area Roman has started a breeding station to help replace livestock that gets mauled by local predators Kasaona admits that the problem is part of the success story of Namibia ,0.4

CNN,world, CNN  With travel to Africa poised to hit alltime highs in 2014 a dropoff in travel bookings was the last thing the continents lucrative safari industry thought it would be facing going into 2015 But despite the fact that the main safari destinations in southern and eastern Africa are thousands of kilometers from the Ebolastricken countries of the west industry leaders say fears of the disease are keeping tourists away A survey based on feedback from more than 500 safari operators conducted by African booking company Safaribookingscom found that as of late September more than half reported a 20 to 70 decline in bookings Numerous safari tour operators report to us that clients view Africa as a single country when it comes to risk assessment Wouter Vergeer Safaribookingscom founder tells CNN Vergeer says the impact is most noticeable in East Africa home to safari hotspots such as Kenyas Masai Mara and Tanzanias Serengeti  places located nearly 5000 kilometers from the West Africa Ebola outbreak area Most people dont realize how vast Africa is and that East and southern Africa are just as far from the outbreak area as Europe or South America says Vergeer All safari countries have enacted strict precautionary measures and as there currently are no Ebola cases the risk of infection is effectively zero Using music to fight Ebol in Liberia Convincing clients theyll be safe Jake McCormick a safari specialist with Shadows of Africa says the Ebola outbreak has caused a 70 decrease in inquiries at his company which offers tours in Tanzania Kenya Rwanda and Zanzibar We are still working to try to convince clients they are safe from this disease but until we see the outbreak come under control my feeling is that it will be a while until things return to normal he says Joao Oliveira founder of It Started in Africa which organizes safaris and Kilimanjaro treks in Tanzania and Kenya tells a similar story We did not have any cancellations but we had much fewer bookings he says The reason I believe there have been no cancellations is because the clients who have already paid  safaris are usually booked several months in advance and a down payment is required  do their own research and find out that the Ebola countries are more than 5000 kilometers away from Tanzania or Kenya As for the reduction in bookings I believe it is because those who are planning their vacations are now not even considering going to Africa because of Ebola Oliveira says 2014 was on track to be his companys most profitable year to date Then as news of the Ebloa crisis spread panic set in In July we projected that August would be our best month ever and then the panic started and August was the worst month of the last two years September was the same He says October looks like its improving slightly but its difficult to tell at this point It does not make sense he adds You would not cancel your vacation in Paris because there are conflicts in the Middle East or in Ukraine If something nasty was happening in Alaska youd still go to New York MORE Fearbola hits epidemic proportions Africa is seen as a country  Brett Thomson managing director of Sun Safaris says that in addition to traveler queries being down 50 to 70 new bookings compared with last October are also down about 50 Over the past month we have had numerous clients replying that they will be in touch after all the health scares are over says Thomson Even if we explain how far southern Africa is from West Africa it does not change their mind Africa is seen as a country and hardly ever as a continent Daniel Njamwea managing director of safari travel booking company Lilac Adventures agrees that its been difficult trying to convince clients how far East Africa is from West Africa  especially Kenya This morning I was dealing with clients over Skype who are coming on October 25 and are worried since they read in the news that there is a woman who died at Jomo Kenyatta airport last weekend and feared that she had Ebola says Njamwea It was hard to convince them that she tested negative for Ebola I had to refer them to Ministry of Health website to read more details The other big problem say those in the industry is a lack of knowledge of how Ebola is contracted Although the Ebola virus is not airborne at this time and can only be caught through coming in contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person and is currently limited to destinations in West Africa we have recently experienced a small number of clients deferring their holiday plans to the rest of the continent says Charlie Bateson product director of high end travel company Abercrombie  Kent We remain in constant contact with the FCO WHO and with tourist boards and our supplier partners across the world Our tour consultants are given the latest news on developments and have the ability to specifically advise clients on how the virus is transmitted so that they are able to allay clients fears Meanwhile Rose Hipwood of the Luxury Safari Company says the top end of Africas safari market hasnt been hit as hard by Ebola fears since many of those clients are international travelers and can look at the situation sensibly Some clients have indeed decided not to book safaris this year after inquiring  but sadly in this industry we get a lot of time wasters and I believe those people would have found another reason not to book if not Ebola although families are always more protective of their little ones says Hipwood Africa tourism was poised for growth  Though no figures have been released on the overall impact Ebola has had on African tourism in the first half of 2014 the industry had been experiencing impressive growth rates According to the World Tourism Organizations 2014 global travel report Africa was due to see 4 to 6 tourism growth this year In 2013 the continent saw international arrivals increase 5 over 2012 the equivalent of 3 million more tourists to reach 56 million This year is now written off already says Njamwea of Lilac Adventures By this time hotels should be issuing stop sales for the Christmas period but I have seen none meaning they still have availability Though this could have been due to other factors like cancellations of direct charter flights from Europe due to security risks Ebola has too played a great part Londonbased James Strawson tells CNN hed been considering a trip to Gambia in late November until the Ebola crisis erupted I wanted to go away for some winter sunshine he says Ive been to Gambia previously and its a good time zone easy to get to and quite nice and warm Strawson 26 said media hysteria related to Ebola changed his mind I just looked at the headlines and thought it looks bad now who knows what it

the outbreak started in March about 9000 Ebola cases and 4493 deaths have been reported mostly in Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone according to the World Health Organization WHO More than half of the deaths have been in Liberia And the numbers are expected to skyrocket There could be up to 10000 new Ebola cases per week in the three hardesthit nations by the end of the year the WHO said It warned

CNN,world, Editors note Theresa Corbin is a writer living in New Orleans She is the founder of Islamwich and a contributor to On Islam and Aquila Style A version of this piece first appeared on CNN iReport CNN  I am a Muslim but I wasnt always I converted to Islam in November 2001 two months after 911 I was 21 and living in Baton Rouge Louisiana It was a bad time to be a Muslim But after four years of studying poking and prodding at world religions and their adherents I decided to take the plunge Questions and answers I am the product of a Creole Catholic and an Irish atheist I grew up Catholic then was agnostic now Im Muslim My journey to Islam began when I was about 15 years old in Mass and had questions about my faith The answers from teachers and clergymen  dont worry your pretty little head about it  didnt satisfy me So I did what any redblooded American would do the opposite I worried about it For many years I questioned the nature of religion man and the universe After questioning everything I was taught to be true and digging through rhetoric history and dogma I found out about this strange thing called Islam I learned that Islam is neither a culture nor a cult nor could it be represented by one part of the world I came to realize Islam is a world religion that teaches tolerance justice and honor and promotes patience modesty and balance As I studied the faith I was surprised many of the tenants resonated with me I was pleased to find that Islam teaches its adherents to honor all prophets from Moses to Jesus to Mohammed all of whom taught mankind to worship one God and to conduct ourselves with higher purpose I was drawn to Islams appeal to intellect and heartened by the prophet Mohammeds quote The acquisition of knowledge is compulsory for every Muslim whether male or female I was astounded that science and rationality were embraced by Muslim thinkers such as AlKhawarizmi who invented algebra Ibn Firnas who developed the mechanics of flight before Leonardo DaVinci and Abu alQasim alZahrawi who is the father of modern surgery Here was a religion telling me to seek out answers and use my intellect to question the world around me Taking the plunge It was 2001 and I had been putting off converting for a while I feared what people would think but was utterly miserable When 911 happened the actions of the hijackers horrified me But in its aftermath I spent most of my time defending Muslims and their religion to people who were all too eager to paint a group of 16 billion people with one brush because of the actions of a few I was done being held hostage by the opinions of others In defending Islam I got over my fear and decided to join my brothers and sisters in the faith I believed in My family did not understand but it wasnt a surprise to them since I had been studying religion Most were very concerned for my safety Luckily most of my friends were cool about it and even curious to learn more The scarf These days I am a proud wearer of hijab You can call it a scarf My scarf does not tie my hands behind my back and it is not a tool of oppression It doesnt prevent thoughts from entering my head and leaving my mouth But I didnt always know this Studying Islam didnt immediately dispel all my cultural misconceptions I had been raised on imagery of women in the East being treated like chattel by men who forced them to cover their bodies out of shame or a sense of ownership But when I asked a Muslim woman Why do you wear that her answer was obvious and appealing To please God To be recognized as a woman who is to be respected and not harassed So that I can protect myself from the male gaze She explained how dressing modestly is a symbol to the world that a womans body is not meant for mass consumption or critique I still wasnt convinced and replied Yeah but women are like second class citizens in your faith The very patient Muslim lady explained that during a time when the Western world treated women like property Islam taught that men and women were equal in the eyes of God Islam made the womans consent to marriage mandatory and gave women the opportunity to inherit own property run businesses and participate in government She listed right after right that women in Islam held nearly 1250 years before womens lib was ever thought of in the West Surprisingly Islam turned out to be the religion that appealed to my feminist ideals Getting married  It might shock you to know that I had an arranged marriage That doesnt mean I was forced to marry my fathers first choice suitor like Jasmine from Aladdin Dad didnt even have a say When I converted it wasnt a good time to be a Muslim Feeling isolated alienated and rejected by my own society pushed me to want to start a family of my own Even before converting I had always wanted a serious relationship but found few men looking for the same As a new Muslim I knew there was a better way to look for love and a lifelong partnership I decided that if I wanted a serious relationship it was time to get serious about finding one I wanted an arranged marriage I made a list of 30 Rockstyle deal breakers I searched I interviewed I interrogated friends and families of prospects I decided I wanted to marry another convert someone who had been where I was and wanted to go where I wanted to go Thanks to parents of friends I found my nowhusband a convert to Islam in Mobile Alabama two hours from my New Orleans home Twelve years later we are living happily ever after Not every Muslim finds a mate in this manner and I didnt always see this for my life But I am glad Islam afforded me this option Living in a post911 world I never had to give up my personality American identity or culture to be a Muslim I have at times had to give up on being treated with dignity I have been spat on had eggs thrown at me and been cursed at from passing cars And I have felt terror when the mosque I attended in Savannah Georgia was first shot at then burned down In August 2012 I moved back home to New Orleans where being different is the norm I finally felt safe  for a while But now with the continuous news coverage of the unIslamic group known as ISIS I have been subjected to much of the same treatment I received in other cities And I now feel less safe than I ever have It enrages me to know there are some who call themselves Muslims and who distort and misappropriate Islam for political gains It weighs on me knowing that millions of my countrymen see only these images as a representative of my religion It is unbearable to know that I am passionately hated for my beliefs when those hating me dont even know what my beliefs are In my journey to Islam I came to learn that Muslims come in all shapes sizes attitudes ethnicities cultures and nationalities I came to know that Islam teaches disagreement and that shouldnt lead to disrespect as most Muslims want peace Most of all I have faith that my fellow Americans can rise above fear and hatred and come to learn the same Have a question for Corbin Well open comments at 1 pm ET and shell be here to answer your questions The opinions expressed in this story are solely those of

CNN,world, CNN  On Sunday Raquel and Pedro Alvarado buried three of their children  Erica Alex and Jose Angel  in the Mexican village of El Control just five miles south of the Texas border The final resting place for the youths  all in their 20s  is the place where their family originated But this small community administered by the larger border city of Matamoros merely provides bookends to the lives these three Americans had north of the Rio Grande The siblings were born in the United States grew up in Progreso Texas and continued to make their lives there They disappeared on October 13  kidnapped witnesses say  as they returned to Texas from a trip to visit their father in El Control Their bodies were found last week Each was bound at their hands and feet the Tamaulipas State Attorney Generals Office said and each had a gunshot wound to the head A fourth victim Jose Castaneda met the same fate Castaneda was Ericas boyfriend her family said All four were killed the same day they disappeared a spokesman for the State Attorney Generals Office said without elaborating Some witnesses told investigators that the armed men who confronted and took the youths belonged to a new security force known as Grupo Hercules State Attorney General Ismael Quintanilla Acosta told reporters Grupo Hercules was created one month before the disappearance of the youths It is touted as an elite security force under the direction of the mayor of Matamoros 37yearold Leticia Salazar In parts of Mexico like this stretch of border where drug cartels battle each other and law enforcement things arent always what they seem Drug gangs have been known to pose as cops Cops have been known to be on cartel payrolls Cases of mistaken identity have had deadly consequences But what troubles Pedro and Raquel Alvarado is that no one has offered a motive or theory about why their children and Castaneda were killed No one has accused the Alvarado siblings of being involved in criminal activity And while nine members of Grupo Hercules were interrogated by investigators no arrests have been made Salazar the Matamoros mayor has neither defended nor disciplined her security forces  at least publicly Contacted by CNN Salazar referred questions to the citys public affairs team which earlier said it did not have any comment on the allegations against Grupo Hercules and could not confirm why the group was created or even its size In a news release announcing the groups unveiling Grupo Hercules is described as being tasked with combating crime and made up of forces capable of carrying out intelligence and highrisk operations A week ago the attorney general said his investigators would call in the mayor for questioning but that has not happened I dont know why they took them Pedro Alvarado said They didnt start trouble with anyone They were quiet not aggressive If her children were mixed up in something criminal there should be a record of their arrests or charges against them but those are nonexistent Raquel Alvarado said If I knew they were doing something wrong I would have recognized it as their mother she said And until someone proves otherwise I will continue defending them Pedro Raquels former husband was the one to identify the remains of his children which were in an advanced state of decomposition the State Attorney Generals Office said He identified them by their clothing shoes and some tattoos The US Consulate in Matamoros has been assisting the family We have been in contact with Mexican officials both in Washington and in Mexico to find out further details of the case and will take appropriate action if necessary once more is known about the circumstances a State Department official said An FBI spokeswoman said the agency is assisting Mexican officials with any part of the investigation on the US side of the border Three lives The final Facebook post that Erica Alvarado shared  at least publicly  is a fitting if unplanned goodbye It is a collage of photos of her four children atop a backdrop with the words I love you She was born in Florida and like her siblings grew up in Progreso a Texas town on the border and about as close as you can get to El Control on the US side of the boundary She was a dedicated mother Pedro Alvarado said and was planning to enroll in a nursing program Her brother Alex loved his Chevy Tahoe his father said Alexs social media postings reflect that photos of the Tahoe muddied photos after a paint job the Tahoe as a profile picture The same armed men who took his children took the Tahoe Pedro Alvarado said The 22yearold had a prominent tattoo on his left arm  an image of St Jude the saint of lost causes  the father said By now Alex and his brother Jose Angel should have been in Missouri doing seasonal agricultural work Pedro Alvarado said Jose Angel was born in Houston and Alex in Harlingen during Pedros own days as a seasonal migrant worker in the United States their father said Routine visit The siblings visited their father in El Control each week Pedro Alvarado said On their short drive back to Texas the Alvarado siblings stopped at La Curva Texas a small restaurant underneath the last major overpass before the Los Indios International Bridge Pedro Alvarado said They arrived separately Raquel Alvarado said According to what witnesses have told her Alex and Jose Angel arrived at the restaurant to find armed men beating up their sister and her boyfriend The brothers intervened and the armed men overpowered all four and placed hoods over their heads before escorting them away the mother said It was there he said that they were last seen before their bodies were found 16 days later Raquel Alvarado said she and Pedro have told all this to authorities but she accuses investigators of moving slowly The facts that are known she said are thanks to the investigative work of Pedro who tracked down witnesses There was an outpouring of support at the funeral Raquel Alvarado said Family from across Texas and Mexico attended and when the funeral procession moved from the church to the burial ground they found that the crowd wouldnt fit in the cemetery On Monday the mother was back in Progreso hoping to get some sleep to recover from the whirlwind of mourning frustration and media spotlight I hope when I wake up I will learn this was all a nightmare

CNN,world, Editors note The author is a British banker who spent several years working in Hong Kong and is now receiving professional help for his addictions He has requested not to be named He no longer lives in the city CNN  The first time I walked down the main drag in Wan Chai in Hong Kong I couldnt believe what I saw all the mama bars there and prostitutes openly in the street outside trying to get guys to go in Within the first week Id already been offered cocaine though I didnt take it at that stage When I did it was easy to get I know 100 guys between the ages of 20 and 50 and Id say around 30 of them were regular cocaine users Not all were working in banking but most were of the ones I knew They were all Westerners I know guys in banking in London Chicago and Sydney and theyve all got the same pressures as Hong Kong Yes I know some cocaine users in those cities but the ratio of the people I know to the ratio of people I know who are drug users is minimal  its almost nonexistent So it can only really be down to two things  the availability of it and how many people do it the general acceptance of it in Hong Kong When I read the news of the murders in Wan Chai allegedly by a British banker my first reaction was I hope I dont know him please dont be someone I know because it easily could have been I knew some guys who were seriously screwed up and now I realize just how much I had changed in Hong Kong almost inhuman at times Getting drugs The guy that I used you could give him a phone call or a text message from 4 pm onwards and within an hour  I think his record was 10 minutes  one of his drivers was sitting in a car outside the office Youd just tell people you were popping down for a cigarette Youd dive over into his car he would just drive around the corner and by the time you got out 30 seconds later youve got cocaine and youve given him the money He had four or five delivery points that were his favorite delivery points and they were all within walking distance of the office And if your guy was busy or not answering then you knew that someone else had a guy and they could get some off him Of the hundred nights that I wanted to get cocaine I think I can only remember one night when I couldnt get any You could walk into almost any bar in Wan Chai and stand there and have a drink and you would soon pick up the signs of another cocaine user theyre going to the toilet every 20 minutes their nose is running theyre talking rubbish really quickly They wouldnt say no if they had some on them It felt like some unofficial club where you only knew members first names  but you all looked out for each other on the drug front A gram would cost between 90 to 130 HK700 and HK1000 At the start I was doing it once a month and after a few years I found myself doing it four times a week I would do one gram for one night out But then quite often I would find myself on a three or fourday bender You could do that because there are a couple of bars in Wan Chai that stay open until 9 am And then when one of those kicks you out you can just walk across the road to another bar thats opening at 9 am  as long as you can make it across the road without being hit The bars that stayed open until 9 am  they werent the mama bars with the girls standing outside but inside there were always prostitutes asking you to buy a drink for them at an inflated price And then generally it wouldnt take long for them to ask you if you wanted to go back to a hotel with them Youd never have to ask them I personally always said no because I was more interested in my beer and coke No one was really that worried If you werent going on a bender and you were just out drinking until 3 am you could go to work and function I was one of them  I was still functioning But if I had a threeday bender then I had to make up excuses for being off sick or whatever or somebody would cover for you Generally no one was really that worried In my office there were three guys who would regularly go AWOL for three or four days and of course the wives would worry and would be ringing everybody People would be trying to get hold of them but you kind of knew theyre alright theyre just in a bar somewhere on cocaine and theyll turn up in a few days looking ashamed and promising they wont do it again for a week If you were out in Wan Chai you knew you werent going to get into trouble with the law You could go into the toilet into the cubicle and chop your cocaine up on the ledge behind the toilet You could clearly see that was going on  the people who were regularly going into the toilet every 20 minutes  not covering up the noise they were making when they were doing it The women were obviously very very easily accessible if you wanted it I knew guys whose number one priority was the drinking I knew guys whose number one priority was the drugs and I knew guys whose number one priority was the women Generally the guys in the last of those groups you wouldnt see them around as much because theyd be off with a woman somewhere Hong Kong can break you as a person That scene in Wan Chai with these girly bars everywhere getting cocaine whenever you need it being able to stay up and drink all night you end up believing that thats the norm When you go to other cities its like why havent they got somewhere that stays open all night Its a pain in the arse to try to get cocaine from somebody I wouldnt have got out of it in Hong Kong I would have been destroyed Leaving Hong Kong saved my life ,0.4

CNN,world, Gaziantep Turkey CNN  It is like many of the images of aftermath in Syrias chaotic war  a man being pulled from the rubble of the building But this one is different The panic is muted the men dig not slowly but leisurely This is because they know he is a regime fighter Where are your friends they ask perhaps taunting him Are you from Yemen But no this is something different As they pull his terrified tired frame from the dust the blood seeping from a head wound and pitted against the white coat of silt from the rubble it becomes clear this regime fighter is Afghan Video obtained by CNN from Syrian rebels which we cannot verify shows this scene and the attempts by the rebels who are engaged in a pitched battle to prevent the regime encircling the main Syrian city of Aleppo to interrogate their new prisoner Thats the first indication theres something new here he doesnt speak Arabic but mutters in Dari Facially he appears Uzbek or Hazara and is terrified Their video shows him bandaged up and on an IV drip He is locked in a basement and fed then questioned further A comparatively generous fate for a regime prisoner in this savage war It is unclear what happened to him but he told his interrogators My name is Sayed Ahmad Hussaini The Iranians pay people like me to come here and fight I am from Afghanistan and I am an immigrant in Iran The Iranians brought us to Syria to fight to defend the Zainab shrine I dont want to fight anymore He says he wants to go home and that he was paid about 500 a month to fight There are many Afghan immigrants in Iran trying to find some shelter from the decades of war that have torn apart their land He says he was trained and then sent to assist the regime It is potentially a serious development in the Syrian war and explains in some ways how the Syrian regime has gained ground in some areas after months of appearing exhausted In the fight for Aleppo they are fiercely contesting a hill settlement called Handarat which is itself tiny but vitally overlooks the main supply road into rebel held areas of Aleppo If the regime hold Handarat they can cut off rebel Aleppo from resupply effectively besieging it Seasoned Afghan fighters could assist the regime  so far letting the Coalition and moderate Syrian rebels take on ISIS  in other battles too CNN sent a photojournalist to eastern Afghanistan to follow up reports of recruitment by Iranian agents of mercenaries to fight for the regime Inside Afghanistan In one village four men who did not want their identity or location revealed said they had just returned from training in Iran There they were taken to a police station blindfolded and taken to a training camp where they were shown tactics and light to medium weapons The men spoke in great detail about their experiences and were able to show the Iranian bank cards through which they will be paid their 500 to 1000 salaries a month Other villagers ratified their stories Their motivations were complicated Most said they sought money  a likely motivation as the NATO drawdown in Afghanistan is changing the Talibans dynamics and reducing the amount of money sloshing around in the country They also wanted to fight America  saying that fighting the moderate Syrian rebels the regime is targeting most heavily and who receive US assistance  was one way of continuing this fight from Afghanistan We want to go there for two reasons one is to fight against those who are being assisted by Americans in Syria and secondly Iran pays us to fight in Syria said one man Those who fight against Assad regime are Americas slaves That is why we want to fight them and kill them They said they were former Taliban who had left for Iran after disagreements in the militant group known for its fractious and sprawling membership Before this we used to be part of the Taliban in Afghanistan but after our disagreements caused tensions among us we left the Taliban and went to Iran We are going there to fight Either we will be killed or will be back with the monthly salary that the Iranian have promised to give us ISIS Yet their limited knowledge of the Syrian conflict exposed a complex issue over which their loyalties to their paymasters Iran may be tested Asked about ISIS a predominantly Sunni group like the Taliban the men said they knew little about them but if we see them in Syria we will definitely sit with them talk to them and if our thoughts were similar we would become friends with them That would be one unexpected outcome for the Iranian agents accused of assisting these men Syrias war has local regime militia joined by Hezbollah from Lebanon Iraqi Shia militia on one side ISIS and its array of global radicals on another And Syrian rebels spanning the width of al Qaeda to moderates with foreign backing Syrias chaotic intractable and hopelessly unnegotiable war just got another complex and battlehardened actor ,0.4

CNN,world, CNN Ones to Watch is a new show that shines a spotlight on upandcoming creative talents set to be the next big names in culture and the arts London CNN  A portrait artist promises to capture more than a photograph is ever able to more than just a glimpse of a persons external appearance a portrait can display a person as they truly are But how does the artists do it Jonathan Yeo is one of Britains greatest portrait artists Some of the worlds most famous people  Tony Blair Nicole Kidman Damien Hirst Kevin Spacey Prince Phillip and Malala Yousafzai among them  have sat to have their image  and something of their essence  captured by him Here he meets prima ballerina Tamara Rojo artistic director and star dancer at the English National Ballet and explains how to create a stunning portrait  from choosing a subject to immortalizing them in paint  broken down into a series of sixsecond Vines You want to choose people youre going to find interesting company  It doesnt even matter if you end up not liking them if you find them interesting then that makes for an interesting painting Its only if you find someone boring then that tends to make the whole process harder At the start youre trying to get the overall shape of the picture and the composition Its tricky when someone has got a very interesting and beautiful face Im torn between wanting to make it close up to the face  and make it about the expression and intensity  but at the same time the whole composition is really interesting Sometimes you get lucky and it happens very quickly and the first idea works well and you get stuck straight in Sometimes it takes several goes  You might start one and not like it Or you might like some bits of it and start it again using some parts and not others A portrait is basically a document of a relationship between the artist and the sitter and that kind of changes as you get to know each other What Im doing is although Im using paint Im kind of drawing  The advantage of drawing straight onto the canvas is the bits I like Ill keep  and then it could be that itll stay as a study Or it might be that Ill do another layer and another layer and then Itll become more three dimensional At this stage you dont necessarily know whats going to happen The idea is that I start by laying down an underlayer of the picture probably in quite muted colors like Im doing here  And then once youre happy with the idea of it that its on the right lines then I dont have to be quite so fixed or concentrating so hard Actually you start talking more and its partly then you see the animation in peoples faces And then thats what makes the thing come alive Youve got very good very strong eyes Its important to get that right  more than anything else  Sometimes it can take quite a long time but if you do get it right thats sort of the way into the picture its the thing that captures someones attention when they glance at it If you get that right its hard for people to look away Its a very powerful thing You cant fake it If someone doesnt have very interesting eyes then you cant pretend We are interested in faces more than other things  Its natural we get so much more information about whats going on from other peoples faces expressions and reactions So much of how we communicate isnt conscious its about how our faces react or dont react or betray how were thinking or emphasize or exaggerate what were saying or contradict it If people really want to look at it while Im doing it Ill let them but on the basis that they dont say anything to me about it  Maybe right at the end Ill ask what they think but in the middle you dont want anything that will influence or distort what youre planning on doing to it Its not often easy to judge at the time when youve just done something whether its good or not  You might like something on the day because its what you were trying to do but sometimes the best ones happen by accident Because if it wasnt what you were trying to do that day you dont see it as a success And its only by putting it away forgetting about it working on something else coming back and finding it after that you see it fresh and then you can be more objective about it Its nice having someone sit but at the same time the most interesting people are busy and havent got all day  Some things you can do without the person  the dress and the pose you can do from the photos  but then you try to get people back to sit for you for the face and the expression For that bit the photo doesnt tell the whole story you want to see not just how someone looks but how a person moves and how they react to things and if you can get those things in thats what makes it come alive really and makes it more interesting than a photo ,0.4

CNN,world, CNN  On Sunday Raquel and Pedro Alvarado buried three of their children  Erica Alex and Jose Angel  in the Mexican village of El Control just five miles south of the Texas border The final resting place for the youths  all in their 20s  is the place where their family originated But this small community administered by the larger border city of Matamoros merely provides bookends to the lives these three Americans had north of the Rio Grande The siblings were born in the United States grew up in Progreso Texas and continued to make their lives there They disappeared on October 13  kidnapped witnesses say  as they returned to Texas from a trip to visit their father in El Control Their bodies were found last week Each was bound at their hands and feet the Tamaulipas State Attorney Generals Office said and each had a gunshot wound to the head A fourth victim Jose Castaneda met the same fate Castaneda was Ericas boyfriend her family said All four were killed the same day they disappeared a spokesman for the State Attorney Generals Office said without elaborating Some witnesses told investigators that the armed men who confronted and took the youths belonged to a new security force known as Grupo Hercules State Attorney General Ismael Quintanilla Acosta told reporters Grupo Hercules was created one month before the disappearance of the youths It is touted as an elite security force under the direction of the mayor of Matamoros 37yearold Leticia Salazar In parts of Mexico like this stretch of border where drug cartels battle each other and law enforcement things arent always what they seem Drug gangs have been known to pose as cops Cops have been known to be on cartel payrolls Cases of mistaken identity have had deadly consequences But what troubles Pedro and Raquel Alvarado is that no one has offered a motive or theory about why their children and Castaneda were killed No one has accused the Alvarado siblings of being involved in criminal activity And while nine members of Grupo Hercules were interrogated by investigators no arrests have been made Salazar the Matamoros mayor has neither defended nor disciplined her security forces  at least publicly Contacted by CNN Salazar referred questions to the citys public affairs team which earlier said it did not have any comment on the allegations against Grupo Hercules and could not confirm why the group was created or even its size In a news release announcing the groups unveiling Grupo Hercules is described as being tasked with combating crime and made up of forces capable of carrying out intelligence and highrisk operations A week ago the attorney general said his investigators would call in the mayor for questioning but that has not happened I dont know why they took them Pedro Alvarado said They didnt start trouble with anyone They were quiet not aggressive If her children were mixed up in something criminal there should be a record of their arrests or charges against them but those are nonexistent Raquel Alvarado said If I knew they were doing something wrong I would have recognized it as their mother she said And until someone proves otherwise I will continue defending them Pedro Raquels former husband was the one to identify the remains of his children which were in an advanced state of decomposition the State Attorney Generals Office said He identified them by their clothing shoes and some tattoos The US Consulate in Matamoros has been assisting the family We have been in contact with Mexican officials both in Washington and in Mexico to find out further details of the case and will take appropriate action if necessary once more is known about the circumstances a State Department official said An FBI spokeswoman said the agency is assisting Mexican officials with any part of the investigation on the US side of the border Three lives The final Facebook post that Erica Alvarado shared  at least publicly  is a fitting if unplanned goodbye It is a collage of photos of her four children atop a backdrop with the words I love you She was born in Florida and like her siblings grew up in Progreso a Texas town on the border and about as close as you can get to El Control on the US side of the boundary She was a dedicated mother Pedro Alvarado said and was planning to enroll in a nursing program Her brother Alex loved his Chevy Tahoe his father said Alexs social media postings reflect that photos of the Tahoe muddied photos after a paint job the Tahoe as a profile picture The same armed men who took his children took the Tahoe Pedro Alvarado said The 22yearold had a prominent tattoo on his left arm  an image of St Jude the saint of lost causes  the father said By now Alex and his brother Jose Angel should have been in Missouri doing seasonal agricultural work Pedro Alvarado said Jose Angel was born in Houston and Alex in Harlingen during Pedros own days as a seasonal migrant worker in the United States their father said Routine visit The siblings visited their father in El Control each week Pedro Alvarado said On their short drive back to Texas the Alvarado siblings stopped at La Curva Texas a small restaurant underneath the last major overpass before the Los Indios International Bridge Pedro Alvarado said They arrived separately Raquel Alvarado said According to what witnesses have told her Alex and Jose Angel arrived at the restaurant to find armed men beating up their sister and her boyfriend The brothers intervened and the armed men overpowered all four and placed hoods over their heads before escorting them away the mother said It was there he said that they were last seen before their bodies were found 16 days later Raquel Alvarado said she and Pedro have told all this to authorities but she accuses investigators of moving slowly The facts that are known she said are thanks to the investigative work of Pedro who tracked down witnesses There was an outpouring of support at the funeral Raquel Alvarado said Family from across Texas and Mexico attended and when the funeral procession moved from the church to the burial ground they found that the crowd wouldnt fit in the cemetery On Monday the mother was back in Progreso hoping to get some sleep to recover from the whirlwind of mourning frustration and media spotlight I hope when I wake up I will learn this was all a nightmare

CNN,world, Editors note The author is a British banker who spent several years working in Hong Kong and is now receiving professional help for his addictions He has requested not to be named He no longer lives in the city CNN  The first time I walked down the main drag in Wan Chai in Hong Kong I couldnt believe what I saw all the mama bars there and prostitutes openly in the street outside trying to get guys to go in Within the first week Id already been offered cocaine though I didnt take it at that stage When I did it was easy to get I know 100 guys between the ages of 20 and 50 and Id say around 30 of them were regular cocaine users Not all were working in banking but most were of the ones I knew They were all Westerners I know guys in banking in London Chicago and Sydney and theyve all got the same pressures as Hong Kong Yes I know some cocaine users in those cities but the ratio of the people I know to the ratio of people I know who are drug users is minimal  its almost nonexistent So it can only really be down to two things  the availability of it and how many people do it the general acceptance of it in Hong Kong When I read the news of the murders in Wan Chai allegedly by a British banker my first reaction was I hope I dont know him please dont be someone I know because it easily could have been I knew some guys who were seriously screwed up and now I realize just how much I had changed in Hong Kong almost inhuman at times Getting drugs The guy that I used you could give him a phone call or a text message from 4 pm onwards and within an hour  I think his record was 10 minutes  one of his drivers was sitting in a car outside the office Youd just tell people you were popping down for a cigarette Youd dive over into his car he would just drive around the corner and by the time you got out 30 seconds later youve got cocaine and youve given him the money He had four or five delivery points that were his favorite delivery points and they were all within walking distance of the office And if your guy was busy or not answering then you knew that someone else had a guy and they could get some off him Of the hundred nights that I wanted to get cocaine I think I can only remember one night when I couldnt get any You could walk into almost any bar in Wan Chai and stand there and have a drink and you would soon pick up the signs of another cocaine user theyre going to the toilet every 20 minutes their nose is running theyre talking rubbish really quickly They wouldnt say no if they had some on them It felt like some unofficial club where you only knew members first names  but you all looked out for each other on the drug front A gram would cost between 90 to 130 HK700 and HK1000 At the start I was doing it once a month and after a few years I found myself doing it four times a week I would do one gram for one night out But then quite often I would find myself on a three or fourday bender You could do that because there are a couple of bars in Wan Chai that stay open until 9 am And then when one of those kicks you out you can just walk across the road to another bar thats opening at 9 am  as long as you can make it across the road without being hit The bars that stayed open until 9 am  they werent the mama bars with the girls standing outside but inside there were always prostitutes asking you to buy a drink for them at an inflated price And then generally it wouldnt take long for them to ask you if you wanted to go back to a hotel with them Youd never have to ask them I personally always said no because I was more interested in my beer and coke No one was really that worried If you werent going on a bender and you were just out drinking until 3 am you could go to work and function I was one of them  I was still functioning But if I had a threeday bender then I had to make up excuses for being off sick or whatever or somebody would cover for you Generally no one was really that worried In my office there were three guys who would regularly go AWOL for three or four days and of course the wives would worry and would be ringing everybody People would be trying to get hold of them but you kind of knew theyre alright theyre just in a bar somewhere on cocaine and theyll turn up in a few days looking ashamed and promising they wont do it again for a week If you were out in Wan Chai you knew you werent going to get into trouble with the law You could go into the toilet into the cubicle and chop your cocaine up on the ledge behind the toilet You could clearly see that was going on  the people who were regularly going into the toilet every 20 minutes  not covering up the noise they were making when they were doing it The women were obviously very very easily accessible if you wanted it I knew guys whose number one priority was the drinking I knew guys whose number one priority was the drugs and I knew guys whose number one priority was the women Generally the guys in the last of those groups you wouldnt see them around as much because theyd be off with a woman somewhere Hong Kong can break you as a person That scene in Wan Chai with these girly bars everywhere getting cocaine whenever you need it being able to stay up and drink all night you end up believing that thats the norm When you go to other cities its like why havent they got somewhere that stays open all night Its a pain in the arse to try to get cocaine from somebody I wouldnt have got out of it in Hong Kong I would have been destroyed Leaving Hong Kong saved my life ,0.4

CNN,world, Taipei Taiwan CNN  Taiwanese President Ma Yingjeou is faced with a hugely delicate balancing act the need to maintain good economic relations with China while trying to keep Beijings push for reunification at bay The latter has become an increasingly tense issue During a recent session with reporters in the presidential office building Ma leaned back in a darkblue armchair under an oil painting of Sun Yatsen  modern Chinas founding father whose legacy is claimed by Taipei and Beijing and delivered a clear message economic relations with China should be developed but not at the cost of sovereignty During my tenure as president I will not discuss unification with mainland China he declared But he added that he would not promote independence let alone the use of force either I believe this is essential to achieving a stable and lasting framework for peaceful development he said Ma says his government is watching prodemocracy protests in Hong Kong closely to see whether Beijing will honor its initial promises on universal suffrage The city is regarded as a testing ground for the one country two systems formula that Chinas leaders originally hoped would entice Taiwan back into the fold China and Taiwan  officially the Peoples Republic of China and the Republic of China  separated in 1949 following a civil war But China still claims Taiwan as its territory and to this day is reported to have missiles pointed at the island Ma said he does not fear that Taiwan will become a second Hong Kong as the two were completely different cases He also admitted a soft spot for the former British colony that was also his birthplace I feel a close affinity with Hong Kong One country two systems Xi Jinping Chinas most powerful president in decades has brought new urgency to the unification issue by stating that the problem should not be pushed from generation to generation In September he expressed his firm and unwavering stance on reunification under the idea of one country two systems during a meeting with prounification delegates in Beijing Within hours Ma rejected the idea as unacceptable During the interview Ma acknowledged his counterpart in Beijing has a more highhanded posture than his predecessors And in a speech on the islands national day October 10 he urged Xi to introduce democracy for his 13 billion people  letting free elections in Hong Kong be the first step Ma has also encouraged mainland Chinese exchange students to study in Taiwan to experience its open society We have never wistfully thought that mainland China would become democratized quickly he said All our efforts in Taiwan have aimed at showing ethnic Chinese societies around the world that the imported concept of democracy can take root germinate and grow into a big tree on purely ethnic Chinese soil Chinese state media last week accused Taiwan of recruiting mainland students studying on the island as spies Soon after Taiwan banned senior officials from studying in China for national security reasons Coddling tyrants Despite his firm position against reunification Ma who took office 2008 has made more of an attempt to ease tensions with the mainland than any of his predecessors  mainly by creating closer business relations and signing a total of 21 cooperative agreements including the groundbreaking Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement ECFA Many Taiwanese companies have moved factories to China while Chinese banks now operate on the island Six years ago no direct flights existed between the island and the mainland today there are hundreds of flight a week and tourists are flooding in Victor Teo of the University of Hong Kong said Taiwans leader is making progress as he negotiates the thin line between economic pragmatism and sovereignty Ma is doing more for Taiwan in terms of democratization economic development and the preservation of autonomy than he would if he took the position of his predecessors he said I personally have a very high opinion of President Ma and I think he has the balance right His main difficulties are being accused of coddling the tyrants in Beijing of course But his critics say the relationship with Beijing has become too cozy Last spring hundreds of students of the socalled Sunflower Movement occupied Taiwans parliament in protest That led to a major trade agreement being blocked and a new souring of relations with China Ketty Chen deputy director of international affairs for the opposition proindependent Democratic Progressive Party DPP said in a recent interview that the 21 crossstrait agreements were signed too hastily and without proper review Taiwanese or Chinese Today less than 10 of people support the idea of immediate or eventual reunification  a figure that has declined consistently over the years Results of a survey by National Chengchi University in June found that 60 of respondents identified as Taiwanese  an historic high  compared to just 35 as Chinese A clear majority supports the political status quo of de facto independence Now with Beijing rejecting true democracy in Hong Kong  despite a public backlash  the idea of one country two systems seems even more unappealing to the people of Taiwan READ Whos who in the Hong Kong protests The leaders in Beijing are afraid that if they give democracy to Hong Kong then other parts of China like Xinjiang and Tibet will also ask for it said a 17year old female high school student who lives in Taipei I hope Taiwan never in my life time reunifies with China It would be very bad We would lose our freedom Her words echoed those of many ordinary people I spoke to in Taipei Many people in Taiwan want independence said a young woman called Febie who manages a small caf in Taipei Taiwans capital But thats impossible without the backing of other powerful countries like the United States I still think President Ma should be stronger against China Kristian McGuire an independent Washingtonbased researcher and volunteer with Taiwan Security Research says that if peaceful unification is going to happen it is going to have to come through a democratic process whereby millions of Taiwanese choose to join China Thus far it looks like most Taiwanese dont want reunification so long as China remains an authoritarian state with little respect for human rights he said ,0.4

CNN,world, CNN  When the United States unleashed 47 US Navy Tomahawk missiles on September 22 on suspected Khorasan Group sites to the west of Aleppo Syria one of their top targets was an unlikely figure David Drugeon a 24yearold French convert from Brittany who had become a key bombmaker for the group Intelligence suggested that Khorasan a group of veteran core al Qaeda operatives who have found sanctuary in Idlib province and surrounding areas was in the final stages of planning terrorist attacks in the West including against American aviation Among the devices Khorasans bombmakers were developing to try to beat airport security bombs made out of clothing dipped in explosive solution and explosives concealed in personal electronics US officials told CNNs Barbara Starr and Pamela Brown on Wednesday that Drugeon may have been actively involved in these efforts which also involved technology transfers from al Qaedas master bombmaker in Yemen Ibrahim al Asiri In July the Transportation Security Administration banned cell phones without electronic charge from airplane cabins in response to the intelligence much of it fragmentary coming in on the plans But the cruise missiles in September appear to have missed their mark US officials told CNN that Drugeon  and Khorasan leader Muhsin alFadhli a veteran Kuwaiti operative once close to Osama bin Laden  almost certainly survived the strikes It is unclear whether they were even at any of the locations that were targeted That has left Drugeon free to continue plotting terrorist attacks against the West His knowledge of explosives European background and access to Western fighters in Syria makes him arguably one of the most dangerous operatives in the entire global al Qaeda network Swift rise from unlikely beginnings Drugeon was born in 1989 in a bluecollar and immigrant neighborhood dotted with social housing on the outskirts of Vannes on the Atlantic coast of Brittany according to Eric Pelletier a reporter with LExpress who has extensively reported on Drugeon and shared his findings with CNN By all accounts Drugeon had a very normal childhood His father was a bus driver and his mother a secretary and committed Catholic He had an elder brother who shared his passion for the French soccer team Olympic Marseilles and he got good grades at school But like a significant number of others who later took the path to radicalization his parents divorce when he was 13 was traumatic Drugeon began acting out and his grades at school nosedived He began hanging out with a group of young Muslims in the neighborhood who espoused a fundamentalist interpretation of Islam Before he turned 14 he converted changing his name to Daoud Drugeon was radicalized over a period of several years A local imam played a key role He was part of group of about a half dozen Salafi Muslims in the town Pelletier told CNN By 2010 Drugeon was on the radar screen of French security services and had made several trips to Egypt to learn Arabic and more about Islam He funded the trips by taking driving jobs In April that year he slipped away from France for good traveling via Cairo for the tribal areas of Pakistan to join the jihad against US forces in Afghanistan According to Pelletier French intelligence established that Drugeon joined a small al Qaeda subgroup known as JundalKhilafah based in the Miran Shah area CNN understands their knowledge of his involvement in the group came partly from the interrogation of one of the groups fighters held in Kazakhstan Security sources in Kazakhstan confirmed the incarceration to CNN The group was led by Moez Garsallaoui a Francophone Tunisian operative married to Malika el Aroud a BelgianMoroccan al Qaeda living legend imprisoned for terrorism offences in Belgium whose deceased previous husband had assassinated Ahmed Shah Massoud the head of the antiTaliban Northern Alliance on bin Ladens orders two days before 911 I interviewed el Aroud and Garsallaoui for CNN in 2006 Taking tea with a terrorist From Pakistan to Syria Drugeon first learned how to make bombs in the tribal areas of Pakistan and over time became skilled in making explosives He took on a new fighting name Souleiman and made several forays into Afghanistan according to Pelletier In September 2011 Drugeon likely came into contact with a new recruit into the group a FrenchAlgerian from Toulouse named Mohammed Merah who in March 2012 would kill seven including three Jewish schoolchildren in a spree of shootings in southern France Investigations shed new light on Toulouse terrorist shootings During the short time Merah spent with the group he was offered explosives instruction but instead opted for shooting practice It is possible Drugeon helped inspire the terrorist shootings in southern France Besieged in his apartment in Toulouse in a final stand before his death Merah told French negotiators over a walkietalkie that an al Qaeda brother in Pakistan who had spent time in France helped persuade him to return to France to launch attacks Before returning to France Merah agreed with Garsallaoui that the latter could claim credit for any attack he launched back in his home country which the Tunisian operative duly did before being killed in a US drone strike later that year Drugeon is believed to have left Pakistan some time in 2013 or very early 2014 and to have traveled to Syria to join up with the Khorasan group A significant number of al Qaeda operatives were making the same journey convinced that Syria now offered a better sanctuary away from the sight lines of US drones US officials told CNN they believe Drugeon has been heavily involved in facilitating the movement of fighters back and forth from Europe and in planning attacks in Europe The potential threat from Drugeon is preoccupying the entire French intelligence establishment Pelletier told CNN The skilled French bombmaker has an unprecedented large potential pool of

CNN,allpolitics, Providence Rhode Island CNN  Tuesdays election in the littlest of states is causing the biggest of stirs When President Barack Obama hits the campaign trail here Friday to lend his star power to Jorge Elorza the firsttime candidate running in the citys deadlocked mayoral race he wont be the most famous politician in the Ocean State that day That distinction belongs to the politician running against Elorza the larger than life man whos never lost a political race the man who served as Providences mayor twice before  and who was forced to resign each time in disgrace Buddy Cianci Youre not going to get a Pulitzer Prize or an Emmy by saying Buddy Cianci is a convicted felon Cianci told CNN at his Providence headquarters this week Everybody knows that He added Im probably the most vetted candidate in America right now They know everything about me Cianci a backslapping machine politician reminiscent of a bygone era served as the citys mayor from 1975 to 1984 and then again from 1991 to 2002 epochs recalled locally as Buddy I and Buddy II Buddy I came crashing down after Cianci was convicted of using a fire log and a lit cigarette to assault a man he accused of having an affair with his wife Buddy II ended after Cianci was convicted on federal corruption charges At the end of his 2002 trial the judge rebuked Cianci before sentencing him to federal prison for five years In this mayors two administrations there has been more corruption in the city of Providence than in the history of this state said Judge Ernest Torres Cianci isnt shying away from his past Ive made mistakes in my life obviously Ive paid the price he told CNN We all stumble I stumbled That doesnt prevent me from running for officeIve done my time and I think Im a contributing member to this society and this city While Ciancis stumbles didnt prevent him from running for office his 37yearold opponent hopes that theyll prevent him from capturing it We have a storied history of corruption here in our city Elorza said at a recent press conference And those incidents of corruption are very welldocumented in Mr Ciancis administration Three former US attorneys  among them current US Sen Sheldon Whitehouse  doubled down on those sentiments urging voters to reject Cianci at a press conference they convened October 14 I would very much doubt that the return of this particular shadow would do our applications any good said Whitehouse referring to federal grant applications But for Buddy its a familiar refrain In fact its Ciancis past  warts and all  that lay at the heart of the campaign message driving the 73yearolds final rodeo  the quest for a Buddy III They can talk all they want about me and my background he said The question is if you went into a hospital and you had to have open heart surgery would you want the intern to do it or would you want the experienced doctor even though the doctor might have had a couple of problems in his life Everyone in Providence it seems has an opinion about Cianci and they typically fall into one of three categories There are those that love him such as Sandra Perrone I think of him as a Robin Hood she told CNN I just think he should be given another chance There are those that dont Buddy Cianci is someone whos very flashy said Joshua Shockly I think its all show with him theres not any substance behind what he does Then there are the conflicted Cianci is someone who is incredibly charming actually very intelligent very funny and very glib said Kent Mallard But somebody who I would never vote for for mayor I think Buddy Cianci loves this city and that he did some good things for this city added Shockly I just dont think this city needs somebody like him at this point in time where Providence and Rhode Island in general needs to take a step forward out of a past which has really kept us kind of behind everyone else That even Ciancis detractors concede that there is much to like and admire about the man reveals the underlying conflict facing voters in the city of nearly 180000 as they head to the polls on Tuesday Do they go with the candidate with a shadowy past but who nevertheless worked tirelessly to bring a once blighted neer do well city out from those very shadows Or do they go with the less experienced and younger Elorza a candidate who Obama  a politician who knows a little something about being young and inexperienced and running for office  says will will bring honest leadership to Providence A lot of positive things happened while Buddy was in office but a lot of negative things happened said resident Dennis Emsley I mean hes a celebrity he has a certain cache but there are other candidates that are more connected to whats going on in the city today and that are going to be more able to lead the city into the future and I dont think thatd be Buddy Cianci As for any other celebrity  presidential or otherwise  campaigning against a Buddy III Cianci says his opponent can have them You know what they all have in common None of them live in the city of Providence ,0.4
CNN,allpolitics, Washington CNN  Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu havent liked each other for years  they just arent bothering to hide it anymore Long time observers of the USIsraeli relationship struggle to remember when the personal chemistry between the leaders of the two countries was so bad Even the Israeli prime minister has compared their relationship to that of a bickering old couple The latest example of their dysfunctional marriage emerged Tuesday when a senior Obama administration official was quoted calling the Israeli leader a chickenst who doesnt match war talk with action The unnamed official speaking to Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg was only saying in public what key Obama aides have been muttering privately for years You have a dysfunctional relationship between Netanyahu and Obama said Aaron David Miller a former US Middle East peace negotiator A senior official with a prominent proIsrael policy organization in Washington said  These guys dont like each other they dont pretend to like each other READ White House snubs Israeli official Netanyahu offered a pointed response to the Goldberg article saying hes not prepared to make concessions that endanger our state The relationship is troubled on multiple fronts Goldberg also reported that the Israeli leader had written off the White House an insult to an administration that still has two years in office And tensions flared last week when the White House denied Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon meetings with Vice President Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry The administration tried to contain the fallout from Goldbergs story on Wednesday Alistair Baskey a spokesperson for the National Security Council said Obama and Netanyahu have forged an effective partnership and consult closely and frequently Still irritants have long tested the alliance between Washington and the Jewish state  over peace talks wars in Lebanon and Gaza settlements and Israeli military action in places like Iraq and Syria But the dislike between Netanyahu and Obama is particularly acute  and personal Goldberg lists a stunning string of insults he has heard officials fire off at Netanyahu over the years including recalcitrant myopic reactionary obtuse blustering pompous and Aspergery OPINION USIsrael quarrel doesnt point to a divorce The NetanyahuObama relationship has played out in a series of awkward photoops anonymous quotes in US and Israeli media and tense body language White House officials were apoplectic in 2011 when Netanyahu lectured Obama in the Oval Office about the history of peace talks and warned him not to fall prey to illusions The same year Obama was caught on an open mic telling thenFrench president Nicolas Sarkozy Youre fed up with him I have to deal with him every day The White House for all its official praise for the unshakeable bonds between the US and Israel blames what it sees as Netanyahus intransigence over Jewish settlement policy and his playing to a domestic political gallery for the collapse of John Kerrys peace drive with the Palestinians Key officials fumed at Netanyahus open backing for Republican Mitt Romney during Obamas reelection campaign and over what they see as interference in American politics through his strong ties to hawks in Congress But the roots of the animosity lie deeper  in sharply differing perceptions of the threat posed by Iran  an issue coming to a head with a deadline looming for a deal between Tehran and world powers next month For Obama the Iranian nuclear challenge is another crisis to be managed and a test case of his doctrine that the United States should be prepared to talk to its enemies But people familiar with Netanyahus worldview say he believes history has handed him the role of delivering the Jewish state from an existential threat posed by Tehrans nuclear ambitions Israel worries that the agreement that emerges will leave Iran as a nuclear threshold state with the materials and expertise to quickly break out and build a nuclear weapon I fervently hope that under your leadership that will not happen Netanyahu told Obama in a White House photoop this month READ US PalestinianAmerican minor killed by Israeli military The Obama administration says the kind of perfect deal envisioned by Israel which would strip Iran of centrifuges and nuclear infrastructure is not realistic and says its goal is to ensure that Tehran does not have a nuclear bomb The disagreement is likely to provoke a new political showdown over Iran in Congress where a bipartisan coalition is mulling a number of steps including further sanctions which the White House warns could scupper a deal and lead to war While the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu deteriorates it does not so far appear to be harming the fundamental relationship between their two nations That has not always been the case in the past In 1981 the Reagan administration instructed UN ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick to back a resolution criticizing Israel for an air attack on an Iraqi nuclear reactor Relations became so frayed between President George HW Bush and the administration of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir that his secretary of state James Baker told lawmakers that if Israel wanted to talk peace it should call the White House switchboard Personal relations may be fraught now with Netanyahu but Obama has never suggested watering down or delaying mostly military US aid to Israel which amounts to 3 billion a year Indeed the Obama administration asked Congress for hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for the Iron Dome antimissile system which shielded Israel from Hamas rockets during the latest Gaza war this summer Senior officials from both sides also say privately that the security relationship between the allies has never been better Miller said that Obamas spats with Netanyahu will cause hurt feelings But what do they amount to It is confined and contained to a soap operalike exchange that never leads to anything of consequence he said What this latest soap opera may amount to for the White House is an unwelcome new political row with Congress over its Israel policy  just as it is gearing up for a fight over Iran When the president discusses Israel and Iran it is sometimes hard to tell who he thinks is Americas friend and who he thinks is Americas enemy House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it was a bit rich to get a lecture by Boehner on salty language He insisted that the remarks by the official about Netanyahu did not represent the view of the administration but pledged to continue to air differences with Israel on illegitimate building That will all but ensure another bitter spat with Netanyahu soon ,0.4

CNN,allpolitics, Washington CNN  Hillary Clinton has spent the final moments of the midterm campaign season publicly deflecting the flurry of questions about her likely run for president But behind the scenes her campaign machine is quietly whirring to life Clinton insiders have begun to approach Washingtonbased Democratic operatives who may play a role in a potential campaign and are soliciting their recommendations on other possible staffers according to Democrats familiar with the conversations A number Clinton associates are compiling staffing lists according to multiple Democratic sources Michael Whouley and Minyon Moore of the Democratic communications and consulting firm Dewey Square Group are one conduit to Clintons inner circle and among the primary compilers of the campaign universe that will surround Clinton should she run The firm is led by veteran players in Clinton world Whouley was an adviser to Vice President Al Gore and a Clinton campaign aide while Moore is a longtime Clinton confidante Ginny Terzano head of communications for Dewey Square said the characterization is incorrect DSG officials have no role in a potential Clinton campaign she said Operatives at the firm are reviewing possible Clinton staffers under the guise of spitballing ideas as one Democratic source put it With a trio of proHillary superPACs  Ready for Hillary Priorities USA Action and Correct the Record  months into shoring up support a Clinton campaign is already well underway outside of her inner circle Clintons midterm campaign schedule The reality is that if you have a message and youre larger than life the organization can come together pretty quickly said Tom McMahon who served as deputy campaign director for Howard Deans 2004 campaign It can be a turnkey operation As the Clinton campaign apparatus is constructed those close to her are trying to shroud it from view wary of the glaring political spotlight that amplifies every move the former secretary of state makes There are no formal talks no one is being offered jobs one source told CNN dismissing the signs of campaign life as a lot of jockeying from Democrats who want to work on a Clinton campaign In September Clinton and her inner circle were dismayed by a leak to Politico that revealed the presence of John Podesta  former Chief of Staff to President Bill Clinton current top aide to President Barack Obama and the person favored to serve as chairman of a Hillary Clinton campaign  at meetings with proClinton super PACs this summer Huma Abedin one of Clintons closest aides has told multiple Democrats to rein in chatter about 2016 saying Clinton wants to keep attention on the midterm elections and minimize attention on a presidential run according to a Democratic source who spoke to Abedin Clinton and the small team she employs are trying to keep her out of the tarnishing political spotlight until she is ready to make a run official something Clinton will likely do by the end of winter though she would like to put it off as late as possible If theres not a competitive primary the general election starts as soon as she declares said Katie Packer Gage former deputy campaign manager for Mitt Romneys 2012 presidential run who says the challenge of a Clinton campaign will be more of what her current team is already struggling with  how do they keep her fresh for the American people Recent campaigns for viable Democratic or Republican presidential candidates were well into the preliminary phase of staffing up at this point in time with top aides already getting in line ahead of an official announcement In 2012 Matt Rhoades at the time the executive director of Mitt Romneys Political Action Committee and later Romneys campaign manager was already in early discussions with all of those who would become senior staff Well before the 2006 midterms thenSen Barack Obama had conducted preliminary discussions with and identified a number of top aides His campaign effectively went into high gear after the elections though he launched his exploratory committee in January 2007 and declared his candidacy in February But some political operatives warn not to read too much into the beginning phase of a Clinton campaign currently underway Of course the preliminary conversations should be going on said Steve Elmendorf Deputy Campaign Manager for John Kerrys 2004 campaign But there are a lot of people who have had those conversations  who thought about running for office made plans to run for office and didnt Among those believed to be part of a potential Clinton campaign Guy Cecil the current executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee appears to be one of Clintons most likely choices for campaign manager according to interviews with more than two dozen Democrats Even if Democrats dont hang onto the Senate people respect the job that hes done said one Cecils role is expected to fall under the oversight of Podesta seen as a calming force who could squash much of the internal drama that plagued Clintons 2008 campaign Podesta is expected to stay at the White House through the State of the Union according to two sources familiar with his current plans despite his initial commitment of one year service when Obama named him to his post in the West Wing last December By last Spring Robby Mook who managed the campaign that propelled Clinton fundraising guru Terry McAuliffe into the Virginia governors mansion has been on ice  as one Democrat put it  since as early as the spring according to two Democrats familiar with the discussion He was told not to make long term plans by those close to Clinton the sources say and is widely expected to play a major role in running the campaign Dennis Cheng who manages fundraising for the Clinton Foundation and served as Hillary Clintons deputy chief of protocol at the State Department is the frontrunner for finance director according to multiple Democrats

CNN,allpolitics, New Orleans CNN  To Hillary Clinton US Sen Mary Landrieu is the fighter for Louisiana who refused to let Washington turn its back on the state in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina almost 10 years ago Clinton reached back to the months and years after the 2005 hurricane killed more than 1500 people in Louisiana to praise Landrieu on Saturday at a New Orleans rally for the endangered threeterm senator She was relentless Clinton said noting that she and Landrieu were in the Senate at the time You learn a lot about a person and a leader in a moment like that And I saw Mary in action no cameras no attention just focused like a laser to take care of her people Clinton continued She never gave up If you know anything about Mary Landrieu you know that is an ingrained characteristic she doesnt shy away from a fight Landrieu is in a different kind of fight this year  a fight to keep her Senate seat against a stout challenge from Republican Rep Bill Cassidy Every national poll since the start of September has shown Cassidy besting the incumbent Clinton did her part on Saturday to knock Cassidy but never actually referred to him by name From what I have heard Marys opponent didnt really lift a finger after Isaac Clinton said using a familiar Landrieu campaign attack that cites a 2012 novote against legislation that included disaster relief money for the state after Hurricane Isaac rocked the state Clinton also subtly hit George W Bushs presidency for fumbling the response to Katrina blaming the former president for a paralyzed response to the tragedy For her part Landrieu portrayed herself as the right choice for Louisiana because her support for oil and gas women and seniors She also didnt run away from her 18years in the Senate despite polls that show a deepseeded resentment of Congress and an antiincumbent mood throughout the country I have now worked with three presidents four majority leaders and six governors Landrieu said within the first few minutes of her speech And I know how to get work done for you no matter what the line up in Washington is and no matter how gridlocked it might be Landrieu however finds herself behind in her fourth race Cassidy has sought to tie Landrieu to President Barack Obama who in much of Louisiana is markedly unpopular In nearly every ad Cassidy mention that Landrieu supports Barack Obama 97 percent of the time The attacks have worked and some polls show the Democratic senator might be past the point of Clintons saving Landrieu advisers and spokesmen on Saturday told reporters to disregard most of the polling and instead pointed to early voting totals as proof that momentum is swinging their way In particular Matthew Lehner a senior adviser to Landrieu pointed to the fact that 33 of early ballots totals have come from black voters a strong demographic for the Democrat Sen Landrieu has had tight races in all of her races said Fabien Levy the campaigns spokesman If need be we will be ready for a runoff But we are ready to win this on election night ,0.4

CNN,allpolitics, Washington CNN  Will pot politics push Florida Democrat Charlie Crist to victory on his quest to regain the governors mansion Thats what some Democrats are hoping Polls show Crist and his GOP rival current Gov Rick Scott are neckandneck A Quinnipiac University survey released Monday has Crist at 42 Scott with 41 Libertarian candidate Adrian Wyllie with 7 and 9 of likely voters still undecided Public Policy Polling released Sunday had the Crist and Scott at 44 each Crists law partner John Morgan spent millions to get an amendment to legalize medical marijuana on the ballot on Tuesday  a move some say was meant to help Crist win by boosting turnout from Democraticleaning groups Democrats in Florida privately hope that having a medical marijuana initiative on the ballot can bring out a set of voters who arent otherwise likely to vote in a midterm election said Reid Wilson a Washington Post reporter who closely follows state politics Its very political calculation and one that frankly Charlie Crists allies have put a lot of money into In a sign of a growing trend 23 states and the District of Columbia have already legalized medical marijuana Florida is not the only state where pot is on the ballot this year  voters in Alaska Oregon and Washington DC have a chance on Tuesday to approve measures legalizing recreational use of marijuana following in the footsteps of pot pioneers Washington and Colorado where weed has proved to be big business State records show marijuana sales brought in an average of roughly 332000 a month to Colorado communities in the first eight months of the year There has been some big money behind the ballot battle in the Sunshine State According to the Center for Public Integrity an estimated 47 million has been spent on television ads supporting both sides of the debate Most of that money  39 million  has been spent by opponents of the ballot measure who are financed in large part by conservative casino magnate Sheldon Adelson In contrast after a massive effort to get the measure on the ballot Morgan and his supporters have spent just 828800 on television ads urging voters to pass the amendment  a disadvantage that could prove decisive in a race that will come down to the wire That means it could be anybodys game Holder cautiously optimistic on legal pot The campaign against the amendment has been pretty aggressive and I think pretty effective based on the polls so there are a lot of people who are now actually kind of mobilizing to vote against medical marijuana initiative because they think its just problematic too many loopholes too easy for people to basically be selling marijuana out in the open said Adam Smith the political editor of the Tampa Bay Times So theres at least some speculation that rather than driving young people who are inclined to vote for it to the polls its going to motivate people who are against it to turn out which could help Rick Scott The amendment needs 60 to pass and while many polls show strong support for the initiative it is not clear that there is enough to pass it  a sign that Democrats high hopes the ballot measure could sway the race for their guy could go up in smoke Writein candidate smokes what she says is marijuana in political ad ,0.4
CNN,allpolitics, Washington CNN  Republicans chances of winning control of the Senate in Tuesdays midterm elections are now up to 95 according to CNNs Pivit an analysis that combines experts projections with political watchers predictions on key races The jump was driven largely by a Des Moines Register poll over the weekend that put Republican Joni Ernst 7 percentage points ahead of Democrat Bruce Braley in a Senate race seen as a mustwin for Democrats In that race Pivit puts Ernsts chances at 88 Pivit also offers bad news for Democratic Sen Mark Udall in Colorado whose chances are at just 6 and Sen Mark Pryor in Arkansas whos down to 2 Pivits analysis suggests Democrats are in better shape in North Carolina where Sen Kay Hagan has a 69 chance of holding off Republican challenger Thom Tillis and in New Hampshire where Sen Jeanne Shaheens chances of beating Scott Brown are up to 81 Republicans meanwhile look to have put Kentuckys Senate race out of reach Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnells chances of surviving a challenge from Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes are up to 97 Republicans need a net gain of six seats to capture a majority Pickups in Montana South Dakota and West Virginia are all but assured and Democratic incumbents are facing uphill battles in Alaska Arkansas and Louisiana as well Republicans are also hoping for wins in states like Colorado Iowa New Hampshire and North Carolina  which would help solidify their chances of gaining a majority by providing insulation in case the GOP loses seats of its own in Georgia and Kansas ,0.4
CNN,allpolitics, Editors note Sally Kohn is an activist columnist and television commentator Follow her on Twitter sallykohn The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author  CNN  Conservatives cant bash and slash government and then suddenly act surprised if government isnt there when we need it After all antigovernment rhetoric and antitax austerity have reallife consequences  consequences playing out at this very moment in the public health response to Ebola Unfortunately Republicans have been attacking for decades In his memoir former President Richard Nixon wrote that the institutions of government had to be either reformed replaced or circumvented Former President Ronald Reagan for his part said Government is like a baby An alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other Such conceptual attacks on government by conservatives have gone hand in hand with a political agenda of austerity cloaking antigovernment sentiment in the language of deficit reduction in order to rationalize cutting spending And while both parties jumped on the austerity bandwagon including President Barack Obama conservatives birthed and raised the idea from conception As Thomas Edsall wrote in the New York Times The politics of austerity are inherently favorable to conservatives and inhospitable to liberals Specifically while both parties contributed to an overall cut in spending over the past decade when accounting for inflation for the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the antigovernment austerity politics behind such cuts are wholly a reflection and manifestation of conservative ideology At the same time taxes are habitually attacked by conservative politicians and activists as wasteful unnecessary  even offensive  to the American people They call it punishing success rather than providing for the common good and the defense of others less successful Over a decade ago the antitax crusader Grover Norquist famously declared I dont want to abolish government I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub Well Mr Norquist a government gasping for air isnt exactly in the best position to protect us when we need it Conservatives have been cheering for the failure of government all along If it fails us now make no mistake about it  conservatives are getting exactly what they hoped for The fascinating thing is that some Republicans will insist that in spite of all their budget cuts and the fact that the federal deficit is at its lowest point in six years government is still too big They argue that if the government isnt handling the Ebola situation well its because government is too large or its priorities are misplaced Just look at the narrative being spread by conservative outlets and tweeters that the National Institutes of Health might have come up with an Ebola vaccine by now had it not been spending money on research about why lesbians are generally more obese than gay men Of course they ignore the inconvenient context That study is only 008 of the much larger amount the NIH spends researching obesity in general  and obesity remains a greater threat to most Americans health than Ebola To take another example Republicans have spent the last several years condemning the role of government in health care Now theyre demanding government step up and play an intensified role Yet consider that Thomas Eric Duncan showed up at a Dallas hospital with symptoms of Ebola but was turned away with just antibiotics and some Tylenol He didnt have health insurance But surely if this outbreak teaches us anything it is that our health depends on everyone have access to affordable quality medical care True the CDC needs to revise its guidelines and procedures for Ebola But in Dallas we saw very clearly that a private health system wont be able to save us Thats why its called public health In an oped for CNN Florida Republican Sen Marco Rubio wrote that many Americans lack confidence in our governments ability to effectively confront crises If so that is in no small part because Republicans like Rubio have systematically undermined that confidence Of course a nation that has for decades been fed the message Government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem is now wary of government playing a greater role in trying to assist Yet once upon a time it was clear that government could actually make our lives better  from postrecession programs that invested in American jobs and infrastructure to laws that helped returning veterans go to college and afford homes Sadly for the past generation or so Republicans have attacked the very idea of government while implementing policies that erode its effectiveness making their prophecies of government failure selffulfilling It is only when something like Ebola happens that Americans realize how much we actually need government to work on our behalf But if that is to happen it requires not just the resources but lawmakers acting in good faith If we want government to succeed when we need it stop setting it up to fail Read CNNOpinions new Flipboard magazine Follow us on Twitter CNNOpinion Join us on FacebookcomCNNOpinion ,0.4
CNN,allpolitics, Editors note Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow He is the author of Jimmy Carter and the forthcoming book The Fierce Urgency of Now Lyndon Johnson Congress and the Battle for the Great Society The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author  CNN  Sen Elizabeth Warren has just been handed a giant political opportunity After spending several years championing the cause of the consumer and railing against the power of big banks the Massachusetts Democrat may be perfectly positioned to react to the revelation of secretly taped conversations within the Federal Reserve that have exposed the cozy relationship that exists between the regulators in Washington and the regulated on Wall Street The tapes which were made in 2012 involve examiners for the New York Federal Reserve who are heard being protective and deferential to Goldman Sachs when discussing some financial transactions that the firm had undertaken Their actions were said to be legal but shady One of the Federal Reserve officials on the tape explains that they should not be too tough with the banks to make sure the lines of communication remain open in the future We dont want to discourage Goldman from disclosing these types of things in the future and therefore maybe you know some comment that says dont mistake our inquisitiveness and our desire to understand more about the marketplace in general as a criticism of you as a firm necessarily The tapes have shocked many listeners because they reveal how weak the rules are and even worse how the regulators dont have much interest in being tough with the banks Years after the horrendous financial collapse of 2008 that led to international economic havoc Washington is not doing very much to improve the situation There have been many critics of the DoddFrank legislation who have warned that the law fell short but to actually hear these conversations has a more powerful impact As Warren said on an interview with NPRs Morning Edition when people listen to the tapes for a moment they get to be the fly on the wall that watches all of it and there it is to be exposed to everyone the cozy relationship the fact that the Fed is more concerned about its relationship with a toobigtofail bank than it is with protecting the American public Warren who was instrumental to the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reacted to the substance of the tape by arguing that the point of these tapes is that the regulators are backing off long before anyones in court making a legal argument about whether or not they came right up to the line or they crossed over the line She has called for oversight hearings as soon as possible The weakness of our regulatory system for finance is an issue that deserves attention and it is a policy problem that attracts the interest of liberals conservatives and moderates all of whom have been stung by the economic toll of the financial meltdown Anger toward the banking system is one of the few issues that provides a common thread between the disparate parts of our political world Tea party Republicans hate the intimate connections between banking and politicians as much as do leftwing Democrats If Warren handles oversight hearings on this problem in the right way they could attract huge interest and really define who she is as a national politician right as the 2016 presidential race heats up In this case politics and policy can work hand in hand Given the widespread concern about this problem and Warrens skill at handling this issue these could shape up to be hearings that have the same kind of impact as Sen William Fulbrights classic interrogation of officials about Lyndon Johnsons Vietnam policies in 1966 or the select committee investigation of Watergate in 1973 when Sen Sam Ervin revealed all the wrongs that Richard Nixon had committed Right now the Democratic playing field for 2016 is more fluid than many think While former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton assuming she runs would be a formidable candidate and a clear frontrunner there is also still room for another candidate to challenge her and potentially to rise to the top of the pack While many names have been mentioned like Maryland Gov Martin OMalley or former Virginia Sen James Webb nobody other than Clinton generates the kind of excitement as does Elizabeth Warren Clinton exposed some of her own vulnerabilities during the roll out for her book Hard Choices and there still remains big questions as to whether Democrats will want a fresher voice one who speaks more directly to the populist economic tradition of the party as their candidate While today it seems inevitable that she will be the partys nominee in 2016 Hillary Clinton learned in 2008 that inevitable doesnt always cut it Warren has said that she wont run for the presidency But these kinds of statements rarely are the best way to predict what a candidate will actually do The Fed tapes might prove to be the development that moves her to the front and center of the public eye Oversight hearings would be a way to expose her to a large national audience and to demonstrate that she is deeply invested in solving the economic problems that have harmed the security of Americans and been at the heart of the laggard economic conditions that define our era Warren has been a huge attraction on the campaign trail during the past few months speaking about these very issues and promising to devote her time to this cause Ever since Massachusetts Sen Ted Kennedy died Democrats have not been able to find a new liberal lion to champion the progressive economic traditions that been so integral to the party since the New Deal President Obama who many Democrats thought would be that person has failed to live up to expectations He surrounded himself with economic advisors who were comfortable with the status quo and whose pragmatism pushed him away from the bolder policies that the Democratic base hoped for Now with the disclosure of these tapes Warren has a very real chance to prove to Democrats that she is the new voice Read CNNOpinions new Flipboard magazine Follow us on Twitter CNNOpinion Join us on FacebookcomCNNOpinion ,0.4
CNN,allpolitics, Washington CNN  Now at last America gets to decide Millions of people are casting votes nationwide in an election that could hand Republicans the Senate after a nasty negative campaign that cost nearly 4 billion Voters are encountering some hiccups as they head to the polls In Georgia home to a competitive Senate and governors race a state website that provides poll location information was down Connecticut Gov Dan Malloy is seeking to extend voting hours after problems were reported at Hartford polling stations In North Carolina where Democratic Sen Kay Hagan is in a tight race to beat Republican challenger Thom Tillis long lines were reported in Mecklenburg County which includes Charlotte There are lines all over the place said Kristin Mavromatis with the Mecklenburg County Board of Elections Not quite as long as the line at the Cheesecake Factory but there are lines READ A viewers guide to the election Meanwhile a winter storm in Maine prompted a state of emergency and left 85000 customers without power on Tuesday morning Heavy rain is expected in Texas Oklahoma and Arkansas where Democratic Sen Mark Pryor is in a tough battle for reelection Republicans need a net gain of six seats to claim the Senate and polls consistently suggest momentum is moving in their favor A GOP win would give the party full control of Congress for the first time since George W Bush was in the White House Republican dominance on Capitol Hill could quickly transform President Barack Obama into a lame duck constantly at war with Congress on everything from health care to energy and spending And it would set the tone for the 2016 presidential election by pitting the competing priorities of both parties against each other What we are seeing around the country from one coast to another is a lot of Republican momentum a lot of desire for change in Washington Republican National Committee Communications Director Sean Spicer told CNNs New Day on Tuesday Spicers Democratic counterpart Mo Elleithee took comfort in the fact that many Senate races despite being in traditional Republican territory are still up for grabs A couple of months ago people thought Republicans were going to run away with this thing in these states but we are finding them too close to call he said Republicans sought to turn the election in which they are also expected to fatten their majority in the House of Representatives into a referendum on Obamas unpopularity amid criticism of his handling of crises over Ebola ISIS and the sluggish economic recovery Democrats hammered Republican candidates on local issues and their record on womens health and workplace equality while branding their foes as oblivious to the struggles of the middle class All eyes this evening will be on seats currently held by Democrats that Republicans need to capture to flip the Senate including in Iowa New Hampshire North Carolina Arkansas Colorado and Alaska READ Second guessing the avoidObama strategy There could be many tensionpacked hours before the fate of the Senate is decided In Alaska for example where Democratic Sen Mark Begich is in a tight race polls will not close until 1 AM on the east coast Runoff elections meanwhile will be needed in Georgia and Louisiana if no candidate gets to the 50 threshold That means that if things remain tight the fate of the Senate could be in limbo for weeks Final polls in the decisive states showed Republican Joni Ernst in a dead heat in Iowa with Democrat Bruce Braley  although one Des Moines Register survey over the weekend electrified Republicans by putting her up seven points In Colorado which Obama also won twice Democratic incumbent Sen Mark Udall is behind after apparently failing to define his GOP opponent Cory Gardner as an enemy of young women In New Hampshire Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen is in a dead heat with Republican challenger Scott Brown and Pryor will lose his Arkansas seat if the polls prove accurate READ How presidential contenders are spending Election Night In Kentucky Mitch McConnell expects to wake up on Wednesday morning as the next leader of the US Senate after a scorched earth reelection race against Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes But Democrats hope to turn the tables on Republicans in Georgia where Michelle Nunn mounted a strong campaign for a Senate seat that has been in GOP hands since 2002 Still she hasnt cleared the 50 threshold in polls that would be needed to avoid a runoff Hagan of North Carolina may also be in position to defy her Republican foe after a nail biter of a campaign Republicans are also sweating the race in Kansas where a stumbling reelection bid by Sen Pat Roberts risks being overtaken by independent Greg Orman Orman hasnt said which party he would caucus with in Washington and his win could set the GOP back in its bid to win a majority I am not going there to represent the Democratic Party or represent the Republican Party he told CNN Tuesday I am going there to represent Kansas Senate races in West Virginia Montana and South Dakota meanwhile are considered Republican locks Even if Republicans win Senate control they will fall short of the 60 vote supermajority needed to overcome likely Democratic obstruction tactics But there could be a small window for possible compromise on issues like trade deals and tax reform before the presidential campaign shakes up the political environment Some fascinating gubernatorial races will also be decided Tuesday including in Florida where former Republican Gov Charlie Crist is running as a Democrat against Gov Rick Scott In Kansas Gov Sam Brownback is in danger of losing amid a backlash against his hard core conservatism Liberal Massachusetts could elect a Republican governor and Ohios John Kasich is expected to be reelected ahead of a potential presidential bid READ Dems put up brave face The 2016 race effectively gets under way on Wednesday morning and potential candidates mounted marathon midterm campaign swings to road test their messages New Jersey Republican Gov Chris Christie proved his political stamina during the election season while Jeb Bush eased himself back into the spotlight and Rand Paul was everywhere Wisconsins Republican governor Scott Walker must endure a nerve jangling reelection bid before he can dream of the White House For Democrats Bill and Hillary Clinton threw themselves into the midterm races ahead of her likely 2016 campaign But one man was largely absent from the fray  the president himself Obama will watch results tonight from the White House and a Republican triumph would inevitably be seen as a repudiation of his presidency and pose tough questions for his administration The elections are contesting a third of the seats in the 100 member Senate all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and there are also 36 gubernatorial races on the ballot READ 7 things that will almost definitely happen on

CNN,allpolitics, Washington CNN  The fate of endangered Democrats vulnerable Republicans and control of the Senate will be decided in a matter of hours Tuesday as voters across the country head to the polls to chart the direction of the country for the next two years That is of course assuming control of the Senate does not hinge on razorthin victories that trigger recounts and possibly runoff elections in two states Election Night will deliver clarity as well as confusion There will of course be individual winners and losers and the GOP is expected to easily hold if not build upon its majority in the House But the great unknown is which party will control the Senate  an important detail that will greatly influence President Barack Obamas final two years in office Republicans need a net gain of six seats to win control of the Senate and momentum seems to be in their direction With polls opening across the country Election Day could also offer fresh evidence that the angry antiincumbent mood extends well beyond Washington as the fate of several embattled governors will be decided on this night We may also witness the rebirth of a handful of political dynasties as well as the crushing defeats of two highprofile and muchhyped Democratic candidates Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis and former American Idol star Clay Aiken who is seeking a congressional seat in North Carolina And as the dust settles in the early morning hours of Wednesday attention will turn to the next presidential and congressional elections that will occur just two years from now Thats assuming control of the Senate will not hinge on recounts and runoffs in Georgia and Louisiana To help guide you through the day and night here are key moments to watch for to help make sense of an evening that can be equally overwhelming and exciting All Day Controversy is the fuel that powers politics It sparks discussions excites activists and forces change Yet it has a dark underside on Election Day  especially when there are charges of voter intimidation In the past supporters of both political parties have been accused of strong arm nefarious tactics Long lines an insufficient number of ballots at polling locations and possible calls for judicial intervention to keep polls open could make for a messy confusing and frustrating Election Day 5 pm ET We will start receiving results from the exit polls  surveys that people take at designated polling locations after voting as well as phone surveys among millions of early voters The preliminary data will likely provide a window into voters thoughts about the most important problems facing the country and what specifically they think about key issues such as the economy health care immigration and terrorism 6 pm ET Polls begin to close in Kentucky which holds one of the most watched Senate races of this midterm election Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell is locked in a competitive reelection battle with Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes a candidate Democrats hope can topple the minority leader 7 pm ET A dual focus on Kentucky and Georgia which features the two best pick up opportunities for Senate Democrats Winning one of these seats would take a little pressure off of Democrats who are playing defense for the remainder of the night Knocking off McConnell would provide an added psychological boost for Democrats but public polling shows that he has a single digit lead at this point in the race In Georgia there are two Democrats hoping to build upon their families political legacies Michelle Nunn daughter of former Sen Sam Nunn is running for the Senate seat vacated by GOP Sen Saxby Chambliss Jason Carter grandson of former President Jimmy Carter is seeking the governors office  the launching pad for his grandfathers successful presidential bid But both contests are so close there is a belief that each race could go to a runoff if the candidates fail to receive more than 50 of the vote If this happens Carter would face off again against Gov Nathan Deal on Dec 2 Nunn and her Republican opponent David Perdue would face the voters again on January 6 730 pm ET Republicans have their first real solid opportunity to win a Democratic seat in the open race to succeed Sen Jay Rockefeller Republican Rep Shelley Moore Capito and Democratic Secretary of State Natalie Tennant are the respective nominees for their political parties North Carolina will be closely watched as Sen Kay Hagan a Democrat is trying to hold off an attempt by House Speaker Thom Tillis to send her home after one term A victory by Republicans in North Carolina would be one of many critical building blocks the GOP is looking for to take back the Senate majority As a pop culture side note Aiken will learn if his American Idol stardom can transform into a congressional victory Spoiler alert its unlikely 8 pm ET  9 pm ET Polls across the country are closing in this hour and in terms of the Senate majority the focus broadens to New Hampshire and Arkansas In the Granite State polls close at 8 pm ET and Democratic Sen Jeanne Shaheen is facing former Massachusetts GOP Sen Scott Brown in what has turned into an ugly campaign Polling shows the race to be tight and a Republican victory would be devastating to Democrats A half hour later polls close in Arkansas where Democratic Sen Mark Pryor is battling Republican Rep Tom Cotton Arkansas is one of several seats that the GOP has a chance of winning In this hour we may begin to see the antiincumbent mood spread to the states Governors in five states  Connecticut Florida Illinois Maine and Pennsylvania  are in danger of losing reelection And we may see a Republican reclaim the governorship in deep blue Massachusetts a position Mitt Romney once held 9 pm ET Voting will end in Kansas a state Republicans should not have to be defending Embattled Sen Pat Roberts is trying to win a fourth term but questions regarding his Kansas residency has put him on the political ropes The twist in this race is that the Democratic candidate dropped out in order to give Independent Greg Orman a chance to win It is unclear if Orman will align himself politically with Senate Democrats if he defeats Roberts but it is one of the most intriguing contests of the night In South Dakota it appears as if Republicans have turned around Gov Mike Rounds campaign  a needed victory in their quest for six seats Colorado is another seat Democrats need to win in order to maintain their majority but Sen Mark Udall is in danger of losing to GOP Rep Cory Gardner The Louisiana Senate race features eight candidates including Democratic Sen Mary Landrieu  and it is unlikely to be decided until the Dec 6 runoff Davis high profile low polling bid to be the next Texas governor is likely to end in defeat But the first legacy victory of the night is expected to happen when George P Bush son of Florida Gov Jeb Bush grandson of former President George H W Bush nephew of former President George W Bush wins the race to become the next Texas Land Commissioner And we have another chance to see if the antiincumbent mood is pulsating beyond the Beltway as four more governors in Colorado Kansas Michigan and Wisconsin are in danger of losing reelection Keep an eye on Wisconsin Gov Scott Walkers race  a defeat would all but end any plans he may have in running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination 10 pm ET Republicans are expected to easily win the Montana Senate seat and have a shot of picking up the Iowa Senate seat Both seats are currently held by retiring Democrats A loss in Montana is expected while a defeat in Iowa would be a major blow to the Democrats ability to keep the Senate 11 pm ET Polls in the most populous state California close and Gov Jerry Brown is expected to easily win reelection Oregon begins releasing real vote totals and Democratic Sen Jeff Merkley is expected to defeat GOP challenger Monica Wehby Polls begin to close in Alaska 1 am ET Voting ends in the US as the final Alaska polls close Depending on what happens earlier in the evening the fate of the Senate majority

CNN,allpolitics, Washington CNN  Happy Election Day America Things have changed since the last time everyone went to the polls Then Barack Obama was reelected to a second fouryear term Now hes been largely benched by his party spending less time on the campaign trail than his much more popular wife first lady Michelle Obama former president Bill Clinton and potential future presidential candidate Hillary Clinton Midterm elections are more local affairs and the issues vary from contest to contest But midterms have national consequences and what happens Tuesday will help determine what President Obama can get done in his final two years in office It will tee up the coming 2016 presidential contest and give Americans the chance to try on a more powerful GOP as they start to think about who should be the next president But first comes Tuesday and here is whats going to happen 1  There will be a surprise  Something were listing below wont end up happening This is an election and it isnt over yet Voters are fickle and polls arent perfect and predictions are even less so So tune in to CNN Politics all day and night Tuesday We will be here and it will be exciting Related Sound like a political junkie with these 2014 midterm facts 2 Most Americans wont take part  Really it will be exciting on Tuesday But most Americans wont have taken part in the election Somewhere between 55 and 65 of eligible Americans vote in a presidential election about 130 million people in 2012 Far fewer  between 39 and 42 of Americans take part in a midterm election about 90 million in 2010 A recent focus group of moms conducted by a group affiliated with Walmart suggested they would bone up for their votes by Googling candidates the night before Voter excitement is actually down from 2010 the last midterm election according to the most recent CNN  ORC Poll That poll also suggested voters are angry at their political process and at Washington DC either because they see their votes as not accomplishing change or they see the current logjam in Washington as intractable Either way less than half the eligible population is likely to show up and let their voices be heard in this election Related Key 2014 races 3  Democrats will lose the Senate  Okay this one is not a sure thing And Vice President Biden at least is still saying Democrats will keep their majority in the Senate on Tuesday But all indications are that the GOP will gain seats and most likely enough for a slim Senate majority Republicans need to gain six seats to win the majority in the Senate There are three seats that were long held by retiring or already retired Democrats in which a Republican is now heavily favored  South Dakota West Virginia and Montana Among the rest of the races that CNN considers to be tossup or leaning toward the GOP 7 of them are held by Democrats Just three are held by Republicans Republicans have eaten away at Democrats majority in each election since Democrats had a filibuster proof majority when President Obama was first elected in 2008 Related Pivit  95 percent chance Republicans take Senate control Related Senate math seems impossible to some Democrats 4  Republicans will elect an AfricanAmerican senator in the South  Tim Scott is already a senator He was appointed after Sen Jim DeMint retired from office to lead a GOP think tank So it will be overlooked as an historical moment Tuesday night but when he wins the race  he is heavily favored  Scott will become the first African American elected by popular vote as a senator from the South and only the fifth African American elected to the Senate ever Scotts election while historic is not expected to change the fact that minorities generally support Democrats although Republicans to great fanfare have made public efforts to rebrand themselves and draw in more support with new demographics Look to some of the younger leading GOP voices  Sens Rand Paul and Marco Rubio both leap to mind  to carry this effort forward 5  There will be a runoff  Two states with tight Senate races create the possibility for runoff contests In both states if no candidate gets more than 50 of the vote the top two candidates head to a runoff In both states there are three or more candidates and in neither state is any candidate getting more than 50 in recent polling In Louisiana the runoff would take place Dec 6th In Georgia the runoff would take place Jan 6th Both races are extremely tight and with a slim Senate majority in the balance it is possible to not know who controls the Senate for two

 Not too much will change  Yes there might be a new Senate majority Yes Republicans will likely control both houses on Capitol Hill They will control the schedule of the Senate floor and theyll control what hearings will be held in both the House and the Senate It will be even more difficult for President Obama to get a potential Supreme Court nominee a confirmation vote if a vacancy should arise But Democrats will still have well more than the 40 votes theyll need to block just about any legislation they want If what angers you about Washington  remember voters are angry  is that

CNN,allpolitics, Washington CNN  Top Democratic strategists in Washington are already beginning one of the citys oldest traditions  secondguessing a losing election strategy before what is expected to be a stinging defeat in Tuesdays midterm elections One of the key debates to emerge is whether Democratic candidates were too cautious in avoiding President Barack Obama at all costs Running away from the president is never smart said one top Democratic strategist who has worked with both the White House and Senate candidates this midterm cycle You look like chicken s the strategist added on condition of anonymity A White House official who also asked not to be named so he could speak freely argued Democrats still have a chance to hold the Senate We dont think anything is done until election day the official said in an email that included election day polls in 2012 that showed the president tied with Mitt Romney Obama went on to win a decisive victory Still the conventional wisdom to banish the president from key Senate battlegrounds in favor of either Bill and Hillary Clinton Vice President Joe Biden and even First Lady Michelle Obama made sense to most Senate Democratic campaigns The presidents low approval numbers plus the conservative terrain at risk for Democrats in Arkansas Alaska and Louisiana was a toxic combination as another top strategist put it The problem with that approach according to Democratic midterm secondguessers is that it left the party with little to offer voters I am becoming convinced that many Democrats made a mistake in trying to run away from President Obama and the Democratic party agenda said Jim Manley a former spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid How is the base supposed to get excited when elected Democrats are going to such great length to put as much distance as the can between them and a president that was elected twice by the American people Manley asked One of the lasting memories of the 2014 midterm elections will likely be Kentucky Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes refusal to say whether she even voted for Obama She was an Obama delegate complained one strategist about Grimes Of course she voted for him The president did not want to tell candidates how to run their campaigns his aides said Instead Obama appeared almost exclusively with Democratic gubernatorial candidates But his message was clearly aimed at firing up his partys base Obama has consistently prodded Democrats to get off the couch take their cousin Pookie with them and vote Democrats the president has argued time and again have a congenital defect when it comes to casting ballots in midterms The number of eligible voters who vote typically in a midterm is like in the 30s I mean Ukraine just went through an election  they got a war going on they had about 60 percent turnout Obama said Sunday of the percentage of Americans who go to the polls in midterm elections There is no excuse for us to just give away our power If you wonder why things dont happen if you wonder why sometimes elected officials dont seem responsive its because so many of us stay at home he added at an event with Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf Despite that feisty tone Obama remained behind closed doors Monday one day before the midterms Also missing are any mentions of the presidents record Obama no longer uses the line about his polices being on the ballot on Tuesday after some of his supporters complained publicly But other strategists worry the aversion to all things Obama went too far noting few Democratic candidates have spent much time pointing to the lowering unemployment rate among a range of hopeful economic indicators Many Democratic candidates blurred the choice so much that voters figured well if Im going to have a choice between two Republicans I might as will choose the one that calls themselves one griped a party operative Candidates also matter several seasoned Democratic operatives argued Iowa Democratic Senate candidate Bruce Braleys gaffe in describing the states popular Republican Sen Charles Grassley as an Iowa farmer who never went to law school was a key mistake according to one strategist A Braley loss to his Republican challenger Joni Ernst would give the GOP two Senate seats in a state Obama won twice after he defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Iowa caucuses In a sign of just how much his Iowa star power has faded in six years the president was never called in to campaign on behalf of Braley In addition the president was kept out of Colorado and New Hampshire two states he also captured in 2008 and 2012 Ben LaBolt a former Obama White House and campaign spokesman maintained Democrats are striking the right balance It makes little sense to publicly deploy him in states he didnt win LaBolt said However he can and is doing surgical things to help Democratic candidates like fundraising and rallying the young and diverse constituencies that carried him to victory and could make the difference in close races ,0.4
CNN,allpolitics, Washington CNN  Republicans are spending the final weekend of campaigning before Tuesdays election sizing up the possibility of their first Senate majority in nearly a decade but with key races still too close to call Latest polls show some critical Senate races tightening guaranteeing a night of drama and suspense on Tuesday as Republicans strive for a net gain of six seats to capture the chamber A GOP victory would give the party complete control on Capitol Hill and the ability to constrain President Barack Obamas final two years in office But the best the GOP can hope for is a slim majority which would do little to end the era of gridlock and partisan division that has stifled Washington for years and contributed to an ugly public mood ahead of the election READ How Mitch McConnell would run the Senate  Even if they win on Tuesday there is no scenario in which Republicans will gain enough senators to build a 60 seat supermajority that is needed to move major legislation in a deeply partisan Congress Some races are so tight that turnout will be crucial In Iowa a CNNORC International poll had Republican Joni Ernst up by two points as she tries to grab a Senate seat held by the retiring Tom Harkin for nearly 30 years In North Carolina Democratic Sen Kay Hagan is clinging to a twopoint margin in a state that leans Republican in another CNN survey In Kentucky Sen Mitch McConnell the man in line to cap a long career on Capitol Hill by becoming Senate majority leader if Republicans win on Tuesday appears to have opened a small gap over his Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes The GOP has a solid grip on the House and Republicans are expected to easily win Senate races in South Dakota Montana and West Virginia Other battlegrounds are in Alaska Arkansas Louisiana New Hampshire Georgia and Colorado READ Poll Republican Ernst has small lead in tight Iowa Senate race Top party surrogates and potential 2016 presidential candidates were fanning out in battleground states with three days to go Hillary Clinton appeared with Grimes in Kentucky and pleaded with voters not to heed fear tactics from Republicans she called the guardians of gridlock Dont wake up the day after the election wishing you had done just a little more Clinton told Grimes supporters On Sunday Clinton will take her turnout machine to New Hampshire to support Sen Jeanne Shaheen who is in a surprisingly close tussle with challenger Scott Brown Her husband Bill Clinton meanwhile tried to give Democrat Bruce Braley a boost in Iowa on Saturday New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was headlining a rally in Ohio for Republican Governor John Kasich who is seeking reelection Obama who has been a drag on Democratic candidates was nevertheless headed to Michigan on Saturday to campaign for Senate candidate Gary Peters and Representative Mark Schauer Georgia will meanwhile on Sunday hold the final debate before election day of a compelling race between Michelle Nunn and Republican David Perdue in which Democrats are hopeful of pulling off a shock win Two Senate races in Louisiana and Georgia could trigger runoff elections so it is possible the fate of the chamber will be in limbo for weeks READ Poll Hagan holds slim lead in North Carolina Senate race ,0.4

CNN,allpolitics, Washington CNN  Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu havent liked each other for years  they just arent bothering to hide it anymore Long time observers of the USIsraeli relationship struggle to remember when the personal chemistry between the leaders of the two countries was so bad Even the Israeli prime minister has compared their relationship to that of a bickering old couple The latest example of their dysfunctional marriage emerged Tuesday when a senior Obama administration official was quoted calling the Israeli leader a chickenst who doesnt match war talk with action The unnamed official speaking to Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg was only saying in public what key Obama aides have been muttering privately for years You have a dysfunctional relationship between Netanyahu and Obama said Aaron David Miller a former US Middle East peace negotiator A senior official with a prominent proIsrael policy organization in Washington said  These guys dont like each other they dont pretend to like each other READ White House snubs Israeli official Netanyahu offered a pointed response to the Goldberg article saying hes not prepared to make concessions that endanger our state The relationship is troubled on multiple fronts Goldberg also reported that the Israeli leader had written off the White House an insult to an administration that still has two years in office And tensions flared last week when the White House denied Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon meetings with Vice President Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry The administration tried to contain the fallout from Goldbergs story on Wednesday Alistair Baskey a spokesperson for the National Security Council said Obama and Netanyahu have forged an effective partnership and consult closely and frequently Still irritants have long tested the alliance between Washington and the Jewish state  over peace talks wars in Lebanon and Gaza settlements and Israeli military action in places like Iraq and Syria But the dislike between Netanyahu and Obama is particularly acute  and personal Goldberg lists a stunning string of insults he has heard officials fire off at Netanyahu over the years including recalcitrant myopic reactionary obtuse blustering pompous and Aspergery OPINION USIsrael quarrel doesnt point to a divorce The NetanyahuObama relationship has played out in a series of awkward photoops anonymous quotes in US and Israeli media and tense body language White House officials were apoplectic in 2011 when Netanyahu lectured Obama in the Oval Office about the history of peace talks and warned him not to fall prey to illusions The same year Obama was caught on an open mic telling thenFrench president Nicolas Sarkozy Youre fed up with him I have to deal with him every day The White House for all its official praise for the unshakeable bonds between the US and Israel blames what it sees as Netanyahus intransigence over Jewish settlement policy and his playing to a domestic political gallery for the collapse of John Kerrys peace drive with the Palestinians Key officials fumed at Netanyahus open backing for Republican Mitt Romney during Obamas reelection campaign and over what they see as interference in American politics through his strong ties to hawks in Congress But the roots of the animosity lie deeper  in sharply differing perceptions of the threat posed by Iran  an issue coming to a head with a deadline looming for a deal between Tehran and world powers next month For Obama the Iranian nuclear challenge is another crisis to be managed and a test case of his doctrine that the United States should be prepared to talk to its enemies But people familiar with Netanyahus worldview say he believes history has handed him the role of delivering the Jewish state from an existential threat posed by Tehrans nuclear ambitions Israel worries that the agreement that emerges will leave Iran as a nuclear threshold state with the materials and expertise to quickly break out and build a nuclear weapon I fervently hope that under your leadership that will not happen Netanyahu told Obama in a White House photoop this month READ US PalestinianAmerican minor killed by Israeli military The Obama administration says the kind of perfect deal envisioned by Israel which would strip Iran of centrifuges and nuclear infrastructure is not realistic and says its goal is to ensure that Tehran does not have a nuclear bomb The disagreement is likely to provoke a new political showdown over Iran in Congress where a bipartisan coalition is mulling a number of steps including further sanctions which the White House warns could scupper a deal and lead to war While the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu deteriorates it does not so far appear to be harming the fundamental relationship between their two nations That has not always been the case in the past In 1981 the Reagan administration instructed UN ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick to back a resolution criticizing Israel for an air attack on an Iraqi nuclear reactor Relations became so frayed between President George HW Bush and the administration of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir that his secretary of state James Baker told lawmakers that if Israel wanted to talk peace it should call the White House switchboard Personal relations may be fraught now with Netanyahu but Obama has never suggested watering down or delaying mostly military US aid to Israel which amounts to 3 billion a year Indeed the Obama administration asked Congress for hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for the Iron Dome antimissile system which shielded Israel from Hamas rockets during the latest Gaza war this summer Senior officials from both sides also say privately that the security relationship between the allies has never been better Miller said that Obamas spats with Netanyahu will cause hurt feelings But what do they amount to It is confined and contained to a soap operalike exchange that never leads to anything of consequence he said What this latest soap opera may amount to for the White House is an unwelcome new political row with Congress over its Israel policy  just as it is gearing up for a fight over Iran When the president discusses Israel and Iran it is sometimes hard to tell who he thinks is Americas friend and who he thinks is Americas enemy House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it was a bit rich to get a lecture by Boehner on salty language He insisted that the remarks by the official about Netanyahu did not represent the view of the administration but pledged to continue to air differences with Israel on illegitimate building That will all but ensure another bitter spat with Netanyahu soon ,0.4
CNN,allpolitics, CNN  It might not be the term that Republican Party leaders prefer but Sen Rand Paul had a choice word about the GOPs brand It sucks While in Michigan on Wednesday spreading his message about building a more inclusive party Paul  as he has many times before acknowledged that Republicans need to collectively improve their image Remember Dominos Pizza They admitted Hey our pizza crust sucks The Republican Party brand sucks and so people dont want to be a Republican and for 80 years AfricanAmericans have had nothing to do with Republicans the Kentucky Republican said according to The Hill His comments came in remarks at a GOP field office in a predominantly black neighborhood in Detroit The Dominos analogy is a staple in his speeches about broadening the partys appeal but he hasnt been quite as candid in his use of language Earlier this month Paul told CNNs Wolf Blitzer that the biggest mistake Republicans have made in the past several decades is not aggressively courting AfricanAmerican votes Its a message hes been carrying for the past year as he lays the groundwork for a likely presidential campaign He told Politico recently he thinks Republicans can win a third or more of the AfricanAmerican vote in 2016 if the party embraces his method of advocating for education and criminal justice reform among other efforts to address poverty and unemployment Were also fighting 40 years of us doing a crappy job of Republicans not trying at all for 40 years so its a lot of overcoming he said Wednesday You got to show up you got to have something to say and really we just have to emphasize that were trying to do something different Following Mitt Romneys 2012 presidential loss in which he carried only 6 of the black vote the Republican National Committee has also attempted to retool its outreach by opening up multiple offices in urban areas and hiring more staff specifically tasked with targeting AfricanAmerican voters ,0.4
CNN,allpolitics, Des Moines Iowa CNN  Imagine if Iowa held a caucus and nobody but Hillary Clinton showed up Democrats of all stripes including Clinton allies have predicted for months that the former Secretary of State  who was campaigning for midterm candidates in Iowa on Wednesday  will face some kind challenge in the race for the Democratic nomination if she decides to run The prospect of a Clinton campaign seems more likely with each passing day But with the presidential race set to lurch into gear after next weeks midterm elections and no clear alternative to Clinton emerging there are questions about whether she will be the sole candidate on the ballot That would mark a dramatic shift from the rollicking caucus fights in previous campaigns including Clintons battle with Barack Obama and John Edwards in 2008 There is a distinct possibility that there will be no serious alternative said Kurt Meyer a pluggedin Democratic activist from Mitchell County Iowa She may in essence have the field to herself with one or two fringe protest candidates and no serious candidates opposing her The prospect of an uncontested race is a little bewildering to some Democrats here where competitive caucuses are ingrained in the culture It could be a process with just one person said Bonnie Campbell a longtime Clinton loyalist in Des Moines None of us can imagine that because it hasnt really happened before For their part the GOP isnt worrying about a boring race A platoon of Republicans  Chris Christie Rand Paul Rick Perry Ted Cruz and others  have paraded through Iowa for the last two years almost shamelessly transparent about their national intentions Among the cast of Democratic potentials Maryland Gov Martin OMalley is the most active in Iowa helping candidates up and down the ballot with campaign stops paid staffers and financial assistance Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders is also visible Both men have said they are seriously considering running regardless of what Clinton does though its hard to imagine Sanders a 73yearold selfdescribed socialist mounting much more than a protest candidacy Meanwhile Massachusetts Sen Elizabeth Warren a progressive darling with grassroots appeal whipped up a frenzy in the college town of Iowa City earlier this month at a campaign event for Senate candidate Bruce Braley in Iowa City Former Virginia Sen Jim Webb is weighing a run and Massachusetts Gov Deval Patrick hasnt quite ruled it out Vice President Joe Biden of course is nurturing his longstanding relationships in the state And Minnesota Sen Amy Klobuchar was warmly received after a headline speech at the state Democratic Partys JeffersonJackson Dinner last weekend But she also typified the reluctance of Democrats to step forward until Clintons decision is clear I am excited about the possibility of Hillary Clinton running Klobuchar said in an interview Democratic women senators have signed onto a letter asking her to run I am one of them I have put that in writing All of the Democrats with the possible exception of Biden are not widelyknown to most voters and have room to grow their support in Iowa if they run The state has rewarded insurgent candidacies in the past and Clinton is a welldefined politician whose centrist politics and cautious instincts could make leave vulnerable to a challenge from a fresherfaced candidate with stronger progressive impulses For Hillary its about meeting the expectations because she cant exceed them said state Rep Pat Murphy who is the Democratic nominee in Iowas First Congressional District The thing about Iowa is they will give everybody a look so you cant rule anybody out at this point But its also real possibility that none of the other choices run  they have said as much publicly with Warren particularly forceful in her denials  potentially leaving Clinton in the drivers seat with no one riding shotgun Democrats here fear that a noncompetitive onewoman show would sap the caucuses of grassroots energy and the potential for partybuilding even with the historymaking potential of her candidacy If you look at the vigor that a caucus or primary brings to a party longterm you have to hope that happens every once in an awhile Meyer said If it hadnt happened two cycles in a row in 2004 and 2008 then our party would be weaker than it is today Dave Price a political reporter and anchor for WHOTV in Des Moines said a noncompetitive Democratic caucus would offer Republicans another presidential cycle in the Iowa limelight bashing Democrats nonstop He said Iowas quadrennial caucusindustrialcomplex would much prefer a two feisty battles as it did during the busy winter of 2007 and 2008 rather than just one Restaurants hotels everyone here gets used to it said Price the author of Caucus Chaos a chronicle of the 2012 Iowa contest It becomes its own spectator sport You see people going all over town the week before the caucuses trying to see famous people politicians journalists operatives whoever Though past campaigns are never predictive even those preparing for a Clinton challenge struggle to remember a previous caucus dynamic like this one A singular dominant frontrunner  who still needs to make inroads with an electorate that never quite warmed to her in 2008  and a cast of smaller figures who may or may not run I dont recall anything like this said Campbell the Clinton supporter There was the 1992 caucus campaign when Iowa Sen Tom Harkin the hometown liberal sought the Democratic nomination allowing his opponents to forfeit the state and focus their energies on New Hampshire and elsewhere Another close analogy the 2000 race when the frontrunner Vice President Al Gore fought off a challenge on the left from Bill Bradley Like Clinton Gore was the cautious heir apparent Bradley had the field to himself after other potential candidates like Dick Gephardt and Paul Wellstone took a pass But unlike the Democrats who might challenge Clinton for the 2016 nomination Bradley was not gun shy After aggressively courting Iowa Democrats for months he launched an exploratory committee in December of 1998 just weeks after the midterm elections and immediately set about raising money and framing himself as the liberal alternative to Gore focusing on education and poverty Gore though ultimately defeated Bradley in Iowa 6335 on his way to the nomination To mount anything more than a gadfly candidacy against Clinton in todays drawnout mediasaturated nominating process will require a boatload of cash Clinton and Barack Obama both raised over 100 million before the January 2008 caucuses and that was almost seven years ago  before the Citizens United ruling made the political system even more awash in money Looking at the field of potential Clinton rivals only Warren seems to have a natural base the potential to raise serious money and a significant grassroots fundraising reach A handful of big progressive donors could help prop her up We have this mythology that you can go to Iowa and New Hampshire and knock a few doors and ultimate you too can be a serious presidential candidate Meyer said Maybe Eugene McCarthy could do that I think that the schedule and political life has gotten to the point today where you arent a serious candidate unless you go through the hoops of raising money and creating an organization I think OMalley probably comes the closest to it but I dont see who else OMalley has done more than any Democrat including Clinton to help elect Iowa Democrats this year  and he has traveled far and wide to do the same in other states Though polling is of little consequence at this early stage he remains stuck around one or two percent in hypothetical 2016 polls that match him up against Clinton Biden Warren and others Still OMalleys Iowa antennae is so heightened that during the Big 10 matchup between the University of Maryland and the University of Iowa earlier this month he wandered over to a Hawkeye tailgate and chatted up the revelers who had made the long trip from Iowa to Maryland All the Iowa Hawkeye fans were quite impressed that here was the governor at this tailgate and so was I said George Appleby a Des Moines attorney and longtime Democratic activist Of course we didnt talk about any of the future But implicitly people dont spend time with Iowans at a football game without a reason But OMalley is still wrestling with the decision to mount a bid and  despite the conventional wisdom about his intentions  could very well sit the race out Whats left beyond a protest candidacy on the left mounted by Sanders or someone else A long list of ambitious Democrats eager to make a name for themselves in Iowa but unwilling to take the plunge against Clinton Klobuchars speech last weekend was a folksy and populisttinged speech in which she declared that Corporations arent people People are people It was warmlyreceived by Democrats in the crowd who said they admired her familys immigrant history After the speech she happily ticked through the similarities between her state and Iowa Iowans are our neighbors she said in an interview We have a lot of friends here back and forth between Minnesota and Iowa our states are pretty similar We are both agriculture states The farm bill and and the renewable fuel standard are really important So its important to me to have allies in Iowa like Tom Harkin has been to get things done for the midwest The message was obvious She would play well here in Iowa But she is not stepping into the arena so long as theres a Clinton in the other corner ,0.4
CNN,allpolitics, Washington CNN  Nearly 7 in 10 Americans are angry at the direction the country is headed and 53 of Americans disapprove of President Barack Obamas job performance two troubling signs for Democrats one week before the midterm elections a new CNNORC International Poll shows Democrats are battling to try and save the Senate majority while hoping to prevent more losses in the House which the GOP controls by a 234 to 201 margin In the Senate Republicans need a net gain of six seats and several state polls in the past month of contested races show that Democrats are in danger of losing control of the majority and thus Congress Currently Democrats control the Senate by a 5545 margin with two of those seats held by independents that align themselves politically with Democrats READ Will last minute strength be enough for Dems The CNNORC poll shows that 30 of Americans are very angry and 38 are somewhat angry about the way things are going in the country while 31 expressed no anger at all CNN Polling Director Keating Holland notes the 31 of very angry Americans matches the mood of the country in 2010 when Republicans took back control of the House In next weeks election the emotion of anger could be a motivating factor in driving out GOP voters While 36 of Republican voters said they are extremely or very enthusiastic about voting this year only 26 of Democrats use that language to describe themselves in the CNNORC poll READ How the war on women is changing That 10 point difference is certain to affect turnout and hurt Democrats chances in marginal districts Holland said about the 435 House races on the ballot next Tuesday And this enthusiasm gap coupled with dissatisfaction over how the president is leading the country is likely to influence the dozen races that will decide which political party controls the Senate for the next two years A deeper look into the polling data shows that Obamas job performance is only viewed favorably in the Northeast 51 and in urban areas 60 All but one of the races that will decide which party controls the Senate in 2015 are located in the three other geographic areas of the country and Obamas approval rating is in the low 40s in each one  In the Midwest where Democrats are trying to hold an open Senate seat in Iowa Obama has a 56 disapproval rating  In the South where three Democratic incumbents are battling for reelection in Arkansas Louisiana North Carolina and Republicans are trying to hold an open seat in Georgia as well as protect Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky the president has a 52 disapproval rating  In the West where Democratic incumbents are fighting for another six year term in Alaska and Colorado Obamas disapproval rating is 55 Making matters even more difficult for Democrats is that Obamas disapproval rating among rural voters is 70 and the eight states listed above have sizable rural populations Nationally when asked if they agree with Obama on issues that matter most to them only 42 said yes while 55 said they disagreed with him in the poll POLL Coakley trails GOP challenger in Massachusetts It is no surprise that Obama has purposely stayed away from campaigning for Senate candidates in difficult contests It is widely believed that Democratic seats in Montana South Dakota and West Virginia will be won by Republicans in November If this were to happen Republicans will only need a net gain of three more seats to take back the Senate majority As for Congress only 13 of Americans approve of how it is handling its job while 85 disapprove ,0.4

CNN,allpolitics, Washington CNN  Just a day before voters head to the polls the New Hampshire Senate race is anyones guess with the two candidates locked in a dead heat according to two new polls Incumbent Democratic Sen Jeanne Shaheen edges out Republican challenger Scott Brown in a WMUR poll out Sunday while Brown is barely ahead of Shaheen by a one point margin in a New England College poll also out Sunday Both results amount to a statistical tie with both leads within the polls margin of error The last word from the WMUR poll of 757 likely voters calls the race at 47 for Shaheen to Browns 45  but 6 of voters say they remain undecided The New England College poll of 1526 likely voters gives Brown the race 49 to 48 but says just 2 of voters are undecided The race has tightened since the summer when Brown consistently trailed his opponent in every major nonpartisan poll Brown has effectively closed the gap and his campaign has worked hard since the summer to tarnish Shaheens independent brand by tying her to President Barack Obama who pulls a 37 approval rating among the states likely voters according to the WMUR poll Brown has also run several ads playing up the Ebola crisis and the threat from ISIS saying in a September ad President Obama and Senator Shaheen seem confused about the threat not me While the race has tightened in Browns favor a larger share of voters polled by WMUR said they believe Shaheen is most likely to pull through with a win  55 of respondents said Shaheen would triumph compared to 49 in October Shaheen meanwhile who has served as both governor and senator in New Hampshire has touted her instate credentials while branding Brown as an outsider Brown served nearly three years representing Massachusetts in the US Senate before moving to New Hampshire after losing his bid for reelection ,0.4
CNN,allpolitics, Philadelphia CNN  After a campaign season marked mainly by Democrats fleeing his shadow President Barack Obama embarked upon the final push of what he calls his last campaign Sunday hoping to mobilize voters in the few pockets of the country where he remains somewhat popular Obama headlined afternoon campaign rallies for Democratic gubernatorial candidates in Connecticut and Pennsylvania capping off a cycle that saw him rally for only one Senate candidate and a handful of governors His diminished presence in 2014 amounted mostly to headlining highdollar fundraisers in wealthy neighborhoods mostly on the coasts where he sought to motivate donors amid bleak prospects for his party in Tuesdays midterm elections In tight races across the country Democrats have distanced themselves from his policies declaring themselves independent from the White House as Republicans worked overtime to lump them into the same unpopular mold The President himself has fueled that effort at times saying during an economic address in October that his policies are on the ballot and telling Al Sharpton during a radio interview that vulnerable Democrats are all folks that vote with me Obama whose presidential campaign drew massive crowds of young people and AfricanAmericans in 2008 and 2012 has been working to propel those voters to the polls Democrats have little chance of keeping control of the Senate unless traditional Democratic voting blocs turn out in force That was Obamas goal Sunday in Philadelphia where he revved up a majority black crowd at a rally for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf Weve got some work to do Because two days from now you get to choose your future he said reminding the 5500 attendees that the historic battle for the right to vote must be honored by casting ballots in midterm elections Obama reiterated that theme in Connecticut earlier Sunday at a rally for Gov Dannel Malloy Your vote matters he told the 1900 supporters who came to see him speak in Bridgeport Dont let people tell you it doesnt The crowd in Connecticut was largely enthusiastic about hearing from the President but his speech was interrupted multiple times by protesters for immigration reform who carried signs with messages such as DREAMers demand bold broad inclusive relief Each time protesters interrupted Obama they were shouted down by the crowd On at least one occasion members of the crowd ripped the signs away from a group of protesters who were ultimately escorted out by security The campaign effort over the weekend amounted to Obamas biggest push for Democrats this cycle His reduced role is the outcome of record low approval ratings and policies unpopular in many parts of the country The restricted campaign role isnt necessarily where Obama wanted to be during the final congressional contests of his presidency though past secondterm presidents have similarly dragged down their partys candidates Im not on the ballot this time and this is the last election cycle in which Im involved as President he said in Maine on Thursday It makes you a little wistful because I do like campaigning Its fun He was originally scheduled to campaign in Connecticut last month but canceled shortly beforehand for meetings on his administrations Ebola response The presidents rescheduled appearance comes at a potentially critical point for Malloy The oneterm governor is polling neckandneck in his reelection battle against Republican nominee Tom Foley a former US ambassador to Ireland who lost to Malloy by only 6400 votes in 2010 A Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday had the two men at 43 each among likely voters A third candidate Joseph Visconti is polling third with 7 in the same survey with 6 undecided Despite these poll numbers Connecticut Democratic Party spokesman Ian Sams said Sunday he believes a heavy emphasis on voter turnout will bring Malloy a win on Tuesday I think with President Obama coming here today were going to see a lot of interest from base Democratic voters Sims told CNN If they come out to vote turn out in full force Gov Malloys confident hes going to win this campaign Connecticut is a reliably blue state but not totally averse to GOP governors  Malloy himself succeeded two Republicans when he took office In Pennsylvania Wolf has led the GOP incumbent Tom Corbett for most of the race and while polls have narrowed recently he still maintains an edge ,0.4

CNN,allpolitics, Portland Maine CNN  When President Barack Obama visited Maine on Thursday he didnt come within 300 miles of the nurse protesting her statemandated Ebola quarantine But he has inserted himself in the middle of a growing debate between the federal government and states over their rules for health workers returning from the Ebola zone Kaci Hickox the Doctors Without Borders worker hailed by the White House as a hero for treating Ebola patients in Liberia on Thursday defied the demands the Maines Republican governor to remain inside her home near the Quebec border She was spotted leaving her house by bike trailed by a state trooper Obama who traveled to Portland on Thursday for a campaign rally has sought to tamp down on fears of recentlyreturned health workers inviting a group of them to the White House Wednesday and hailing their mission as essential When they come home they deserve to be treated properly he said in the East Room on Wednesday flanked by doctors still within the 21day incubation period They deserve to be treated like the heroes that they are Rules implemented this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention require closer monitoring of health workers returning from West Africa but stop short of requiring any type of quarantine Many states have gone further insisting nurses and doctors remain isolated for three weeks The White House has questioned those state laws saying the rules are too strict and not guided by the science of Ebola The virus is spread through bodily fluids and patients arent considered contagious until theyre showing symptoms of the disease When I hear people talking about American leadership and then are promoting policies that would avoid leadership and have us running in the opposite direction and hiding under the covers it makes me a little frustrated Obama said on Wednesday Hickox was initially quarantined inside a tent in Newark before being allowed to leave for her home in Maine where Gov Paul LePage said hed require her to remain inside her home for 21 days Hickox said the state rules amount to a restriction on her civil rights and has threatened a legal battle over the mandated isolation LePage an Republican whose past offcolor remarks have garnered national headlines sent state troopers to Hickoxs Fort Kent home to enforce the quarantine On Thursday White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said only that Obama believed state policies should be guided by science but wouldnt go to say whether Obama believed Maines rules lived up to that tenet A fivehour drive south from the unfolding legal machinations Democrats welcomed Obama for a political rally supporting LePages opponent Mike Michaud who scored a boost to his chances on Wednesday when the states independent Sen Angus King lent his backing Michaud a sixterm congressman is locked in a dead heat with LePage Like past races in Maine an independent is also in the mix though Eliot Cutler is running well behind the two main party candidates Maines gubernatorial contest is one of only a handful of stops Obama will make on the campaign trail this year his record low approval ratings and controversial policies have made him unwelcome in key Senate battles Thursday Obama hit Republicans as full of bad ideas and resistant to measures he said could help improve the lives of middle class Americans like boosting the minimum wage and insisting on equal pay for women The objective in Maine according to University of New England political science professor Brian Duff is to get Democrats to just act like Democrats  that is vote for Michaud over the trailing independent There is a sense that voters just need a final push to come back into the fold Duff said They are helped by the fact that the current Republican governor is not popular and has very conservative views that are out of step with the majority of Mainers One area LePage and and his rival have found agreement however is quarantining Hickox Its the states responsibility to make sure that people are protected here in the state of Maine for public safety and I support the 21 day quarantine the Democrat told reporters Wednesday ,0.4

CNN,allpolitics, Washington CNN  Have you heard that it all comes down to turnout Of course you have because politicians say it every November But the act of getting voters to the polls is much more than a shopworn cliche Theres an entire industry in American politics built around finding and mobilizing voters largely constructed by Democrats who have been innovating in the field for more than a decade The nerd science of campaigning  sifting through data analyzing behavior modeling segments of voters and persuading people to cast ballots  is one reason President Barack Obamas team flabbergasted Mitt Romneys overconfident numberscrunchers in 2012 Many of those same Democratic operatives are on the front lines of the 2014 midterm elections mining the electorate statebystate to find enough voters to tip a race one or two points in their direction Having a welloiled field operation is never enough to overcome a bad national climate or a bum candidate at the top of the ticket But in a tight campaign like so many of the deadlocked 2014 races it can make a serious difference DSCC back on the air in Kentucky With advanced analytics and targeting the Obama team in 2012 narrowcasted its message to persuadable voters  on Facebook on television on Pandora on wellplaced billboards on doorsteps wherever  and tilted swing state electorates in their favor It was done efficiently without wasting money on television ads or mailers that were hitting the wrong households In press reports after the campaign Obamas tech savants were hailed as gurus and masterminds They werent always so celebrated On the Kerry campaign in 2004 they put the internet team  they called us the Internet team not digital  next to the IT team and most people would come over and ask us to fix their printers says Andrew Bleeker the founder of Bully Pulpit Interactive one the Democratic Partys premier digital firms That was how little people understood he says It wasnt until we started to produce metrics that people understood that people took us seriously So raising money was the first big one We raised 87 million in 2004 And then people said all right Digital Got it Bleeker was a grunt on the Kerry campaign But like many of his young colleagues he was a pioneer Bleeker now 29 went on to steer digital marketing for both of Obamas innovative campaigns launching Bully Pulpit along the way to build fullspectrum digital campaigns for Democrats Hillary Clinton is returning to Iowa Along with Obama theyve helped elect Elizabeth Warren in 2012 as well as New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Virginia Gov Terry McAuliffe in 2013 This cycle Bully Pulpit is doing independent expenditure work for Democratic party committees as well as NextGen Climate the Tom Steyerfunded environmental outfit In a fragmented and selfsegregating media world defined by declining television viewership and skyrocketing mobile usage the digital geeks of 2004 are now at the chief innovators of voter targeting In 2004 there were like 30 of us in a horrible dive bar said Ben Coffey Clark a veteran of Howard Deans presidential campaign and a partner a Bully Pulpit We started off in the back of the campaign with no access no insight and no budget Now we are at the forefront of how you reach voters and change sentiment online By matching voter files with consumer data and online behavior Bully Pulpit creates models of voting universes and devises clever eyecatching ways to engage with them in the digital space where attention spans are notoriously short The Stop Tweeting Boring Shit poster displayed prominently in its Farragut North offices is less a joke than a guiding principle Their goals  fundraising persuasion mobilization  are as varied as the tools they employ They produce online video display ads microsites Facebook and Twitter campaigns and email blasts for their candidates We know how to reach people that are low TV watchers says Mark Skidmore a Bully Pulpit partner with a background in corporate marketing and communications We know from our modeling that 33 as high as 40 of voters might not be watching any television So if you are spending the majority of budget on television guess what You are probably not getting any of that 40 With election day less than two weeks away their offices resemble a daytrading firm with scores of smartlydressed young operatives glued to their computers and pushing out content aimed at mobilizing voters Right now we are optimizing our campaigns Clark says The strategy has been set We know the story of the candidates We have really good content and video and sites to direct people towards Digital data field microtargeting  the terms are often confused or lumped together as catchall shorthand for whatever it was the Obama campaign did on its Chicago computers to mobilize auto workers in Youngstown or Puerto Ricans in Orlando The truth is that they are each discrete domains each requiring its own expertise and methods Democrats the successful ones at least have won by synchronizing those activities both inside their campaign offices and across the spectrum of leftleaning interest groups ensuring that the right voters are getting the right message at exactly the right time and place Another truth Democrats are still better at most of it than Republicans Republicans are still very much in the television persuasion model said Zac Moffat who led digital strategy for Romneys campaign and runs Target Victory a leading GOP digital firm We are still having philosophical arguments about where we are and meanwhile the Democrats arguing about the type of targeting to use After getting walloped in the field in 2012 the GOP vowed to overhaul their digital and data efforts In many ways they have The Republican National Committee for instance added a team of data scientists juiced its email marketing and fundraising efforts remember those George HW Bush socks and created a widelyused app for doortodoor canvassers Today 70 of RNC voter data being collected in the field is done digitally  up from just 5 last cycle Outside groups like American Crossroads and Americans for Prosperity have also revamped their data and digital programs tapping into the RNCs voter file Data Trust and i360 another data hub affiliated with the Koch brothers financial network Opinion Why the Seinfeld election matters But while Republicans have developed the tools and can point to a bevy of talented digital strategists in their ranks they still havent matched the culture or the manpower of the Democratic tech world thats been blossoming for over a decade There are schools and training programs in Democratic circles focused on field organizing and data Bleeker himself teaches one at Georgetown University And theres a tradition of sharing information and best practices thats been wellestablished over the years spearheaded by leftleaning interest groups and labor unions that began experimenting with voter contact techniques during the George W Bush years Moffat is confident Republicans will catch up It will take time he says for the partys established consultant class schooled in TVbuying to understand the importance of data and digital advertising Its not that Republicans arent building tools he says The tools are there its just a question of why arent people choosing to use them ,0.4
CNN,allpolitics, Manchester New Hampshire CNN  Soon after I arrived in New Hampshire I hit Mitt Romney in the face Romney was running for president  the first time  in 2008 and he showed up at Bedford High School on primary day for a photoop and a spurt of last minute handshaking in the frigid early January cold I was CNNs campaign embed assigned to follow Romneys every step during his travels On that day I was also assigned to hold a boom mic for our photographer Chris Turner The arriving Romney was quickly surrounded in the high school parking lot by a swarm of reporters and cameras For a brief moment I looked down to scan my BlackBerry  remember those  without paying attention to the candidateonthemove I looked up pivoted and accidentally swung the long microphone directly right into Romneys handsome mug Romney twirled like a malfunctioning R2D2 but was unfazed He seemed more concerned with escaping the pack of reporters than the piece of television equipment that just whacked him on the forehead I was mortified of course but no one seemed to notice It was just another cramped mob of press on the campaign trail Stuff happens READ Inside the GOPs secret school The moment of confusion though was only the latest of several weird moments in New Hampshire a state I was struggling to figure out The preceding year I had been living in South Carolina planted there as CNN pioneered statebased producers during campaign season As a native southerner it was easy to fall in love with the place and its outlandish brand of politics I was then called up to Iowa in the runup to the 2008 caucuses and found comforting similarities The people were friendly foodloving and earnest Then it was on to New Hampshire Unlike the wideopen spaces I had experienced covering campaigns in New Hampshire you could drive 15 minutes and be in an entirely different town Streets were covered in muddy sloppy snow Events were held in claustrophobic bars diners and inns Reporters their bulky coats and sweaters crackling with static electricity jostled for space Everyone seemed cranky And the biggest insult Patriots fans were everywhere Granted it was the depth of winter and I wasnt seeing the state at its finest but I couldnt wait to get out I heard Florida was nice at that time of year READ White boy Biden calls tea party crazy It wasnt until later that summer covering John McCain in the general election that I came to understand why New Hampshire holds such a special place in our political imagination Steve Duprey the McCain adviser who dubbed himself the Secretary of Fun and dedicated himself to cheering up the traveling press corps is a garrulous New Hampshire native He was biased of course but he schooled me on the honorable dedication of New Hampshire voters  their fealty to the process their skepticism of phony platitudes and contrived television ads their willingness to call out a presidential candidate As it did in 2000 the DNA of New Hampshire allowed McCain his campaign broke and forgotten to resurrect himself with an endless succession of town hall meetings in which he delivered selfstyled Straight Talk about the Iraq war His heroic 2008 comeback story has a dash of mythology sprinkled on it  Romney the longtime New Hampshire frontrunner was collapsing after his Iowa loss and McCain was the strongest alternative  but the strategy worked nonetheless Its hard to think McCain could have pulled it off anywhere other than in the Granite State So when I started going back to New Hampshire after the 2008 election I realized that I had been trying too hard to figure the place out Before I had heard all the corny talk about how New Hampshire voters are flinty and fiercely independent but had dismissed those characterizations as the kind of lazy pundit cliches that they are I was trying to understand what New Hampshire voters were really like But it turns out that is what theyre really like A good many of them at least Voters here ask tough questions with a wary eye have a reasonable grasp of the issues and take their primal role in picking presidential candidates seriously At a time when outside spending social media and partisan news are transforming the presidential process a mindnumbing nihilistic slog fueled by money and phony umbrage  there is still New Hampshire Not every longshot can catch fire in the firstinthenation primary state  sorry Jon Huntsman the odds still favor the big dogs  but if lightning can strike anywhere its here So New Hampshire this Hambycast is for you Now get me a donut READ Hillary Clinton subtly swipes Mitt Romney ,0.4
CNN,allpolitics, Derry New Hampshire CNN  The war over women arrived in New Hampshire this week  in the form of a press release New Shaheen Campaign Ad Highlights Scott Browns AntiChoice Record and Extreme Bill He Introduced reporters were informed Tuesday morning by email just hours before Sen Jeanne Shaheen was to host a womensthemed campaign event in Derry Shaheens ad is a brutal one  particularly against someone who is a selfproclaimed prochoice independent Republican In ominous tones the ad reveals that when he was a state legislator in Massachusetts the state Brown used to live in and later represented in the US Senate he backed a bill that would force women considering abortion to look at color photographs of developing fetuses Though Democrats in tough races nationwide have been running on womens issues for the better part of a year the message had not taken center stage in New Hampshires Senate race until this week The shift foreshadows what could be a rough and tumble end to election season in this typically tranquil New England state READ Have Democrats already lost the Senate  Brown is less vulnerable to the war on women attack than other downtheline conservative Republicans  one reason the issue is only now surfacing in the race Beyond his prochoice stance he has broken with his party by supporting the Violence Against Women Act and funding for Planned Parenthood But Shaheens new offensive struck a nerve forcing Brown to throw together a slapdash press conference to respond to her despicable attacks He was thrown offmessage on a day when he was supposed to be talking about foreign policy and tying Shaheen to President Obama and his inthedumps poll numbers The next morning Brown went up with a defensive television ad stressing his support for abortion rights and accusing the senator of running a smear campaign Shaheen a cunning noholdsbarred campaigner despite her pleasant demeanor is leaving nothing to chance as she clings to a steady singledigit lead in a treacherous political environment for Democrats In the latest poll of the race this week from WMUR and the University of New Hampshire Shaheen led Brown by 6 points but she was topping out at 47 the under50 danger zone for any incumbent But she has a healthy 15point advantage among likely women voters and is doing everything she can to keep it that way You get the sense this race could turn at just a moments notice said James Pindell the alwayson political director at Manchester television station WMUR Pindell was joining me for a slice of pepperoni at Romanos Pizza in Derry for this weeks episode of Hambycast The race seems to be primed for that Pindell said It gets all the attention in this state This state has got four major races We have two congressional races and a competitive governors race But all people talk about is Shaheen and Brown every single day At her lone campaign event Tuesday inside a Derrybased food incubator called Creative Chef Kitchens Shaheen rattled through a laundry list of femalefocused issues she supports  equal pay access to contraception abortion rights  as a small crowd of women nodded in approval READ Hagan skips Armed Services Committee hearing for campaign fundraiser  The message was heavyhanded and impossible to miss but Shaheen put an exclamation point on it just in case Scott Brown she said is being disingenuous when he says he is prochoice Reporters surrounded her after her appearance One asked her why she waited until October to thrust womens issues into the campaign using probably the most negative ad of the campaign Shaheen has highlighted the topic before memorably in July after Brown hid in a restaurant bathroom when a reporter asked him about the Supreme Courts controversial decision in Burwell vs Hobby Lobby that allowed corporations to deny birth control coverage in their insurance plans But her campaign had not put money behind a television ad on womens health before particularly such a blistering one I think this is something that we planned to talk about all along Shaheen responded I think access to health care access to reproductive choice is critical to women Ive worked on it my entire career This is an issue that is important to women and families Ninetynine percent of women use contraceptives at some point in their lives Then I asked Shaheen about Browns topic of choice President Obama whose disapproval ratings in New Hampshire approach 60 What is it about him exactly that Democrats are so wary of Shaheen would rather not talk about Obama which is why Brown spent their first oneonone debate on Monday reminding voters that the senator has voted with the president 99 of the time Its one reason he has seized on the ascendancy of ISIS the terrorist group roiling Syria and Iraq and border security National security is becoming a winning talking point Republican operatives here argue claiming it scores points among the very women Shaheen is trying to keep in her fold There is a leadership void Brown said at an event Tuesday in Derry where he was joined by Florida Sen Marco Rubio a foreign policy hawk and potential presidential candidate in 2016 Our allies dont trust us and our foes dont fear or respect us Like Republican candidates across the country Brown wants the race to be about national issues Shaheen does not so she brings up another sore point for Brown his decision to sell his home in Massachusetts last year and move to the Granite State to run for Senate Brown is not exactly a carpetbagger  hes long owned property in New Hampshire and many thousands of people have moved here from somewhere else thanks to the low tax rates  but its still a reliable campaign jab This race is not about President Obama Shaheen said This race is about Scott Brown and me I know that Scott Brown would like to be running against the President because he has not done anything in New Hampshire he doesnt have a history here he just moved here I have spent my entire professional life here in New Hampshire READ Roberts rebounds in Kansas Senate race CNNORC Poll finds  ,0.4
CNN,allpolitics, Charleston South Carolina CNN  Campus politics arent always a clear winner for Rand Paul as he discovered here this week during an appearance at the College of Charleston The Kentucky Republican and potential 2016 contender opened with a familiar riff about government surveillance that won predictable applause  especially from the many students who represented Young Americans for Liberty the libertarian outfit created from the ashes of his father Ron Pauls presidential campaigns Then a young woman in the audience asked if Paul who sponsored an antiabortion bill in 2013 that defines life as beginning at fertilization is opposed to Plan B the emergency contraception commonly known as the morningafter pill A number of social conservatives  plenty of them in Iowa  have condemned the morningafter pill as an ondemand abortion drug sometimes confusing the contraceptive with RU486 which can be used to induce abortion Noticeably uncomfortable with the question Paul first gave a terse answer I am not opposed to birth control he said After a pause he elaborated Thats basically what Plan B is Plan B is taking two birth control pills in the morning and two in the evening and I am not opposed to that Rand Paul I am not opposed to birth control Next question The exchange was notable because it happened on a college campus  a place where Paul has made inroads in building support for his libertarian agenda And it underscored the challenge that lies ahead for him burnishing the libertarian credentials that make him so appealing to young voters while making sure he doesnt stray so far from the Republican line that he wont be able to win the partys presidential nomination Another student here pressed him on the drug war asking if Paul would support legalizing marijuana cocaine and heroin He said he wasnt supportive of drug use explaining that pot is not that great but said drug laws should be left up to states Colorado and Washington are experimenting with legalized marijuana he said and we should be watching carefully Paul has enjoyed plenty of success on the campus circuit His visits to universities from Harvard to Howard have snagged flattering headlines and pats on the back from Republicans who want to modernize the party and broaden its national appeal Rand Paul Republican presidential hopeful finds support in Berkeley of all places the San Jose Mercury News announced after Paul visited in that den of Bay Area liberalism in March Paul reared in libertarian politics found support there because he railed against the National Security Administrations invasive surveillance operations calling them an absurd violation of privacy Its his goto topic when he talks to young people Last March at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference Paul blew his opponents away in a presidential straw poll after he brought a ballroom full of 20somethings to their feet with cries of outrage over government prying into cell phones Soon after he packed a nearby restaurant with fawning college kids at an open bar sponsored by his political action committee Paul and his wife Kelley danced and sang along to Chumbawamba the 90sera pop band with an anarchist streak We tagged along to the event at the College of Charleston for the latest episode of Hambycast After the talk standing in the sunsplashed campus courtyard I asked Paul to elaborate on some of the issues that so often put his party at odds with young people  as well as the thorny topics that Paul confronts as he tries to square with smallgovernment libertarian roots with a more dogmatic Republican Party On the topic of drugs I picked up where the student left off wondering if Paul as president would allow a state to legalize a hard drug like cocaine or heroin He hedged My position has not been for legalization my position has been for less criminalization and more fair adjudication for people that are caught in this and that kids who make youthful mistakes should get a second chance he said Then I asked about samesex marriage something Paul did not touch on in his remarks Almost 80 of people under the age of 30 support samesex marriage according to a Gallup poll earlier this year Its hard to think of an issue on which Republicans are more out of step with Americas youth And its not just teenaged and 20somethings A clear majority of Americans 55 support samesex marriage Paul favors traditional marriage but has said states should determine their own marriage laws I dont want my guns registered in Washington or my marriage he told me Founding Fathers all got married by going down to the local courthouse It is a local issue and always has been But can Republicans win a national election if they arent in tune with rapidly changing opinions on the matter He took a soft tone Societys changing he said I mean people change their minds all the time on this issue and even within the Republican Party there are people whose child turns out to be gay and theyre like oh well maybe I want to rethink this issue So its been rethought The Presidents rethought the issue So I mean a lot of people have rethought the issue It sounded for a moment as if Paul was hinting that he too could change his thinking about marriage The bottom line is Im old fashioned Im a traditionalist he said I believe in oldfashioned traditional marriage But I dont really think the government needs to be too involved with this and I think that the Republican Party can have people on both sides of the issue You could rethink it at some point too I asked him He shrugged and gave me a halfgrimace It wasnt a yes or a no but it revealed Pauls complicated dance as he tries to color outside the lines of the Republican Party ,0.4
CNN,allpolitics, Des Moines Iowa CNN  Iowa Gov Terry Branstad favored to win reelection and a historic sixth term in November credits his famous facial hair for his political success Ive never lost and Ive always done it with a mustache so Im going to keep it he told me First elected governor in 1982 at the tender age of 36 he went on to serve four terms stepping down in 2000 But he came out of retirement six years ago and rode a GOP wave back into office If voters return him to office this fall the 67yearold will have served over 20 years as governor making him the longestserving executive in American history One reason for Branstads winning streak is that hes much more of a hardball politician than his awshucks Midwestern demeanor suggests Earlier this year Branstad the definition of an establishment Republican successfully deployed his political machine in an effort to reclaim the Iowa GOP from the clutches of tea party leadership So far this year in his race against Democrat Jack Hatch hes been able to weather administration scandals and accusations of corruption One Democrat told me that for Iowa voters Branstad is like an old sweater  just the comfortable choice Obamadale The secret weapon that could save Iowa Democrats Branstad was talking about his whiskers while giving me a private tour of the picturesque Iowa state capital for the latest episode of Hambycast showing off the knickknacks and ceremonial gifts that decorate his hideaway office normally offlimits to reporters He pointed proudly to his hunting trophies a photo with Pope John Paul II and an Iowa Hawkeyes football jersey with BRANSTAD emblazoned on the back Upstairs in the state capitol we examined baseballs signed by players who had jogged the bases at Field of Dreams in Dyersville Then we were guided up to the very top of the gilded state capitol for a stunning autumn view of downtown Des Moines As the talk turned to 2016 and the looming parade of Republican presidential contenders set to march through Iowa Branstad brushed off criticism that the caucuses favor uncompromising social conservatives over more moderate Republicans Hambycast Hillary Clintons madcap media mob He has a point Mitt Romney not exactly a favorite son of the Christian right almost won the caucuses Theres a sizable pool of mainstream Republicans here waiting to be courted and in a crowded presidential field a candidate can win the state with a plurality  and without unified support from social conservatives You need to come here early and often Branstad said invoking the example of Rick Santorum who came out of nowhere to win Iowa after campaigning in the states 99 counties and it should be noted after wearing his conservative Catholic faith on his sleeve Branstad would not say if he would endorse a candidate but said hes favorable to Republican governors  no surprise there  a comment that should warm the hearts of Chris Christie Rick Perry Scott Walker and Mike Pence Jeb Bush heading to 2016 primary state As for the infamous Ames Straw Poll that mediasaturated oftcriticized and nonbinding summertime test of candidate support Branstad backed away from previous suggestions that the fundraiser should be scrapped I asked him if the GOPrun Straw Poll will actually happen next summer in the runup to the caucuses Branstad said maybe but floated another option Its going to depend on the candidates and who is willing to participate he said I think having a series of fundraisers regionally around the state would be a good alternative ,0.4

CNN,living, Editors note Kelly Wallace is CNNs digital correspondent and editoratlarge covering family career and life She is a mom of two girls Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter CNN  Ask any teen whether he or she suffers from social media anxiety and the answer will probably be no Thats what happened when six teens and adolescents  five from New York and one from Los Angeles  got together recently for a unique weeklong workshop at the offices of SheKnowscom a leading womens lifestyle media platform The teens didnt think that Facebook Instagram and Snapchat their goto social networks added much extra anxiety to their lives But then the conversation turned to the importance of likes and the fear of missing out also known by the acronym FOMO Sadie a 10thgrader in Brooklyn New York said shed never heard the acronym before but is definitely familiar with the feeling You see on I guess you could say Facebook or even Snapchat  you see your friends hanging out with other people and youre like Oh Im alone right now she said And even if theres no way you could get to them even if you wanted to it still just makes you feel bad or lonely or sad The upside of selfies Social media not all bad for kids  Olivia 12 said she sometimes feels that way too If theres an event that maybe Im not at or my friends are hanging out with each other  sometimes I kind of feel I guess kind of left out The quest for the 100 club The teens and tweens also agreed there is a constant  and at times anxietyinducing  fixation with likes People will be like Oh are you in the 100 club  Sadie said of getting 100 or more likes for a post The 15yearold told the story of a friend who changed her profile picture and didnt get the 200 likes she normally gets on the first night whenever she makes such a change She was freaking out she said The more likes the greater the social standing you appear to have the girls said People feel that when they get a lot of likes It means that theyre pretty and popular and that makes them feel better Sadie said Schools step up social media monitoring of students  Said Olivia I really do notice that a lot of people who get tons of likes and have tons of followers on Instagram and Facebook do tend to think that they are really popular and that everyone knows who they are when  all their followers havent even met them before Likes translate into validation and attention said Diana Graber cofounder of CyberWiseorg a digital literacy site for parents educators and tweens and teens Graber also teaches cybercivics to middle schoolers in Aliso Viejo California When she overhears conversations of students she says she very often hears things like Check this out I have this many likes Its almost like a little competition for the number of likes Graber said I think thats anxietyridden because you get likes based on how many friends you have and you have to keep posting things to get more friends and its like a vicious circle Graber says this phenomenon was illustrated by a recent assignment in her classroom She asked her students to try to go 24 hours without social media during one of three weekends Middle school transition tough for teens and parents  Of the 28 students only one was able to do it The teens couldnt stand not knowing what their friends were doing Graber said It was very hard I kept getting tempted by my phone and my friends wrote one student who said he could last only five hours in his socialmediafree zone Research Social media can make you feel sad  Studies show that social media can actually make you feel bad about yourself According to a study last year by the University of Michigan the more people checked Facebook the worse they felt about their lives Another study this one by German researchers found that a third of people felt worse after spending time on Facebook especially if they spent time viewing vacation photographs Helping students realize the impact of social media on them was a big goal of the summer workshop held by SheKnowscom That workshop also served as a pilot for a program called Hatch which was just launched by the company As part of the new effort kids ages 9 to 16 create videos for adults said Samantha Skey SheKnowscoms chief revenue officer The informal tag line for the program is content for grownups made by kids on a mission she said What counts as a real name on Facebook Its content by kids but its really meant to address topics of interest to their parents in many cases she said The mission component is focused on teaching them digital literacy and citizenship while also allowing them to play with digital storytelling Reese an 11thgrader in Los Angeles who participated in the Hatch pilot program said she didnt really give much thought to the notion that digital media can impact people emotionally until there was a discussion about its psychological effect And I found out that I am kind of neurotic about some things she said For example when I text someone and I think that I might have made them upset because they didnt reply right away I automatically assume that they got mad at me To prevent that from happening she admits closing nearly all texts with a smiley exclamation point or LOL Sadie who also participated in the Hatch pilot says she now looks at Snapchat and Facebook a bit differently I know they can also have a negative psychological effect that I feel like didnt occur to me as much she said Starting conversations early  The takeaway from the workshop said Skey was that there is a huge opportunity to talk with teens about social media A lot of them say that educators are not talking to them about media and social media unless theyre telling them not to do something Talking about social media early and often is key says Graber who did a demonstration this month for principals and other educators from across the state of California on how she teaches digital literacy and citizenship to teens How to cut your childs cell phone addiction  I always say to parents Its not one conversation Its a thousand small conversations and it is really starting young she said Take an interest in what your children are doing online and have them show you why they like it she said And then you are in the circle she added Its pretty easy to get there but you have to start when they are young Graber who starts teaching students in the sixth grade said it often takes her students until the eighth grade to figure out all the social media angst aint worth it Its a huge trajectory to get there  when they start saying Gosh thats a waste of my time  Do you get anxious if you dont get a certain number of likes on social media posts Tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook ,0.4

CNN,living, CNN  Amal Alamuddin was wellknown in many important circles long before she snagged the worlds most eligible bachelor But Amal Alamuddin is now Amal Clooney according to her law firms website That the 36yearold British attorney has decided to take her famous husbands last name has raised many questions about feminism and traditional marriage roles My only question is If you married George Clooney why wouldnt you take his name In all seriousness though the decision over whether to take a spouses name is an extremely personal one Married in May I had to make it myself just a short time ago and there was a lot to consider Theres a reason we stand in front of friends and family read vows listen to awful bestman speeches and cut the cake Its tradition But as more couples choose to stand in a backyard or on the beach write their own vows ditch the speeches and serve cupcakes maybe changing your name is just another custom we should feel OK about tweaking As more samesex couples marry this is certainly an issue that will come up across a variety of unions In traditional marriages studies show the majority of newly wedded women still change their names The percentage of women who kept their maiden names peaked in the 1990s before leveling off in the 2000s at about 18 according to a 2009 study though more recent data from Facebook show that around a third of 20somethings who wed decide against the change Here are some factors that every bride and groom must weigh Your personal brand That same 2009 study found that welleducated women with higher incomes were much more likely to keep their maiden names especially if they were in a namerecognizable field like the arts or entertainment A study published in 2010 found that women who married later in life say ages 35 to 39 were also more likely to keep their maiden names than women who married before 25 As you age you have more and more associated with your name various degrees personal property a career or business built around your name said Danielle Tate founder and CEO of the namechanging service MissNowMrscom If your income comes from people knowing your name youre more likely to keep your name in some way Why In a word branding In the digital age nothing is as important to your career as your personal brand Jobseekers strive to keep their Google search results clean while resume websites must match Twitter handles and Facebook profiles In other words you are your online identity And if your name changes your online identity must change Lets say my husbands last name was McGregor what if JacqueMcGregor was taken Kids Of course theres another brand to consider that of your family Tate says the intention to have children is one that edges many women toward changing their maiden name Patriarchy is still deeply ingrained  in all of us writes Molly Caro May who decided with her husband to give their daughter his last name Surnames are one of the unseen limbs of the old world Giving a child the fathers last name is still a given Tate has heard many stories from moms who kept their maiden names and gave their children their fathers only to be stopped when trying to pick the kids up from school or day care One woman who was married to a German man spent hours fighting airport security while trying to fly home with her kids They thought she had stolen his children Um divorce And then theres the big What If  as in what if we dont make it I took my husbands name when I got married I was happy to do it Then we got divorced one Reddit user posted The old name chases me everywhere  Its been years and I still get correspondence and checks in that name Its humiliating in so many ways because my ex cheated and it will be with me forever The paperwork In the end I like Mrs Amal Clooney decided to adopt my husbands last name Yet there was one more thing I hadnt considered what a giant pain in the butt it was going to be to do so Thats the reason Tate started her namechanging service in the first place After a 13hour attempt to change her state drivers license she put the process on hold and launched MissNowMrscom Its a very lengthy legal process and if for some reason you want to reverse it  Tate trails off Most brides dont consider all the things that have their name on it she says Your Social Security card your drivers license your passport and your credit cards are the big ones But what about your health and car insurance What about your gym membership and magazine subscriptions Your Amazon PayPal or frequentflier account Your work email that your colleagues are now going to have to remember has changed Some states dont allow you to use your maiden name as a middle name Tate says and others like New York and Pennsylvania require you to do things in a certain order  ie change your Social Security card and passport before your drivers license Many insist you make the changes before a certain amount of time passes after your wedding or the process gets infinitely more complicated And of course no company or state has the same rules or process when it comes to making that name change One credit card company I called simply said OK

CNN,living, CNN  Its not just a phase Theyre not frigid sick repressed or broken Meeting the socalled right one isnt going to change anything But for people like Sandra Mellott the questions just keep on rolling in from friends family and loved ones who may mean well but dont understand what its like to identify as asexual In a society historically centered around romantic pairings and increasingly bombarded by raunchy imagery people who dont experience sexual attraction can often feel isolated invisible and misunderstood But now a growing number of asexual people are banding together in solidarity and support finding likehearted souls in a culture where happily and hornily ever after is the end goal Most people likely havent heard the word asexual since their high school biology class where it was used to describe plants that reproduce without a second parent When it comes to people however the term can encompass a vast array of experiences At its root asexuality is an orientation defined by the lack of sexual attraction to other people But humans are complicated creatures and it only branches out from there This is not about selfimposed celibacy Asexual people can identify as gay straight bisexual or none of the above Intersex dating Finding love across the intersection Some like Mellott are aromantic to varying degrees and have little to no emotionally romantic attraction to other people They may still experience and desire intense friendship bonds crushes or squishes  which Asexualityorg defines as the platonic equivalent of a romantic crush Some have romantic feelings but are satisfied with cuddling handholding and proximity Still others experience waxing and waning degrees and frequency of sexual attraction drive and pleasure thus finding themselves on whats called the grayA spectrum depending upon the circumstances and parties involved An ongoing meme in online asexual circles is that even if someone isnt interested in sex theres always cake and who doesnt like that Images of cake are often used to welcome new members or reward them for various life victories online and off The community is not without a strong sense of humor and warmth  but its not always met with a tremendous degree of understanding from people wired since birth to believe that pair bonding is the endall beall Mellott a writer and victim advocate at a Montana shelter has always known that she was asexual and aromantic but has often struggled to get the people around her to accept it as fact At age 5 she got her first boyfriend and promptly forgot neglecting to write the love poem they had agreed to exchange the next day At 10 she braced herself for questions from adults wondering if she had a boyfriend yet rehearsing the answer I dont want one Im just not interested At 13 a quick Internet search for asexual confirmed to her that she wasnt alone At 18 she casually came out to a female classmate who thought it was the coolest thing ever and at 21 to a male classmate who tried to help her by suggesting masturbation At 25 she came out to her family confirming what she thought they probably knew and letting them know she was at peace with it This is a permanent part of who I am and Im proud and confident about it Mellott says her mother was loving and supportive  and entirely baffled She understands what Im saying but just cant comprehend how its possible herself Mellott says So she asks these really not ever kind of questions that arent malicious but get tiring mostly because theyre coming from someone who I love and want to just accept and understand me without all this extra effort What not to say to a transgender person And then there are the men who treat her as a potential sexual conquest Sometimes I think they take my orientation as some kind of personal attack and they can get really hostile about it she says Megan Allen who works as a health care professional in a town outside of Seattle has known all her 21 years that sexual attraction just wasnt in the cards for her She identifies as a repulsed asexual  a person for whom the idea of sexual contact is simply disgusting All of those bodily fluids and being in such a vulnerable position and the diseases it could cause and just eww she says Its not a prudishness on her part shes done her due diligence on the matter even to the point of being involved in a nudist colony There was an actual psych test to join that proves youre not there to be a pervert she says So Ive seen it all But she too knew from an early age that some activities simply arent an option for her and that it might limit her prospects for partnership Because of my complete unwillingness to compromise on sex Im sort of limited on my dating options she realizes Other asexuals the impotent people willing to confine their sexual encounters to either selfgratification or a mistress Allen approves would be the only viable solutions she says Obviously the last two would put quite a strain on any relationship But shes more open about herself these days than she was in the past  even placing a bet with several family members who dont believe that her orientation is set in stone I tried to discuss this with my sister once and with my parents Allen says Both proceeded to make bets with me that I would change my mind someday I put it in writing both

CNN,living, CNN  Canadian radio host Jian Ghomeshi has interviewed some of pop cultures biggest names from Barbra Streisand Joni Mitchell and Dan Rather to Lena Dunham and Zach Galifianakis and thats just in the past few months His CBC Radio show Q with Jian Ghomeshi is one of the most popular in the networks history making him a bona fide celebrity in a country that takes pride in its public radio It aired on more than 180 public radio stations in the United States prompting the Washington Post to call it the most popular new arts and culture radio show in America in 2013 Still the 47yearold was far from a household name in the United States when he posted a lengthy screed on his Facebook page Sunday accusing the CBC of firing him for his private sex life He said the dismissal came after he shared details of his sex life with his former employers to head off a smear campaign by jilted exes accusing him of nonconsensual kinky activity The combination of Canadian celebrity an iconic Canadian institution and allegations from anonymous women produced what one columnist called a Canadian sex scandal the likes of which we havent seen in decades The size of Ghomeshis star and the seriousness of the allegations makes this bigger than your run of the mill celebrity sex scandal with implications beyond Canada Two major issues reside at the heart of the scandal a 55 million lawsuit against the CBC in which Ghomeshi alleges that he was fired for his sexual proclivities and anonymous allegations reported by the Toronto Star from three women accusing Ghomeshi of sexual violence and nonconsensual BDSM activity The CBC released a statement saying the decision was not made without serious deliberation and careful consideration and declined to comment further Ghomeshi denies the allegations and says any sexual activity between him and the women kinky or not was consensual Let me be the first to say that my tastes in the bedroom may not be palatable to some folks They may be strange enticing weird normal or outright offensive to others he said in his Facebook post But that is my private life That is my personal life And no one and certainly no employer should have dominion over what people do consensually in their private life By bringing BDSM into the mix through his Facebook post Ghomeshi ignited conversation in legal circles and the kink community over whether the kinky defense will prevail in his lawsuit and the court of public opinion The scandal is of particular interest to the kink community who say it raises two common topics of concern in their world discrimination over sexual activity and the gray area between consensual activity and assault in BDSM Others worry about the potential for the kinky defense to be misappropriated and used as a shield for rape and assault It hits on a lot of important aspects that BDSM faces said Susan Wright spokeswoman for National Coalition for Sexual Freedom an advocacy group that promotes tolerance of sexual minorities Rarely do you have an instance where so many things come together Dont hate me for being kinky In his Facebook post Ghomeshi says he has always been interested in a variety of sexual activities but only those that are mutually agreed upon consensual and exciting for both partners He suggested that the coming days would bring allegations of unsavory aggressive acts in the bedroom with the implication that they happened nonconsensually And it will be based in lies but damage will be done Ghomeshi said His publicist declined to comment further referring CNN to his Facebook post Scores of fans have called for his reinstatement through online petitions to get him back on air The kink community also has rallied to support Ghomeshi as one of their own saying his plight drew attention to some of the more serious consequences the BDSM community faces for its lifestyle particularly when it comes to job security divorce proceedings and custody disputes Polyamory When three isnt a crowd For others it brought mainstream attention to ongoing difficult conversations within the kink community about how to deal with breaches of consent Canadian writer and sex educator Andrea Zanin said Its a twofold concern its important that we have conversations within the kink community about consent and negotiations and the reality that does happen within the kink community she said At the same time we also need to constantly battle public perception of kink as being inherently abusive In a blog post that spread as the scandal unfolded poor persecuted perv Zanin cautioned against rallying around Ghomeshi or anyone who uses the kinky defense until all the facts are in A danger inherent in this kind of mediamessage success is that the dont hate me for being kinky defense will be used by people who perpetrate nonconsensual violence and that we as a community will stand by uncritically  or worse cry out in support  as victims of violence are once again silenced Zanin called it a major triumph for the kink community that Ghomeshi took a gamble on the consensual kink argument outweighing the youre a filthy pervert reaction in the court of public opinion Regardless of the outcome she hopes the mainstream remembers that its not what people do behind closed doors that matters but how they do it Is everyone having fun and enjoying themselves Is something in place to help catch them if they fall she said BDSM A culture of consent Responsible BDSM practitioners participate in whats called consent culture where verbal discussion of boundaries and expectations are carefully negotiated ahead of time said Noel Robertson an Atlanta sex educator who leads talks about responsible BDSM The conversation between the dominant and the submissive generally goes something like What are you looking for out of this scene What do you think I can supply you with Is there anywhere Im not allowed to touch you Is there any level of nudity you are not comfortable with Safe words are agreed upon to let the person know when to stop whether theyre stoplight colors or actual words The bottom line The person in the submissive position always has the right to use the safe word she said They can stop the scenario no questions asked If I have you bound and gagged and you cant use the safe word I still have 100 responsibly to give you some way to say thats not OK Robertson said If I fail to do that and you cant tell me or if I cant understand it is my failure not yours As with any community there are unscrupulous members who seek to exploit others and survivors are not always treated with respect she said Case law in the United States says that consent is not a defense to assault where great bodily harm has occurred said Wright whose organization works with the BDSM community to report assault to police when it crosses the line Thats why breathplay covering mouths choking and hitting with a closed fist can be risky especially for people starting out she said Some educators recommend against those activities altogether But consent to rough sexual activity that does not cause serious bodily harm is not assault she said People like intense physical sensations they like extreme sports and they like extreme sex she said They can play with each other and give each other intense sensations but they cant seriously harm each other ,0.4

CNN,living, CNN  Its one of the most mocked fonts on the Internet the target of numerous campaigns and websites that believe its comical design has no place in civilized society Now Comic Sans has gone analog with the Sincerity Machine a typewriter that types letters in Comic Sans The idea came to Pittsburgh designer Jesse England one night in September when he was lying in bed reading a comic that used a typewriterstyle font in its lettering It just struck me there was nothing stopping me from making a typewriter that could use a different font he said Why do it Its hard to say exactly But its the kind of project that interests England an artist and educator who leads classes in lasercutting and engraving at a digital media studio for a living Through his job he had access to tools to etch letters out of acrylic and glue them onto the strikers of an old Brother Charger 11 typewriter he found on the street years ago He could have used any font but he chose Comic Sans to provoke a reaction If Id made it in Helvetica people wouldve just observed it as a little design experiment he said in a phone interview Saturday Instead by altering a classic machine to type one of the most polarizing fonts he hopes to make people think about how they consume generate and store media It appears to be working Reaction on his YouTube video has been mixed and extreme much like feelings over the muchmaligned font The Comic Sans Criminal website urges people to take the Comic Sans Pledge to seriously consider whether it is an appropriate font choice before using it in any printed work England has contemplated use of media in previous projects As a Carnegie Mellon graduate student he printed the pages of an eBook to create a bound book He also leads YouTube tutorials on how to write in different fonts to show people that they can retrain themselves to use media differently from how they were taught in school He insists hes not a Luddite he uses a smartphone and the cloud and he appreciates the benefits of the digital age But he worries that our fetishism of nostalgia and homage to older standards in unquestioned fashion is misguided at times He also worries about policies and governments that restrict access to digital media Its great that we can store our own content in the cloud and access email anywhere he said What I want to avoid is the ability to have control over my media life being removed So what does that have to do with a Comic Sans typewriter I sincerely want people to consume and generate and make media in a considered fashion he said As for those who despise the Sincerity Machine as much as the font he has a reminder Nothing is permanent If need be those stickers can come off the keys and the Comic Sans covers can come off the strikers and the machine would be as good as new ,0.4
CNN,living, CNN  She picks up the custom handgun painted in her favorite colors purple and black Her long black braid bounces slightly with each of the six shots she fires Metal pings signify when shes hit the mark She runs to the next target Nine more shots Reload Meet Shyanne Roberts a 10yearold competitive shooter who is out to prove something Children with guns dont always mean disaster I want to be an inspiration to other kids and be a leader said the girl Kids and guns dont always mean bad things happen Natural talent turns into a passion Shyanne competes alongside junior shooters who are participants younger than 18 and even adults Last year she beat out adult women to place second in the Womens Division of the New Jersey Ruger Rimfire Challenge On October 31 she will square off against 200 of the top women shooters at the Brownells Lady 3Gun ProAm Challenge in Covington Georgia Shyanne is the youngest competitive shooter registered at the femaleonly event according to the match director The top shooter has a chance to win 5000 as well as items from a prize table of guns ammo and more The Franklinville New Jersey girl who now has more than 20 sponsors started learning gun safety when she was 5 After she could recite the rules and had grasped what guns can do around age 6 her father started taking her to a gun range Dan Roberts is a certified firearms instructor and a single dad He has custody of Shyanne and her younger brother Shyannes natural talent turned into a passion and at 7 the young athlete started competing in local matches Physically a competitive shooter needs to have good hand and forearm strength as well as the ability to handle the firearms sometimesstrong recoil Good technique also helps Not every child is ready to wield a gun When asked how he feels about his daughter using a gun her father said I feel very comfortable because I know shes been extraordinarily welltrained at how to be safe I could have a fully loaded machine gun and she would not dream of touching it because the curiosity factor has been eliminated Roberts believes early firearm education and training are the keys to reducing gun accidents He argues that if kids knew about guns at a young age their curiosity wouldnt get the best of them leaving tragedy in their trail Even under direct supervision giving kids access to guns can be deadly A 9yearold girl accidentally shot and killed her instructor with a submachine gun called an Uzi in August causing antigun activists to reiterate their objections to allowing guns anywhere around children Roberts balks at the notion that training children to use guns poses an increased danger We can teach fourthgraders safesex practices but we cant mention teaching firearm education in a public grade school without antigun groups having a complete meltdown  Its completely ludicrous he said When and how do parents educate children about guns Not everyone is convinced that teaching gun safety at a young age is the key to preventing accidents Dan Gross president of the Brady Campaign and Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence says its not enough Its not to say that teaching your kids gun safety cant help but relying on that alone is an extremely dangerous mentality Gross said I see tragedies every day that wind up occurring because a parent thought that their child knew better Roberts trusts his daughter but that doesnt mean he believes that every child or even adult is ready to wield a gun As an instructor for over a decade Ive been around adults that shouldnt be within 10 feet of a slingshot he said I have a 10yearold daughter thats a competitive athlete It really depends on the kids involved Its not just a hobby The fifthgraders determination to win a national title before shes an adult shows in how she talks about her career  Its not a hobby its what I want to do she insists There arent many children beating adults at matches at least not since KC Eusebio The California native started shooting competitively at 8 By the time he was 10 he became the youngest Master shooter in the history of the United States Practical Shooting Association Eusebio who is in his mid20s is a professional shooter for Glocks competitive shooting team Winning a competition typically means recognition free equipment and sponsorships according to USPSA Media Director Chris Taylor Rarely do the wins yield cash prizes Youre really not going to make any money doing this This is an expensive sport he said The ones who are professional shooters arent making a living on money theyre making a living on sponsorships 3Gun Nation a different shooting style within competitive shooting is an exception to the cash rule At each match the winner gets a pot of money And at the championship the top shooter wins 50000 Shyanne may not be a professional but she is a rare breed At 10 years old its tough to be doing anything well as your muscles arent quite developed yet Thats pretty impressive said Taylor when he heard someone that young was beating adults in competition Its 95 males that get involved in USPSA but the funny thing is that girls tend to do better than the boys in general he said I think its that theyre more open to coaching Shyanne participates in several types of shooting styles including USPSA 3Gun Action Rifle and Steel Silhouette USPSA and 3Gun are two of about seven major styles within the sport of competitive shooting Participants use shotguns rifles or pistols or a combination of different firearms depending on the shooting style Taylor said When looking at target shooting across all the styles theres been a 67 increase in the number of women participating in the past decade More than 64 million women competed in 2012 compared with 38 million women in 2003 according to the National Sporting Goods Associations annual sports participation reports USPSA membership is smaller with about 25000 active members and 500 children in the junior division Taylor said Were probably one of the smaller niche sports out there The male version of Dance Moms Because of the small group size USPSA participants are part of a closeknit community Taylor said Even though its really competitive its one of the most congenial social groups Ive ever been a part of Dan and Shyanne are very much a part of that culture Roberts said he was recently trading text messages with a woman from Wisconsin whose daughter also competes They plan to set up their camps next to each other at the next match Parents tend to be very involved in their childs participation much like any other sport Competitive shooting costs money Roberts buys firearms intended for Shyanne  she cant legally own her two rifles and two shotguns until shes 18 and her three pistols until shes 21 There are also jerseys and gear that he gets customized for his daughter Beyond the money theres a big time commitment Shyanne lives 15 minutes from the shooting range and she tries to practice at least 30 minutes on each firearm  shotgun pistol and rifle  every day Sometimes thats not realistic as homework comes first Roberts said All together Shyanne practices about 15 hours per week Her dad says thats on the low end of what it should be The next level she needs to get to is where she can walk out the back door onto her own private training range and shoot every day Roberts said At first impression this can seem like a male version of dance moms overbearing mothers thrusting their dance dreams on their children pushing them to practice and win prizes Taylor who attends USPSA events all over the country says its not quite like that in competitive shooting Participants are trying to beat their own scores Its your performance that determines your outcome he said Its not quite the same thing as dance moms You dont have that kind of drama An inkling of the competitive side of the sport came out while interviewing Shyanne over the phone Her father could be heard nearby I do have others hobbies like playing soccer and like  Shyanne said Hanging out her dad whispered in the background Hanging out with my friends and  she said But this is what I really want to do he whispered But this is really what I really want to do Roberts admits that it was his idea to see whether Shyanne wanted to compete in matches I never in my wildest dreams thought this is where we would be at just a few years after teaching her basic gun safety and education he said As an instructor I noticed she had a natural talent I brought up the idea to see if she wanted to do a match and she said yes When she got second place at a competition early on in her career Roberts said thats when he saw it click His daughter was hooked on the sport Roberts said as long as Shyanne is having fun hell keep being her advocate coach PR guy and more When it stops being fun thatll be the end of it I want her to have as much success as she possibly can he said If all that ever comes out of this is that she gets a scholarship to a college with a rifle team  there are 31 colleges that sponsor NCAA rifle teams  and if as a father I have the peace of mind that she can defend herself Im thrilled with just that The rest is just extra But if you ask Shyanne what her dream is the answer is much simpler I want to win the national title ,0.4

CNN,living, Editors note Sally Kohn is an activist columnist and television commentator Follow her on Twitter sallykohn The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author  CNN  Recently my 6yearold picked up the word fckin on the school bus I swear it was from the school bus and I know this because I dont say that word I say fck She has no idea what the word means Then again most often those of us who actually know what it means dont use it that way Its an expletive  adults say it when theyre whipped up about something so kids pick it up and then say it to whip up adults A clothing company has used this interplay to create a video of little girls dressed as princesses dropping fbombs to draw attention to gender injustice and inequality First they each pose as a pretty princess Then a little girl shouts What the fck Im not some pretty fckin helpless princess in distress Im pretty fckin powerful and ready for success What is more offensive the girls ask in the video A little girl saying fck or the fking unequal and sexist way society treats girls and women All great points Points we still dont talk enough about as a society  as evidenced by the unequal treatment still baked into the cultural and policy reality of women in America today And the most interesting premise of the video is indeed tied to its salacious production Why do we think its more offensive for children especially little girls to be cursing like sailors compared with the extraordinary bias discrimination and in too many cases violence these girls and others will face throughout their entire lives Isnt that far more offensive By the same token we as a society often focus on how young women dress  just like we focus on how young black men dress  and suggest that not only their clothes are offensive but they welcome abuse No whats offensive is that young women and young black men are so routinely disproportionately subject to discrimination and violence and that rather than addressing those patterns of bias we blame the victims because of what they were wearing That folks is what is effed up The video itself is provocative and bordering on trite One or two fbombs would have probably got the message across but the barrage of pottywords feels like sensationalistic overkill Although young children are constantly cast in movie scenes depicting unimaginably horrific violence  about which no one bats an eye  somehow a group of girls 6 to 13 cursing their hearts out feels a bit exploitative Theyre profanity puppets my friend philanthropist Ruth Ann Harnisch said Yup At least theyre puppets for good kind of Those violent movies dont usually have a message but are purely about making money This video has a positive message about girl power and womens rights But it is also an ad The video wants you to channel all your outrage not into volunteering at a domestic violence shelter or calling for the reintroduction of the Equal Rights Amendment but into buying a Tshirt Girls Just Want to Have Fundamental Rights reads one such shirt The lettering is ironically bright pink At least 5 from each Tshirt sale goes to a womens rights group The company behind the Tshirts and the ad has its share of critics who accuse the brand FCKH8 of exploiting the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community as well as others to turn a profit Thats fair insofar as I suppose if youre icked out about these girls being put up as potty mouths it seems even ickier if theyre doing it to hock clothing Then again Im a huge fan of the Camp Gyno ad for Hello Flos monthly period care packages  and thats a funny video with a political message but ultimately aimed at pushing product Then again in fairness Camp Gyno a more subtle and ingenious video There are other critiques of the PottyMouthed Princesses video For instance in the video when one girl says I shouldnt need a penis to get paid many see the reference as transphobic In a similar vein earlier this month comedian Sarah Silverman made a video for the National Womens Law Center about the gender pay gap While illuminating viewers about the massive discrepancy in wages Silverman pretends she is getting a sex change to address her own unequal treatment Does this penis make me look fat she jokes at the end But the transcommunity was upset by both the implication that transitioning ones gender is such an easy nonchalant effort and that transmen have it so much easier in the workplace In fact the transcommunity suffers even worse job discrimination and pay inequity So its distinctly possible that the PottyMouthed Princess video offends everyone Certainly conservatives  many of whom insist gender inequality doesnt exist or if it does its biologically natural  transfolks a lot of moms and plenty of others Then again offensive stuff gets attention in our society and plenty of lowestcommondenominator crap aims to do nothing more than generate clicks even if each click drags our society further into the gutter Here you have little girls cursing for a cause Theyre talking about important things things we all need to be talking about And yeah theyre selling Tshirts But remember 5 from every shirt will go to womens rights organizations So far FCKH8 has donated over 250000 to LGBT rights organizations through other Tshirt campaigns Still on the fence about whether I was ultimately

CNN,living," CNN  As beer bottles flew and bonfires burned at the annual Pumpkin Fest in Keene New Hampshire over the weekend those following the events online compared the riotous behavior near Keene State College to protests in Ferguson Missouri Their common refrain a racist double standard in law enforcement response and media coverage that they attempted to mock using hashtags PumpkinSpiceRiots and Pumpkinfest among others The kids at keenestate threw beer cans at cops and got arrested Mike Brown threw his hands up and caught SIX shots If anyone wanted to question if racism still exist in America please research the coverage of pumpkinfest riot and compare it to Ferguson How the media works

pumpkinfest Apples to oranges Such comparisons are complicated experts say because Keene and Ferguson arose from different circumstances Yes law enforcement deployed tear gas and rubber bullets at both scenes but otherwise the two events are an apples to oranges comparison said Donna Murch associate professor of history at Rutgers University in New Jersey Based on what we know about Keene the mostly white riots appear to have stemmed from alcoholfueled parties Ferguson is an ongoing organized movement prompted by the shooting death of an unarmed black teen said Murch whose research focuses around civil rights social movements and policing It demeans Ferguson and St Louis to compare them to Pumpkin Fest said Murch who has spent time with protesters in Missouri While the use of tear gas reflects how normative these militarized population control measures have become Ferguson is a political movement and looting in Keene is quite different from the civil disobedience were seeing in Ferguson Sentiments about the militarization of law enforcement echoed throughout social media over the weekend but they were largely overshadowed by racial discourse Thats where the conversation took a productive turn Murch said by shifting the discussion from comparisons between Ferguson and Keene to differences in how society perceives black and white behavior Your media guide to the differences between Ferguson and pumpkinfest pictwittercomXfRjlhgei0 That kind of comparison is really important because its those attitudes that make state violence possible Murch said White youth are allowed to be children and have a sense of protection no matter how they behave while black youth are criminalized by justice system Theyre not allowed to have childhoods Perceptions of behavior Those perceptions extend to riots too which most people tend to associate with the black community said Victoria W Wolcott director of undergraduate studies at the University of BuffaloNew York and author of Race Riots and Roller Coasters The Struggle Over Segregated Recreation in America Race riots tends to conjure memories of the Rodney King acquittal or 1967 Detroit but those are anomalies Wolcott said Throughout history white mobs have perpetrated the majority of racially motivated riots against the black community over integration in public and private life  from the 1863 draft riots to the civil rights battles of the 1960s It speaks to the notion that white violent behavior is not something talked about or stigmatized in the media or in mainstream society to extent that AfricanAmerican rioting or looting behavior is Wolcott said Pumpkin Fest was a dramatic version of that because of initial characterizations of crowd behavior as rowdy vandalization of cars and streets signs fighting police and setting fires in the streets White people frequently get rowdy at sporting events or music festivals but that behavior is not associated with the white community on the whole in the same way that instances of looting or vandalization tend to be associated with the black community she said Look at these thug gangbangers in Keene NH pumpkinfest pictwittercomDHwgAHC9Kd White behavior gets normalized she said In the AfricanAmerican community the longterm complaint is that the behavior of a small number of people stigmatizes the entire race or community But you dont hear that same racialized language about small groups of white people that behave badly They do not stigmatize the community in the same way Picking battles Journalism professor Douglas M McLeod of the University of WisconsinMadison agrees that comparing the nature of the two events is preposterous seeing as Ferguson arose from enduring longstanding issues related to race and inequality that keep the protests alive unlike in Keene But as far as media coverage goes he sees the two as having more in common than others might believe Both instances were framed as narratives in which the media strove to maintain neutrality by depicting facts on the ground  what happened who was there how many arrests  essentially a story pitting police against the crowd instead of going deep into the themes and issues When we do that the underlying message is heres a group that was creating chaos or disrupting order and the response of police was to restore order said McLeod whose research focuses on the impact of media coverage in social conflicts If there is justification for being upset about the coverage its the fact that the Ferguson situation was treated so much like the New Hampshire not that they were treated differently They were treated like they didnt have enduring issues or evidence to support their frustrations and claims He understands the history of discrimination and inequality that gives rise to frustrations when incidents like this occur But If I were them Id pick their battles to focus on the bad coverage in Ferguson he said There are a lot of things to be concerned about in racial inequity and discrimination This may not be the best example case to hold up ",0.4

CNN,living, Editors note Kelly Wallace is CNNs digital correspondent and editoratlarge covering family career and life She is a mom of two girls Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter CNN  I have long thought millennials who expect flexibility in the workplace would be the group that would bring an end to the stigma that is toooften associated with flex time  the belief that wanting a flexible work arrangement means you arent willing to work as hard But now Im thinking its going to be men who will get us there A new report by the Working Mother Research Institute had some fairly startling findings Nearly eight out of 10 men 77 say they have flexible work schedules and nearly the same amount 79 say they feel somewhat or very comfortable using flex time The online survey of 1000 men 65 of whom were married or had a partner and who had an average age of 39 also found that most men prefer a mix of working from home as well as in the office Of the men surveyed 25 favored working in the office full time but occasionally from home followed by 23 who preferred working from home one to two days per week Also 47 said they have a formal flex arrangement at work according to the report READ Worklife balance not just a womens issue  Men not only want flex they are using it confidently  in numbers that rival women said Jennifer Owens editorial director of Working Mother Media It means that workplace flex is no longer a working mother or even a womens issue Its an everyone issue which lends more fuel to the argument that flex works no matter who you are The Working Mother report which was sponsored by the accounting firm Ernst  Young follows other surveys that are helping to change the narrative that worklife balance is strictly a concern of women Its not According to a survey last year by the Pew Research Center 50 of working fathers said it was very or somewhat difficult to balance the responsibilities of their jobs and their families  nearly as many as working mothers agreed 56 READ Are millennial moms more traditional happier And according to a national survey earlier this year by FlexStrategy GroupWorkLife Fit Inc which works with organizations and individuals to create flexible workplaces three out of four telecommuters were men The more men embrace flex time the more perceptions are likely to shift Consider this finding in the Working Mother Report 63 of the men surveyed said employees who use flex time are as productive or more productive than employees who dont participate in any flexible work arrangement For women its a really big deal to realize that the men on your team are flexing their schedules as well said Owens When everybodys doing it the women are less likely to be thought of as less committed to their work and careers just because they leave at 5 pm to pick up the kids from afterschool programs a few times a week That said there still appears to be a double standard when it comes to men and women using flex time Dorothy Liu founder and partner of VelaTrio Consulting said on Facebook that she always found it interesting that when women take advantage of flexible schedules they are viewed as not being serious about their careers When a man uses flex time she said he is often viewed as being a good family man Sara Sutton Fell chief executive officer of FlexJobs a company which tries to find flexible work arrangements for women and men said there are historical stigmas associated with work flexibility For example when many people think of working from home they envision a mother working while also watching her kids doing laundry taking regular breaks to chat with neighbors or any number of similar lessthanprofessional distractions Sutton Fell who is also founder of the nonprofit 1 Million for Work Flexibility which focuses on raising awareness of work flexibility pointed to a study published last year by the Journal of Social Issues It found that bosses favored men over women when granting requests for flexible work schedules The hope is that as more men are part of the worklife conversation and are experiencing it firsthand the double standard may start to shift But heres another sticking point There is still a widely held belief that flexible work arrangements are more challenging to manage According to the report while eight out of 10 male supervisors believe employees should have access to flexible schedules 39 wish they didnt have to manage employees who work flexibly This is something we try to educate people on all the time said Sutton Fell Any change in the way we are used to doing things will feel hard at first but the great thing is that the management style that works best with flexible workers is also the style that results in better productivity a more engaged and collaborative team and a better functioning team overall READ Microsoft CEOs gender gaffe Worrisome for women  Men also face some of the same judgment that women who use flextime experience According to the Working Mother report 41 of men who have flexible schedules say they frequently feel their commitment to work is questioned by others That number jumps to 58 for men who work from home three to four times per week And while 59 of the working dads surveyed would choose to work part time if they could still have a meaningful and productive career 36 say parttime work is looked down upon at their company We clearly have a long way to go before more managers and companies realize what the men in the Working Mother report and what women in many other surveys have said loud and clear Flexible work schedules are good for employee and employer In this newest report 86 of men said flex time improves their overall job satisfaction 85 said it improves their productivity 84 said it improves their motivation and 82 said it improves their loyalty to the organization With numbers like those why wouldnt all companies embrace it Do you think there is a double standard in how men and women who use flex time are judged Tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook ,0.4

CNN,living, Editors note Bryant Terry is an Oakland Californiabased healthy eating advocate and author of AfroVegan Farm Fresh African Caribbean and Southern Flavors Remixed Follow him on Twitter bryantterry The opinions expressed are solely those of the author CNN  When I first saw Thug Kitchen in 2013 I like thousands of other people was intrigued by a website  anonymously penned  that peppered its posts with phrases like Hydrate Mother Fker and Antioxidants are all up in the Bh in an effort to promote healthy eating So effective it was hard to look away Most compelling to me and my contemporaries was the sites name specifically the word thug As an AfricanAmerican activist and author working to excite people to eat more healthfully and create more access to fresh affordable food in communities most impacted by food injustice I have long thought about the important role of pop culture and online media in changing peoples attitudes habits and politics around food Start with the visceral move to the cerebral and then the political has been the mantra guiding most of my efforts The pairing of vulgar slangheavy admonitions with big bright nutritious recipes was certainly visceral But the more I read through the Thug Kitchen posts the more skeptical I became about the cerebral and political aspects if they even existed I held out hope that Thug Kitchen was a hamfisted attempt to craft viral memes that might positively influence the eating habits of the thugs that the wider culture imagines when that word is used young black men living in lowincome urban neighborhoods In her book Talkin and Testifyin linguist Geneva Smitherman describes how through song story folk sayings and rich verbal interplay among everyday people lessons and precepts about life and survival are handed down from generation to generation So maybe this anonymous writer was a workingclass young person of color attempting to engage in linguistically and culturally appropriate cyberoutreach to young folks with similar backgrounds Dont fear the vegan While on a promotional tour in the spring for my latest book AfroVegan I met a 30something Philadelphiabased healthy eating activist who was focused on transforming the consumption habits of people by inspiring and improving the quality of life one fruit and veggie at a time Spreading the love and knowledge of an all plantbased diet This cat was affectionately known as the Gangster Vegan A less cynical side of me imagined someone like him who seemed genuinely committed to transforming communities or like YouTubes outrageously fun Sista Girl Felicia O Dell aka Auntie Fee as the blogger behind Thug Kitchen If only A week before the publication of the sites eponymous cookbook Thug Kitchen The Official Cookbook Eat Like You Give a Fk it was revealed that Michelle Davis and Matt Holloway a young white couple living in Hollywood created and maintained the site Needless to say audiences were surprised Many critics accused the duo of playing around with a postInternet form of blackface and ultimately benefiting from it financially Some apologists denied there was anything specifically racist or even racial about the swearing and slang Others cried foul at the critics claiming that a little harmless inauthenticity was AOK if it raised the profile of fresh healthy foods and diets Certainly swearing isnt exclusive to AfricanAmericans But many of the sites captions usually dreamed up by Davis to accompany Holloways striking visuals rely heavily on phrases from black rap lyrics standup routines and films which eventually went mainstream Nobody needs mayo in their life Calm your bitch ass down like a boss and Dont fk around with some sorryass tendollar takeout are hardly the language of a Sopranos mobster or Sons of Anarchy biker And thats a problem If Guidos Kitchen were revealed to be the work not of a bluecollar East Coast ItalianAmerican but of an Asian hipster living in the Bay Area wouldnt his credibility be shattered The careful avoidance of putting any faces to the Thug Kitchen name for as long as possible two years suggests an awareness of the offense Its no coincidence that Thug Kitchens admirers often imagined the voice of the site to be that of shrill vulgar and often uproariously funny black men like actor Samuel L Jackson or rapper Ghostface Killah and not that of actor Robert De Niro or Hells Angels founder Sonny Barger The contrast drawn between the consciously progressive dishes shown and the imagined vulgar ignorant thug only works if the thug is the kind of grimy person of color depicted in the news and in popular media as hustling drugs on a dystopian block under the colorful glow of various burger stands bulletproof takeout spots or bodega signs Those kind of people the visual gag suggests intimidating you into preparing arugula or tempeh How absurd how shocking how hilarious Whites masking in AfricanAmerican street vernacular for their own amusement and profit isnt just the tired trope of cultural exploitation which has a rich tradition going back beyond the bete noires of the moment Macklemore and Iggy Azalea past Vanilla Ice and Quentin Tarantino and even beyond Madonna Elvis and the minstrel shows of the late 19th century that first innovated modern American blackface spectacles And it isnt just breaking some unwritten codes governing race and language either A common misunderstanding about racism that there are hordes of sensitive politically correct grievance peddlers waiting to descend upon people for saying the wrong word or idea usually comes arminarm with claims of reverse racism and a witchhunt mentality of political correctness run amok that is as hurtful and divisive as the allegedly racist word or idea itself Take Paula Deen and Donald Sterling the sentiment holds and how they are punished for merely saying a mistaken word or opinion in private that later became public knowledge Paula Deen and Southern food Critics say credit is past due The worst offense here is the misrepresentation As food historian Jessica Harris has noted the traditional West and Central African diet and AfricanAmerican diet are essentially  a majority vegetarian one Concepts like farmtotable eating seasonally and eating locally while increasingly popular in the mainstream were not news to a community who was enslaved and brought to America generations ago to help develop the agrarian South AfricanAmerican cuisine may suffer from the stigma and stereotype of being based in fatty porkbased dishes and butterheavy comfort foods but in truth that kind of meatheavy indulgent decadence was scarce for millions struggling under the oppression of segregation before the industrialization of our food system When we peel away the negative stereotypes and reductive portrayals of AfricanAmerican food we see a diverse and complex culinary tradition with nutrientrich foods like collards mustards turnips butter beans blackeyed peas green beans sugar snap peas and the like at the cuisines core Urban farmer If I do not farm Ill get sick As of 2011 for 57 of AfricanAmericans the Southern United States is still home and most of them come from families who have been close to the land for generations as sharecroppers and migrant agricultural workers My grandparents and those of many other Southerners cultivated home gardens that yielded a number of the crops mentioned above Many still do First lady Michelle Obamas advocacy of home gardens isnt trendy for her and millions like her who descend from the South its traditional Whether or not the hipsters and health nuts charmed by Thug Kitchen realize this vegetarian vegan and plantstrong culture in the black experience predates pernicious thug stereotypes Said another way the Thug Kitchens central comic conceit doesnt jibe with reality ,0.4

CNN,living, Editors note Kelly Wallace is CNNs digital correspondent and editoratlarge covering family career and life She is a mom of two girls Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter CNN  It was a heartbreaking week for three families football teams and communities Three players from three different states  Alabama North Carolina and New York  died last week And while investigations are underway in each case it is believed the deaths may have been related to football In the most recent incident a Long Island 16yearold reportedly suffered a serious head injury during a varsity game He was rushed to the hospital and died after surgery I cant even imagine what his family and the others are going through As Gina Rau a mom of two in Portland Oregon put it We shouldnt lose our children this way No we should not As weve learned more and more about the dangers of concussions and head injuries in football including from research on the brains of professional players who died we have definitely seen a drop in the number of kids playing the game Participation in Pop Warner youth football leagues dropped 95 from 2010 to 2012 according to a report last year by ESPNcom READ Concussion concerns may lead to fewer boys playing football  Now after three deaths in a short time the question is whether more parents will decide the sport is too violent and dangerous for their children On one side are parents like John Furjanic of Chicago who played football through high school and during college at Yale He says his 7yearold daughter will never play football and if he had a son he would never let him play either I have had over 10 concussions playing football said Furjanic who says he was coached by some of the best in the business No coaching technique can result in safety when the point of playing defense is to play with reckless abandon The kids today call it blowing people up The game is violent and people get hurt in violent games On the other side are parents like Ben Smith chief executive officer of Wanderful Media whose eighthgrader plays football Smith said he has certainly thought about the risks but says the training put in place in childrens programs during the last few years has given him the confidence to let his son play That training is part of the Heads Up Football program funded by the NFL Coaches are educated on how to deal with concussions and how to teach safer ways to tackle where players are taught to keep their heads up and to lead contact with their shoulders not their heads Hitting has dramatically changed the game from when I was on the field over 20 years ago Smith said In the end it comes down to the league training and coaches You have to be comfortable that they are putting safety first Amanda Rodriguez of Frederick Maryland says her 9yearold is more passionate about football than just about anything else and her 6yearold just started playing as well She urged her sons league to adopt the Heads Up Football program and it did READ High schools tackle football concussions I think that its something you can definitely see in how the younger kids are playing versus how the older boys are playing football because its a whole different way of playing said Rodriguez a mom of three and host of the blog DudeMomcom So I feel safer knowing that my kids are playing in a league that is doing something proactive about their safety Like any parent Rodriguez says she has her concerns but what helps her is putting the dangers in perspective The risk is there but the reward is so great its a risk that we take and statistically I dont think  that risk rivals things like riding in a car or riding your bike Other parents whose children play football pointed to sports such as horseback riding and gymnastics that can also be dangerous for children but said the dangers of those sports often dont get as much attention as football Because of its inherently violent nature football is often singled out for scrutiny re head injuries and headneck injury deaths said David Hawkins of Ann Arbor Michigan whose son plays football According to a report by the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research deaths in football are rare but tragic events with 17 direct and indirect deaths during the 2013 football season out of approximately 11 million high school players Gina Rau of Portland Oregon whose 10yearold is a talented soccer player says she was initially thrilled he wasnt interested in football because of her concerns about head injuries Then she learned that concussions are just as common in soccer Thankfully there is so much attention to the longterm potential damage of concussions that clubs associations and parents are taking this issue seriously she said There has been increased education on how to identify a concussion and the league doesnt allow kids at age 10 to dropkick the ball she said READ Smart football helmet may help detect concussions  Ironically it was Rau who ended up with a mild concussion while watching her sons game The mom who runs her own marketing and brand consulting business was injured after an older boy kicked the ball over two goals and it rammed right into her head Because of that situation I feel like Im better educated as a parent as to what to look for in case my child is injured she said We pray that we never need that knowledge though Terry Greenwald a divorced father of three says his son was only 5 when he started playing ice hockey another sport known for its concussion issues His son is 26 now and never suffered a serious injury but Greenwald thinks back to when his son was a senior in high school and was asked to play football I adamantly said No  said Greenwald who based his decision on the fact that his son had never played the game before It is my opinion that when a child begins playing a sport with injuries like this they learn proper techniques to protect themselves and how to avoid causing severe injuries to others I am confident that saying no was the right decision for my son I would not presume to make that decision for anyone else he said I believe in sports but I also believe each person needs to consider a lot of factors when choosing which sport to participate in and that a parents responsibility is to choose wisely when allowing their child to make this decision Opinion Make football safe for our kids  Childrens television host Miss Lori a mother of three remembers when her son was choosing between basketball and football Both sports have a connection to her family she said Her adopted father played for the Harlem Globetrotters while her birth father whom she only met once played college football and was drafted by a professional team He died of dementia before he reached 60 and she wonders if his deteriorating condition was related to his participation in football As her son who excelled in many sports was deciding which to focus on she left the decision to him  but quietly prayed hed pass on football Silently I said a prayer to the sports gods above to put basketball first and firmly in his dreams It worked and I am grateful said the social media specialist and Babblecom contributor What sport a child may or may not play is an individual parents decision  or an individual childs decision As Amanda Rodriguez told me if a child is passionate about a sport or an instrument or some other activity wouldnt a parent want to nurse those passions And while there is definite debate over whether football has become too dangerous for our children knowing what we know now its clear theres agreement on a key way to help keep our kids safe making sure safety is the top focus Louise Sattler a psychologist educational consultant and mom of two grown children in southern California said her son played school and regional soccer for years and suffered one concussion and several other injuries While opposing coaches always urged him to keep playing she praised her sons astute team coach who was always cautious and would send him off the field and to the emergency room As with everything in our lives including football soccer and other sports common sense and safety need to prevail said Sattler who is also the owner of a business providing sign language instruction  The lesson that we care about health and safety far outweighs the game Would you or do you let your kids play football Tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook ,0.4

CNN,living, Editors note This is an update to a story that was done last year by CNN Digital Correspondent Kelly Wallace on how a growing number of schools are monitoring students social media accounts and the legal and privacy implications of such moves CNN  Just as parents are grappling with how to keep their kids safe on social media schools are increasingly confronting a controversial question Should they do more to monitor students online interactions offcampus to protect them from dangers such as bullying drug use violence and suicide In Huntsville Alabama the school system hired a retired FBI agent for security work which includes reviewing social media when a high priority tip is received about an emerging threat to a school student or staff member Keith Ward a spokesman for the Huntsville City Schools told CNN Ward said the district paid 157190 to a firm TW Inc which employs the former FBI agent The districts connection to the firm and the exagent was first reported by AIcom Last year the district received a tip about a social media post concerning a threat to a high school teacher Ward said The student was found to have brought a knife with an eight inch blade to campus he added After this incident the superintendent wanted to have a method to quickly identify threats before any harm might occur Ward said The district started a program called Students Against Fear SAFe which is based on tips from students staff members and parents Only after a tip comes in regarding the potential for a student to pose a threat is the students public social media activity checked out Since the program started 14 students have been expelled but not due to their social media posts Ward said  a review of their social media accounts merely supported the case for expulsion As any good parent would do we take all the measures that are appropriate to ensure the safety of our kids said school district superintendent Casey Wardynski in September when asked about the program at a news conference We were able to save a life  The Huntsville Alabama school system is just the latest district to capture headlines for monitoring students on social media sites In the summer of 2012 the Glendale school district in suburban Los Angeles was in the spotlight for its decision to pay a tech firm 40500 to track what middle and high school students post publicly on Facebook Twitter and other social media The school district went with the firm Geo Listening after a pilot program with the company helped a student who was talking on social media about ending his life company CEO Chris Frydrych told CNNs Michael Martinez last September We were able to save a life said Richard Sheehan the Glendale superintendent adding that two students in the school district had committed suicide the past two years Its just another avenue to open up a dialogue with parents about safety he said The Glendale school district is not alone David Jones president of the firm Safe Outlook Corporation said two school districts and three schools pay on average between 4000 to 9000 per year for one of his technology products called CompuGuardian and that he expects the number of schools participating to go up Jones said he was not at liberty to reveal which schools work with his company Parents beware of bullying on sites youve never seen  His product gives schools access to among other things reporting tools that allow users to search key words connected to cyberbullying and drug use and to see whether students are researching topics about dangers such as school violence You can identify a student and you can jump into their activity logs and see exactly what theyve typed exactly where theyve gone exactly what theyve done and it gives you some history that you can go back to that child and use some disciplinary action Jones said You can bring in the parent and say Hey look this is what your childs doing You need to talk to them about it  Florida suicide sparks questions for schools  The issue of just what kids may be doing to each other online gained even more attention after a 12yearold Florida girl Rebecca Sedwick who was allegedly repeatedly cyberbullied jumped to her death in September of last year Two girls ages 12 and 14 were arrested and charged with aggravated stalking accused of sending Sedwick messages such as Why arent you dead and Wait a minute why are you still alive Those charges were eventually dropped Police file raises questions about bullying in Rebecca Sedwicks suicide Wayne Blanton executive director of the Florida School Boards Association said the school was aware of oncampus bullying of Sedwick and dealt with it by separating the students and putting them in different classes but it was not aware of any offcampus bullying  online  that was allegedly taking place Under a Florida law that went into effect in July of last year PDF before Sedwicks death if parents or students notify a school about suspected bullying offcampus the school has the authority to look at a students Facebook posts and emails according to Blanton The key to everything is we have to be notified  because there is no way we could monitor all the Facebook accounts and email accounts and tweets and Twitters and all that Blanton said We have 28 million students but if its reported our teachers our principals our school resource officers are receiving extensive training and acting immediately on that A gray area that could  lead to a lot of litigation Blanton said school administrators are talking especially after the Sedwick case about what more they can do in terms of monitoring kids social media but said that besides the logistics of keeping tabs on millions of students there are big legal questions about a students privacy rights,0.4

You cant make a bond with anyone like the bond me and you have right now Tell me what your going to do Your gonna piss me off And then some shits gonna go down and I dont think youll like it It breaks me It actually does I know it seems like Im sweating it off But Im not And I never will be able to Its a cry for help said Avital Norman Nathman who wrote a story for The Frisky on the Washington tragedy headlined School Shootings Toxic Masculinity and Boys Will Be Boys  This kid was hurting but do we have a safe space for young men to feel OK talking about their feelings without fear of repercussion whether thats teasing even if its gentle ribbing asked Norman Nathman editor of the motherhood anthology The Good Mother Myth Emotional literacy in boys  Type emotional literacy for boys into Google and Raising Cain Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys is the first item that will pop up Coincidentally the book came out just days before the Columbine school shooting Coauthor Michael Thompson says the cultural ideal of masculinity the thinking that men need to be strong and independent is causing many boys and young men to have trouble bearing difficult emotions Masculinity mental illness and guns A lethal equation Teenage boys still have the myths Thompson said They still believe in the myths of total strength and independence and when your girlfriend drops you and you are flooded with feelings of loss shame and abandonment then you think you cant manage these feelings And thats where the issue of emotional literacy comes in because emotional literacy means being able to identify your feelings and being able to manage them said Thompson a clinical psychologist who works at a boys school in Massachusetts The Mask You Live In to be released in 2015 is a film about the impact that our narrow definition of masculinity is having on boys men and society in general The experts interviewed for the film say that boys have been socialized in such a way that theyre not supposed to experience pain or suffering and that theyre expected to be dominant stoic and in control at all times said Jennifer Siebel Newsom the films writer producer and director She also wrote produced and directed the documentary Miss Representation which examined the role of the media in the underrepresentation of women in power If young men do not have an outlet for expressing their feelings and communicating honestly and outwardly with others they are subject to an incredibly lonely and isolating existence said Siebel Newsom who is also the founder and chief executive officer of the nonprofit The Representation Project The numbers paint a portrait of frustration and despair that can lead to extreme behavior Eightyone percent of completed suicides among young people ages 10 to 24 are by boys according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Although girls attempt suicide twice as often Thompson said they typically leave notes or take pills whereas boys often get a gun or hang themselves or they jump off a bridge Why are they doing that Thompson asked Well they feel they have to do something that looks strong Im hurt but Im still strong I can leap off a bridge They do what in many ways is the final test of masculinity What more can we do to help boys Siebel Newsom believes a conversation is necessary among parents guardians educators and coaches and young men allowing boys to know that there is more than one way to be a man  SOS for stressedout teens We have to redefine healthy masculinity for our boys to include empathy emotion care and compassion she said And we have to model it challenging unhealthy dominant norms in public culture and daily life Thompson said that as we see an increase in fathers involvement in their sons lives peoples idea of masculinity will change If your father is diapering you from the getgo and taking care of you and bathing you and feeding you then you dont think masculinity is just a tough thing  He also said we should think about encouraging our boys to take on caretaking positions just like girls do in terms of babysitting or helping the elderly Meeting the needs of somebody whos dependent allows you to become more accepting of your own dependency needs he said Do modern dads get enough credit Parents need to talk to their boys but too often they arent using the right words said Thompson Theyre often saying Be in touch with your emotions  Embrace your inner femininity and men experience that as they are being told to be more like women and they reject it and teenage boys do especially Dad No be a man narrative in home  Jim Higley of Chicago who has two sons and a daughter said he has always tried to help his sons understand what they are feeling by literally saying to them Youre feeling frustrated  anxious  nervous  hurt right now but I promise that feeling will go away  As a dad we are obligated to take our sons by the hand and make sure they are as familiar with their emotions as they are with healthy eating habits the importance of exercise and sexuality said Higley an awardwinning author radio host and creator of the site Bobblehead Dad  Buzz Bishop father of two boys who are 4 and 7 said the be a man narrative is not present in their home There are not stereotypical gender roles in the house said Bishop of Calgary Alberta who founded a blog called Dad Camp I am an active and engaged parent and dont feel the need to berate masculinity into them Terry Greenwald a divorced father of three says he has spent a lifetime dealing with his own emotions and trying to find ways to deal with them effectively When it comes to his younger son who is 26 he believes he has been dealing with the being tough issue since the boy started playing hockey when he was 5 They fall or get hit and are told be tough or get back out there  Greenwald said As a parent and a former athlete I wanted him to find a balance not let little things stop him but also not to try and keep playing if he really was hurt Greenwald said he tried to strike a balance with his son with emotional issues too  what to share and what to hold inside  and to this day tries to initiate conversations with his son to open the doors to him expressing his feelings Norman Nathman who has a 7yearold son says they play the song Its Alright to Cry from the hit 70s album Free to Be  You and Me all the time in their household Its such a simple concept but one that gets lost to boys as they grow up she said She wishes middle and high schools would focus as much on emotional development as many elementary schools do where the goal is giving boys tools on how to work out feelings just like they have tools for math and language arts Its just padding up their tool belt so they have more things to go to before it boils over and it turns into any number of these tragedies How much do the you think the be a man messaging in society is hurting our boys and young men Tell Kelly Wallace on

CNN,living, CNN  Every so often a boy shows up to school at Garden Oaks Montessori in Houston wearing nail polish or a headband When that happens children  and sometimes parents  ask questions But Principal Lindsey Pollock is confident her staff knows what to do They have been trained to support children who deviate from gender norms whether its a boy in girls clothes or a child who was born a girl and wants to be called a boy And they know its school policy Diversity is a good thing We all benefit from the unique characteristics that we all have Pollock said Our goal is to build a culture of inclusivity and understanding and a mindset of being welcoming to everyone Across the country schools are adopting similar mantras for transgender and gender nonconforming children in their mission statements and policies Advocates say the efforts reflect growing support for research showing the negative effects of enforcing fixed ideas of what it means to be a boy or a girl on children especially in learning environments This is the reality in which we live Gender is a continuum not a box said Graciela SlesaranskyPoe dean of Arcadia Universitys School of Education in Pennsylvania Her experience with a gendernonconforming child led her to become a consultant who has helped schools across the country learn to accommodate children who are opening up about gender identity as early as kindergarten We need to be sure we dont create structures and artifices to reinforce binaries that limit and constrain the ways in which we behave and express ourselves The right to an education free of discrimination based on gender identity is protected by federal state and local laws The US Department of Education in April reaffirmed a 2010 declaration that Title IXs sex discrimination prohibition extends to claims of discrimination based on gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity Massachusetts and California are among the growing number of states with strong legal protections for transgender and gender nonconforming students At least 160 cities and have passed laws prohibiting gender identity discrimination according to advocacy group Gender Spectrum Wisconsins Madison Metropolitan School District is one of many districts to issue guidance to administrators for creating a welcoming environment for transgender and gender nonconforming students The efforts are not always welcomed by the community Opponents of California AB 1266 are working to get it on the ballot for veto referendum This week a Nebraska parent raised objections over training for Lincoln Public School staff about lesbian gay bisexual and transgender issues In an email to parents the mother cited handouts including one called 12 easy steps on the way to gender inclusiveness that recommended against gendered expressions such as boys and girls the Lincoln Journal Star reported The mother and school district did not respond to CNNs request for comment By sidelining academic teacher training and replacing it with social reengineering the LPS administration has placed a higher priority on social reformation than on education the mother said in an introductory speech prepared for an upcoming school board meeting according to documents obtained by the Journal Star Advocates say improving school climate and legal protections are important because transgender and gender nonconforming children are frequent targets of bullying A 2012 survey found that 42 of gender nonconforming students feel safe at school compared to 62 of their gender conforming counterparts More than 40 of students who participated in a 2005 National School Climate Survey felt unsafe at school because of their gender expression 26 said they were physically harassed the previous year because of their gender expression The work that we do is not to make schools safer just for transgender students but to make schools safe for everyone regardless of where they fall on the gender spectrum said Kim Westheimer director of the Human Rights Campaign Foundation Family Projects Welcoming Schools initiative The program helps schools such as Garden Oaks Montessori create an inclusive climate through staff training policy recommendations and bullying prevention approaches Creating a welcoming environment is an ongoing process that involves various stakeholders from the school community Here are some steps that educators parents and advocacy groups recommend for creating a gender inclusive school community 1 Dont separate children by gender When its time to work in groups experts recommend coming up with alternatives for separating children The first letters of their last names birthday months clothing colors or types of pets they own are just some ways to do it but many more exist Separating by categories other than gender helps children identify and build relationships based on common ground  or at the very least start conversations In other words it helps them learn to relate to others based on similarities and differences other than gender 2 Start the day with inclusive language and stick with it  Instead of saying good morning boys and girls experts recommend using broader language to convey a sense of equality and togetherness Again a variety of alternatives exist such good morning class or good morning everyone Using inclusive language throughout the day reinforces the idea that boys and girls are not limited by their biology to succeed in the same arenas said Rhonda Thomason with Welcoming Schools Often we imply that boys or girls are only good at specific things through the subtle and notsosubtle things we say or the activities we nudge them toward 3 Feature diversity in books posters and other workbooks Welcoming Schools Gender Spectrum and TransYouth Family Allies offer bibliographies and other resources for classroom materials featuring diversity in various forms A wide selection of childrens books feature transgender and gender expansive children Many more feature men and women in nonstereotypical roles of all races and sexual orientation the same goes for posters that hang in classrooms 4 Create a professional development plan to help educators Some schools devote several administrative prep days to familiarizing staff with issues surrounding transgender and gender variant children After all teachers set classroom tone through language and lesson plans They also can intervene in instances of bullying or namecalling and when appropriate use them as teachable moments In order to act experts say educators need to develop a shared understanding of gender identity and language to be able to communicate with students and parents But they need to know what to look for and they need to believe that they have the support of the school which leads to the next suggestion 5 Have strong policies to support transgender students Some schools may not know what do if a child who was referred to by male pronouns now uses female pronouns What does that mean in the classroom or on their transcript Policies should address how to handle names and pronouns bathroom use extracurricular activities student records and confidentiality said Westheimer with Welcoming Schools These issues can be complicated so best to consult an expert in your area or national organizations such as Welcoming Schools Gender Spectrum or TransYouth Family Allies 6 Engage the entire school community Each school approaches this differently One school in Maine sent a letter home to parents informing them that a secondgrader who identified as a girl the previous year would be recognized as a boy this year Others incorporate the discussion into class or schoolwide meetings The goal is the same to set community norms for whats expected and create a platform for people to ask questions ,0.4

CNN,living, Editors note Californias Senate Bill 967 was signed into law on Sunday Previously CNNs Emanuella Grinberg explained in depth what that will entail CNN  Thousands of freshmen at the University of CaliforniaBerkeley swiped their student cards last week at the doors of Zellerbach Hall and filed into the dark auditorium for one of the few mandatory sessions in their threeweek welcome program Dealing with sexual harassment alcohol and stress were on the 90minute Bear Pact agenda  much of what you might expect in a freshman orientation said 17yearold Alexandra YoonHendricks who attended one of three sessions offered One topic however caught her by surprise the definition of sexual consent the way we let others know what were up for be it a goodnight kiss or the moments leading up to sex A slide projected onstage defined consent through three pillars Knowing exactly what and how much Im agreeing to expressing my intent to participate deciding freely and voluntarily to participate Instead of waiting for your partner to say no speakers onstage told students you should seek an explicit yes It could come in the form of a smile a nod or a verbal yes as long as its unambiguous enthusiastic and ongoing To YoonHendricks a staff writer for the teen publication Sex Etc it was a refreshing stance for a school to endorse I loved hearing that because Id never really heard people describe consent in that manner before she said Instead of saying no means no yes means yes looks at sex as a positive thing Its a message students across the country are hearing as they return to campus for a new semester Often referred to as affirmative consent its the concept of both parties agreeing to sexual conduct either through clear verbal communication or nonverbal cues or gestures There are lots of ways to express yes My favorite is yes a speaker told the Berkeley freshmen California might become the first state to make affirmative consent law Senate Bill 967 would amend the education code to require schools whose students receive financial aid to uphold an affirmative consent standard in disciplinary hearings and to educate students about the standard The legislature sent the bill to Gov Jerry Brown last week The legislation has the support of victims rights groups violence prevention groups and the University of California System But critics worry it could define a great deal of sexual activity as sexual assault and undermine due process rights of the accused Even if Brown vetoes the legislation consent will still be defined on the University of Californias 10 campuses as an affirmative unambiguous and conscious decision by each participant to engage in mutually agreedupon sexual activity MORE Why vomiting on your attacker wont prevent rape What that looks like in practice is harder to explain leaving institutions grappling with how to make the policy more meaningful than words in a student handbook Theres varying language but the language gets to the core of people having to communicate their affirmation to participate in sexual behavior said Denice Labertew of the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault It requires a fundamental shift in how we think about sexual assault Its requiring us to say women and men should be mutually agreeing and actively participating in sexual behavior A laughing matter Its a shift schools have endorsed before with mixed results Ohios Antioch College became a target of national mockery after revising its Sexual Offense Prevention Policy in 1993 to require that students give ongoing verbal consent at each stage of intimacy The policy reads today much as it did then Consent means verbally asking and verbally giving or denying consent for all levels of sexual behavior Consent is required regardless of the parties relationship prior sexual history or current activity Grinding on the dance floor is not consent for further sexual activity the policy reads It cannot be given if the person is intoxicated unconscious or asleep The rule was mocked in a Saturday Night Live skit featuring Phil Hartman as the host of the game show Is It Date Rape The date rape players acted out encounters that Antioch students played by Shannen Doherty and Chris Farley called out as date rape or not date rape The date rape players talked like robots using cold and clinical language said Louise Smith Antioch dean of community life In reality good communication between sexual partners can be fun even sexy she said If you think about it not in the SNL kind of way but as a conversation thats ongoing as things progress it can work Smith said The school which closed in 2008 and reopened in 2011 has no empirical way of measuring the policys success said Smith an Antioch alum But the school feels vindicated by SB 967 and renewed dialogue around consent Despite the fact we were ridiculed we were extremely proud of this policy We felt like it was forwardthinking and in line with our values about social justice equality and health Meanwhile affirmative consent continues to be fodder for sitcoms and sketch comedy shows highlighting the profound disconnect between the policys bureaucratic requirements and the reality of human sexuality said Joseph Cohn legislative and policy director for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education a legal advocacy group that has come out against the legislation The disconnect underscores the serious difficulty that passage of SB 967 would present to campus administrators across California he said Under this legislation students who are or may become sexually active must now worry about documenting that they obtained consent because proving affirmative consent is the only way to defend oneself before a campus tribunal Rewriting the rules of consent Its no laughing matter to survivors feminists and prevention specialists who have long pushed for schools to enforce some form of affirmative consent policy not only as the moral code governing student conduct but the standard of proof used in disciplinary proceedings Now its starting to gain traction on college campuses amid pressure from advocacy groups and the federal government to do more to prevent sexual violence Schools nationwide are in the process of rewriting or have already rewritten their sexual assault policies procedures and prevention education programs to meet standards in the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act known as the Campus SaVE Act That took effect in 2013 as part of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act said Tracey Vitchers with Students Active for Ending Rape which assists studentled campaigns to reform college sexual assault policies More Violence Against Women Act shines light on samesex abuse The White House further signaled its support for the issue this year through the formation of the Task Force to Protect Students From Sexual Assault Its goal is to help schools improve policies and protocol for preventing and dealing with sexual misconduct so they comply with the Campus SaVE Act One of the task forces recommendations for revising sexual misconduct policies included defining consent as a voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity Past consent should not imply consent nor should silence or the absence of resistance the guidelines recommend To reach compliance with the Violence Against Women Act the California State University and University of California systems in February adopted standards similar to those in SB 967 including affirmative consent spokeswoman Dianne Klein said Weve been working on these issues for quite a while Is it perfect No But we are confident that we are doing everything we can and will continue to do so Berkeley also was revising its orientation program before the White House task force recommendations based on student feedback and guidance from the federal government spokeswoman Janet Gilmore said In addition to Bear Pact students are required to take online awarenessbuilding programs on alcohol use and sexual harassment More Survivorled activist movement leads fight against campus rape But is it enough The sexual harassment component of Bear Pact evolved from existing consent education workshops offered at Berkeley since 2011 called EmpowerU The smaller inperson workshops covered affirmative consent by walking through various scenarios followed by group discussions While making Bear Pact mandatory and emphasizing affirmative consent are positive steps some worry that expanding the presentation into a large lecture format reduces its effectiveness For Bear Pact the 90minute EmpowerU workshop was compressed into a 45minute lecture with no time for discussion Berkeley student and Bear Pact speaker Meghan Warner would like to see consent education continue beyond orientation and sexual harassment workshops and into classrooms and academic curricula We still have a long way to go said Warner who works in sexual violence prevention through a number of roles with the Associated Students of the University of California and the Greek System I think its a great step in the right direction but I dont think its sufficient to educate someone for the rest of their life Creating positive models of consent Typical lessons about consent focus on what it does not look like Most students learn at some point in their postsecondary careers that by law consent cannot be given under the influence of drugs or alcohol or if someone is asleep or unconscious In other words sex under the influence can be considered nonconsensual which is the definition of rape Through presentations and workshops social media campaigns and fliers posted on campus schools also are trying to impress upon students that consent should be enthusiastic voluntary and unambiguous It can even be sexy But affirmative consent rules wont stop someone intent on committing sexual assault Sexual violence is still a problem even at schools that promote affirmative consent including Berkeley Berkeley is one of 76 schools under investigation by the Department of Educations Office of Civil Rights for violations of Title IX the federal law that grants students access to education free of genderbased discrimination and harassment Enforcing an affirmative consent standard alone in schools will not fix the system said Berkeley senior Sofie Karasek one of 31 students who filed a Title IX complaint against the school in February It takes a multipronged approach trained counselors to support survivors investigators to thoroughly examine cases and a timely hearing process  all required under federal law and included in SB 967 The affirmative consent clause of SB 967 generates headlines but supporters of the bill champion its comprehensive approach which mirrors Title IX requirements SB 967 also requires schools to implement comprehensive prevention programs and survivorcentered sexual assault response policies and protocols It calls on schools to form partnerships with community organizations to assist survivors The affirmative consent standard helps by shifting the burden in disciplinary hearings from the complainant who had to prove assault occurred to the accused who must show that he or she sought consent Karasek said Theres this underlying assumption unlike in any other crime that survivors are lying or overexaggerating Karasek said Having an affirmative consent standard changes the dynamic because were not automatically assuming that if someone didnt say no it means yes The flipped dynamic is what concerns critics of SB 967 Under an affirmative consent standard sexual activity is sexual assault unless the accused can prove that the accusing party consciously and voluntarily agreed to engage in sexual activity Moreover the accused student must prove that the consent was ongoing said Cohn with the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education When affirmative consent becomes law there will be no practical fair or consistent way for colleges to implement these newly mandated prerequisites for sexual activity Cohn said It is impracticable for the government to require students to obtain affirmative consent at each stage of a physical encounter especially if students must later prove they successfully did so in a campus hearing In reality requiring students to obtain affirmative consent will render a great deal of legal sexual activity sexual assault Consent by whose standard To some young men however mutual consent is already a familiar concept Berkeley freshman Alexander Vu attended the same Bear Pact session as YoonHendricks To him it sounded like a lot of the same concepts from high school health class It was a good way to reinforce the idea of mutual consent but it wasnt anything I hadnt heard before the 18yearold said Is it something he would practice Yes absolutely he said It seems like a good foundation for a healthy mutually respectful relationship Berkeley freshman Joshua Deng who also attended the Bear Pact presentation said he supports the idea of affirmative consent both as a school policy and a rule of thumb to cover him from allegations of wrongdoing I dont want to be forcing someone into a position theyre going to be uncomfortable with he said People might say its impractical or ridiculous in reality but the possible end of doing something thats not something someone wants is a frightening possibility He stopped short though of fully backing affirmative consent as state law Id have to do more research he said Making a law for anything has huge implications and theres got to be a lot of thinking that goes into that In evaluating sexual misconduct claims SB 967 calls for schools to apply a preponderance of evidence standard similar to Title IX Its a lower standard of proof used in civil cases instead of the beyond a reasonable doubt bar used in criminal trials Thats another point of contention for people who say SB 967 undermines due process rights by subjecting the accused to a lower culpability threshold without the protections offered by criminal and civil courts  such as the mandatory exchange of evidence known as discovery and restrictions on hearsay and prior bad act evidence Those accused in campus tribunals are generally denied these protections  but nevertheless are subject to lifechanging sanctions based on little more than a hunch by campus court participants that one persons story is slightly more credible Cohn said Words to love by Like Berkeley Columbia University in New York has been the subject of negative publicity in the past year over its handling of sexual misconduct Just this week a Columbia student made headlines for vowing to carry around a mattress on which she claims she was raped until her alleged attacker is disciplined Columbia rolled out a new mandatory twopart workshop for freshmen this semester on sexual violence and genderbased misconduct as part of its New Student Orientation Program Since the beginning of this year the university has been moving on multiple fronts both to respond to student concerns and reflect the changing guidance from the US Department of Education on this issue spokeswoman Victoria Benitez said Student activists asked administrators to revise Columbias Consent is Sexy workshop last year to make it mandatory and more serious in tone Attendees told the Columbia Spectator that the presentation focused on defining consent and walking through different scenarios of sexual harassment Consent was defined as an enthusiastic yes that was gained without the use of intimidation or coercion one attendee told the campus newspaper The information was thorough and explicit attendees said even if it was a little boring and repetitive at times Orientation for many students began before they arrived at Columbia Benitez said Through newsletters and a video the school introduced students to its Step Up and Make a Difference campaigns on sexual harassment prevention and bystander intervention One handout on gauging consent offers examples of signs that you should stop such as you or your partner are too intoxicated to gauge or give consent or you hope your partner will say nothing and go with the flow Signs you should pause and talk might be that you feel like you are getting mixed signals or you are not sure what the other person wants Another handout provides students with suggested ways to ask for consent Does this feel good Would you like me to Do you want to keep going Framing consent this way serves as a reminder that it can also apply to committed relationships After all the vast majority of people who are sexually assaulted know their attacker and often have a relationship with them said Laura Palumbo with the National Sexual Violence Resource Center Even couples in healthy relationships can benefit from consent she said If youre in a healthy sexual relationship wouldnt you want your partner to be as interested in what youre doing as you are Wouldnt you want the move youre making to be satisfying to your partner she said Our culture is saturated with sex but were not given great info about how to talk effectively about sex We see it on billboards and TV but when were talking about sexual wants needs and boundaries people dont have good language or models for how to approach that Lasting impressions Time will tell if the orientation workshops posters and fliers have a lasting impact on students YoonHendricks said the session at Berkeley made an impression on her but she acknowledges there was a lot of snickering in the crowd around her To kids who giggle every time someone says sex I dont think it was as informative as it couldve been she said But they did a good job of illustrating the point in a short period of time One thing missing from the presentation More transparency about Berkeleys history with the issue I think theyre trying very very hard to

CNN,living, CNN  When artist William Wegman shows up for events fans dont only bring books or pictures for him to sign They also bring their dogs  mostly Weimaraners  to meet him After all Wegman is the patron saint of those sleek regal canines  a man who has made a career around Weimaraner imagery Now 70 Wegman has dabbled in various mediums and themes since introducing the world to Man Ray his first pet Weimaraner in the 1970s But his choice of muse has remained fairly constant throughout his art and even in the dog bed he helped design Hes the reason so many people know about these dogs said Betsy Bottomley who brought her 7yearold rescue Weimaraner Chance to see Wegman at a recent author talk at the Decatur Book Festival in Georgia Weimaraners are very peopleoriented she said They love days like this when they can be outside with their families Wegman was at the festival to promote Flo  Wendell Explore his newest childrens book inspired by his blueeyed pet Weimeraners Flo and Topper Theyre the latest in a long line of Wegmans canine muses that have inspired a robust collection of paintings photographs films books and worldwide exhibits Wegman has had 3yearold Flo and 2yearold Topper since both were 8 weeks old They share the Wegman home with 13yearold Candy and 15yearold Bobbin a descendant of Fay Wray one of his most famous subjects Topper didnt seem like a little boys name Wendell seemed to suit the look Wegman said in a postpanel interview in a nearby hotel lobby pulling out his iPhone to show off pictures like a proud parent How could you not do a book about her he said pausing on a closeup of of Flo Shes so captivating The followup to Flo  Wendell features a combination of paintings and photographs a departure from the images of dogs in costumes and roller skates for which Wegman is perhaps best known Its a format that suits his current lifestyle and artistic sensibilities he said It allows him to ditch the studio and production crews needed to stage shoots of dogs dressed as Little Red Riding Hood or the Hardly Boys Instead he can paint the backdrop to Flo and Wendells adventures beneath the skylight in his lakeside home in Maine It was great because I could be by myself in my room like I was when I was a little boy drawing pictures he said referring to his childhood in western Massachusetts Wegman shared the book festival stage with authorillustrator Chris Gall for a discussion about why animals make such great subjects for books Every dog has its own personality which guides how Wegman portrays them he said He told the festival audience  a mix of adults and children  that he approaches childrens picture books the same way as everything else he does He just makes art using dogs I love the idea that Wegman isnt thinking about picture books any differently from his adult work that hes approaching his books for kids with the same kinds of ideas and aesthetic concerns said author and panel moderator Laurel Snyder He seems to be an artist by nature and an author by default and it shows Wegman knows it too At best hes a parttime childrens book author a fact that became apparent to him in the company of established childrens authors at the book festival I dont have a TV show Youre not going to have a huge following unless you have a franchise or a creature  something that gets in your imagination whereas I just kind of dabble in childrens books he said Everything that I do is sort of that way he said I think its a product of being an artist in the 60s where switching mediums was not alien Dont get Wegman wrong  he loves children He has two children of his own that he also likes to show off in pictures on his iPhone doing winter sports like ice skating and playing hockey He also likes creating art with children which he occasionally does in schools They dont care about impressing William Wegman the artist  even his appearances on Sesame Street with Fay Wray are too far in the past to register with them They dont care about doing a William Wegman piece They just want to do a Darth Vader piece or disco dog he said Their language is mesmerizing If he could be anywhere unsurprisingly hed be spending time with his dogs in the country or taking photos of them in New York where he spends about half the year Dogs personalities shine through in front of the camera he said It was true for Man Ray who became very calm and interested when Wegman would point a camera at him Same goes for Flo and Topper who loves to be on top of things You really fall in love with them taking their pictures he said You learn so much about them ,0.4

CNN,living, Editors note First Person is a series of personal essays exploring identity and personal points of view that shape who we are The latest contributor is Jessica Dunne a producer at CNN She loves her hometown of New Orleans the Saints Mardi Gras and her two rescue dogs She tweets jessicacnn CNN  I dont think anyone is ready for grief But when it hits you it knocks you out cold I was told that tears and the sorrow would come in waves For me its been more like a riptide or a tornado constantly circling around me whipping me in the face Sometimes it stabs sometimes it punches sometimes it drowns me My grieving process began in March when I got a phone call from my mom while at work She told me that my dad had suddenly stopped breathing and that I needed to get home to Louisiana as soon as possible The sevenhour car ride felt like an eternity As the optimist I am I kept telling myself that my dad would pull out of it But when I got to the hospital and saw the looks on my relatives faces I knew the situation was much worse than I thought My father had a major brain hemorrhage the kind that you dont recover from I sat by his side for roughly 48 hours with my siblings and my mom holding his hand until he took his last breath The loss didnt hit me until a few days after the funeral when all the outoftown relatives were gone and friends and neighbors made fewer checkins My parents home didnt feel like home anymore just an empty space Friends were just people who didnt understand what I was going through First Person My life as a little person I had always been an incredibly social person and loved being surrounded by people I always found a reason to smile I always cracked jokes But after my fathers death the world became a dark and scary place I wanted to crawl into a dark corner and avoid everyone This grief felt insurmountable and incredibly alienating I went from planning a family vacation to planning a eulogy in a matter of days Its the kind of whiplash that is emotionally and mentally paralyzing I attempted to manage my own grief while trying to be strong for my mom and my family And to top it all off I had to deal with some of the more practical matters My mother and I had to close down his real estate appraisal business and I had to explain to client after client that my dad had passed away previously healthy at the age of 64 Do you have a firstperson essay Share it with CNN iReport The resounding response was always What But we just talked to him a few days ago and he sounded fine I would quickly hang up the phone before they could witness my imminent breakdown Then there was the task of planning his memorial service My mom my siblings and I were all in a daze as we ironed out the details When I gave the tribute at his memorial service I described him as the kind of guy who was a mountain among pebbles I needed everyone to know just how amazing he was Its part of the reason why I am sharing this with you My dad Michael P Dunne was a real estate appraiser with a penchant for perfectionism He was a senior Olympic volleyball player a former coach and an avid member of an Irish marching club in New Orleans Friends would tell you he was the life of any party His six siblings  older and younger  always called him for advice on everything from real estate to relationships He and my mom were inseparable For me he embodied everything good in the world I remember when my first love dumped me in high school he spent hours sitting with me in the middle of the night as I cried constantly reminding me of the amazing woman I was He baked a cake for his grandson  my nephew Nikolas  every year for his birthday He wasnt even very good at baking but hed spend hours meticulously frosting his creation First Person A fat girl gets naked Now more than six months later those fond memories come often I remember sitting on the porch in the days after he died steeped in sorrow and angry at the world Out of nowhere I heard my neighbors play one of my dads favorite songs Unchained Melody by the Righteous Brothers I went from crying to laughing as I recalled a fond memory One day he and I were in the car and it came on the radio We both belted the ballad out at the top of our lungs Moments like that serve as reminders for me to live my life fully and with joy My father lived a life full of love And the best thing I can do to honor him is to try to do the same Those little moments make me look at the world differently Life is suddenly more precious more beautiful So many things remind me of my dad I see the love he had for me and my family in everything Every time I eat an apple Im reminded of the time we went applepicking in North Georgia It was late in the season and he was the only one of us tall enough to actually grab the fruit When the New Orleans Saints play a game I think about how hed yell at the TV a trait he definitely passed down to me I try to remind myself of how fortunate I am to have had 27 years with this incredible man I still have the support of my mom and thats what keeps me going most days She lost her husband of more than 30 years her best friend and yet somehow she finds the strength to be there for me daily She and my father taught me everything I know about love and family and she and I often lean on each other for support But Id be lying if I said it wasnt a struggle every single day The biggest relief from the pain has been surrounding myself with photos and mementos of joyful moments I constantly try to remind myself of a phrase I uttered in the hospital as I saw our whole family surround him ,0.4
CNN,living, Editors note First Person is a series of personal essays exploring identity and personal points of view that shape who we are The latest contributor is Lisa Respers France senior producer for CNN Digitals Entertainment section and star of the CNN Original Video series Lisas Desk CNN  Youve met me before Im the fat funny girl who is often hailed for my confidence and selfesteem The big girl who has such a pretty face and who despite her weight manages to snag really great looking boyfriends I dress really well for my size and am so much fun to be around because of my outgoing personality Dont call me fat I prefer the term fluffy  I say and you smile at how I am able to put you at ease about an uncomfortable subject Im the first with a Hell yeah fist pump for slogans like Sexy has no size and Love me for who I am not what I look like But I suffer from the one addiction that doesnt elicit much sympathy from most people Were this a confession of meth abuse or alcohol I would anticipate an entirely different reaction But my drug of choice is one that will likely elicit more eye rolls and accusations than loving embraces of support Food is my drug According to the informal definition an addict is an enthusiastic devotee of a specified thing or activity Thats me all day You couldnt find anyone more enthusiastic about food and eating than yours truly My Instagram account is evidence of that The food photos there compete only with the number of strategically shot selfies all positioned in such a way to conceal my fat of course In my spare time I devour food autobiographies that I attack as lustfully as a porn junkie  often pairing them with something delicious I have driven a stupid amount of miles to satisfy a craving and even canceled on friends to sit in my house and eat More of my money has been spent dining in good restaurants and buying groceries than some people make in a year Ive eaten to the point of getting sick and once I was empty have eaten again The number of diets Ive started and stopped is not even worth mentioning here because in the end I always go fleeing back to my first love food I hate to exercise but have managed to use my treadmill and hit the gym more than a few times But it makes me so hungry I feel like I undo all of that work the minute I can get to food First Person My life as a little person Before I met my husband I once joked to a friend that food was my boyfriend The only man who could truly satisfy me Whats the difference if I say Ill go away when I know Ill come back on my knees someday For whatever my man is Im his forever more I told her quoting song lyrics when she suggested we join a workplace weight loss campaign These days food is more like my closest friend than a lover but its influence is just as strong Its a weird place to find myself in given that as a child my parents had to force me to eat I was a short skinny kid who at the age of 4 was so petite that I was mistaken for a toddler I suffered major problems with my adenoids tonsils and sinuses and consequently food tasted like snot to me At age 9 I had my tonsils and adenoids removed That changed everything I was just home from the hospital and my parents grabbed cheesesteak subs for themselves for dinner Upstairs in my bedroom sipping soup and still nursing the posttonsilectomy sore throat I suddenly smelled the most delicious aroma You know how in cartoons a smell wafts and tickles the character under the nose That was how those subs smelled to me and I floated downstairs to investigate As I stood practically drooling my mother asked Would you like a taste I went on to gain about 30 pounds in the months following my surgery and that hasnt slowed Its not as if I havent successfully shed weight before but the moment I start I figure out some way to undermine it My mind attacks me with thoughts that hurt to even type Would my more attractive girlfriends like me as much if I were on their level Would the increased attention from men cause my marriage to crumble Why should I have to live in a constant state of denying myself when others can eat what they want and be slim And worst of all What if absolutely nothing changes at all other than my body What will I then blame lifes disappointments on I know that so much of my food and weight issues are really about my emotions That was driven home recently when a counselor suggested When Food is Love by Geneen Roth I was in my kitchen waiting for dinner to be ready when I read this passage and broke down sobbing Compulsive behavior at its most fundamental is a lack of selflove it is an expression of a belief that we are not good enough At that moment I realized that I have been trying to fill my heart by filling my stomach But pinpointing the pain means going places I fear Living with anxiety hoping for joy Im more afraid of delving into what is killing me and trust me I am so aware that it is killing me than I am of dying Every extra pound represents a pain for me something I dont like to acknowledge not even to myself I grew up in a family where we didnt talk about our struggles  we ate or drank them away I have continued that legacy After a love affair that didnt work out I took to my bed with a box of Ritz crackers and two cans of squeeze cheese I jokingly told my roommate that I was sitting shiva for the relationship that I was convinced would take me off the market The one that would stop the cycle of men who spoke to me in code You arent my usual type I usually avoid fat girls but you are cool You are so easy to talk to When my friends question how I can be with you I can always point to your personality Thirteen years ago I married a man who has always told me how beautiful he thinks I am But it has done little to assuage the fact that for all of my outgoingness and sunny manner I do not love myself enough I hate not being able to fit my purse in the seat beside me or having to ask for an extender on an airplane because the seat belt may not fit I hate the smirky looks sales people give me in regular clothing stores  the look that says Surely you arent thinking you will find anything here I hate that I crave the numbing power that food represents to me The moment I begin to feel happy or sad I turn to food Sometimes its in celebration and sometimes its to achieve a level of bliss that means I dont have to hurt or process what I am feeling Tough day at work Dinner with coworkers Fight with a family member High fat snacks Who needs tears when there are donuts to be had Its a neverending cycle being fat makes me feel uncomfortable and feeling uncomfortable drives me to the behaviors that make me fat What they never tell you about losing a lot of weight A good friend once told me that I should view the parts of me that need to heal as a younger version of me who I needed to protect I should talk to Little Lisa she said and tell her how worthy she is of health selflove and an abundant life Only by peeling back the layers of pain she said could I get to the real emptiness that I needed to feed  that part of me that doesnt believe I deserve the blessed life I have with a career family and friends that I adore So Little Lisa this is the first step towards you and I getting to where we need to be It wont be easy and its going to hurt But we are going to do the work and try to be an inspiration to others who have started and failed over and over We are going to do it for every overweight person who struggles and those who are no longer here to struggle because their bodies gave out on them Most days we are going to want to quit but we cant because the stakes are too high and there is so much more waiting for us than we have allowed for ourselves Ive met you Youre worth it ,0.4

I finally arrived a month late a habit I have kept Thats how my parents found out that I was a little person a dwarf of short stature They were shocked and upset knowing that my life would be hard My maternal grandfather told my mother I dont care how tall she is shes my first granddaughter and shes pretty  They didnt find out I had achondroplastic dwarfism until a few months later Achondroplasia is a word that haunted me in my childhood I never wanted to hear it It wasnt who I was I was not different According to a 2009 report by Richard M Pauli from the Midwest Regional Bone Dysplasia Clinics achondroplasia happens 1 in every 25000 births It doesnt really matter how often it happens we happened and were here My brother is as big as I am small and has been my protector from day one He made it possible for me to live whatever life I choose My parents grew up during the civil rights movement They and their siblings were the only black kids at their respective Catholic schools in middle America They were treated as subpar While they were allowed in they werent allowed to fully participate They were denied equal treatment The indignities they endured are too many to list My parents made sure my brother and I participated in whatever we wanted My family cares for me and at the same time has never shielded me from the world Thats how they raised me I am Cara Expectations are not lowered We can talk about it whenever I need to but I have not been allowed to hide Attack of the 42 chef Even so living as a little person is like being the main attraction at the circus every day of my life Going grocery shopping getting tampons at the drugstore  its like being a celebrity and the whole world is my paparazzi The tag line of my blog Infamously Short is celebrity without fame or money and thats pretty accurate I dont believe anonymity is achievable for me That can make a person a little crazy And angry When I was a child I used to walk into public places and scan the room to figure out who would be the first to say something Inevitably they did Most of the time it was Isnt she cute But sometimes it was more cruel Deeper Darker They hold their hands over their mouths and laugh trying to look away but also alert their friends They whisper Theres a midget When I make eye contact they look away and try to hold in their laughter I can read lips Its from a lifetime of watching people mouth midget There are times when they dont even pretend to hide their ridicule Walking in a mall I pass a store Someone spots me and then brings their whole family to stand in the store window to laugh and jeer My existence is a joke to them When these people refer to little people they often say Look at it Little people big top To them I am not even human Im a different species Its even used in a clinical capacity In medical journals the language is something like this male dwarf Do they say this male autistic or this female cerebral palsy The answer is no its always this person with fill in the condition When I was a child I used to internalize the torment Outwardly I was stoic I pretended it wasnt happening Inside I was crying and wishing I was someone else It shaped how I felt about myself I was often the target of bullies in school and felt prejudice from some of my teachers They never outwardly said anything but they made it difficult to participate in activities I also had some wonderful teachers who cheered me on even when I was being lazy I played basketball in grade school not very well but I tried The coach Mr Sweeney worked out plays so that I could score I took dance something to which I was much more suited Mrs Wren required I work as hard or harder as the other girls She showed me how to be graceful in a body that is typically not regarded as graceful I have always been a bit of a drifter searching for a new adventure When I was 12 I went to India and it changed my life I was gone almost a month and was at least three travel days away from my parents I was scared exhilarated and free That trip set the tone for my life From the age of 18 to 27 I lived in six cities and moved eight times During that time I got three degrees in political science theater and photography I couldnt decide what I wanted to be when I grew up  or more accurately I had a hard time figuring out what the world would allow me to be When I moved to New York to start work as a photographer I finally had to face why I had been running I am a little person Manilas little people seek their own community Coming to terms with being a little person has been a long process complicated by the worlds prejudice I dont wake up every morning and think Oh woe is me I am a little person I wake up and get on with my day My first thought is usually Oh no I am late again I fly out of the house in whatever outfit I have cobbled together grab breakfast at the bodega and check my email while rushing to the subway As each moment passes I calculate how many minutes I am going to be late But like a kick in the chest I am startled because someone interrupts my morning routine by pointing laughing or taking a picture I am no longer just Cara the freespirited comedian who has trouble getting to work on time I am the little person who deserves ridicule Im late to work running with a body that doesnt have the greatest leg span praying that the A train is working and now I have to interact with someone who thinks my mere existence on this planet is a joke Its a fantastic way to start a day Within the past 10 years I have stopped internalizing my anger and started directing it outward where it belongs Why should I put up with the taunting the picturetaking the inappropriate sexual propositions on a daily basis just because I am different externally The answer is I shouldnt I have different levels of response to peoples reactions If someone laughs I ask Whats funny Most of the time people say Nothing nothing and then run off in embarrassment If people use the word midget I say Its called dwarfism Dont use that word Then there are the sexual deviants Men approach me in the street and start conversations with I want to try it Sex with you would be different I yell back I am not a sampler platter no They respond with an indignant I just want to try it It would be fun You dont have to get nasty Thats what I hear whenever I defend myself Apparently I am supposed to take it I am supposed to suck it up One of my friends says Cara is always trying to prove shes normal I am normal I have the same thoughts feelings and desires The world treats me as if there is something wrong with me It took me a while not to trust the worlds opinion  ,0.4

pounds so she could fit into a 50yearold dress from high school Determined to stun all her old classmates Highsmith saw her invitation to Minnehaha Academys 50th reunion as the catalyst to spark a lifestyle change Voted Most Mischievous by her classmates in 1964 the Takoma Park Maryland resident was determined to reclaim some of her youth I wanted to go back to high school as I left she says Still having fun in life looking slim and feeling as good as I did back then Looking back Highsmith would never have predicted shed have weight problems If I had seen a photo of myself as I look right now  I would have died of embarrassment But though she was thin her eating habits were far from healthy In my teens I would go on all sorts of diets  one time all I ate was hot dogs  to make sure I fit into all my pretty dresses Once she started her career those bad choices began to take their toll She started to travel a lot and it became easy to eat what she calls road food frequently I remember my first bite of a Krispy Kreme donut It was heaven I wanted more and many One time I did a photo shoot at a Krispy Kreme place and they gave us two dozen donuts I ate five in one sitting Her

shirt in for fear of showing just how much weight she had gained When she received news of her upcoming reunion Highsmith vowed to follow what she called the WWW Plan so that she could wear her favorite high school dress again Her first step was watching what she ate She tried to eat only 1300 calories per day of almost entirely unprocessed foods Step two was walking She purchased a step tracker and made sure to log 10000 to 25000 steps per day even if that required her to walk the halls and stairs of her hotel late at night The last step was drinking lots of water She began to drink five to six bottles a day to ensure she was staying hydrated in the midst of all of her walking Complicating her mission Highsmith knew she was going to be on the road during the months leading up to the reunion working on a photography project for the Library of Congress capturing photos of 21st century America for the Prints and Photographs Archive She would also be staying busy with her This is America Foundation which she founded to capture and catalog hundreds of thousands of photos of slices of American life threatened by technological change rampant development and widespread cultural homogenization She had to customize her weight loss strategy to her nomadic lifestyle Although gas stations full of candy and other unhealthy snacks beckoned Highsmith fought cravings by carrying unsalted nuts canned baked beans unsweetened Greek yogurt and fresh fruit For breakfast Highsmith would generally eat fruit poached eggs ham and a little milk and coffee Protein was key for keeping her full well into the afternoon Lunchtime was a less structured meal Highsmith made a point to never eat lunch just because it was lunchtime but to wait until she genuinely felt hungry Then she would eat some yogurt fruit and nuts or a fresh salad For dinner she usually ordered grilled fish sweet potatoes and vegetables Sometimes she would allow herself to splurge on a carefully measured pat of butter for her sweet potatoes Every time I thought about not walking all the steps or not drinking the water or having just one extra handful of nuts I thought about how much fun it would be to go the Minnehaha Academy reunion and look like a million says Highsmith Between her healthy eating habits and being constantly on her feet Highsmith watched as the pounds melted away Every day that I follow my weight loss plan I am thrilled Highsmith wrote to CNN in the middle of her journey All of it helps me feel better about myself When I look in the mirror and see a slimmer me I am more confident and know I look good in my clothes She was careful though not to get distracted from her main goal her health I eat only when I am hungry but if I get hungry I need to eat says Highsmith I am not on a starvation diet  I am on a healthy let me lose this weight and live longer journey I never mention the word diet When the day of her 50th high school reunion arrived Highsmith was ready and eager to show off her new physique Her classmates were stunned with her transformation I was very impressed says former classmate Linda Bjorklund who has stayed in touch over the years She was very disciplined about her food intake and her exercise Carol usually does whatever she sets her mind to doing  she always gives everything 115 Highsmiths message to her classmates Find a way to turn back the clock

CNN,health, CNN  Flu season is about to begin Get your flu shot now Thats the message both the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are sending to every American older than 6 months Nearly 60 of the flu cases reported to the CDC last flu season were people between 18 and 64 That figure proves even the healthiest can come down with the flu says Dr William Schaffner professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine Last year was an unfortunate reminder that no one is exempt from flus most severe consequences Schaffner said Thursday at the National Press Club in Washington The CDCs recommendations about the flu vaccine are similar to last years but there are a few updates If its available children between 2 and 8 should get the live attenuated influenza vaccine commonly known as FluMist instead of the flu shot the CDC says The nasal spray flu vaccine includes four influenza virus strains and seems to be the best protection for this age group for the 20142015 flu season Because it is a live vaccine the nasal spray is not recommended for women who are or think they may be pregnant and is only approved for people up to age 49 For those at least 65 the federal health agency says a onetwothree punch is the best way to stay healthy all year long The CDC recommends this age group be administered a highdose flu shot which gives stronger immune response and a greater protection against the flu It also recommends that those over 65 be given a twodose series of pneumococcal vaccines  the new pneumococcal conjugate vaccine followed by the traditional pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine about six months later One more reminder The flu can be a deadly illness so all pregnant women should get the flu shot The flu shot can be given in any trimester but the sooner a new mom is vaccinated the better for the baby A flu shot will not protect you from Enterovirus D68 said Dr Paul Offit director of the Vaccine Education Center for the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia Although both are respiratory illnesses they are totally different viruses They could infect one individual at the same time its rare but it could happen he said The flu vaccine will prevent influenza virus and the influenza virus only Offit said Certainly we see a lot of mixed respiratory virus infections in our hospital Well see often two viruses that are infecting at the same time  That makes it all the more important that you get your flu vaccine Offit stressed that parents should take the flu season seriously Last year more than 100 youngsters died from influenza and most of them were healthy at the time Most had not had a flu shot Offit said When you look at vaccine preventable diseases in general like the current measles outbreak the vast majority of children are unvaccinated he said So whens the best time to get vaccinated Now says CDC Director Dr Tom Frieden Flu vaccines should be on their way to your doctors office We are told by the manufacturers they will be bringing approximately 150 million doses of flu vaccine to the market Frieden said Thursday There are many different options out there And theres plenty of flu vaccine to go around ,0.4
CNN,health, Send iReport photos of your flu survival kit CNN  Flu vaccine myths can confuse people trying to decide whether to get a shot Here are five common myths and based on information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the truth 1 The shot can give you flu Not so says the CDC The viruses in flu shots are killed during the production of the vaccine which means they cannot cause infection The vaccine batches are then tested with a group of people randomly assigned to get either the vaccine or salt water The only differences in symptoms was increased soreness in the arm and redness at the injection site among people who got the flu shot the CDC found There were no differences in terms of body aches fever cough runny nose or sore throat Still some people feel bad after a flu shot Soreness at the injection site is one reason but it usually dissipates within two days Its caused by the immune system making antibodies to the killed viruses in the vaccine that help a person fight off the flu The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices says symptoms in rare instances include fever muscle pain and discomfort or weakness which also typically go away after a day or two And though a flu shot wont give you the flu its protection doesnt kick in for two weeks from the time of injection During that time you are vulnerable In addition its easy to confuse seasonal flu for an illness caused by a number of other pathogens including rhinovirus Or you may be exposed to a flu virus that is not included in the vaccine Finally the flu shot does not always work  particularly among the elderly and people with weak immune systems But even among these highrisk groups the vaccine can prevent complications 2 It is better to get the vaccine later in the season to limit the risk that its efficacy will wane No The shot lasts an entire flu season except for some children who may need two doses The CDC recommends that all people older than 6 months get a flu vaccine 3 The flu shot might adversely affect my pregnancy No The flu vaccine is an essential element of prenatal care and is recommended for all pregnant women according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Pregnant women are among the groups at increased risk for flu complications like pneumonia infections and dehydration Though babies cannot be vaccinated until they have reached 6 months of age antibodies they received in utero from their mothers may help protect them But note that the group recommends against the nasal spray  the live attenuated version  for pregnant women The CDC says seasonal flu vaccine shots have not been shown to cause harm to pregnant women or their babies 4 Ive had the flu before and it was no big deal so bring it on No Seasonal flu exacts a bigger toll in some years than in others Between 1976 and 2007 the flu was linked to a low of 3000 to as many as 49000 fatalities in the United States with more than 200000 hospitalizations There are two main reasons The viruses that circulate in one year may differ from those that circulate in another And of course people change from year to year meaning that your response to a viral infection one year may not be the same as your response in another 5 The flu shot doesnt work It doesnt work all the time but it does confer some level of protection For example the CDC says preliminary data for the 20102011 season show that it was about 60 effective for all age groups combined and studies for earlier years found protection rates of up to 90 ,0.4

CNN,health, Vital Signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world CNN  Sitting in class second grade teachers would put me outside the hallway because I had been ticking so loud I was a distraction recalled 25yearold Amber Comfort Teachers would walk by me back and forth and say youd better stop that before you get into my class next year Things that were just completely obscene that you would never expect the world to be and I had to deal with on a daily basis From the age of five Comfort has suffered from Tourettes syndrome a neurological disorder that causes her to make involuntary movements and loud noises known as tics For almost 20 years the condition has shaped every moment of her life I dont remember any parts of ever being tic free she said Theres not a day thats gone by that I dont remember moving or making noise when I couldnt help it But she has not let Tourettes dictate how she lives Comfort graduated from high school with honors and was even accepted to college on full scholarship But her uncontrollable outbursts have made it hard to continue her education or even hold down a steady job Read The people with someone elses face There is one thing that comes easy though Singing She loves to sing and when she does her tics are curiously absent Singing is what gets me through a lot of hard days When Im on the computer when Im driving when I write poetry basically anything with a sense of focus Comfort explained When I have to worry about my tics I do just that  I worry about my tics Deep brain stimulation  There is no cure for Tourettes syndrome But after years of suffering and unsuccessful therapies Comfort was selected for experimental surgery by specialists from the University of Floridas Center for Movement Disorders The procedure is called deep brain stimulation DBS where small electrodes are implanted into the brain to stimulate affected regions in patients with movement disorders such as Parkinsons disease or tremors The delivery of electricity is at the root of what makes DBS work The electrodes are attached to an impulse generator or pacemaker implanted under the patients skin which provides electrical impulses to the affected region of the brain Read These 8 whiz kids are the future of medicine By providing impulses to circuits in the brain associated with a specific motor skill its possible to change the connections between neurons and stop the abnormal activity that causes the symptoms DBS was first approved for tremors in 1997 and since then more than 100000 patients have had the procedure But Comforts surgery would be the first time the technique had been used for Tourettes Tourettes syndrome is characterized by an impulsivity that combines both emotion and motor activity and makes the underlying neurology differ from that of Parkinsons and other conditions previously treated with DBS The difference in Tourette is the movement isnt there all the time explained neurologist Dr Michael Okun codirector of the Center for Movement Disorders and author of Parkinsons Treatment 10 Secrets to a Happier Life with Parkinsons Disease The patients that have a tic they get this build up they call it a premonitory urge They feel like they need to move and until they move they dont feel better This urge to tic is a daily woe for people like Comfort Its like having 15 mosquito bites that you cant itch she said Theres no way to ever tell they are coming Until now treatments available for Tourettes have been behavioral therapy and drug medications These treatments however only manage the severity of tics to make them less disruptive and do not prevent them Without my medications I am one of the worst cases the doctors have ever seen in the United States said Comfort Experimental surgery  In September 2014 Comfort had the DBS electrodes implanted in her brain  a 12hour process that involved six operations In addition to the standard electrode leads she had a new gridlike device implanted on top of her brain  an experimental procedure intended to gather information from her brain that could not only lessen her tics but maybe someday stop them Not only did Comfort have four holes drilled into her skull but she was awake throughout the process The way sedatives work is by suppressing brain activity so we get better recordings if we dont use any sedatives explained Dr Kelly Foote also codirector of the Center for Movement Disorders who performed the surgery The team uses music to help relax the patient while the painless but stressful procedure is carried out We let them pick the music to take the focus off the fact that I am drilling a hole in their head and cutting their scalp and that sort of thing said Foote Comforts surgery was a success but implanting the stimulation and recording devices is just the start of the DBS process Okun and Foote will now monitor Comforts brain activity over the next six to 12 months The grid will provide insight into the underlying cause of her Tourettes syndrome and allow the doctors to regulate the electrical impulses so that they can begin to manage and maybe someday eliminate her tics For Comfort this is her chance to finally live a normal life If its a chance to change my life for the better and to make sure I dont have to deal with this anymore Im up for it said Comfort I have had this 20 years and I think Ive done my time Read The people with someone elses face Read These 8 whiz kids are the future of medicine Read Machine makes drinking water from air ,0.4
CNN,health, Is ayahuasca a natural remedy for anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder or just another drug fad Lisa Ling goes inside an ayahuasca ceremony in the Amazon on this weeks episode of This Is Life With Lisa Ling Jungle Fix Sunday October 26 at 10 pm ETPT CNN  Imagine discovering a plant that has the potential to help alleviate posttraumatic stress disorder suicidal thoughts and paralyzing anxiety Thats what some believe ayahuasca can do and this psychedelic drink is attracting more and more tourists to the Amazon If you Google ayahuasca youll find a litany of stories about Hollywood celebrities espousing its benefits as well as the dangers of this relatively unstudied substance that triggers hallucinations On this Sundays episode of This Is Life Lisa Ling goes inside an ayahuasca ceremony in Peru and talks to the men and women who are drinking this potent brew in hopes that it will alleviate their mental and emotional traumas Here are six things to know about ayahuasca which some call a drug and others call a medicine War vets are seeking it for PTSD  Former Marine Lance Cpl Ryan LeCompte organizes trips to Peru for war veterans like himself who are seeking ayahuasca as a possible treatment for PTSD and other emotional and mental trauma suffered after multiple combat deployments He says hes aware of the risks as theres very little known about ayahuascas effect on the body but he says its a calculated risk Ayahuasca is a way to give relief to those who are suffering says LeCompte who says many veterans are not satisfied with the PTSD treatment they receive when they return from combat Its just Heres a pill heres a BandAid The ayahuasca medicine is a way to instead of sweeping your dirt under the rug you know these medicines force you to take the rug outside and beat it with a stick until its clean LeCompte explains And thats how I prefer to clean my house Libby an airman 1st class is one of the veterans who accompanied LeCompte to Peru to try ayahuasca for her PTSD diagnosis which includes sexual trauma while on active duty She says antidepressants made her more suicidal I would like to wish not to die all the time she said when asked why she was seeking ayahuasca I want that to go away Its endorsed by some Hollywood celebrities As more ayahuasca centers pop up in the United States not surprisingly celebrities including Sting and Lindsay Lohan have spoken publicly about their experiences with the substance  albeit illegal outside of religious purposes in the United States Lohan who has struggled with addiction called her ayahuasca experience eyeopening and intense I saw my whole life in front of me and I had to let go of past things that I was trying to hold on to that were dark in my life she said on her OWN reality series Linsday Sting said he and his wife Trudie Styler traveled to a church in the Amazon where they tried ayahuasca which the British singer said made him feel like he was wired to the entire cosmos Its not a cure Those of have tried ayahuasca say that any benefits  like with other drugs or medicine  must be combined with therapy If you think youre just going to take joy juice  youre nuts explained author and ayahuasca expert Peter Gorman who settled in Iquitos Peru during the first wave of ayahuasca tourism in the 1990s The five years of work to get rid of mental trauma is still gonna be on you Gorman author of Ayahuasca in My Blood explains that ayahuasca can help dislodge that negative energy and show people what their life could be like without the negativity Then you can go back home and work on getting rid of it And it used to be taken by only the shaman Gorman says ayahuasca traditions in the Amazon have changed since Western tourists began seeking its benefits Traditionally the shaman drinks ayahuasca he accesses other realms of reality to find out where the dissonance is that if the shaman corrects will eliminate the symptoms  could be physical could be emotional could be bad luck Gorman explains Then we Americans come and we said we insist on drinking the damn stuff  we want our lives changed and we want that experience so that certainly set things right on its head You can even buy ayahuasca powders and extracts online and in the local markets in the Peruvian Amazon but Gorman warns you dont know what it would be As more and more Western tourists consume ayahuasca Gorman says it has him worried Ive had this feeling in my bones for five or six years that something could go slightly wrong here that could sour a lot of stuff Some ayahuasca tourists have died  In April 19yearold Briton Henry Miller died after taking part in an ayahuasca ceremony in Colombia according to various media reports And Kyle Nolan an 18yearold from northern California died under similar circumstances in August 2012 in Peru The shaman who provided Nolan with the ayahuasca and who initially lied about his death was sentenced to three years in prison his mother Ingeborg Oswald told CNN There have been other reported deaths as well as reports of physical and sexual assaults Writer Lily Kay Ross says she survived sexual abuse by an ayahuasca shaman We have to take seriously the potential for harm alongside the huge potential for benefit Ross says on a video on a fundraising website for the Ethnobotanical Stewardship Council Standards of safety and ethics would go a long way in making sure that this kind of abuse isnt experienced by anyone else Ron Wheelock an American shaman who leads an ayahuasca healing center in the Peruvian Amazon says he fears there may be more deaths I hate to say it yes there probably will be he told Lisa Ling Its in the cards Theres a movement to create safe ayahuasca   Through IndieGogocom the Ethnobotanical Stewardship Council is raising money to create a health guide for ayahuasca centers in the Amazon so tourists know which centers are safe and harvesting the plants in a sustainable manner that supports the local communities Great news A donor is matching all Ayahuasca Dialogues donations httptcoidAnshCWxF pictwittercomlh3eOnogZq The idea would be to put the ESCs logo outside ayahuasca ceremony sites to signify those centers that meet the councils criteria for safety and sustainability In addition there are efforts to study the medicinal benefits of ayahuasca so that it can be regulated and legalized in the United States explains Rick Doblin executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies At a time when drug policy is being reevaluated when marijuana looks like its on the road toward legalization when psychedelic medicine is moving forward through the FDA and we can envision a time when psychedelics are available as prescription medicines how ayahuasca should be handled in a regulatory context is really up in the air Doblin said ,0.4

CNN,health," CNN  Nurse Kaci Hickox has cut a deal with authorities that permits her to travel more or less freely while monitoring her health But Hickox who recently returned to the United States after treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone says she wont go into town where she lives or public places even though shes allowed The truth is I completely understand that this town has been through a lot and theres still a lot of fears and misinformation out there I think we need to start addressing those issues she told CNNs Anderson Cooper 360 on Monday night Its also true that I only moved here to Fort Kent Maine in August So you know there are a lot of people who dont know me Im still an outsider and I just sort of want to respect their wishes she said On Friday a judge in Maine ruled in favor of Hickox who defied a quarantine in a tense standoff with state authorities District Court Chief Judge Charles LaVerdiere said local health officials failed to prove the need for a stricter order enforcing an Ebola quarantine and ordered Hickox to submit to direct active monitoring coordinate travel with public health officials and immediately notify health authorities should symptoms appear Weighing returning Ebola workers liberty public safety Maine authorities had wanted Hickox to stay home for the remainder of a 21day period  the incubation time for the deadly virus  following her return to the United States although she has tested negative for the disease and has shown no symptoms There is no science behind it with this disease she told CNN about quarantine We know that Ebola is not transmitted as easily as many other diseases and that selfmonitoring and even an enhanced version which is what most states in the US are going to now  This will work Hickox said She first made news when she returned from a month working with Doctors Without Borders Hickox had an elevated temperature at an airport in Newark New Jersey officials said She was put into an isolation tent She blasted New Jersey Gov Chris Christie for enforcing a new policy that required anyone showing symptoms of Ebola including an elevated temperature to be isolated The biggest reason that I fought is because I you know felt so much fear and confusion and I imagined what my fellow aid workers were going to feel if they came back to this same situation  and the more I thought about the fact that these policies are being made by politicians really not the experts in the field  the more I felt like I had no choice but to fight back Hickox said The ruling in Maine just applies in her case It has no bearing for anyone else possibly returning from working with Ebola patients in West Africa which is why Hickox believes more work must be done Id like to see more leadership at the national level as well We really need evidencebased policies and these kneejerk reactions you know theyre just not being well thought out she said The fight is not over Ebola outbreak Get up to speed CNNs Ray Sanchez Catherine E Shoichet and Faith Karimi contributed to this report Watch Anderson Cooper

CNN,health, Orange California CNN  Ian Chung is nestled in darkness Born just 24 weeks into gestation he weighs scarcely more than a pound He can hear the faint sounds of the outside world mingling with the soothing sound of his mothers voice His spindly arms and legs shake as he lets out a warble Oh my love coos his mother Julie Chung 31 Youre going to be OK Julies hands descend  one landing lightly on Ians chest while the other pushes against his jerking legs She is using touch and light pressure to simulate for her premature son her own womb A few moments later Ian stops crying When he was born he was so tiny said Chung It was like Oh wow can a baby even survive outside the womb this early Medical advances are improving outcomes for even the tiniest babies Experts say fewer than 1 are born in the micro preemie category at the hospital where Ian is being treated Childrens Hospital of Orange County in California that means born before 28 weeks or born weighing less than 22 pounds Survival rates among micro preemies have been improving said Mindy Morris a neonatal nurse practitioner at Childrens Hospital So they may survive to discharge But then growing up as children they have a lot of complications Doctors and nurses at a specialized unit at Childrens Hospital have implemented a system they say is dramatically reducing disability and infection rates among this rare preemie population Aptly named the Small Baby Unit the staff work under the cover of darkness and quiet in a separate wing of the hospital Here stimulation is kept to a minimum speaking is only done in hushed voices The overall effect is one of relative calm an attempt to mimic what babies would experience if they were still safely tucked in utero We try to keep it low sound low lights so that it is as close to the womb as we can get said Morris coordinator of the Extremely Low Birth Weight Program at Childrens Hospital We try to minimize the intrusion to them In 2009 before the Small Baby Unit was up and running 45 of babies were discharged with chronic lung disease In 2012 after the unit had been operating for three years the rate was down to 27 Infection rates from 2009 to 2012 dipped from 41 to 15 and feeding weight and head circumference have also improved Dr Kristi Watterberg chairwoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on the fetus and newborn said that developing processes to treat extremely low birthweight babies is  broadly speaking  a good thing But since Childrens Hospitals data are selfreflexive she questions what exactly is contributing to the units success When someone starts focusing on something it tends to trend better said Watterberg What made it happen We dont know Watterberg said that some elements of what is being done at Childrens Hospital including various forms of touch therapy can be beneficial to premature infants A large study published in 2004 found 21 to 48 greater weight gain among infants undergoing moderate massage therapy they also were discharged sooner from the hospital Other studies suggest that specific types of massage therapy stimulate production of growth hormones and promote bone development At the Small Baby Unit parents act as therapists and partners with the staff so they are engaged fully with their childs progress Studies show that mothers who massage their infants experience decreased depression and anxiety It can hurt to be touched Chung is learning about the thin line between stimulating and overstimulating her son For preemies it can hurt to be touched because their skin isnt ready for it explained Karin Mitchell a developmental therapist working with Chung Mitchell grabs Chungs hand Let me show you on your hand she said pressing on Chungs palm to show her how firmly to touch Ian Its not heavy but its also not superlight Remember when he was inside the womb there was amniotic fluid and there was a feeling of that moving across every skin cell of his body Mitchell said Thats what helps babies know Where do I start and where do I stop When babies are born early like Ian they dont have that option so now they have to learn their body in the midst of air Its a lot different Soon Ian will lie  tubes and all  skintoskin on his mothers chest for an hour or more something referred to as kangaroo care Painful medical interventions like intubation extubation and blood draws are performed while a baby is skintoskin with a parent whenever possible In those situations touch is thought to mitigate pain Kangarooing as mothers here refer to it also helps with bonding and regulating things like respiration and sleep among babies For mothers it may stimulate breast milk production It calms me when hes kangarooing with me and I notice hes more calm said Chung She pauses as tears roll down her face Its nice to know that those things help him You cling to those little things that can ease things for him Ians care here is in stark contrast to what he got during his first few days of life in a traditional NICU at another local hospital There according to his parents the lights and noise were blaring This unit is a laser focus on this very specific patient population I think that is what makes this so unique said Dr Kushal Bhakta medical director of the Extremely Low Birth Weight Program at Childrens Hospital Other places Ive worked you will have a tiny premature baby next to an older child who has a heart condition next to another child who may be crying he continued So theres  a lot of other stimuli to this little tiny preemie and its not done purposely Its just the layout of whatever unit theyre in Watterberg of the American Academy of Pediatrics said it is important to strike a balance adding that theories and approaches regarding noise in the ICU are constantly evolving We used to think it should be quiet so when these babies came into the world too soon wed turn off the lights and make it quiet said Watterberg a professor of pediatrics and neonatology at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine Turns out babies were hearing a fair amount of noise in utero and that maybe if its too quiet they are not hearing the kind of language they need She cites recent research that suggests too little sound could interfere with a babys acquisition of speech and language and that exposure to speech can enhance brain development in babies Similarly she said too much darkness could be counterproductive to a babys development since in utero a baby would be exposed to a stream of information from its mother reflecting her own changing circadian rhythms We know that what happens in the ICU affects babies long term said Watterberg So Im pleased that this group is working on it but the information we have is always in process Numbers  In the Small Baby Unit numbers mean a lot When Ian was born they went something like this 47 chance hed survive and if he did survive only a 31 chance he would escape serious neurodevelopmental problems Chung and her husband Ryan Chun,0.4
CNN,health," CNN  Nurse Kaci Hickox has cut a deal with authorities that permits her to travel more or less freely while monitoring her health But Hickox who recently returned to the United States after treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone says she wont go into town where she lives or public places even though shes allowed The truth is I completely understand that this town has been through a lot and theres still a lot of fears and misinformation out there I think we need to start addressing those issues she told CNNs Anderson Cooper 360 on Monday night Its also true that I only moved here to Fort Kent Maine in August So you know there are a lot of people who dont know me Im still an outsider and I just sort of want to respect their wishes she said On Friday a judge in Maine ruled in favor of Hickox who defied a quarantine in a tense standoff with state authorities District Court Chief Judge Charles LaVerdiere said local health officials failed to prove the need for a stricter order enforcing an Ebola quarantine and ordered Hickox to submit to direct active monitoring coordinate travel with public health officials and immediately notify health authorities should symptoms appear Weighing returning Ebola workers liberty public safety Maine authorities had wanted Hickox to stay home for the remainder of a 21day period  the incubation time for the deadly virus  following her return to the United States although she has tested negative for the disease and has shown no symptoms There is no science behind it with this disease she told CNN about quarantine We know that Ebola is not transmitted as easily as many other diseases and that selfmonitoring and even an enhanced version which is what most states in the US are going to now  This will work Hickox said She first made news when she returned from a month working with Doctors Without Borders Hickox had an elevated temperature at an airport in Newark New Jersey officials said She was put into an isolation tent She blasted New Jersey Gov Chris Christie for enforcing a new policy that required anyone showing symptoms of Ebola including an elevated temperature to be isolated The biggest reason that I fought is because I you know felt so much fear and confusion and I imagined what my fellow aid workers were going to feel if they came back to this same situation  and the more I thought about the fact that these policies are being made by politicians really not the experts in the field  the more I felt like I had no choice but to fight back Hickox said The ruling in Maine just applies in her case It has no bearing for anyone else possibly returning from working with Ebola patients in West Africa which is why Hickox believes more work must be done Id like to see more leadership at the national level as well We really need evidencebased policies and these kneejerk reactions you know theyre just not being well thought out she said The fight is not over Ebola outbreak Get up to speed CNNs Ray Sanchez Catherine E Shoichet and Faith Karimi contributed to this report Watch Anderson Cooper

CNN,health, For more from Elizabeth Cohen on the ground in West Africa watch CNN Saturday at 3 pm ET CNN  It can be exhausting nursing a child through a nasty bout with the flu so imagine how 22yearold Fatu Kekula felt nursing her entire family through Ebola Her father Her mother Her sister Her cousin Fatu took care of them all singlehandedly feeding them cleaning them and giving them medications And she did so with remarkable success Three out of her four patients survived Thats a 25 death rate  considerably better than the estimated Ebola death rate of 70 Fatu stayed healthy which is noteworthy considering that more than 300 health care workers have become infected with Ebola and she didnt even have personal protection equipment  those white space suits and goggles used in Ebola treatment units Instead Fatu whos in her final year of nursing school invented her own equipment International aid workers heard about Fatus trash bag method and are now teaching it to other West Africans who cant get into hospitals and dont have protective gear of their own Every day several times a day for about two weeks Fatu put trash bags over her socks and tied them in a knot over her calves Then she put on a pair of rubber boots and then another set of trash bags over the boots She wrapped her hair in a pair of stockings and over that a trash bag Next she donned a raincoat and four pairs of gloves on each hand followed by a mask It was an arduous and timeconsuming process but Fatu was religious about it never cutting corners UNICEF Spokeswoman Sarah Crowe said Fatu is amazing Essentially this is a tale of how communities are doing things for themselves Crowe said Our approach is to listen and work with communities and help them do the best they can with what they have Two doctors for 85000 people She emphasized of course that it would be better for patients to be in real hospitals with doctors and nurses in protective gear  its just that those things arent available to many West Africans No one knows that better than Fatu Her Ebola nightmare started Juy 27 when her father Moses had a spike in blood pressure She took him to a hospital in their home city of Kakata A bed was free because a patient had just passed away What no one realized at the time was that the patient had died of Ebola One woman walked in and the Ebola nightmare began Moses 52 developed a fever vomiting and diarrhea Then the hospital closed down because nurses started dying of Ebola Fatu took her father to Monrovia the capital city about a 90minute drive via difficult roads Three hospitals turned him away because they were full She took him back to another hospital in Kakata They said he had typhoid fever and did little for him so Fatu took him home where he infected three other family members Fatus mother Victoria 57 Fatus sister Vivian 28 and their 14yearold cousin who was living with them Alfred Winnie Guilty of Ebola until proven otherwise While operating her onewoman Ebola hospital for two weeks Fatu consulted with their family doctor who would talk to her on the phone but wouldnt come to the house She gave them medicines she obtained from the local clinic and fluids through intravenous lines that she started At times her patients blood pressure plummeted so low she feared they would die I cried many times she said I said God you want to tell me Im going to lose my entire family  But her father mother and sister rallied and were well on their way to recovery when space became available at JFK Medical Center on August 17 Alfred never recovered though and passed away at the hospital the next day Im very very proud her father said She saved my life through the almighty God Now hes working to find a scholarship for Fatu so she can finish her final year of nursing school He has no doubt his daughter will go on to save many more people during her life Im sure shell be a great giant of Liberia he said Ebola patients left to lay on the ground CNNs John Bonifield Orlando Ruiz and Orlind Cooper contributed to this story,0.4
CNN,health, Vital Signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world CNN  During World War Two soldiers learned to fear treatment as much as enemy bullets Unsanitary conditions and equipment in field hospitals made open wounds a breeding ground for bacteria that killed thousands particularly the fastacting and barely detectable gramnegative strains that caused toxic shock syndrome meningitis and typhoid Today vast improvements in medical hygiene have greatly reduced the odds of patients being poisoned on the treatment table And our safety is protected by an unlikely source  the bright blue blood of the horseshoe crab The helmetshaped creature has developed a unique defense to compensate for its vulnerability to infection in shallow waters When faced with toxins produced by bacteria amebocyte cells in the blood  colored blue by their copperbased molecules  identify and congeal around the invading matter trapping the threat inside a gellike seal that prevents it from spreading Natures method is now utilized on a grand scale Over 600000 crabs are captured each year during the spring mating season to donate around 30 of their blood in a handful of specialist facilities in the United States and Asia The blood is worth 60000 a gallon in a global industry valued at 50 million a year Read The people with someone elses face An extract has been used in the industrystandard limulus amebocyte lysate LAL contamination test since the 1970s  replacing a rabbitbased system Fortyfive minutes of exposure to the crabs blood is enough to reveal endotoxins from gramnegative bacteria which otherwise avoid detection and is sensitive enough to isolate a threat the equivalent size of a grain of sand in a swimming pool The US Food and Drug Administration FDA requires that intravenous drugs and any medical equipment coming in contact with the body must first pass through the crabs blood from needles to surgical implants including pacemakers As a result thousands more of us survive such procedures The method is established but undergoes constant improvement according to John Dubczak General Manager at Charles River Laboratories which manufactures and globally distributes LAL products Detection is down to one part per trillion he said But we can take it down to a tenth of a trillion and further orders of magnitude more sensitive Charles River has adapted the system into a more resourceefficient handheld kit requiring as little as 5 of the blood solution Such systems can be applied outside the lab and break new frontiers such as on a trip the International Space Station The test was used to determine if certain types of bacteria were present on various space station surfaces said Norman Wainwright the facilitys director of Research and Development Further the system could help perform biological studies necessary for an extended human presence in space from crew health and spacecraft environmental studies to the search for life elsewhere in the solar system Read These 8 whiz kids are the future of medicine The blood is finding other uses on Earth too Japanese scientists have devised a test for fungal infections with it and further research is developing antiviral and anticancer treatment through the same principle of isolating and trapping threats As the applications and their value multiplies efforts have increased to develop alternative tests rather than rely on harvesting the crabs One approach uses an electronic chip that provides an alert when in contact with contaminants Another system using liquid crystals developed by the University of WisconsinMadison could offer similar detection ability at lower cost The Wisconsin literature claims to surpass the sensitivity and specificity for finding toxins so false positives are not a serious problem says Dr Peter B Armstrong a professor of molecular and cellular biology at the University of California But nothing has gone to the level of FDA approval to show it is yet a viable alternative to LAL test Knowing the cost and difficulty of obtaining FDA tests it may be some time before any alternative is out there on the market The urgency may increase with reports of horseshoe crab numbers declining for a variety of reasons with the worlds largest population in Delaware Bay reportedly reduced by between 75 and 90 in the last 15 years Although there are welfare procedures in harvesting the blood between 1030 of donor crabs die in the process One recent study showed that survivors are also impaired after release and often incapable of mating further threatening the population Its difficult because the blood is crucial for human health issues but the biomedical industry needs to keep the population steady says Christopher Chabot a biology professor at Plymouth State who led the study We suggest decreasing the time they are out of water and maintaining an ambient temperature for transportation  there is a lesser mortality rate if you keep them cool Ultimately Chabot believes an alternative is necessary to reduce the strain on the population through both conservation programs and the development of a synthetic substitute It is not clear what expiry date there is on the lifesaving services of the horseshoe crab but without it medicine faces a return to the dark ages Read The people with someone elses face Read These 8 whiz kids

CNN,health, Editors note Tony Stoddard is a childhood cancer advocate The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely his CNN  My son Cole died two and a half years ago from neuroblastoma a common childhood cancer after suffering through multiple surgeries chemotherapy injections and painful radiation therapy These treatments while standard for this type of cancer were so barbaric and horrifying I would not wish them on my worst enemy Nor would I wish him or her to have to live with the image of their child experiencing their gruesome side effects Cole was just 5 years old He left behind my wife Michelle and I a heartbroken twin brother named Troy and his loving big sister Tara Our family has been devastated by this loss I miss my son every second of every day By talking to many other parents who have lost children to childhood cancer I have come to understand that this pain will last until I am gone A week before Cole died in our arms he looked up at me and said Im not going to grow up to be or do anything Can you imagine hearing your child speak such words Fighting back tears I promised my son he would do something big someday For two years now I have been fighting around the clock to fulfill my promise to my son I do this in hopes that greater awareness will lead to desperately needed funding and research so children can receive more humane treatments and have a better chance of survival with fewer future complications Pediatric cancer kills more kids in the United States than any other disease And more than 11000 children are diagnosed with cancer each year Yet the National Cancer Institute devotes just 4 of its budget toward pediatric cancer research Surely these statistics speak of the dire need for increased funding to fight pediatric cancer I began my mission to increase childhood cancer awareness in August 2012 My dream was to see as much gold in September for Childhood Cancer Awareness Month as there is pink in October for Breast Cancer Awareness Month The awareness generated by the breast cancer community has led to earlier detection newer and improved treatments and higher survival rates for those fighting breast cancer I just wanted the same for kids fighting cancer I started reaching out to officials at bridges buildings and landmarks across the United States asking that they light gold in September to help increase awareness I was successful in getting many to agree the Prudential Building the Zakim Bridge and the TD Garden in Boston the battleship New Jersey and the Liberty Bridge in Greenville South Carolina Many others across the United States began to reach out to structures in their hometowns Our movement to go gold in September even took root in countries such as Ireland Australia Canada and Switzerland Last year there was more gold displayed in September across the world than ever before and we are just beginning Please display gold this September to help shed light on the monster that afflicts so many of our children Lighting gold is the first step toward greater awareness of childhood cancer  awareness that will hopefully lead to increased funding which will lead to more research that will hopefully lead to a cure for all types of childhood cancer But there is another reason to light gold It helps to heal the hearts of parents such as myself who have lost children to cancer It lets us know our children did not die in vain It shows us our kids are not forgotten My son received most of his treatments at Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center in Boston After my son died I had a difficult time going back to Boston there were too many painful memories there But last September I returned to see many of the landmarks we had crossed and passed by so often illuminated with gold lights I smiled with tears streaming down my cheeks looking at the buildings and bridges shining gold and thought You are doing something big Cole ,0.4

CNN,health, Editors note Diane Coleman is president and CEO of Not Dead Yet a national grassroots disability rights group The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author CNN  A beautiful 29yearold woman with a rare brain tumor Brittany Maynard and her tragic death have sparked the onagain offagain debate about whether assisted suicide should be legalized in this country The media frenzy over the Maynard story has made it almost impossible for a legitimate opposing view to be heard and many people believe that any opposition has to come from religious extremists or rightwing busybodies I am neither As a disability rights advocate for over 40 years as well as a person living with a disability I am deeply troubled about the Maynard media swarm Assisted suicide legalization isnt about Brittany Maynard Its about the thousands of vulnerable ill elderly and disabled people who will be harmed if assisted suicide is legalized A recent report from the Institute of Medicine calls the countrys system of caring for terminally ill people largely broken poorly designed to meet the needs of patients and refers to Medicare and Medicaid health care systems designed to meet the needs of the poorest among us in need of major reorientation and restructuring More from Opinion Why assisted suicide laws are dangerous The idea of mixing a costcutting treatment such as assisted suicide into a broken costconscious health care system thats poorly designed to meet dying patients needs is dangerous to the thousands of people whose health care costs the most  mainly people living with a disability the elderly and chronically ill Assisted suicide drugs cost less than 300 Compare that with the cost of treating a terminal illness This is one of the many reasons every major disability rights organization in the country that has taken a position on assisted suicide is opposed to legalization along with the American Medical Association palliative care specialists and hospice workers who know better than anyone that advancements in palliative care have eliminated pain as an issue for patients who receive appropriate care Anyone dying in discomfort may legally today in all 50 states receive palliative sedation wherein the patient is sedated and discomfort is relieved while the dying process takes place peacefully This legal solution does not raise the very serious difficulties that legalizing assisted suicide poses More from Opinion When assisted suicide is not the answer Assisted suicide ultimately affects everyones health care In Oregon where assisted suicide is legal and where Maynard moved to be prescribed the lethal dose patients have been harmed In 2008 cancer patient Barbara Wagner was prescribed a chemotherapy treatment by her doctor but Oregons staterun health plan sent a letter which denied coverage of this chemo yet offered to cover other treatments including assisted suicide The same scenario happened to another Oregon resident Randy Stroup The Oregon assisted suicide reports tell us that over 95 of those who supposedly received lethal prescriptions in Oregon had insurance but how many got a denial like the one sent to Wagner and Stroup When assisted suicide is encouraged it becomes a covered treatment and ultimately removes choices from patients Assisted suicides supposed safeguards are hollow Nothing in the Oregon Washington and Vermont laws prevents an heir or caregiver from suggesting assisted suicide as an option taking the person to the doctor to sign up and witnessing the consent form Once the prescription is obtained with no further witness required nothing in the law ensures the persons consent or selfadministration at the time of death More from Opinion Maynard was courageous and right With the rising tide of elder abuse in this country we cant ignore the dangers of granting blanket legal immunity to all the participants in an assisted suicide When voters are given all the facts surrounding assisted suicide they reject bills to legalize it This was the case in Massachusetts when Question 2 which would have legalized assisted suicide in the Bay State was on the ballot in 2012 but was defeated In 2014 bills again in Massachusetts Connecticut and New Hampshire failed because of lack of support in the legislature Brittany Maynards story is incredibly heartwrenching When you look at assisted suicide based on one individual it often looks acceptable But when you examine how legalization affects the vast majority of us  especially those most vulnerable  the dangers to the many far outweigh any alleged benefits to a few Read CNNOpinions new Flipboard magazine Follow us on Twitter CNNOpinion Join us on FacebookcomCNNOpinion ,0.4

CNN,health, CNN  Researchers have found dozens of new genes that may play a role in causing autism according to two studies published Wednesday in the medical journal Nature Scientists identified 60 genes with a greater than 90 chance of increasing a childs autism risk Previous research has yielded only 11 genes that had been confirmed with this level of certainty Though other studies have shown the importance of genetics in the development of autism experts say these new studies zero in on the exact nature of the genetic mutations that cause the disorder The researchers say these genes appear to be clustering around three sets of key biological functions The first set focuses on the development of synapses in the brain which are responsible for all kinds of communication between nerves The second set is responsible for the creation of genetic instructions and the third is responsible for DNA packaging within cells Each of these functions could have an effect on the individual that would cause the traits commonly associated with autism according to one of the studies Dr Matthew State chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of California San Francisco and coauthor of both studies believes that the most important thing to take away from the studies is a new knowledge base Instead of focusing on environmental factors he says these studies are focusing on what happens inside of the brain This kind of genetic research has been used to treat all kinds of disorders and diseases State says but before now had not been applied to psychiatric disorders Similar genetic studies for childhood leukemia took it from nearly always fatal to a treatable often curable disease Its the understanding of biology at that level thats helped treatments for cancer Its something weve been missing in psychiatric disorders in general State said They lay the groundwork for a transformed understanding of the disorder and hopefully a transformation in how were able to diagnose and treat it Autism is a complex disorder one that has been difficult to treat because it is so poorly understood By tapping into the genetic foundation of the disorder scientists theorize it may be possible to provide more personalized treatment based on a persons own unique gene set I think that if everybody were to be genotyped when theyre diagnosed the more this is studied the more well be able to say what the biological causes are  and we can target your symptoms with more personalized medicine said Dan Smith senior director of neuroscience at the advocacy organization Autism Speaks In addition to developing treatments based on a better understanding of the disorder the study provides hope for the prevention of autism as well A portion of the genes studied were de novo genes not passed down from either parent but developed in the egg or sperm shortly before conception Further studies could determine what environmental factors cause those genes to mutate This is going to begin to give us an opportunity to study the interactions between genes and environment State said The rate of new mutation increases with age specifically fathers because a lot of these mutations are in sperm State is optimistic about the future and what these two studies will contribute The big difference is that five years ago we had no idea When you have no idea you have no opportunity to think in a systematic or rational way to develop treatment he said We can finally say something really concretely about a large number of genes that contribute to risk ,0.4

CNN,health, Vital Signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world CNN  Valuable insight into our health is lurking beneath our city streets We can reveal the invisible in a city The underworld we dont see every day says architect Carlo Ratti The underworld Ratti is referring to is our sewers  home to the most personalized waste a city has to offer As director of the Senseable City Lab at MIT his Underworlds project is using this waste to open up a new world of information on human health and behavior through a platform he calls Smart Sewage New techniques in biology allow us to characterize bacteria and viruses leaving our bodies This is the microbiome of us explains Ratti His team is currently designing prototype smart platforms that collect sewage filter it and use computational techniques to analyze any genetic material present to identify any viruses and bacteria as well as spotting specific chemicals using a technique known as mass spectrometry Read The people with someone elses face Ratti aims to characterize a citys microbiome the vast community of microbes that lives in the human body and ultimately see epidemics before they happen Detecting infections The main benefits lie in the realtime aspect of the technology providing insight into the diseases circulating in a community before the people affected know for themselves The steps involved in disease diagnosis are slow Ratti explains First people need to notice symptoms of illness and then they have to begin the process of doctors appointments and tests to get a diagnosis Testing sewage could be a faster way to predict the presence of infections among the population To begin with the project will primarily look for influenza and gastroenteritisrelated outbreaks such as salmonella and rotavirus infections but the potential public health benefits go beyond outbreak prediction and surveillance Most of whats going in and out of a city is the water going in and sewage coming out says Eric Alm professor of Biological Engineering and Civil and Environmental Engineering at MIT who runs the Underworlds project alongside Ratti The change in water in and out reflects a broad array of human activity going on in a city he adds But Alm admits there are many challenges ahead and that its not as straightforward as getting DNA from the sewage and sequencing it Its only useful if we can figure out what kind of sewage water it is he says The water in our sewers is a mix of water from showers toilets and rain and the resulting chemicals and microorganisms will vary depending on the source The second challenge is who has contributed to that water explains Alm But he believes his team can build a robust platform to not only monitor changes in health but also see what chemicals are being released into the water by industries as well as monitor chemical security threats and even assess the impact of health policies by looking at other biological factors Theres a whole host of applications we can use says Alm Live trials The first city to trial their prototype will be the one local to MIT  Boston This will be piloted in 2016 ready for a bigger prototype set to be implemented in Kuwait City the following year where the team has formed a partnership with Kuwaiti stakeholders including its Ministry of Health Read These 8 whiz kids are the future of medicine Trials are essential to understand the true sensitivity of such a technology and the extent to which microorganisms such as viruses can be detected Its a clever idea in principle says Sandy Cairncross professor of Environmental Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine But he remains unsure whether the bacteria and viruses being targeted can be easily found Some organisms are more fragile than others and will die in the sewers some are difficult to detect in small numbers and some are more numerous than others he says Cairncross recalls a cholera study that took swabs of sewage from manholes in Dhaka Bangladesh but failed to find a single one these bacteria It has potential but will take a lot of trial and error to find which results are reliable or meaningful he adds The concerns are shared by the team at MIT We need to figure out how far down from somebodys home or business you can still see organisms explains Alm who also suggests they may need to time sampling to peak poop hours during the day such as the morning But they have had some success We did some early studies last year and detected some flu viruses which we were very excited about Their sewage success was indeed exciting as the types of organisms expected to be found are those associated with the gastrointestinal tract such as salmonella whereas flu viruses are respiratory Im optimistic says Alm Smart toilet Whilst the shortterm plan is to use this technology platform to collect information about entire populations in the future it could become more personalized via a smart toilet We will be able to monitor the microbiome individually and tell you about your body says Ratti about the overall vision for the technology to monitor and detect this before you fall sick Alm monitored his own microbiome for a year back in 2009 which involved noting every food item consumed and analyzing his every bowel movement But the arduous task provided detailed insight into the microbial communities living inside his body and the impact any changes in travel diet or health had on their composition The smart toilets are likely to begin simple with a device to drop into a toilet rather than a toilet you buy outright with technology installed But the information provided could add to the growing field of personalized medicine and healthcare The immediate future however remains the glamorous task of mining sewage to visualize urban health patterns Sewage is the most logical start point concludes Alm about his goals to find the bugs infecting a city You never know until you go out and find it Read These 8 whiz kids are the future of medicine Read Is this the return of the White Plague Read The people with someone elses face ,0.4

CNN,health, Life by DailyBurn  The first meal of the day can have a very different meaning for different people For some its grabbing a granola bar to nibble on during the morning commute for others it includes a big omelet with a cup of coffee at home Then there are the millions who forego grub in the am altogether But how do these morning behaviors really affect weight loss energy levels and appetite throughout the day In order to help you crack the breakfast code we tracked down the latest research in addition to insights from Katherine Zeratsky a nutrition instructor at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota Before you do  or dont  dig in heres a reality check on the biggest breakfast myths DailyBurn 10 delicious protein pancake recipes Myth 1 Breakfast is essential for weight loss Reality Munching in the morning doesnt have a direct effect on dropping pounds A recent study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that when people are trying to lose weight it doesnt matter if they devour a dish first thing after waking up or if they skip it altogether The researchers assigned more than 300 overweight and obese but otherwise healthy individuals ages 20 to 65 to either the control group that continued with eating habits per usual a group that was told to eat breakfast or a group that was instructed to miss the meal After tracking their weight for 16 weeks the scientists found that those who grabbed a bite in the morning didnt lose any more weight than those who omitted am snacks DailyBurn 25 quick and healthy 4ingredient breakfast recipes But take this finding with a grain of salt Though our study suggests breakfast may not be key to weight loss we only examined a general recommendation of eating versus skipping says Emily Dhurandhar assistant professor at the Department of Health Behavior at the University of Alabama Birmingham and a lead author of the study Specific foods and timing may help so if weight loss is the goal consult with a nutritionist or doctor to determine your best course of action Myth 2 Skip boxed cereals Reality Sure you should lay off the sweet stuff but not necessarily the cereal itself Lucky Charms Cocoa Puffs and Fruity Pebbles may taste delicious but they arent packing a nutrient punch Thats not to say that other cereals on the market cant be a part of a healthy balanced diet In fact an Advances in Nutrition study found that wholegrain cereal can lower cholesterol the soluble fiber prevents reabsorption of the substance in the gut These slowdigesting carbs can also improve bowel function the fiber content softens stool and promotes goodforyou bacteria in the digestive system and help maintain a healthy weight DailyBurn 5 intermittent fasting methods Which one is right for you  The best choices when searching the shelves Oat and barley mixes work best for those keeping an eye on cholesterol levels and wheat bran is ideal for those with gut problems says Peter Williams honorary professorial fellow at the University of Wollongong in Australia and one of the studys researchers Williams suggests portion sizes of about onethird to onehalf cup of a heavy cereal like muesli or one cup of a light cereal such as puffed grains Myth 3 You should eat a meal to fuel your am workout Reality Food will increase your energy just consider your activity of choice As for whether a morning meal will help you power through a workout the answer is most likely Research from the University of Bath in the United Kingdom found that those who ate breakfast had higher energy expenditure in daily physical activity over a sixweek period compared to those who fasted until noon The study authors suspect that this effect can occur on any given day breakfast is eaten discounting a longterm effect because the improvement in energy levels was apparent from week one says James Betts research scientist and senior lecturer in the Department of Health at the University of Bath and lead author on the study Betts and his team also found high glucose levels in the breakfasteating group which signals to the brain and central nervous system that theres energy available and motivates you to move You may realize the quality of your physical performance that day is not critical say if youre performing simple housework so you opt for skipping breakfast to take advantage of the negative energy balance explains Betts Or you may decide that you need breakfast to support your energy needs and perform to the best of your ability Either way breakfast can help support an active lifestyle Myth 4 Grabbing a bite before work will help you eat less later Reality Its not guaranteed to reduce calorie intake in the afternoon but eating in the morning does release chemicals to the brain and can also steady glucose levels throughout the day A new study just released from the University of Missouri found that having breakfast particularly dishes high in protein increased young adults levels of dopamine a brain chemical responsible for moderating impulses and reward which may reduce food cravings and overeating later in the day Eating initiates a release of this neurohormone which then triggers feelings of reward explains Heather Leidy an assistant professor of nutrition and exercise physiology at the University of Missouri and author of the study That reward response Leidy adds is what helps people regulate how much they chow down If someone has eaten three meals in a given day and theyre still munching in the evening that usually due to reasons other than hunger like convenience boredom stress or a reward says Zeratsky But that doesnt necessarily mean eating breakfast will stave off latenight cravings The abovementioned University of Bath study found that having breakfast didnt suppress caloric intake later in the day but that it did however regulate glucose levels in the afternoon and evening The benefits More variable glucose levels can indicate a poorer diet or a more unsteady metabolism says Betts And chronic inflammation from the bodys excess exposure to glucose can lead to issues like diabetes or cardiovascular disease So while breakfast might not help you cut back on calories it may cut disease risk Myth 5 Breakfast is the most important meal of the day Reality Its less about one meal than it is about what you eat over the course of the day According to the above recent research weight loss isnt necessarily tied to breakfast habits It comes down to calories instead Its the total number of calories that matters whether you divide that into two meals or six says Zeratsky But again that doesnt give you a free pass to skip breakfast every day Having some foods to start out the day can promote a nutrientrich diet overall Zeratsky says Her goto power meals energy foods including fruits and whole grains and hungercontrolling foods like milk yogurt or eggs If you are working out in the early am opt for something smaller particularly if you have a sensitive stomach such as a banana or wholegrain bread with peanut butter or honey If you do choose to eat early in the day be sure its something healthy that will do your body good

CNN,health, Vital Signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world CNN  Think of psychedelics and youll likely think of bright colors hallucinations spirituality and an overall mystical experience For centuries these drugs have been used in social religious and medicinal contexts by cultures across the globe But today the ability of these drugs to alter our brain function is being tapped into as a potential therapeutic for a range of mental health conditions from anxiety and depression to addiction and obsessive compulsive disorder OCD Only by losing the self can you find the self explains Dr Robin CarhartHarris from Imperial College London These may not be the usual words of a scientist but there is biology behind them People try and run away from things and to forget but with psychedelic drugs theyre forced to confront and really look at themselves he says The drugs CarhartHarris is referring to are hallucinogens such as magic mushrooms  specifically the active chemical inside them psilocybin Were beginning to identify the biological basis of the reported mind expansion associated with psychedelic drugs he says Psilocybin is not addictive and is interesting to researchers for its ability to make users see the world differently The team at Imperial College has begun to unravel why CarhartHarris scanned the brains of 30 healthy volunteers after they had been injected with psilocybin and found the more primitive regions of the brain associated with emotional thinking became more active and the brains default mode network associated with highlevel thinking selfconsciousness and introspection was disjointed and less active We know that a number of mental illnesses such as OCD and depression are associated with excessive connectivity of the brain and the default mode network becomes overconnected says David Nutt professor of neuropsychopharmacology who leads the Imperial College team Nutt was formerly drug adviser to the UK government but was fired in 2009 He cannot be both a government adviser and a campaigner against government policy wrote a member of the British Parliament at the time Read The people with someone elses face The overconnectivity Nutt describes causes depressed people to become locked into rumination and concentrate excessively on negative thoughts about themselves By disrupting that network with psilocybin you can liberate them from those depressive symptoms by showing them its possible to escape those thoughts he says Depression is estimated to affect more than 350 million people around the world according to the World Health Organization The current pharmaceutical approach to treatment is with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs such as Prozac which increase levels of serotonin in the brain to improve moods But SSRIs are not effective in everyone take time to show an effect and are generally prescribed for long periods of time to maintain their effect Nutt thinks psilocybin could be a gamechanger used as part of a therapeutic package where the mindaltering and confronting nature of psychedelics are combined with therapy to treat people within just one or two doses of treatment Weve never had drugs before with an instant effect This could create a paradigm shift to help people into a different state of thinking that they can then stay in he says But he stresses that psilocybin should be administered with professional support as part of medical therapy Psilocybin is illegal in many countries and in the United States it is considered a Schedule 1 drug Schedule 1 drugs have a high potential for abuse and serve no legitimate medical purpose in the United States according to the Department of Justice The US National Institute of Drug Abuse says that longterm negative effects such as flashbacks a risk of psychiatric illness and impaired memory have been described in case reports Some people have frightening experiences while on psilocybin and can experience panic reactions which may cause them harm to themselves or others Read These 8 whiz kids are the future of medicine This new research however has only scratched the surface of the brain and its consciousness The brain is about organizing information and predicting the external world and we think psilocybin disrupts that and makes it more chaotic says Nutt People have hallucinations because instead of seeing the world as the brain expects it to be you see what the brain is doing This chaos could potentially treat not only depression but also addictions such as smoking and alcoholism which were the subject of some of the earliest studies on psychedelics in the 1950s and 60s before laws against the drugs were introduced With psilocybin people feel reorganized after therapy and the nature of the reorganization is such that there are effects on attitudes towards addiction explains professor Roland Griffiths from the Johns Hopkins School of medicine The Centers for Disease Control estimates there are 42 million smokers in the United States and the habit accounts for one in five deaths each year Initial studies by Griffiths and his team to treat smoking addiction have found 80 success rates in people quitting the habit up to six months after their treatment Their studies indicate that psilocybinbased therapy could potentially be quicker and more effective than longterm therapies such as nicotine replacement The mechanisms behind the change arent fully understood but the therapy is thought to increase motivation and selfefficacy so people have more confidence in their ability to quit The defaultmode network is about habitual patterns of behavior and decreasing activity in this system may free someone to think differently postulates Griffiths People say their addiction doesnt seem compelling anymore Similar smallscale studies on alcoholism by Michael Bogenschutz at the University of New Mexico have had equally promising results with the greatest improvements seen in people after they had received psilocybin than after counseling alone The degree of improvement was highly correlated with the intensity of the subjective effects of psilocybin says Bogenshutz Psilocybin therapy is still a long way from widespread acceptance and trials need to be conducted on larger scales in controlled settings The early research is promising but further research is needed comments Dr Owen BowdenJones of the UKs Royal College of Psychiatrists It will require much more research to establish whether these drugs work in clinical settings and are safe to use with patients he says But the transAtlantic teams envision a future of approved clinics administering these mindalerting psychedelics in a supportive setting to treat various mental ailments Its unlikely to become the mainstream treatment concludes Nutt But it could be used on people with depression when SSRIs arent working Read The people with someone elses face Read These 8

CNN,health, CNN  Can a lack of sleep affect the size of your brain Its possible a recent study published in an online issue of Neurology suggests European researchers looked at 147 adults between the ages of 20 and 84 With two MRI scans they examined the link between sleep problems like insomnia and the study participants brain volume The first scan was taken before patients completed a questionnaire pertaining to their sleep habits The second scan was done approximately 3 years later The questionnaire showed that 35 of those in the study met the criteria for poor sleep health Investigators found that those with sleep problems had a more rapid decline in brain volume or size over the course of the study than those who slept well The results were even more significant in participants over the age of 60 Numerous studies have showed the importance of sleep and the effect sleep deprivation can have on our brains It is wellknown that poor sleep patterns can contribute to such brain disorders as Alzheimers and dementia So it stands to reason that if a lack of sleep can lead to memory loss the size of the brain would also be affected We know that a lack of sleep can lead to all kinds of problems explained Dr Neal Maru a neurologist and sleep specialist with Integrated Sleep Services in Alexandria Virginia who is not associated with the study Poor sleep can affect our immune systems our cardiovascular health weight and of course memories But we still dont know why Studies have shown poor sleep can cause protein buildup in the brain that attacks brain cells So were still trying to put the puzzle together The study authors agree It is not yet known whether poor sleep quality is a cause or consequence of changes in brain structure said author Claire Sexton of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom There are effective treatments for sleep problems so future research needs to test whether improving peoples quality of sleep could slow the rate of brain volume loss If that is the case improving peoples sleep habits could be an important way to improve brain health The problem is we really dont know what comes first Maru agreed Is it a sleep problem that causes the atrophy wasting away of a body part or is it the atrophy that causes the sleep problems Thats a question we need to sort out ,0.4

CNN,health, CNN  What we know  and psychiatrists have diagnosed for decades  as schizophrenia may really be eight separate diseases research published in The American Journal of Psychiatry suggests Scientists at Washington University in St Louis analyzed the DNA of more than 4000 people with schizophrenia They matched any gene variations they found in the DNA with study participants individual symptoms In doing so they found several gene clusters that appear to cause eight distinct classes of schizophrenia according to a statement from the university Complex diseases such as schizophrenia may be influenced by hundreds or thousands of genetic variants that interact with one another in complex ways the study authors wrote in their introduction Genes dont operate by themselves Dr C Robert Cloninger one of the studys senior authors explained in the statement They function in concert much like an orchestra and to understand how theyre working you have to know not just who the members of the orchestra are but how they interact Schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder that affects about 1 of the population according to the American Psychiatric Association Symptoms can vary from hallucinations to disordered speech to attention and decisionmaking problems Past studies done on twins and families have shown that about 80 of the risk for schizophrenia is inherited the study authors say A study published in July showed as many as 108 genes may be tied to the mental health disorder But scientists have had trouble identifying specific genetic variations that put people at risk The Washington University researchers looked at instances where a single unit of DNA was altered which is known as a single nucleotide polymorphism or SNP Then they identified 42 interactive SNP sets that significantly increased peoples risk of schizophrenia according to the study In other words if study participant Bob had Gene Cluster X he was 70 more likely to have schizophrenia than study participant Fred who didnt have that cluster of genes In some cases certain gene clusters were matched with close to a 100 increase in risk In the past scientists had been looking for associations between individual genes and schizophrenia coauthor Dr Dragan Svrakic said in the statement What was missing was the idea that these genes dont act independently They work in concert to disrupt the brains structure and function and that results in the illness The idea that schizophrenia is not one single disorder is not really new says Dr Charles Raison a professor of psychiatry at the University of Arizona Its similar to the way doctors use the term breast cancer to describe several different diseases that cause tumors in the breasts Schizophrenia is probably 80 different diseases Raison says All psychiatric conditions likely share this heterogeneity There are only so many ways that certain malfunctions in your genetic code can manifest Raison says There may be 10 separate gene mutations but they might only express themselves as one or two symptoms So whats causing hallucinations in one person might be different than whats causing them in another So why are scientists trying to separate out the different schizophrenia disorders Two reasons Raison says to help predict who might get schizophrenia and to help treat it more efficiently Take for example pleurisy which is a condition where the liquid around your lungs becomes inflamed Several things can cause pleurisy including a viral infection pneumonia or cancer If you have a drug that treats pneumonia its going to help only a certain percentage of patients with pleurisy But if you know that your patients pleurisy is caused by cancer youll find a different course of treatment The same could hold true for schizophrenia and other mental health conditions Raison says In psychiatry land were still stuck with pleurisy he says Theyre descriptions of symptoms and we only have a vague idea of the underlying causes ,0.4

CNN,travel, Worldrenowned chef bestselling author and Emmywinning television personality Anthony Bourdain explores Paraguay at 9 pm ETPT on Sunday October 12 in the fourth season of Anthony Bourdain Parts Unknown Follow the show on Twitter and Facebook CNN  Overshadowed by its bigger flashier neighbors Paraguay is a curious country thats overlooked by visitors who flock to South American destinations like Buenos Aires Rio de Janeiro and the highlands of the Andes For those who visit nearby nations though Paraguays subtropical forests broad rivers and unusual history can make it an intriguing detour Surrounded by Brazil Argentina and Bolivia this landlocked nation is larger than a glance at the map suggests Its roughly the size of California but has only about 67 million residents at least 3 million fewer than Los Angeles County Taste Paraguays delicious mistake The Rio Paraguay divides the country into roughly equal halves Most of the population lives in the eastern half about a third of them in the riverside capital city of Asuncion To the west the Gran Chaco area is a mostly grassy plain brutally hot in summer punctuated with marshes savannas and thorn forests Thinly populated with ranchers and Amerindians the west is also home to Germanspeaking Mennonite colonies near the Bolivian border Its tempting to say that Paraguay is unspoiled by tourists and that would be true most visitors come from neighboring countries with whom the nation warred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries Now despite ups and downs in the quartercentury since notorious dictator Alfredo Stroessner fell from power Paraguay has become a more welcoming place In the absence of mass tourism its a place where closer contact and the lack of preconceptions can lead to memorable even intimate experiences at underrated sites Arrivals from North America or Europe are a relative novelty to be treated with courtesy and respect Here are 14 things to know about this littleknown country Habla usted Guarani Paraguay is Latin Americas most bilingual country as nearly 90 of all Paraguayans speak both Spanish and indigenous Guarani It is the only country in the region with a large percentage of nonindigenous citizens who speak an indigenous language There are at least a dozen other native languages but none approaches Guaranis prevalence An evolving capital Paraguays sprawling riverside capital Asuncion is the hub of its political commercial and cultural life Unlike most of South Americas capitals its a relatively lowrise city where shade is at a premium except on some lushly landscaped plazas It was founded in 1537 and its grid pattern is typical of the earliest Spanish settlements but there are few remaining colonial buildings The most notable structures such as the government palace and the shrine to those who perished in battle date from the 19th century The governments house Asuncions counterpart to the White House is the Palacio de los Lopez a neoclassical building intended for the dynasty that ruled the country for decades in the mid19th century The Lopez family didnt survive the War of the Triple Alliance when they foolishly took on Argentina Brazil and Uruguay in a bid to dominate the region Still their political successors have occupied the palace ever since Shrine to warriors In downtown Asuncion protected by an honor guard the Panteon de los Heroes is a domed neoclassical shrine housing the remains of the figures who led their country into disastrous conflict with neighboring countries Started in the 1860s before the War of the Triple Alliance it wasnt finished until 1936 after the Chaco War with Bolivia A couple of unknown soldiers are a token presence Picturing diversity Paraguay has a rich indigenous heritage not just from its Guarani past and present but also thanks to the smaller but diverse Amerindian populations from the Gran Chaco region that overlaps western Paraguay Asuncions Museo Etnografico Andres Barbero has a strong collection of historic photographs but also displays tools ceramics and weavings from all regions of the country Avant art In its isolation Paraguay may give the impression of provincialism but Asuncion has a lively contemporary art scene showcased at many galleries and the Museo del Barro which displays avantgarde works by Paraguayan Spanish and other Latin American artists under optimum conditions no easy feat in this hot humid climate The museum also features folk art collections from the 17th century to the present and more strictly indigenous artifacts from Paraguays native peoples Spiderweb lace One of Paraguays iconic crafts is nanduti the embroidered lace that probably arrived from the Spanish island of Tenerife The word itself meaning spiderweb in the Guarani language aptly describes the weavers geometric patterns but not the rainbow of colors that embellish their designs Sopa Paraguaya A common traditional dish Paraguayan soup isnt quite what its name would suggest Rather its cornbread flavored with cheese and onion among other ingredients Check out Eatocracys recipe Legend says its odd moniker stems from a mistake by 19thcentury dictator Carlos Antonio Lopezs cook who accidentally added excessive corn flour to a more liquid lunchtime dish Fortunately for the cook Lopez liked the results Terere Related to the common holly cultivated on plantations throughout the region mate pronounced mahtay or Paraguayan tea is popular among Argentines Uruguayans and even southern Brazilians who imbibe prodigious amounts of their favorite infusion Some like it hot but Paraguayans prefer it chilled in the suffocating summer heat An early Jesuit missionary claimed that mate improves the appetite speedily counteracts the languor arising from the burning climate and assuages both hunger and thirst Villa Hayes Historically Latin Americans are skeptical of the United States and its politicians but Rutherford B Hayes is a Paraguayan hero After the 19thcentury War of the Triple Alliance against Argentina Brazil and Uruguay this otherwise obscure US president awarded the Gran Chaco  now more than half of Paraguays territory  to Asuncion instead of Buenos Aires Both Argentina and Paraguay sent diplomats to Washington for Hayes binding arbitration Paraguayan President Candido Bareiro renamed the former town of Villa Occidental across the river from Asuncion in Hayes honor The surrounding county a school with a monument and the local soccer team also bear his name In Hayes hometown of Delaware Ohio a gas station occupies the site

but Paraguays Mision Jesus de Tavarangue and Mision la Santisima Trinidad de Parana near the southern city of Encarnacion are almost equally wellpreserved ruins Strictly speaking Mision Jesus is not a

CNN,travel, CNN  Hankering to see some happy feet Antarctica is far from your only option From the windswept beaches of Tierra del Fuego at South Americas tip to sunny Cape Town South Africa and Melbourne Australia penguin colonies exist in many strikingly beautiful destinations in the Southern Hemisphere Theres no denying it Penguins are among the most charismatic creatures Their notorious curiosity waddling gait and comical body language seldom fail to charm But these flightless sea birds have evolved over 15 million years to become strong nimble swimmers that often migrate long distances in pursuit of fish following seasonal ocean currents 7 prime spots for wildlife viewing Today most of the 18 species of penguins are in decline because of climate change habitat destruction pollution and overfishing  in fact more than half are considered endangered You can support their survival by visiting carefully managed colonies where tour operators respect penguin habitat and

more time on shore to breed nest and raise their young Check out these amazing penguin spots Tierra del Fuego Argentina and Chile Ushuaia Argentina the southernmost city in the world boasts several tour operators offering day cruises to view penguins and other marine life But only one PiraTour gives visitors the chance to walk among the penguins PiraTour runs two sixhour tours daily from the

strut along the beach by the hundreds The tour guide will instruct you to maintain a safe distance from the birds but be prepared for them to approach you as penguins can be extremely curious After a few minutes on the beach youll be led up a bluff to see their nesting ground where the birds often return to the same mate and same nest year after year Back at Estancia Harberton youll have time to grab a hot drink at the tea room or explore the farms onsite marine research center There is also a guest house and camp sites contact Harberton directly if you want to extend your visit to this peaceful haven Otherwise Ushuaia offers a wide range of accommodation options from backpacker hostels to luxury hotels perched on glacial mountainsides overlooking the city PiraTour US 95 for a sixhour tour 50 discount for children under 12 plus 13 entry fee to Estancia Harberton  Phillip Island Australia Since the 1920s tourists have flocked to Phillip Island to witness the smallest penguin species known as little penguins or fairy penguins return to shore each evening to feed their young after a long day of fishing Only 12 inches tall and weighing less than 3 pounds the little penguin is found only in Australia and New Zealand For decades the penguins on Phillip Island were largely unprotected from the throngs of sightseers but today most visitors observe the evening penguin parade from elevated boardwalks and viewing platforms to minimize disturbances to the birds For those who want a more upcloseandpersonal experience a limited number of tickets are available each day for small group rangerguided tours where you can walk among penguins on a secluded beach The ticket price helps support conservation work on the island including habitat restoration and research focusing on how penguins are affected by climate change development and invasive species Phillip Island is a 90minute drive from Melbourne but plan on spending at least a couple of days here to enjoy all its wildlife including koalas wallabies elusive anteaters seals and whales Phillip Island Nature Park prices start at US 23 for evening viewing from a platform 46 for closeup viewing and 8250 for a private rangerguided ecoadventure in a part of the penguin colony thats closed to the general public Cape Town South Africa The southern tip of Africa offers numerous opportunities to view the African penguin previously known as the jackass penguin because of its distinctive donkeylike bray African penguins have declined by 80 in the past 50 years because of pollution development climate change and irresponsible tourism activities The Boulders Beach colony about 24 miles from Cape Town was only established in 1983 but its now an important habitat for the endangered bird As its name suggests the beach is strewn with granite boulders which create an impressive backdrop for photographing the penguins Today boardwalk viewing areas help protect the birds from excessive human contact although you may encounter penguins while swimming and should take care not to approach them if possible A ride on the wild side in Tanzania Boulders Beach is part of Table Mountain National Park situated at the convergence of the Atlantic and Indian oceans on the Cape of Good Hope Hiking mountain biking wind sailing and wildlife viewing are just a few of the activities here that offer impressive views of Cape Town and the surrounding countryside The nearby village of Simons Town with its historic cottages and cobblestone streets provides numerous accommodation and dining options Table Mountain National Park visitors to the park pay a daily conservation fee of US 530 per adult and 250 per child Otago Peninsula New Zealand Even in a country known for its dramatic scenery and amazing wildlife the Otago Peninsula stands out Located on New Zealands South Island the peninsula was born of volcanic eruptions that created steep mountains and rugged sea cliffs Its a hot spot for marine wildlife

surprise to most travelers that a trip to the Galapagos could include the chance to see penguins But in fact the islands are home to the only penguin that lives in a tropical climate Unlike other species that migrate according to the season endangered Galapagos penguins live here yearround especially in the colder waters of the western islands such as Isla Isabela Almost any tour of the Galapagos includes the chance to see an incredible variety of wildlife but some operators specifically offer penguin tours More likely than not youll be observing the birds from a boat but if the tour includes snorkeling in an area frequented by penguins theres a chance that you could end up swimming with the birds Southern Exploration a member of the International Ecotourism Society is one tour operator that offers the chance to see penguins at close range However since the Galapagos National Park Service restricts tourists to specific areas and may limit access depending on conditions its best to contact tour operators directly to confirm that youll be able to see penguins on your trip Talk through the options carefully with the booking agent to make sure your expectations will be met Southern Explorations four to 15day Galapagos cruising tours with an Englishspeaking guide start at around US 3000 up to about 6000 including the flight from Quito to the Galapagos Ask to speak to a

filled the caldera or ringlike indentation left after the explosion creating the deepest lake 592 meters 1943 feet in the United States In winter snowshoeing expeditions give a peek into the wilds of this natural wonder But make sure to visit this beauty in the summertime too when more of the Crater Lake National Park is accessible A twohour trolley tour circles the rim of the lake and allows visitors four scheduled stops Hop aboard a summer lake cruise weather permitting and catch a glimpse of the famed Old Man of the Lake a large tree stump that has been floating vertically in the cold water for nearly a century Bicyclists rave about the 33mile loop around the rim of Crater Lake but be warned that the route features steep climbs and brilliant views in equal portion Crater Lake Lodge

behemoth lives in the north end of Giant Forrest in Sequoia National Park California and towers about 84 meters 275 feet high At its base this giant is about 31 meters 103 feet around roughly equal to fourteen and a half Shaquille ONeals lying headtofoot around the base of the tree Despite its impressive height and width it is not the tallest or widest tree around Instead its distinction as the largest living tree is judged by the volume of its huge trunk  52500 cubic feet  Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks lie adjacent to each other in the southern Sierra Nevada and make a wonderful playground no matter the season In May Crystal Cave a large naturallyforged underground cave with streampolished rock formations and large marble rooms opens to the public In the winter book a room at

with ice storms and snow days plan a getaway to the hottest lowest place in the United States Death Valley It may sound like a depressing destination but this place boasts some of the most adaptable plant and animal life on the planet Death Valley is 86 meters 282 feet below sea level and was formed when movement in the earths crust along a fault line caused the land to sink From Telescope Peak the highest mountain in the national park at 11049 feet to the Badwater Basin floor is nearly a twomile drop twice the depth of the Grand Canyon The average rainfall for the area is less than 2 inches per year A record high of 134F 57C was recorded in Death Valley on July 10 1913 The park is open yearround but guided ranger tours are available only in the cooler months from November to April and they are a great way to learn more about the geology and history of this fascinating desert Full Moon festivals available in the cooler months of the year give visitors the opportunity to see how this

than Mauna Kea a dormant volcano in Hawaii that when measured from the ocean floor is taller than Mount Everest the worlds highest mountain by altitude From its oceanfloor base Mauna Kea measures more than 10000 meters about 33000 feet or a little more than six miles Historically the summit of Mauna Kea has been considered a spiritual place to native Hawaiians and only royalty and tribal chiefs were allowed to visit Today the summit is still spiritually relevant for many people but thousands of visitors make the arduous trip each year to visit observatories perched at the summit Every night regardless of weather the Visitor Information Station at the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy holds a free public stargazing program Book a room at the Shipman House Bed and Breakfast and

structure at Rainbow Bridge National Monument in Utah is estimated to be more than 200 million years old and it stands 88 meters 290 feet tall Rainbow Bridge is considered to be the highest natural land bridge in the United States and its name hints at the unique color striations formed from layers of different types of sandstone which became hardened and fused together by wild fluctuations in the climate through the Triassic and Jurassic periods Geologists estimate that several million years ago heavy rains and a rising river gradient swept through the area cutting wide swaths through the watersoluble sandstone and creating many interesting shapes in the landscape Today most visitors gawk at the bridge from a viewing platform but some folks may backpack along the Navajo Mountain trail once theyve acquired the appropriate permit from the Navajo Nation Lake Powell a reservoir of the Colorado River that straddles the border between Utah and Arizona is relatively nearby and provides access by boat to the famous land bridge One of the best ways to experience the spectacular landscape is to rent a houseboat and navigate Lake Powell via the more than 2000 miles of shoreline The

science class Some of these sites are challenging to get to others are busy tourist destinations They keep natural scientists searching for answers and the rest of us astounded by the secrets and mysteries the world continues to reveal Blood Falls Antarctica Most people wont see Blood Falls in person but even in photographs the sight is arresting a bloodred waterfall staining the snowwhite face of Taylor Glacier The place was documented in 1911 by geographergeologist Thomas Griffith Taylor a member of Robert Falcon Scotts illfated expedition to the Antarctic Scott named the glacier for Taylor 8 very old sites in the New World Since then glaciologists and microbiologists have sought to determine what causes the mysterious red flow Theyve concluded that the source is a subterranean lake rich in the iron that gives the water its red hue Stranger still recent research has revealed microorganisms living 1300 feet beneath the ice sustained by the iron and sulfur in the water Magnetic Hill Moncton New Brunswick What could possibly cause an automobile to roll backward uphill without power A magnetic force from within the Earth Something even more fantastic Since the 1930s when the phenomenon of Magnetic Hill was discovered and almost immediately promoted as a tourist attraction people have been trying to figure out its riddle Even though its been demonstrated that the

15 ancient ruins you might not know Surtsey Iceland When people try to convince you theres nothing new under the sun direct them to the Icelandic island of Surtsey Before 1963 it didnt exist Then an underwater volcano in the Westman Islands Vestmannaeyjar erupted and when the activity settled down in 1967 what remained was an island where no island had been before At its largest Surtsey measured about 1 square mile but wind and water have eroded the volcanic matter to a little more than half that size Presented with this unsullied environment the Icelandic government determined that the best thing to do was preserve it Thus although you can sail past it on a Westman Islands day cruise Surtsey remains offlimits to just about everyone except marine biologists geologists botanists and other scientists conducting research there 8 elegant US mansion hotels Moeraki Boulders New Zealand Large spherical boulders  some measuring 12 feet in circumference  are scattered on Koekohe Beach on the east coast of New Zealands South Island They formed millions of years ago on the ancient sea floor collecting and hardening sediment and minerals around a core such as a fossil or a shell similar to the way oysters form pearls Theyre not the worlds only examples of what geologists call septarian concretions You can also visit the Koutu Boulders near Hokianga Harbour on the northwestern coast of New Zealands North Island for example Yet the Moeraki Boulders are some of the worlds largest The particulars of their origin and what caused the distinctive cracks inside them are still being studied Midnight sun Spitsbergen Norway From April 20 to August 23 the sun never sets over Svalbard a Norwegian archipelago that lies north of Greenland in the Arctic Sea The phenomenon plays havoc with everyones body clocks Is it noon Is it midnight After a day or two its hard to tell Among the northernmost yet stillaccessible places to experience the midnight sun is Spitsbergen the largest island in the group The island is wellsuited and accommodating to travelers who tend to keep strange hours in summer and who soon understand why their hotel rooms have been fitted with darkening curtains Pamukkale Turkey What appears to be a Doctor Zhivagostyle snowy landscape in southwestern Turkey is actually the result of calcium carbonate deposits from 17 natural hot springs accumulating over thousands of years Beginning in the late second century BC this area near presentday Denizli was a destination for those who sought the therapeutic benefits of the mineralrich water whose temperature reaches upward of 100 degrees Fahrenheit Today you can see remnants of the baths at the ancient holy city of Hierapolis but its the stunning terraces cliffs and petrified white waterfalls of Pamukkale  Turkish for Cotton Palace  that give it remarkable natural beauty Racetrack Playa Death Valley California How ordinary stones manage to sail over the surface of Racetrack Playa in Death Valley National Park is a mystery people have tried to solve since 1915 when a prospector and his wife noticed tracks that seemed to indicate that the stones had somehow traveled across the dry earth Short of cosmic intervention the stones required terrestrial forces to move them But what forces The current prevailing theory about the sailing stones of Racetrack Playa presented by a team of physicists in 2011 involves ice that forms around the stones causing them to move and to leave a trail in their wake Many visitors still hope for a more mystical explanation Eternal Flame Falls Orchard Park New York Behind the cascade of a small waterfall in the Shale Creek Preserve section of Chestnut Ridge Park in suburban Buffalo New York you might see what appears to be an optical illusion a flickering golden flame Actually youll smell it before you see it and amazingly its real fueled by what geologists call a macroseep of natural gas from the Earth below A geological fault in the shale allows about 1 kilogram of methane gas per day to escape to the surface where at some point possibly the early 20th century a visitor had the idea to set it alight The water occasionally extinguishes the flame but theres always another hiker with a lighter to reignite it Old Faithful Yellowstone National Park Wyoming Yellowstone National Park claims the highest concentration of geysers of any place on Earth Geysers are hot springs with plumbing challenges that result in eruptions More than 300 can be found throughout the parks 3472 square miles and none is more famous than Old Faithful In fact Old Faithful is the reason Yellowstone was designated a National Park  the first in the United States  in 1872 Its name comes from the perceived regularity of its eruptions which occur every 55 to 120 minutes and last for two to five minutes The spectacular eruptions remain a source of fascination for the more than 35 million people who visit Yellowstone each year The fact that the eruptions arent quite as regular as they might seem  and that the mean eruption interval seems to be lengthening  keeps geologists fascinated too Relampago de Catatumbo Ologa Venezuela Thanks to its humidity its elevation and the clash of winds from the mountains and the sea the southwestern corner of Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela has the worlds highest frequency of lightning activity 250 flashes per square kilometer per year More than 200 nights per year with peaks in May and October lightning flashes fill the sky  sometimes 25 or more flashes per minute To put that in perspective The National Weather

CNN,travel, CNN  Look out NASCAR one of the worlds fastest motor sports wants to steal your fans Were talking about air racing where powerful small planes compete on a looped path in the air reaching speeds between 200500 mph This thrilling sport is just as fast as NASCAR IndyCars and Formula One But with the added vertical dimension the action seriously amps up In Hollywood terms its Top GunmeetsDays of ThundermeetsStar Wars Its not quite the podracers that raced in The Phantom Menace but its pretty intense Picture these planes streaking across the landscape at only 80 feet above the ground Thats about the same height as a sevenstory building Dangerous Perhaps Some people might go one step further and call it nuts This aint new Its been going on since France hosted the first air race in 1909 In the United States races started a year later and gained momentum in the 1920s drawing pilots thrill seekers and aviation enthusiasts Related story Excitement speed key to air racing appeal Three years ago a deadly plane crash at the Reno National Championship Air Races raised new safety questions about the sport Now insiders say these events are safer and poised for growth This weekend some of the worlds best air racers are competing in an international air race series owned by Red Bull at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway a few miles north of the Strip  In Red Bulls version of air racing planes rocket around a loop one at a time The pilot who can complete the course in the least amount of time wins Red Bull is holding races this year in Europe Asia America and the Middle East Its very analogous to dogfighting says race director Jimmy DiMatteo referring to the deadly midair combat ballet between two fighter planes Its the exact same skill set DiMatteo knows what hes talking about Hes a retired captain and former instructor at the Navys famous fighter pilot school unofficially known as Top Gun And it shows  right down to the way he talks This former F14 Tomcat driver loves to talk about angle of attack proficiency level and pulling Gs It is those G forces that are so important to surviving this sport When these planes make breathtaking turns theyre being radically pulled and pushed in ways that can challenge the structure of the aircraft and the health of the pilot Some pilots report pulling as many as 10Gs during races equivalent to 10 times the force of gravity The pilots are flying extremely aggressive in very tight locations DiMatteo says For most sports fans Its not something youve ever seen before The planes fly so low that spectators who sit in the grandstand nosebleed seats will actually be able to look DOWN on the planes as they shoot by The course includes inflatable 82foot pylons Pilots are supposed to fly between these pylons Theyre not supposed to hit them But sometimes  traveling at 230 mph  it happens When you hit them under a humongous amount of Gs then it can be a little bit exciting says pilot Kirby Chambliss Basically you slice through like a hot knife through butter Just BOOM  and youre through it The pilots are racing against time but its hard to keep an eye on the clock while youre twisting and turning through the gates Chambliss says his Zivko Edge 540 aircraft doesnt have any kind of special headup display in front of the windshield that would let him keep his eyes forward while watching his time Widely described as one of the worlds greatest stunt pilots and racing aviators Chambliss won Red Bulls Air Race championship in 2004 and 2006 Flying comes so naturally to this guy that he says he feels like his planes wings are nothing but an extension of my arms The key to winning pilots say is pulling through the turns fast  but not so fast that you lose speed Its a delicate balance that DiMatteo says good fighter pilots share with champion air racers Nonetheless that doesnt mean you have to be an exfighter jockey to excel Chambliss has never flown in the military He graduated to air racing after piloting Boeing 737s for Southwest Airlines Before that I loved motocross as a kid Chambliss said I was always a speed junky The Red Bull series launched in 2003 but by the end of the decade rising speeds and scary aerobatics were making race organizers nervous So beginning in 2011 they put the series on pause to regroup This year its back with new safety restrictions limiting how low pilots can fly and banning certain trick maneuvers The rules surrounding air races differ In the United States one of the oldest events is the national championship in Reno where multiple planes race each other around a circuit The first pilot across the finish line wins The 2011 crash at Reno raised serious questions about safety During a sixlap race a modified World War IIera P51 Mustang flying at about 500 mph went out of control and collided with an airport ramp in the spectator seating area The pilot and 10 people were killed and 64 others were hurt Investigators blamed deteriorated parts that contributed to fatigue cracks that led to the crash Related story Speed worn parts contributed to Reno crash The tragedy led to new Federal Aviation Administration rules requiring all air racing organizations to go through a standardized safety accreditation process They check the capability skill set and training of the pilots says DiMatteo They also monitor aircraft maintenance and the mechanics who work on the planes They really look at the full scope of your operation The 2011 Reno crash was believed to be the first in the 50year history of the event to kill spectators Last month during a Reno qualifying race a former champion was killed when his experimental Backovich GP5 aircraft crashed away from spectator seating bringing the total deaths at Reno events to 20 since the races began in 1964 Red Bull boasts zero deaths in the 11 years since the series began and only one pilot injury from a crash into a river during an Australian practice run in 2010 Our record shows that weve been doing a good job  knock on wood DiMatteo says Its actually safer than some of these other sports that are out there A newcomer to the sport might assume racing with other planes  as they do in Reno  would be more dangerous than racing one at a time Not necessarily says John Cudahy president of the International Council of Air Shows an industry trade organization  I wouldnt say one is inherently safer than the other Cudahy says They each have a different set of safety challenges and theyve addressed them for the most part pretty successfully The Reno planes are in some cases older  but the Red Bull pilots participate in pretty aggressive aerobatics Its strongest supporters believe American air racing can one day rival the popularity of NASCAR Last years NASCAR Sprint Series drew nearly 70 million unique TV viewers in the United States according to NASCAR In 2009 the Red Bull Air Race was televised in more than 180 countries reaching more

CNN,travel, WrightPatterson Air Force Base Ohio CNN  It looks like an upsidedown bathtub with wings pretty odd for a spy jet that was among the nations most highly classified pieces of military hardware As I stand in front of the plane codenamed Tacit Blue at the National Museum of the US Air Force near Dayton Ohio Im reminded that it still holds a bit of mystery Engineers made fun of Tacit Blues design by nicknaming it the Whale but the program  declassified in 1996  was deadly serious It was all about stealth Pentagon Cold War strategists desperately wanted to build planes that could evade Soviet radar And so the Air Force launched a black program to develop Tacit Blue and tested it at a secret government airbase in Nevada called Area 51 according to CIA documents released in 2013 The program which lasted from 1978 to 1985 aimed to develop a singleseater jet for battlefield surveillance Before last years document release the government never acknowledged the existence of Area 51 For decades a fencedoff area surrounding Nevadas Groom Lake was rumored to be a testing ground for some of the nations most secret technology Two retired Air Force test pilots who flew Tacit Blue in the early 1980s Ken Dyson and Russ Easter spoke about why this plane was important and what set it apart Although the plane flew 135 times and was never put into production without Tacit Blue there would have been no B2 Spirit bomber The plane proved that aircraft with curved surfaces could evade radar The airplane flew pretty solid Id say Dyson remembered Could sightings of Tacit Blue have contributed to UFO reports Im not aware of any circumstance like that Easter said Dyson also says no But Cynda Thomas widow of the first Tacit Blue test pilot Richard G Dick Thomas said she was with her husband in Los Angeles when an airline pilot accosted her husband during a test pilots banquet at the Beverly Hilton As she remembers it The pilot came over and he said Mr Thomas Im soandso and I fly for Continental and Im sure I saw you flying the Tacit Blue  and you know I reported you as a UFO  Airline pilots have over the past reported some stuff that could have been black aircraft in flight tests Dyson said One and a half Tacit Blue planes were built Dyson said so that if we lost one we could have a second one up and flying in short order What happened to the other half of Tacit Blue I think it was done away with  with total respect to secrecy Mechanical remnants from a related black program called Have Blue are buried at Groom Lake according to a 2011 Air Force report Groom Lake is inside Area 51 according to those released CIA documents I dont know anything at all about that Have Blue stuff and wouldnt answer it if I did said Dyson who also tested Have Blue airplanes Dyson is aware of the CIA documents but said he didnt want to talk about Groom Lake or Area 51 or to even mention those places by name Thats just because of the secrecy that was drilled into me he said Maintaining Tacit Blues secrets and preventing leaks Dyson said was proof of the success of a tightly knit and dedicated team Pursuing a career centered around a secret job takes discipline My wife had no clue what I was doing for a long time Dyson said I just didnt talk about it to her or to anyone else who wasnt cleared on the program It just wasnt done Richard Thomas also kept details about his work from his family Cynda Thomas said although in 1978 he did reveal to her that he was going into the black world Secrecy made professional relationships complicated at times Associates outside Dysons and Easters secret circle wanted to hear war stories about what it was like to work in the world of black programs Easter said Sometimes I wish we could tell more stories more freely so that some of the lessons learned could be passed on freer 50 states 50 spots to visit in 2014 Three unique things about Tacit Blue,0.4
CNN,travel, CNN  Bob Lyon remembers the day he met Howard Hughes He also recalls when Hughes nearly crashed a plane into his boyhood home Nearly 40 years after Hughes died Lyons life still crosses paths with the eccentric billionaire  Lyon has found himself in the center of a dispute over Hughes gigantic bizarre wooden seaplane nicknamed the Spruce Goose This thing is arguably the worlds most famous airplane and  at five stories tall with a wingspan longer than a football field  one of the biggest on the planet Related Stalking the worlds biggest planes The Spruce Gooses home is a respected aviation museum which is part of an investigation by the state of Oregon Heres the story In 1992 Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum in McMinnville Oregon struck a halfmilliondollar deal with Aero Club of Southern California to buy the legendary plane Lyon  who represents Aero Club  is now negotiating the planes final payment which he estimates at about 50000 For Lyon this is way more than everyday business This plane was a part of my life said Lyon 77 I saw it being built I saw it being put together Unfortunately negotiations have hit a snag More on that in a minute First you gotta know about the amazing story surrounding the plane and the man who flew it Its official name was the H4 Hughes called it the Hercules Designed to carry more than 700 troops the Spruce Goose flew only once In 1947 in Long Beach harbor it grabbed about 70 feet of air for about a mile Hughes  who piloted the test flight  said it needed more development He never let it fly again Was the flight a failure as some newspapers suggested Depends on who you ask Hughes did prove the thing could fly But it was never officially certified Lawmakers hauled Hughes before a congressional committee to justify the planes taxpayer price tag of 22 million Hughes pointed out that he had spent an additional 18 million of his own funds to develop the plane Fearless rogue pilot When Lyon met Hughes it wasnt the OCDplagued naked bearded recluse portrayed near the end of Martin Scorseses The Aviator This was before that This was a younger Hughes  the seemingly fearless rogue pilot and entrepreneur who was hellbent on success for his aircraft manufacturing company Lyon was then 10 years old Hughes seemed like a likable person when they met at the office of Lyons father  who was Hughes patent lawyer Id never seen a tall lanky guy with a Texas accent before he remembers I grew up in Southern California In July 1946 the young Lyon had a more memorable brush with the man when Hughes crashed a prototype reconnaissance plane a block away from his parents Beverly Hills home The boy arrived at the crash scene to see a fire a huge column of black smoke and what was left of three damaged houses No one was killed but Lyon saw an ambulance driver help transport a seriously injured victim That turned out to be Howard Hughes he said Soon other neighborhood kids descended on the scene and started grabbing small pieces of wreckage and running off with them as souvenirs Lyon remembers police canvassing the neighborhood looking for the missing debris My brother and I were upstairs and my mother went to the front door and there were two officers from the Beverly Hills police department asking Do you have any young children in this house She yelled upstairs to us saying Do you have some pieces of that airplane We said No And she said Yes I think you do Bring them down here The police are here and they want them So we pulled this piece of metal out from underneath my brothers bed and took it downstairs Lyon recalled with a chuckle We thought that was highly unfair That same year Lyon watched trucks roll the Spruce Goose down local streets from the planes construction site on Los Angeles west side to Long Beach They cut telephone and power lines to get this huge thing down the road Hughes died in 1976 at age 70 and by the early 1980s the Spruce Goose was forced to move out of its giant Long Beach hangar The planes owners  including Hughes Summa Corp and the US government  gave the plane to the Aero Club The transfer forestalled tax expenses and the prospect of cutting the plane into pieces for display at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington The Aero Clubs mission in this whole thing was to save the Spruce Goose said Lyon The club leased the plane to a company as a tourist attraction Spruce Goose was moved a short distance away to a spectacular seaside dome next to the moored luxury liner Queen Mary Around that time during a celebration dinner Lyon arrived late to what was supposed to be an escorted tour of the plane He took the liberty of exploring it alone Lyon who also has an engineering degree and a pilots license said it was like being a kid in a candy store He wandered inside one of the aircrafts gigantic wings amazed at the planes engineering He climbed up a set of stairs into the cockpit daring to sit in the pilot seat where Hughes flew the plane in 1947 I noted that there were controls for the pilot but none for the copilot Lyon said with a chuckle Yeah Howard was gonna fly it He didnt need any help Eventually the Spruce Goose had to leave the dome Thats when Aero Club struck a bargain with Evergreen and the behemoth was floated up the West Coast on barges in a spectacular 138day moving operation to Oregon Now Lyon is piloting Aero Clubs negotiations for the planes final payment The dispute said Lyon basically comes down to a payment formula and the interpretation of three words justifiable operating expense Its a problem of contract interpretation Lyon said News media reports have overstated the negotiations worstcase scenario he explained Were not interested in repossessing it It would be a nightmare For its part the museum agrees with Lyon  both sides expect a prompt resolution of that payment the museum said in a statement Although the museum declined CNNs requests for an interview the museums statement said the facility remains open is financially viable and has no plans to close Bottom line museumgoers  which number around 150000 a year  have nothing to fear Lyon said The Spruce Goose is going to stay where it is The museum is no danger of losing the Spruce Goose echoed Evergreen spokeswoman Melissa Grace in a statement It will stay at its home at the museum for visitors to enjoy for years to come But the museum faces another financial issue For months the Evergreen museum and a related organization called the Captain Michael Smith Educational Institute have been part of an investigation by Oregons Justice Department Agency spokesman Michael Kron said the investigation was sparked by people who were concerned about financial transactions by Evergreen The museum owner holds companies that are forprofit and some that are nonprofit There have been allegations of improper transfer of funds between the two types of companies The museum said it is independent selfsufficient and nonprofit Kron describes the probe as a charitable activities investigation into the charity that runs the museum Recently a broker listed two of the museums plane exhibits  a 1945 Grumman Avenger for 250000 and a 1928 Ford TriMotor  for 175 million Its unknown if the museums decision to sell the planes is linked to its financial issues The vast majority of the museums aircraft exhibits it said are unaffected by issues linked to the investigation Evergreen said most of the planes on display at the museum are on loan from some of the best aviation museums in the world including the National Museum of the US Air Force the Smithsonian Institution National Air and Space Museum and the National Naval Aviation Museum The museum says its in no danger of losing its displays from these and other sources and it has cooperated with the Department of Justice in its review and that we are confident the Department of Justice would acknowledge our cooperation and the good work we have put into addressing concerns it has raised Kron said a final investigation report is expected to be made public soon Meanwhile Lyon is nearing the finish line as a custodian of this aviation icon During the two decades since the Spruce Goose deal was struck hes never traveled to Oregon to see the plane But he said who knows When its all said and done he may fly up for a visit ,0.4

CNN,travel, CNN  Kenji Croman has broken bones dislocated his shoulder and elbow endured concussions and nearly drowned several times Hes also had three close encounters with sharks over the years A 10foot wave landed directly on top of him five years ago bending his body to the point that he actually kicked himself in the head I literally heard every bone in my body crack he said 29 beach photos thatll make you drool Croman has been photographing ocean waves since 2008 sometimes risking his life to get that perfect shot at the surf break Despite the risks and inevitable injuries that come with wave photography the Hawaii resident body surfer and former competitive swimmer wouldnt do anything else The 36yearold photographer loves the thrill of meeting the barrel of a wave head on shooting waves as his passion and shooting surfers to pay the bills Some of his business involves creating Instagram promotions for Dos Equis Maui Sunrise Shells and other companies He has been able to shoot some of the most beautiful and untouched beaches in South America and Mexico through a Kickstarter fundraising campaign But most of his wave photos are taken close to home His favorite moment When the sun rises at Sandy Beach in Oahu Hawaii but the waves there are good at any hour What Croman loves about waves is how each one is unpredictable and as unique as a fingerprint And he captures waves from an angle that allows spectators to see them breaking in slow motion as he does The process of photographing waves requires more than just swimming out to where the surf breaks and waiting he says The night before a photo shoot Croman checks Surflinecom a website and streaming coastal HD camera network that provides live and predicted ocean weather information to see what the winds waves and tide will be like at certain times If the winds are blowing offshore this creates nice barrels and usually better conditions than if the winds are blowing onshore Croman has both a primary camera and a backup for emergencies He goes without a wetsuit but wears fins and uses heavy duty underwater housing to protect his camera There is no great way for him to protect himself He admits there is probably protective gear he should be wearing but there is little he could have done to decrease the impact of the 10foot wave that crashed on top of him Croman was rushed to the hospital where his doctor initially thought he had broken his neck His neck was fine but he was hospitalized for a week and spinal fluid leaked out of his ear he says The hardest part of Cromans job is staying calm in the face of breaking waves when his initial instinct is to panic and swim away He once risked his life to shoot a 25foot wave but the resulting photo looked like a threefoot wave he says The 25foot rock in the background didnt give it the right depth you need to show how big the wave was Croman studies the swells searching for patterns and trying to time when a wave will break At most Croman will take two to three shots of a single wave Ive shot waves for so many years now that I see the wave in slow motion he said Travel photos we wish wed taken Blood Falls and more natural oddities ,0.4

CNN,travel, ROOTS OUR JOURNEYS HOME is a new series featuring Anthony Bourdain Anderson Cooper and other familiar CNN faces It kicks off Sunday October 12 with a twohour primetime special airing Monday October 20 at 9 pm ET More show info here  CNN  This is the house my mom asks turning around Yes says our guide This is where your grandmother was born My mother and I have traveled more than 6000 miles to explore Candia Canavese a tiny village outside Torino Italy founded in the fifth century Were here to learn more about our heritage and get a sense of where her family is from Were not the first ones to visit for that reason Even though Candia Canavese has a population of just 1200 our guide says plenty of other travelers have come searching for records data photos and that intangible sense of history you cant get without visiting a place yourself Interest in genealogy appears to be at an alltime high with a recent Harris Interactive Survey indicating that four in five Americans wish to learn more about their family history Shows like CNNs upcoming Roots Our journeys home along with series Who do You Think You Are and Finding Your Roots are gaining in popularity People see these programs and they want that experience for themselves says Michelle Ercanbrack family historian at Ancestrycom As a result she says more travelers are looking to incorporate family history research into a trip or even plan a standalone journey for the sole purpose of discovering their roots Want to embark on your own family tree trip Here are some tips and techniques to help smooth the process Get your history organized before you leave If youre spending the time and money to get to a farflung destination you dont want to spend your visit stuck in a library or office Its more rewarding to get your history organized before you leave Start with what you know and build your tree online says Ercanbrack Sites like Ancestrycom Familysearchorg and Genealogycom can get you on the right track while genealogy research site Cyndislistcom has a comprehensive collection of useful links For example Ancestrycom has 14 billion searchable indexed records  everything from passenger records to census data and more Remember online records can build the branches but there will be holes  things you cant find because of records loss or privacy details Ercanbrack adds Beyond just building out a family tree skeleton online its also wise to create a historical timeline before your trip A snapshot of the familys movements will help you see holes easier For example start with one family member  say a grandparent  and create a timeline of where and when they were born where they lived went to school were married and so forth Writing things down in a narrative fashion can help you pinpoint gaps like when a child might have been born or a family member emigrated MORE Finding your roots Let them know youre coming Regardless if where in the world family history travel takes you it helps to get in touch with a few locals before you arrive People worth contacting include librarians city clerks museum officers and clergy Giving information in advance helps a researcher flag potential documents and can maximize time on the ground while visiting Prior to our Italy trip my mother and I got in touch with the innkeeper at the one hotel in the village to inquire about an Italianspeaking guide to help us Our host went above and beyond  as it turns out his family had lived in the village for generations and knew all the people we needed to speak to Because we sent information requests with family names and dates in advance by the time we arrived he had already laid the groundwork and we had appointments with the priest and the city clerks office That allowed us to spend a good chunk of our time wandering the streets taking in the ambiance and imagining how my greatgrandmothers family lived Onsite research Tombstones and immigration offices Sure you may have to spend time browsing through old boxes and files searching for documents but there are countless of other places to find data while visiting a location Visiting the place is where you do the finishing touches says Ercanbrack Cemeteries Local cemeteries often provide locationbased details you wont find in other files such as place of death They can also turn up details on previously unknown family members or even children that died as infants and were never recorded Ercanbrack offers a great tip for getting details off a worn headstone Shine a flashlight directly above the headstone to cast a shadow on engravings  you can then take a picture of the shadow Its far more effective than using the paperrubbingwithcharcoal technique you see so often in the movies  that can actually permanently damage the headstone Immigration offices Passport applications and naturalization records can be information goldmines as they often include detailed information on family records places of residence and work MilitaryVA Offices Military pension records also are crammed with data including dates and location of service awards and recognition and time spent overseas Note that these might be harder to access and there are privacy issues concerning release of some statistics but worth investigating By the end of our journey we discovered new details previously blank on the family tree More importantly we felt connected to a place that was previously just a spot on the map As Alex Haley author of Roots so eloquently put it In all of us there is a hunger marrowdeep to know our heritage  to know who we are and where we have come from Without this enriching knowledge there is a hollow yearning Author Aimee Cebulski has worked as a freelance writer and photographer for almost 15 years and currently calls San Diego California home She recently combined her love of travel new cultures and writing with release of The Finding 40 Project a book about women turning 40 years old around the world,0.4

CNN  When visiting Hawaii who doesnt imagine packing up and relocating to Americas tropical wonderland The epic sunshine and the rainbows the afternoons of shave ice on glorious beaches inspire millions to vacation in the Aloha State each year Before you sell off your belongings and pack your bags try to experience the islands like a true Hawaiian to see whether you have what it takes to handle all that paradise Leave your cell phone at the hotel and take off your watch Youre in Hawaii and everything moves at a slower pace Life is measured by the sun surf and simple pleasures Make time for a morning stroll through Oahus greenbelt to swim in Jackass Ginger Pool a natural swimming hole accessed from the Judd Memorial Trail a Sunday afternoon serenade at Molokai Coffee Plantation an impromptu swim in the ocean without so much as a nod in the direction of the sea turtles feeding by the nearby rocks 29 beach photos thatll make you drool Forget the overpriced resort food Locals know that the real ono grindz Hawaiian for yummy food comes from joints like Mauis Bullys Burgers on Piilani Highway the backroad to Hana 8088783272 or Oahus Nicos Pier 38 And dont bother forking over the big bucks for gourmet poke a delicacy of raw marinated ahi and onions Instead pick up the freshest ahi at local favorites like the Big Isles Da Poke Shack and Kauais Koloa Fish Market 8087426199 Hula is not mere bootyshaking Each movement of this ancient dance tells a multilayered story rich with meaning A hand toward the air might mean sky but can speak of a lost love To really feel like a Hawaiian sign up for a hula class Companies like Hawaii Hula Company teach private hula lessons for both locals and tourists on Oahu and Maui Accept it Hawaii is expensive Locals dont flinch at paying 10 for a quart of milk But if you excavate their kitchens youll spot heaps of headsized avocados grapefruits and lemons taking up space on the counter The key to shopping like a Hawaiian is making friends with both Costco and the farmers markets Oahus KCC Farmers Market Kapaas Wednesday afternoon market on Kauai and the Big Islands Saturday morning Keauhou Farmers Market are some of the best in the state Recordsetting natural wonders in the US Have a relationship with the ocean but respect its power Surfs up a swell hit the North Shore and suddenly shopkeepers lock their doors and head to the beach You want to join the crowds Check in with yourself Be honest about your abilities Only the most advanced surfers should take on winter north shore swells on any of the islands Newbies can learn on the more mellow summer waves or the easier waters at beaches like Mauis Kalama Park Party like the ancients A real luau is not some bigbudget affair held in a resort Usually families hold luaus for a first birthday party or major special event They often take place on the grassy knolls above a beach and feature lots of barbecued meats a large cooked pig poi an acquired taste even most locals cant stomach the bland pureed taro Molokai sweet potatoes lomilomi a salmon concoction that requires you to massage the fish and plenty of live music Rather than forking over the big bucks up to 100 a head at most resorts for a choreographed luau throw your own party Beaches like Oahus Ala Moana Kauais Anini Beach and Mauis Kamaole Beach Parks offer the perfect setting to celebrate life in the islands Spike a Drink like the natives Thirsty Dont bother hoofing it to the store Instead scale a palm tree grab a coconut return to your condo machete it open mix with rum and enjoy a seriously fresh cocktail If your tree climbing skills need some work Hawaii has its share of spirit makers Kauais Koloa Rum Mauis Ocean Vodka the Big Islands Kona Brewing Company they also have an outpost on Oahu and Maui Brewing Companys outstanding coconut porter all help enliven an evening Plus tours and tastings are offered at their facilities 22 cantmiss US beaches Traffic is a part of life in paradise too Its unavoidable these days Most islands save Molokai and Lanai are plagued with gridlock during the morning and afternoon commutes And its not just the tourists lining up to brave the Road to Hana The worst backups are on Honolulus highways and on Maui and Kauais thoroughfares into town At least if you have to be stuck in the car you can appreciate the beauty as you listen to local tunes on the public radio broadcasts Favorites include Kauais KKCR and the Big Islands KAPA radio Toss the socks Its all about the slippahs aloha shirts and board shorts on the islands The casual dress sure is appealing Getting dressed up in Hawaii means tossing on your aloha shirt though please dont get matching ones in his and hers and being adorned by a lei if its a special occasion or a large flower in a womans hair Typical island wear consists of shorts and Tshirts for just about everyone Learn at least a few words of the Hawaiian language To show respect learn a few words If nothing else know what a haole is a notalwaysnice way to refer to a mainlander or aloha which means hello goodbye and love makai the ocean side of the street and mauka the mountain side of the street which are common directional terms worth adding to your vocabulary However while on the islands dont start speaking in pidgin the Hawaiian dialect Thats the equivalent of going to England and trying to speak in a Cockney accent Incorporate the Aloha Spirit into your day Alohas a state of mind a series of actions not merely a word At its core it means treating the world and others like they are a part of you Living the Aloha Spirit involves sharing your kindness and wisdom your heart and your true self with your community Hawaiian people come together to help each other out whether that means cleaning up your trash or helping rebuild a house upended by a storm Getting into the community and giving rather than taking is the most rewarding way to be able to call yourself Hawaiian This can

CNN,travel, Editors note The City is a CNN special series that profiles the sustainable urban future of five cities over five days Watch the show every day during our special theme week starting Monday Aug 19 on World Business Today at 1300 GMT and Connect The World at 2000 GMT CNN  If youre of the opinion that the only thing better than viewing great art is owning it put these destinations on your travel itinerary Not only are they cities renowned for their beauty their museums and their architecture they are the sites of the worlds great art fairs From ancient objects to art that was conceived yesterday these carefully curated fairs offer the best of the best to their audiences Attending one is like walking through a museum where everything is for sale  to anyone with adequate funds Yet even if youre not equipped to buy you can still visit these fairs take part in the spectacle and feed your aspirations 5 train stations worth a stop Maastricht The Netherlands Held annually in Maastricht the European Fine Art Fair is the art fair by which all others are measured There is no other fair like it says Lawrence Steigrad a New York City fine art dealer who specializes in Old Master paintings At the fair in March he sold an 1810 painting by Dutch artist Nicolaas Baur to the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam Thats the level of shopper who attends this fair museum curators serious collectors and those who aspire to be serious collectors Calvin Klein and Kanye West are among those who have been spotted at the invitationonly preview day in recent years They come because the quality and authenticity of every piece  from antiquities to contemporary art  undergoes what is acknowledged in the art world to be the strictest vetting process of any art fair After the preview day the fair is open to all The ticket price is considerable but the chance to see and possibly purchase such art antiques and objects is extraordinary The next fair takes place March 1423 2014 and theres talk of launching a TEFAF Beijing fair as well Maastricht in the southern Netherlands near Belgium is known as a place where Amsterdam residents go for a weekend break The cafes and restaurants around Vrijthof Square are lively and comfortable Selexyz Dominicanen housed in a former Dominican church is one of the worlds most beautiful bookstores and the Bonnefantenmuseum is an excellent place to see art all year round The places where masterpieces are born London Ever since its debut four years ago Masterpiece London has been gaining a reputation as a miniTEFAF Installed in a specially built pavilion on the grounds of the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London Masterpiece specializes in fine art antiques and design and adds luxury goods  cars yachts watches and wines  to the mix of offerings Everything is vetted everything is expensive and Prince Harry was one of the VIP attendees in 2011 The list of exhibitors is hovering around 200 for this years fair which will take place June 26July 3 Yet the even newer fair that everyones talking about now is Frieze Masters an adjunct to Frieze London both of which will take place October 1720 While Frieze London showcases contemporary art Frieze Masters which premiered in 2012 is for everything pre21stcentury Last years exhibitors included 90 international dealers attendees included curators from around the world and sales included ancient Mesopotamian artifacts Renaissance marbles a couple of Picassos and a Joan Mir painting with an eightfigure asking price When youre in London its never hard to find great art to visit at the Victoria  Albert Museum the Tate Modern the British Museum or the Royal Academy of Arts Put the London Transport Museum on your list as well Its Poster Art 150  London Undergrounds Greatest Designs exhibition through October 27 features art that everyone can understand Gatsbys Gold Coast 8 grand estates Venice There are other biennial international art exhibitions but when people talk about the Biennale theyre talking about Venice This being an oddnumbered year the city is preparing the 55th Venice Biennale  a nearly sixmonthlong festival June 1 to November 24 with pavilions and art installations throughout the city An architecture Biennale runs in evennumbered years The Biennale seeps into every nook and cranny of the city and the year wont be the only odd thing about it For artists the chance to represent their countries at the Venice Biennale can be a careermaking moment The path to greatness isnt easy however and neither is the art which is typically conceptual avantgarde and often not to put too fine a point on it just plain weird Of the 88 nations represented by national pavilions 10 are exhibiting for the first time One is Bahamian artist Tavares Strachan whose installation includes a reenactment of Robert Pearys 1909 expedition to the North Pole The installation by Vincent JF Huang representing Tuvalu another firsttime participant involves suicidal penguins Sarah Sze will represent the United States with an installation called Triple Point Chinese artist Ai Weiwei is one of four international artists who will create the installation in the German pavilion At times it can seem that the Biennale is inescapable Whether thats good or bad depends on your taste If after seeing the newest of the new youre longing for a cleansing immersion in classical or decorative art the 11 museums of the Fondazione Musei Civici Venezia will satisfy you Basel Switzerland When it comes to art fairs that truly put their cities on the map Art Basel tops the list In 1970 three Basel gallery owners joined forces and invited their gallerist colleagues to Basel to exhibit the works of their current clients Ninety galleries from 10 countries exhibited more than 16000 people attended and with that one bold move Basel became a modern and contemporary art pilgrimage destination The 2012 Art Basel saw 300 galleries from 36 countries exhibiting and more than 65000 curators and collectors attending Its a happening  and no one whos passionate about contemporary art would miss it Art Basel is limited to 20th and 21st century art and the emphasis is on the new So yes youll see Warhol and the occasional Leger but youre more likely to encounter Cindy Sherman Phyllida Barlow Edward Ruscha and Takashi Murakami among the offerings and possibly among the attendees In addition to the gallery exhibitors there are installations of sitespecific artworks open to the public free of charge in the Art Parcours section of the fair The next Art Basel takes place June 1316 2013 With 40 museums to serve a population of around 165000 Basel rightly claims the title of Switzerlands culture capital Recently Kunstmuseum Basel has been welcoming crowds for its excellent Picasso retrospective through July 21 In nearby Weil am Rhein Germany the Vitra Design Museum is celebrating the work of American architect Louis Kahn through August 11 Just as thrilling to locals and sports fans alike the local soccer team FC Basel was the defending Swiss champion until they were defeated on Monday by Zurichbased club Grasshopper for the Swiss Cup title Miami Beach Florida Its not really cheating to include Art Basel Miami Beach on this list Yes the show is an offshoot of the original in Switzerland but as it approaches its 12th year Art Basel Miami Beach has earned its stripes in the art community  and not merely because it gives everyone an excuse to visit Florida in the winter The even newer Art Basel Hong Kong kicks off its inaugural show this month from May 23 to 26 Held at the Miami Beach Convention Center Art Basel Miami Beach features more than 200 exhibitors showcasing the work of some 4000 artists and competition to be included is fierce  close to 700 galleries applied to show at Art Basel Miami Beach last year As at the original Art Basel the focus here is on the new but in Miami Beach theres emphasis on artists and galleries from the United States and Latin America The Art Nova and Art Positions sections of the fair showcase recent works and young and emerging artists The Art Public section organized in cooperation with the Bass Museum of Art places art installations in Collins Park The next Art Basel Miami Beach takes place December 58 Miami and Miami Beach have a number of private art collections open to the public The

incumbent Mark Pryor The first screen on Cottons website is a plea for contributions that says Obamacare is so bad that Obama doesnt want it Tell him neither do I Fundraising schemes and campaign advertisements are central to Republican races in red and swing states around the country Republican confidence When Republican David Jolly beat Democrat Alex Sink in Floridas special election for the 13th Congressional District in March Republicans attributed the win in part to the health care law His Jollys victory shows that voters are looking for representatives who will fight to end the disaster of Obamacare Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and cochair Sharon Day said in an email blast to reporters after the results were tallied The deeppocketed group Americans for Prosperity is playing in dozens of races around the country and its sole weapon is Obamacare We do want to make sure that Obamacare is the number one issue in the country Tim Phillips president of AFP said in a recent interview The organization backed by the wealthy partisans David and Charles Koch has already spent more than 30 million this election cycle and plans to spend a great deal more to ensure that Democrats have to explain their support of the law Public opinion Republicans believe they have a winning issue insisting that Americans are opposed to the law And most polling is on their side According to the most recent survey conducted just over a week ago by CBS News 53 of Americans gave the law a thumbs down compared to 41 saying they approve of it Thats in line with most polls But that could be starting to change A Kaiser Family Foundation poll released last week found that the gap between approval and disapproval of the law narrowed to 8 points And a new Washington PostABC poll out Monday found that 49 support the law compared to 48 who dont Public action While polls are indicative of voter opinion they dont indicate voter action What does however is enthusiasm and Republicans have that on their side In a midterm election when people are less likely to vote voter turnout is critical and Obamacare gives Republicans an advantage This data pretty clearly shows that even though attitudes regarding the ACA are baked in with voters 68 feel strongly one way or another about the issue the intensity is clearly on the negative side as GOP voters clearly dislike the new law more than Democrats are in love with it said GOP pollster Neil Newhouse a cofounder of Public Opinion Strategies Voter apathy is a challenge that Democrats must overcome Republican strategy Invoke doubt Republicans are hitting a nerve when it comes to Obamacare They are appealing to their bases mistrust in the President Republican Sen John Barrasso on Fox News Sunday alleged the administration is cooking the books regarding the programs rollout numbers This includes the latest number that more than 6 million have enrolled And Republicans constantly raise questions Who are the people enrolling and did they have health insurance beforehand Obamacare was pushed by the President and passed by Congress in 2010 with no Republican support as a way to narrow the gap between those with coverage and the tens of millions without it White House spokesperson Jay Carney said Republicans are grasping at straws as the law takes hold and people begin to see benefits I know it leaves them with the need to go back to the drawing board when it comes to other means of trying to attack a law that is providing opportunity and security to millions of Americans Carney said Republican risks Pounding an issue into the ground does bring some risks  voter annoyance A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that 53 of Americans are tired of hearing about the law Republican pollster Whit Ayers said theres a more powerful factor in voter fatigue Obama himself Six years into a Presidents term people get tired of that persons leadership he said Especially this Presidents Democrats challenge The goal is to get Democrats to the polls Democrats however have a more complicated role that consists largely of defense While they are being attacked on the campaign trail over the law they have decided to respond in a multipart way by saying that some of the law is great but some parts need to be fixed Thats exactly what endangered Democrats including Sens Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Alaskas Mark Begich did when they and several colleagues penned an oped laying out the parts of the law that they said need to be changed Rep Steve Israel chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee an organization that works to elect Democrats to Congress is fighting back by highlighting the cost of repeal The organization is telling stories of people who live in districts with contested congressional races who say they could not afford health coverage without the Affordable Care Act Americans do not want to repeal the ACA and go back to the days when insurance companies had free rein over health care they want it fixed and improved But this Republican Congress is obsessed with a repeal that will force hardworking families into bankruptcy and let insurance companies deny care and drop coverage Israel said Its a difficult way to convince people to turn out to vote even if public opinion drastically changes in favor of the law In the March Florida special election in a swing district in a swing state the only test case analysts have to monitor in the current political climate Sink embraced only parts of the law She also talked about what needs to be fixed a strategy that didnt work But as of now Democrats dont want to be talking about it Thats why they are focusing on economic issues such as minimum wage and equal pay for women New York Sen Chuck Schumer who is a member of Senate Democratic leadership said people arent focused on Obamacare Most Americans want to hear something positive What are you going to do for me Republicans are going to give them no answers on that Schumer said But former President Bill Clinton said Democrats cautioned against running from the law they championed and passed I thought that Democrats had a tendency to shy away from things they had done that were unpopular and talk about positions they had that were popular And that my own experience had convinced me  going back to 94 and even more when I was governor  that that was always a terrible mistake Clinton said this week Official Obamacare on track to meet original goal Five things polls tell us about Obamacare CNNs Political

CNN,mostpopular, Washington CNN  A lastminute enrollment surge enabled the White House to meet its original signup target for the Affordable Care Act a surprising victory for the Obama administration after a rocky rollout of the program that has become a political hot potato for Democrats and a rallying cry for Republicans President Barack Obama said on Tuesday that 71 million people had signed up on federal or state exchanges for coverage under the health care law now often known as Obamacare The enrollment period began anemically in October with a faltering federal website and ended with a crush of people trying to beat Mondays deadline to get coverage Not everyone who has selected a health plan has paid for it yet officials said Nevertheless Obama claimed victory at a White House ceremony saying the program approved by Congress in 2010  with no Republican support and vilified relentlessly by the GOP as government overreach  has been a force for good He said it wasnt perfect acknowledging the early difficulties in selecting a policy on HealthCaregov and he predicted more hurdles in carrying it out But the overall goal of starting to narrow the gap between those with health coverage and those without it has begun and millions of Americans are embracing it Obama said Thats what the law is all about making sure all of us and all our fellow citizens can count on the security of health care when we get sick he said noting that the law is doing what its supposed to do Its working The numbers The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office originally projected the 7 million enrollment target for the October through March period which was adopted by the administration Expectations plummeted throughout the fall and into this year after the early website problems which Obama called several lost weeks But signs of a pickup began in late January and continued into February and early March despite a fierce campaign by Republicans to demonize the law as unworkable Administration officials said an absolute crush of people pushed the program  Obamas chief domestic accomplishment  over the finish line at the 11th hour More than 48 million visits were made to HealthCaregov on Monday alone Officials stressed that the 71 million figure represents only those who signed up for coverage Those who came in late and encountered technical problems have until midApril to complete the process Private insurers are providing the coverage Health of Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told an Oklahoma TV station on Monday that insurers were reporting that 80 to 90 had paid so far The law also includes expanded Medicaid insurance for the poor in many states but those participants are not part of the signup total The politics Republicans especially in the House have waged a nonstop campaign to repeal or roll back the Affordable Care Act saying it was rammed through Congress without their input and now is another illustration of big government at its worst They have made it a rallying cry of their fall campaign to expand their majority in the House and reclaim the Senate It has energized the base and the issue informs the commentary of potential GOP candidates for president as well Michael Steel a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner an Ohio Republican said in a statement that the law continues to harm the American people despite Obamas victory lap He said costs are not going down as Obama contends and people are losing insurance plans they preferred and small businesses are chafing under the laws requirements Thats why we must replace this fundamentally flawed law with patientcentered solutions that will actually lower health care costs and help create jobs Steel said Democrats on the stump especially those who voted for it and now find themselves in tight races have recalibrated their position with Obamas presidency not much help to them with voters overall in their states But Obama said at the White House that the law is good for the country regardless of politics and that the numbers show Americans want it and that its here to stay I dont get it Why are folks working so hard for people not to have health insurance Why are they so mad about the idea of people having health insurance he asked What people think Americans are divided over how they view the law Last month 46 said they viewed it unfavorably down 4 points since January and 38 said they viewed it favorably up 4 points over the same time period according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll Those who held unfavorable views cited concerns about costs 23 opposition to the individual mandate 17 and concerns about government intrusion 10 Those with favorable views cited expanded access to health care and health insurance 61 followed by the perception that it will control health care costs and make it more affordable 10 and that it will be good for the country 7 The telephone survey of 1504 adults was conducted March 11 to 17 and had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 points Professor Uwe Reinhardt a health economist at Princeton University said he was not surprised at the lastminute rush to sign up I think the prayer of the conservatives that this would collapse just didnt get answered he told CNN It fills a need He predicted conservatives would chip away at whatever the number proves to be Its all just some people hate Obama and anything he does he said The details The administration did not release details about the numbers including the number of younger Americans who signed up That metric is crucial for making the program work economically because premiums from younger healthier participants are needed to make the program work for older people who use the health care system more An official briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity said insurance companies were confident the percentage of young people was sufficient for the insurance marketplaces to function properly Obamacares primary goal is to reduce the ranks of the 45 million uninsured Until now many Americans with preexisting conditions had to pay skyhigh prices for insurance if they could get any at all Often insurers branded them uninsurable The surge The administration pulled out all the stops in the final weeks of the enrollment period  an effort one official equated to a get out the vote campaign before an election Administration officials took to the radio airwaves by participating in 400 interviews enlisted celebrities and athletes to promote the law and engaged people on social media And Obamas interview on the online comedycast Between Two Ferns resulted in the socalled Zach Galifianakis effect resulting in 33 million views of his mock interview with the comedian The interview with Galifianakis along with a promotional push from Miami Heat forward LeBron James were cited by administration officials as two of the most effective components in the push to enroll young Americans on the health care exchanges The overall effort the White House said surpassed their expectations in terms of lastminute signups By the numbers The final Obamacare push Republicans hit a nerve when it
