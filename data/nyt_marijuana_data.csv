She has some thoughts about the man and how the public perceived him.That image of him as the laconic, peace and love guy smoking a joint  that was the antithesis of Bob, she said the other day. He was really a hard worker. When people put up a poster of Bob in their dorm room and say, Im going to smoke a joint, what they should be thinking is, How do I realize my potential? Thats what Bob was thinking.Recently, Marleys family and an American venture capital firm announced a plan to make Marley the face of what they called the worlds first global cannabis brand. The makeover of Bob Marley  from the rebel behind anthems like Get Up, Stand Up and Burnin and Lootin to the face that launched a thousand bongs  would seem to be complete.Its a very reductive view that people have of him, said the writer Vivien Goldman, who worked briefly as Marleys publicist and now teaches the course Bob Marley and Post-Colonial Music at New York University.Its a phenomenon I call cuddly dread, she said. Its a sanitized version. He got more militant with each record. He wouldnt be happy to be reduced to a pothead or party guy. I remember him saying of someone, He only smokes herb to get high. To Bob it was a sacrament.Ms. Simons photographs, which she collected in a 2004 book called Rebel Music: Bob Marley & Roots Reggae (Genesis House), capture other sides of Marley. There are marijuana and joy, yes, but also Marley as newshound; as constantly evolving musician; and as political peacemaker, inveigling the rival Jamaican politicians Michael Manley and Edward Seaga to shake hands onstage in 1978 (Photo 11), when their parties were engaged in violent clashes that played out in impoverished neighborhoods.Through all of this, Ms. Simon had uniquely intimate access. He was always trying to help me, she said. Where other musicians tested her, insisting that she smoke a spliff before she shot them, Marley approached photography as a collaboration, and welcomed her into his world, she said. I could go anywhere, and he was, Shes cool.Her best-known image of Marley, for the 1978 Kaya album, leapt out because it was one of the only pictures of Bob smiling, said Ms. Goldman, who was at the shoot. The photo has since made its way around the globe, perhaps unwittingly contributing to the tourism-board image that has grown around Marley (photo below).Yet there is also a vitality to the image  the sharpness of Marleys gaze, the wiry strength under the athletic suit  that is harder to possess or cuddle up to, even for a face that has become a global brand. In the frame he is both smaller and larger than his image.I was trying to show what a sweet person he was, how much I cared about him, Ms. Simon said. I just wanted to give thanks and praise.

Rick Scott in his first term in office.The three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, ruled that the law, one of the strictest in the country, was an unreasonable search because Florida officials had failed to show a substantial need to test all people who applied for welfare benefits. Applicants were required to submit to urine tests, a measure that Mr. Scott said would protect children of welfare applicants by ensuring that their parents were not buying and using drugs.The state has not demonstrated a more prevalent, unique or different drug problem among TANF applicants than in the general population, the panel said in its unanimous decision, using an acronym for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.Eleven states have passed laws to mandate drug testing since 2011, but most of those differ from Floridas because they require testing only if drug use is suspected. After the Florida Legislature approved its law, Georgia followed suit. A similar measure was ruled unconstitutional in 2003 by a Michigan Court of Appeals.The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida sued the state on behalf of a welfare applicant, Luis Lebron, a Navy veteran and single father, shortly after the law took effect in 2011. A federal judge ruled it unconstitutional in 2013, but Florida appealed.The court has once again confirmed what we argued all along: that the state of Florida cannot treat an entire class of people like suspected criminals simply because theyve asked the state for temporary assistance, said Maria Kayanan, the associate legal director of the Florida A.C.L.U.From July through October 2011  the four months when testing took place in Florida before a federal injunction  2.6 percent of the states applicants for cash assistance, or 108 of 4,086, failed the drug test, according to figures from the state obtained by the group. The most common reason was marijuana use. Another 40 applicants did not go through with the testing.Because the Florida law required that applicants who passed the test be reimbursed for the cost, an average of $30, the cost to the state was $118,140. This was more than would have been paid in benefits to the people who failed the test.",2014-12-04,marijuana

But after viewing the footage and hearing from witnesses, including the officer who used the chokehold, the jurors deliberated for less than a day before deciding that there was not enough evidence to go forward with charges against the officer, Daniel Pantaleo, 29, in the death of the man, Eric Garner, 43.Officer Pantaleo, who has been on the force for eight years, appeared before the grand jury on Nov. 21, testifying that he did not intend to choke Mr. Garner, who was being arrested for allegedly selling loose cigarettes. He described the maneuver as a takedown move, adding that he never thought Mr. Garner was in mortal danger.The decision came barely a week after a grand jury found no criminality in the actions of another white police officer, Darren Wilson, who shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man in Ferguson, Mo.After the news from Staten Island, a wave of elected officials renewed calls for Justice Department intervention, saying the grand jurys finding proved that justice could be found only in the federal courts. By the evening, the department announced it would open a civil rights inquiry.On the streets of the city, from Tompkinsville to Times Square, many expressed their outrage with some of the last words Mr. Garner uttered before being wrestled to the ground: This stops today, people chanted. I cant breathe, others shouted.While hundreds of angry but generally peaceful demonstrators took to the streets in Manhattan as well as in Washington and other cities, the police in New York reported relatively few arrests, a stark contrast to the riots that unfolded in Ferguson in the hours after the grand jury decision was announced in the Brown case.President Obama, speaking in Washington, said the decisions in New York and Missouri highlighted the frustrations that many African-Americans have harbored about a legal system that has a long history of discrimination against black people.When anybody in this country is not being treated equally under the law, that is a problem, Mr. Obama said, and its my job as president to help solve it.Officer Pantaleo said in statement on Wednesday that he felt very bad about the death of Mr. Garner, just as he had told the 23 panelists of the grand jury when he testified before them for two hours.During the proceedings, jurors were shown three videos of the encounter, and in his testimony Officer Pantaleo sought to characterize his actions as a maneuver taught at the Police Academy. He said that while holding onto Mr. Garner, he felt fear that they would crash through a plate glass storefront as they tumbled to the ground, said Stuart London, his lawyer. One of the officers arms went around Mr. Garners throat, as Mr. Garner repeatedly said, I cant breathe, I cant breathe.Appearing with the Rev. Al Sharpton in Harlem, Mr. Garners widow, Esaw Garner, said she did not accept the officers apology.Hell, no, Ms. Garner said. The time for remorse for the death of my husband was when he was yelling to breathe.She said that while she mourned, the officer could go home to his family.Hes still feeding his kids, she said, and my husband is six feet under and Im looking for a way to feed my kids now.Mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking on Staten Island, said that it was a deeply emotional day for the Garner family and all New Yorkers, and that he had thought of his own son in considering Mr. Garners fate. But he implored demonstrators to voice their outrage peacefully and not engage in the destructive violence that followed protests in Ferguson over Mr. Browns death.Todays outcome is one that many in our city did not want, Mr. de Blasio said. Yet New York City owns a proud and powerful tradition of expressing ourselves through nonviolent protest.An autopsy by the citys medical examiner found that Mr. Garners death was a homicide resulting from the chokehold  a maneuver banned by the Police Department in 1993  and the compression of his chest by police officers.In early September, the Staten Island district attorney, Daniel M. Donovan Jr., impaneled the grand jury to weigh evidence; it heard testimony from the officers involved and 22 civilian witnesses. All of the officers, with the exception of Officer Pantaleo, were granted immunity.The encounter exposed apparent lapses in police tactics and raised questions about the aggressive policing of minor offenses in a time of historically low crime. The officers involved, part of a plainclothes unit, suspected Mr. Garner of selling cigarettes on the street near the Staten Island Ferry Terminal, a complaint voiced by local business owners.Mr. Garners death hastened an effort to retrain all the departments patrol officers and brought scrutiny on how officers who violate its rules are disciplined. Officer Pantaleo has been stripped of his gun and badge during the investigation.Now, Mr. de Blasio said, the grand jury decision had accelerated the need for that overhaul. Earlier on Wednesday, the mayor announced the start of a pilot program to equip officers with body cameras to record encounters on patrol.But how useful such technology will prove to be in settling disputes over police actions remains an open question. Mr. Garners relatives had believed for months that a widely circulated cellphone video of the violent arrest that caused his death would be enough to convince grand jurors that the case merited a criminal trial.Jonathan C. Moore, a lawyer for the Garner family, said Were astounded by the outcome of the grand jury process.In a statement, Mr. Donovan said investigators also spoke with the emergency responders who provided medical treatment both at the scene and at the hospital, and expert witnesses in the area of forensic pathology as well as the procedures and training of police officers. He said that he was constrained by law from discussing details of their findings, but that he had petitioned the court for authorization to publicly release specific information in connection with this grand jury investigation.He expressed his condolences to the family and said his office conducted a thorough investigation that spanned four months.I assured the public that I was committed to a fair, thorough, and responsible investigation into Mr. Garners death, he said.Grand juries determine whether enough evidence exists for a case to go forward to a criminal trial, either before a jury or a judge. By law, they operate in secret and hear only evidence presented by prosecutors, who also instruct the grand jurors on the law. Defense lawyers are barred from speaking. For a decision, 12 jurors who have heard all of the evidence must agree.While the exact makeup of the grand jury was unclear, Mr. London said it was roughly half white, with the other half evenly divided among blacks and Hispanics.With the criminal phase over, Officer Pantaleos fate moves into the realm of Police Department discipline. It is far from clear if he will return to enforcement duties, and Commissioner William J. Bratton said he would remain on suspension pending an internal investigation.Even before Mr. Garners death, Mr. Bratton had been tasked by the mayor with repairing the fissures between the police and the communities they serve, moving away from street stops and minor marijuana arrests. Those changes, however, have yet to quell the anger that deaths such as Mr. Garners bring forth.",2014-12-04,marijuana

A line of police scooters briefly blocked the group from proceeding, then retreated, leaving the highway to the marchers.With a shout, the protesters continued on. But at 48th Street, the protesters encountered another line of police scooters. As a helicopter hovered above, the headlights of halted traffic illuminated the highway. The protesters stood for several minutes chanting Hands up, dont shoot. The line of police officers remained impassive. Then many of the marchers turned around and left the highway at 49th Street.

The circumstances surrounding his death were nothing short of tragic. And while there will be people who disagree with todays grand jury decision, it is important that we respect the legal process and rule of law. At the same time, the justice system also allows for additional investigations and reviews, and it may be appropriate for the federal government to do so in this case. And if there are improvements to be made and lessons to be learned, we at the state level are ready to act to better the system.I stand with the Garner family and urge those wishing to voice their opposition to todays ruling to do so peacefully. My thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Garners family and friends as they continue to grieve during this difficult time.Mayor de Blasio spoke about the grand jurys decision at Mount Sinai United Christian Church on Staten Island, a few blocks from where Mr. Garner died. Watch it live.Theres a lot of pain and frustration in the room this evening, and at the same time a lot of purposefulness, Mr. de Blasio began.Its a very painful day for so many New Yorkers, he continued. That is the core reality.Were grieving again for the loss of Eric Garner, who was a father, a husband, a son and a good man who should be with us and isnt.The mayor said that when he had spoken to Mr. Garners father he could not help but think how he would feel if he lost his own son, Dante. ANDY NEWMANJustice Dept investigating circumstances surrounding death of Eric Garner, whether civil rights were violated, law enf sources tell CNN Ram Ramgopal (@RamCNN) 3 Dec 14President Obama reacted swiftly to the grand jury decision, saying it underscored the frustrations that many African-Americans felt about their treatment by the police and a legal system they believed was stacked against them. Though he declined to address the details of the case, Mr. Obama spoke of a crisis of confidence.When anybody in this country is not being treated equally under the law, that is a problem, and its my job as president to help solve it, Mr. Obama said to American Indian leaders in Washington.He added, We are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of the trust and strengthening of the accountability that exists between our communities and our law enforcement.

Reverend Al Sharpton (@TheRevAl) 3 Dec 14Shortly before 4:30 p.m., about two dozen people lay down in silence near the information booth in Grand Central Terminal to protest the Staten Island grand jurys decision. Many wore red. One woman wore a button to protest the stop-and-frisk police tactic, and a man had a sign beside him that read, Black Lives Matter.  The number of protesters increased steadily to about 50 on Wednesday night.Im tired of hearing about police abusing, killing minorities all over the country, said one protester, Christopher Cannon, 20, a student at Fordham University. One protester, a man who appeared to be in his 50s or 60s, tied a scarf around his neck and yanked up on it. He was choked,  the man said. A modern day version of lynching.Talibah Newman, 30, began tearing up  when asked why she was protesting. I have two Ivy League degrees and I cannot believe I live in a country where this is happening in 2014, she said. KATE PASTORSenator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, said that she was shocked by the decision and that Eric Garners death demands accountability. While this decision is shocking, I want to echo the statement of a wide range of leaders inside and outside of government who are urging that protests remain peaceful in the aftermath of this decision, Ms. Gillibrand said. The death of Eric Garner is a tragedy that demands accountability. Nobody unarmed should die on a New York City street corner for suspected low-level offenses. Im shocked by this grand jury decision, and will be calling on the Department of Justice to investigate.Several members of the New York Congressional delegation gathered Wednesday at the Capitol in Washington to condemn the grand jury decision and call for an investigation by the federal Justice Department into the death of Mr. Garner.Outrageous! #EricGarner Hakeem Jeffries (@RepJeffries) 3 Dec 14Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Democrat, said the circumstances of the case could not have been more clear.He was surrounded by policemen, Mr. Rangel said. No one else touched him and the grand jury did not say he committed suicide.How, he asked, could the grand jury possibly stretch the imagination to reach that decision.Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of Brooklyn, said that the failure to hold the officer accountable for Mr. Garners death was incomprehensible.What more does America need to see? Mr. Jeffries said. We are better than this as a country.Several of the delegation members noted with outrage that the officer who put Mr. Garner in a chokehold, Daniel Pantaleo, is not being charged with any offense at all, not even misdemeanor assault.Representative Yvette D. Clarke, another Brooklyn Democrat, said, I cant believe we cant get a simple indictment in the murder of a man that was caught on tape. MARC SANTORAimportant note: Officer in #EricGarner case to remain suspended  http:t.cotybIIPLqzt #NYPD #Ferguson #HandsUpDontShoot Azi (@Azi) 3 Dec 14A top official from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. called the grand jury decision horrific and extraordinarily disappointing, and described it as part of a broader problem exposed by the shooting death of a black man by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.Its indicative of this presumption of criminality of black people, and black men in particular, that plagues our society,  said the official, Janai Nelson, associate director-counsel of the fund. Im hoping that the frustration and anger and outrage that results from yet another miscarriage of justice will be channeled toward really exposing how this bias affects our entire criminal justice system, and that we can really get some reform. JULIE HIRSCHFIELD DAVISThe grand jurys decision today comes 139 days after Mr. Garner died at the hands of officers on Bay Street in Tompkinsville  on Staten Island. See timeline of developments in the case. ANDY NEWMANMayor Bill de Blasio, who is expected to speak this afternoon about the grand jurys decision, issued a statement saying that todays outcome is one that many in our city did not want. Mr. de Blasio noted that many New Yorkers would be angry by the decision and would have a right to publicly display their displeasure, but he urged demonstrators to be peaceful. He also said the city would fully cooperate with an ongoing federal investigation.Mr. de Blasios full statement:This is a deeply emotional day  for the Garner family, and all New Yorkers. His death was a terrible tragedy that no family should have to endure. This is a subject that is never far from my familys minds  or our hearts. And Eric Garners death put a spotlight on police-community relations and civil rights  some of the most critical issues our nation faces today.Todays outcome is one that many in our city did not want. Yet New York City owns a proud and powerful tradition of expressing ourselves through nonviolent protest. We trust that those unhappy with todays grand jury decision will make their views known in the same peaceful, constructive way.  We all agree that demonstrations and free speech are valuable contributions to debate, and that violence and disorder are not only wrong  but hurt the critically important goals we are trying to achieve together.These goals  of bringing police and community closer together and changing the culture of law enforcement  are why we have introduced so many reforms this year.  It starts at the top with Commissioner Bratton  a strong, proven change agent. We have dramatically reduced the overuse and abuse of stop-and-frisk. We have initiated a comprehensive plan to retrain the entire N.Y.P.D. to reduce the use of excessive force and to work with the community. We have changed our marijuana policy to reduce low-level arrests, and we have launched a new pilot program for body cameras for officers to improve transparency and accountability.These are the long-term reforms we are making to ensure we dont endure tragedies like this one again in the future.  But we also know that this chapter is not yet complete. The grand jury is but one part of the process. There will still be an N.Y.P.D. internal investigation. And we know the U.S. attorney is continuing her investigation. Should the federal government choose to act, we stand ready to cooperate.Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  one of our nations most profound thinkers on these issues  taught us something very simple:  Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. The problem of police-community relations and civil rights is not just an issue for people of color  or young people  or people who get stopped by police. This is a fundamental issue for every American who cares about justice. All of us must work together to make this right  to work for justice  and to build the kind of city  and nation  we need to be.The Staten Island district attorney, Daniel M. Donovan Jr., said he had sought a court order that would allow him to release the proceedings of the grand jury. Mr. Donovan said he had done so because  unlike other jurisdictions that have statutes that permit a district attorney to disclose specific details regarding what took place during a grand jury proceeding, New York law does not permit a district attorney to engage in such disclosure. State law does make an exception, Mr. Donovan said, upon a showing of a compelling and particularized need for access.  Mr. Donovan said his request was being considered.Read Mr. Donovans full statement. THE NEW YORK TIMESWilliam Fitzpatrick, president-elect of the National District Attorneys Association and the district attorney in Syracuse, said recently that under New York law, it was not possible to release grand jury materials as Missouri prosecutors had in the Michael Brown case. MICHAEL WILSONBenjamin Carr, the stepfather of Eric Garner, said he hurt anew.Its just like getting a knife stabbed in my heart, Mr. Carr said. You might as well choke me.Around him, a sparse crowd yelled, No Justice, I Cant Breathe, and obscenities about the police.Mr. Carr said that he had expected this outcome.Im not surprised, he said. The federal government got to do something about it.He took a phone call, and his tone turned from sad to pleading.Tell everybody else, dont start nothing, he said. Please, Eric wouldnt want it, and I dont want it. NATE SCHWEBERMayor de Blasio will hold a news conference on the grand jury decision at 4:45 p.m. at Mount Sinai United Christian Church on Staten Island, not far from where Mr. Garner died.The mayor will not be in Rockefeller Center tonight for the Christmas tree lighting.The mayors appearance tonight at the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting has been canceled. Mike Grynbaum (@grynbaum) 3 Dec 14Lie-in at Grand Central Station @ 4:30pm to protest non-indictment in Eric Garner case. #ThisStopsToday #Ferguson http:t.co1ZWxGyP3ar Monte-Angel Richards (@MonteIsMad) 3 Dec 14Justice for #EricGarner  This system has NO RIGHT TO RULE! Go to Union Square NOW & at 5pm! http:t.cohpNnkzzN68 Sunsara Taylor (@SunsaraTaylor) 3 Dec 14Shortly after the grand jury reached its decision, Officer Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who used a chokehold on Eric Garner, issued the following statement:I became a police officer to help people and to protect those who cant protect themselves.  It is never my intention to harm anyone and I feel very bad about the death of Mr. Garner.  My family and I include him and his family in our prayers and I hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss. THE NEW YORK TIMESWhile Officer Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who used the chokehold that led to Eric Garners death, may not face an indictment, he still faces an internal inquiry by the Police Department.The officer is currently on suspension and will remain on suspension while the department moves forward with its administrative process, said Police Commissioner William J. Bratton, responding to a question, hours before the decision, about what would happen to Officer Pantaleo if the grand jury did not indict. In other words, he said, if there are no criminal charges filed against the officer, the next action will be in the department for us to review if there were any violations of administrative processes. NIKITA STEWARTReached by phone at 2:35 p.m. on Wednesday, the Rev. Al Sharpton said that lawyers for Mr. Garners relatives had been notified by the Staten Island district attorneys office that there was no indictment in the case.Mr. Sharpton could not immediately describe their reaction, but said, I can just tell you that there was not a whole lot of surprise because we have been saying all along that we have no confidence in state grand juries.That is why, he said, he had met with federal prosecutors from the United States attorneys office in the Eastern District, to ask them to take over the case.People thought we were being extreme, Mr. Sharpton said. But now, I think you can see, we have no confidence in the state grand juries, whether in Ferguson or in New York, because there is an intrinsic relationship between state prosecutors and the police; they depend on the police for their evidence, they run for office and depend on the unions for endorsements.Mr. Sharpton said the nations attention was drawn to such issues, since so many fatal encounters between the police and civilians have occurred in a short period of time.How many people have to die before we wake up and understand this? Mr. Sharpton said.He said he would appear at 7:30 p.m. at the headquarters of the organization he leads, the National Action Network, along with Mr. Garners relatives to discuss the grand jurys decision. AL BAKERThe decision not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo is a stark contrast to how a similar chokehold case played out in the Bronx 20 years ago  one that was widely seen as a possible signpost for how the Garner grand jury might act.In 1994, Anthony Baez, 29, was playing a late-night game of football when a stray toss landed on a police car. Officer Francis X. Livoti confronted Mr. Baez and placed him in a chokehold. Mr. Baez, who had asthma, died of asphyxiation. The case closely resembles the one on Staten Island, minus any video.A grand jury in the Bronx indicted Officer Livoti on charges of criminally negligent homicide. He elected to have his case heard by a judge, not a jury. Officer Livoti faced the lesser charge of manslaughter, in which the defendant is accused of killing a person while intending to cause serious injury. In a negligence case, the prosecution need not prove that the defendant had any such intent, but rather, failed to perceive the risk in his actions, a risk a reasonable person would have foreseen.The judge, Gerald Sheindlin, acquitted Officer Livoti   perhaps a lesson in how difficult it is to get a conviction in these circumstances. MICHAEL WILSONWere astounded by the outcome of the grand jury process and that after hearing months of evidence and having deliberated that they would find no true bill as to any potential criminal charge, Jonathan C. Moore, the lawyer for the Garner family, said in a brief phone interview.Its very upsetting to us  we obviously hope that the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District, Loretta Lynch, will take a close look at this.We think people should express their objections to this grand jury verdict, but we urge on behalf of the family that any protest be peaceful, Mr. Moore added. BENJAMIN WEISERThe authorities are bracing for demonstrations in response to the grand jury decision. In Staten Island, police are laying out barricades around the court house, according to @nateschweber who is on scene jdavidgoodman (@jdavidgoodman) 3 Dec 14Near the site of Mr. Garners death on Bay Street, New York 1 shows footage of garbage that has been thrown in the street.Police Commissioner William J. Bratton, speaking at a press conference earlier in the day, said that he expected any protests to be peaceful and the police were prepared to deal with anyone seeking to cause trouble.We have had quite a bit of time to prepare for the events that will unfold here for the next few days, Mr. Bratton said.Since the decision not to indict the white police officer who shot an unarmed teenager in Ferguson, Mo., prompted protests across the nation, there have been 31 arrests of protesters in the city, he said.While seeking to ensure that people can voice their opinions, Mr. Bratton said the police would take forceful action against those who used the protests to break the law. MARC SANTORAMayor Bill de Blasio abruptly canceled a bill signing after news broke that the grand jury would not indict the officer. Phil Walzak, his spokesman, said the mayor was in City Hall and that his schedule would be updated shortly to address the news. He would not confirm the decision. NIKITA STEWART",2014-12-03,marijuana

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/03/nyregion/violent-crime-in-new-york-has-dropped-to-historic-low-mayor-de-blasio-says.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/03/nyregion/CRIMEweb1/CRIMEweb1-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg,"New York Crime Keeps Falling, Mayor de Blasio Says; Cites Years of Momentum","Mayor Bill de Blasio declared that New York, which his opponents once said would grow more dangerous under his watch, had in fact become even safer.","Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Tuesday that a city his opponents once said would grow more dangerous under his watch had, in fact, become even safer.Robberies, considered the most telling indicator of street crime, are down 14 percent across New York City from last year. Grand larcenies  including the thefts of Apple devices that officials said drove an overall crime increase two years ago  are also down, by roughly 3 percent.And after a record-low 335 homicides in 2013, the city has seen 290 killings in the first 11 months of this year, a number unheard-of two decades ago.When I came into this job, people always talked about last year  last year was an amazing year in this city in terms of bringing down crime, Mr. de Blasio said. We saw what was possible. The citys crime rate continues to go down.Even shootings, which had increased by more than 10 percent earlier this year, have receded amid a push by the Police Department to stamp out troublesome pockets of gun violence. There were just over 1,000 shootings in the first 11 months of this year, about a 4 percent increase over last year.The announcement on Tuesday, which, at the beginning of December, came earlier than in years past, appeared timed to precede a decision by a Staten Island grand jury that is investigating officers actions in the case of Eric Garner, who died after a police chokehold during an arrest in July.The announcement also comes less than two weeks after an officer shot and killed an unarmed man, Akai Gurley, while patrolling a Brooklyn housing development in what the police described as an accidental shooting. Both Mr. Garner and Mr. Gurley were black.For Mr. de Blasio and his police commissioner, William J. Bratton, the numbers provided a kind of cushion for the criminal justice and policing reforms that both men are putting into place.Officers will this week begin a pilot program of wearing body cameras in three police commands, Mr. Bratton said on Tuesday, and a wholesale retraining of the departments patrol force is also starting. A new marijuana policy aimed at reducing low-level arrests, which was announced in November, has already resulted in a 61.2 percent decline in arrests in its first two full weeks.We can see with our own eyes, we can experience in our own lives, a safer city, Mr. de Blasio said, and a city that is becoming more unified.The decline in the citys crime rate, while deeper in many categories than other cities, mirrors a nationwide downward trend from heights of violent crime in the 1990s. How much any one mayor or one police commissioner has control over crime has remained a subject of debate.Indeed, Mr. de Blasio pointed to 20 years of momentum that he inherited, referring to an arc of continuous progress across different mayors, different commissioners. He expressed pride in the performance of the Police Department over the first 11 months of this year, and declined to describe the continued decline as vindication of his reform-minded policies.Others were more ready to do so.Bravo! wrote Joseph J. Lhota on Twitter, who as the Republican candidate for mayor last year ran ads predicting a return to the crime-plagued streets of the early 1990s if Mr. de Blasio were elected.With a month still to go before the end of the year, the favorable crime numbers appeared to render a verdict on at least one question: Would a vast decline in the number of recorded stop-and-frisk encounters create an opening for violence to return? So far, Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Bratton said, the answer has been no.Mr. Bratton said that by the end of the year there would be fewer than 50,000 such stops, down from a high of over 685,000 in 2011. That sharp decline, like crime over all, began well before Mr. de Blasio took office and has continued.Two years ago, in front of a graduating Police Academy class in Madison Square Garden, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced what was then a record low for homicides  419.On Tuesday, Mr. de Blasio chose a community center gymnasium in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, for his announcement. In the surrounding Ingersoll public housing development, crime has gone down 18.6 percent, he said.Elsewhere, however, the citys public housing developments have presented a more complicated picture. Some have seen double-digit declines, while in others, like the Bushwick Houses in Brooklyn, shootings and violence are up.With fewer crimes, detectives have found themselves with more time to devote to investigations, said Robert K. Boyce, the chief of detectives. The rate at which homicide cases are closed  usually with an arrest  reached 77 percent this year.Its the highest Ive seen, said Chief Boyce, who joined the department in 1983.",2014-12-03,marijuana
