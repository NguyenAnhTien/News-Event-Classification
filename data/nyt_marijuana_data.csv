Describing Manaus as the Williamsburg of the Amazon? Katmandu as the Cobble Hill of Nepal?Its not news that we write a lot about Brooklyn  especially about a certain selection of Brooklyn neighborhoods. But as a colleague and others have recently pointed out, we now seem to be using Brooklyn as the measuring stick or point of comparison for everywhere.Heres the latest, about a gentrifying area of frumpy old Queens:[Headline] A Touch of Brooklyn in  Ridgewood, Queens?Ridgewood is in the chrysalis stage of an outer-borough transformation that shrieks Brooklyn.Among the clues we cite: vegan muffins, destination pizzerias, guitar cases and shearling coats.Just a week earlier, we stretched the similarity to another continent:Chic organic farms, cowsheds serving fresh-picked herbs and tables made from old electric cable spools. Move over, Brooklyn: the South African citys artisanal charms are enough to make any New Yorker fall in love.Granted, the whole conceit of this travel essay was an attempt to impress a jaded New Yorker. But really  is the allure of Cape Town best measured by its resemblance to Williamsburg?Lest you think two examples merely indicate a coincidence, our friends at The Atlantic did a more rigorous search last month. They list a whole range of places weve included in our Brooklyn comparisons  from the Hamptons and Maplewood to Stockholm and Beijing. Check out their list  and lets think twice the next time were tempted to declare someplace the new Red Hook. Number TroubleHeres the latest dreary lineup of agreement problems  subjectverb or nounpronoun. An overstuffed, convoluted sentence is often the root of the problem.Read them and weep, and lets step up our scrutiny.But the unredacted report, a copy of which was reviewed by a person not authorized to disclose it publicly, as well as interviews and an examination of federal regulatory correspondence, show that Ms. Averill looms large in the ignition-switch safety crisis that has engulfed the automaker this year.Make the verb singular: shows, not show. An intervening as well as phrase appears to have tripped us up, but as a parenthetical aside, it doesnt alter the singular subject, report.This caused Breakr to update its LinkedIn post to say that neither Alex nor Abbie were part of any scheme, that it occurred organically and the company jumped on it to draw attention to its services.Make it was part of any scheme; the neithernor construction leaves us with a singular subject.Several members noted that they were unhappy that the number of arrests for marijuana possession, which overwhelmingly involve black and Latino males and are often the result of unjustified stops and searches, were not declining more rapidly under the new administration.Make it was not declining to agree with the singular subject the number. We were thrown off by the intervening relative clause (which overwhelmingly ); it modifies the plural arrests but tangles the syntax. Perhaps that should have been a separate sentence.Heres what The Timess stylebook says about the number of number:Total of or number of (and a few similar expressions, like series of) may take either a plural or a singular verb. In general, when the expression follows a, it is plural: A total of 102 people were injured; A number of people were injured. When the expression follows the, it is usually singular: The total of all department budgets is $187 million; The number of passengers injured was later found to be 12.He is one of the few who has focused on suicides, which make up nearly two-thirds of all gun deaths.Recorded announcement: Make it the few who have focused.One of those superintendents who was let go, Rhonda D. Farkas of District 22 in Brooklyn, said in a brief telephone interview that she did not know yet what her plans were.And another. Make it those superintendents who were let go (or, more simply, One superintendent who was let go.)Football was the only sport for which someones political views helped predict their comfort level, Katherine Grace Carman and Michael Pollard of RAND noted.Someone, like everyone or nobody, is singular and does not agree with their. We could make it all plural, starting with peoples political views.From Frank Sinkwich in 1942 to Cam Newton in 2010, almost every Heisman winner from the SEC (with the exception of Billy Cannon) has had a monster day against Kentucky in their Heisman winning season.The subject almost every Heisman winner is singular, and we correctly used the singular verb has had. But we also needed the singular pronoun his.If a traveler who has been in one of the three West African countries within 21 days arrives at a port of entry that is not one of the five designated arrival airports, Dr. Frieden said, they will be held there until the same screening could be done.Again, dont shift from the singular traveler to the plural they. We could easily have used the plural throughout.A jury in Federal District Court found that the deaths of 17 Iraqis in the shooting, which began when a convoy of the guards suddenly began firing in a crowded intersection, was not a battlefield tragedy, but the result of a criminal act.Make it the deaths  were not.It is games like those  a long time to complete a contest in which not all that much happened  that has Major League Baseball worried that the sport is losing its appeal to a younger generation more attuned to the immediacy of the Internet.Make it games like those  that have Major League Baseball worried. Better yet, rethink this cumbersome sentence. The opening It is  device often leads to trouble. In a WordThis weeks grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.And in the shows high point, theyre a delight doing a Comden-and-Green-style presentation of their characters score for the show.The plural possessive form is characters.That it will do so is hardly a forgone conclusion, as members of many powerful interests, including the Free Democratic Party and the Farmers Union, have opposed contributing to such a fund.From the stylebook:forgo, forego. Forgo means refrain. Forego, which is relatively rare, means precede. Thus: foregone conclusion, an outcome determined beforehand.Democrats were in a defensive crouch, much like they were at times in the Reagan era, when Newt Gingrich led Republicans to take control of the House of Representatives in the mid-1990s and in the early years of George W. Bushs presidency.Make it as. Also, a reader notes that the sequence would be much clearer if semicolons separated the descriptions of the three different time periods.But with their profit margins being squeezed by Amazon and electronic books, publishers are facing a different reality, one in which private offices may be a luxury that are not worth paying for. If editors or other employees are still finding it too distracting to work in their cubes, they can bring their manuscript or laptop into one of handful of silent conference rooms called quiet cars.With its singular antecedent (a luxury), that needed a singular verb in the first sentence. In the second, make it take, not bring.Earlier this year, JREFs Fort Lauderdale building was sold, and its reference library and collection of memorabilia were boxed up and relocated to Randis home. When I visited, many of the cartons remained unpacked; the portrait of Isaac Asimov that once hung above the fireplace in the JREF library was propped against a wall.No, they remained packed; that is, they had not yet been unpacked.Ms. Moore is close to other potential campaign aides like Guy Cecil, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and who previously worked at Dewey Square.The appositive (executive director) and the relative clause (who previously worked) are not parallel constructions and shouldnt be joined by and. Put a comma there instead.New Yorkers who voted on Tuesday proudly and creatively showed off their I Voted stickers. Heres a selection of Instagram photos from various New York City neighborhoods, worn by voters and even tolerated by a few pets.This paragraph loses its way in the second sentence. Voters wore and pets tolerated I Voted stickers  not a selection of Instagram photos.[Picture caption] In the margins of chapter one, Handler writes: Oh, no. I have to read the thing. Why did I agree to do this.The stylebook says this:chapter numbers. Capitalize them as proper names: Chapter 16; Chapter 2. In tables and charts, abbreviations may be used: Ch. 16; Ch. 2.Republicans working on the Senate race in Colorado sensed something was shifting even before the votes were counted.We shouldnt have omitted that in introducing this relative clause. Without it, a reader might start to read something as the direct object of sensed.But for a country that by some estimates needs an oil price of more than $140 a barrel to balance its budget, the roughly 25 percent drop in oil prices to around $80 a barrel since last summer has to be deeply concerning.Lets avoid this adjectival use of concerning, which seems to be in vogue.He expressed similar sentiments in a 2010 book, On Heaven and Earth, written three years before becoming pope, even as he expressed his personal support for celibacy.Dangler; the book did not become pope. Simple fix: before he became pope.Rodriguez, who was originally barred for 211 games, appealed his punishment, with he and his lawyers noting that he had not failed a drug test.This with construction is awkward and best avoided  but if it is used, we need him, not he.But analysts say other factors are having a major effect, including unfavorable sectarian and political demographics, pushback from overrun communities, damage to the groups financial base in Syria and slight improvements by ground forces in Iraq.The faddish pushback seems particularly out of place in this context.The whole process not only takes three lines  something New Yorkers just love  and is barely private.Not only would require a but also construction afterward. Better still, delete not only to turn this sentence into a two-item list of grievances.In addition to a panoramic view of San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose and, sometimes, the Sierra Nevada mountains set off against a cornflower sky, there is a pole to climb, one where hikers can pose in a victory stance for a photograph that proves they made it.Sierra refers to a mountain range. The stylebook says this:Sierra Nevada; the Sierra (not Sierra Nevada Mountains or the Sierras).Voting in Georgia, where the Senate race between Michelle Nunn, a Democrat and David Perdue, a Republican, is expected to be tight, got off to a rough start Tuesday morning.Quite a few commas already, but this sentence needs one more, after Democrat.Mr. Orman could make a powerful ally for the other independent, Angus King of Maine, who could try to build a voting block in the center that would influence both parties.From the stylebook:bloc, block. A bloc is a group of people (or nations) with a common interest who are working together. A block is any number of people or things treated as a unit.",2014-11-18,marijuana

In the past Ive written skeptically about those ghost-hunting reality shows that search for spirits in abandoned psychiatric hospitals, but Aunjanue Elliss rendering of Jenny and Abbies dead mother, Lori Mills, made a believer out of me, at least for an hour.Abbie (Nicole Beharie) was assigned to investigate suicides at the institution where her mother had once been a patient, which made for some nicely creepy moments when her mother turned up, in that fluttery, holographic way that ghosts do in our high-tech age. A demonic nurse named Lambert turned out to have been responsible. Incidentally, Nurse Lambert was played by Cynthia Stevenson, who knows something about the afterlife from her work a decade ago in the Showtime dramedy Dead Like Me, in which she played the mother of a teenager who ends up on a crew of grim reapers after being killed by a toilet seat that fell from the Mir space station.Anyway, Mondays show almost granted my wish of last week for an episode consisting entirely of Abbie: Ichabod (Tom Mison), suffering from a cold, spent much of the hour asleep thanks to some medicine administered by Nick Hawley (Matt Barr). That also left a decent amount of screen time for some cast members who have been shorted this season, notably Orlando Jones as Frank and Lyndie Greenwood as Jenny.It was nice to see Abbie and Jenny get some closure in relation to misimpressions they had harbored about their mother since childhood. Lori, in giving Young Abbie and Young Jenny advice, also gave all of us the best put-it-on-a-T-shirt phrase to come out of this show in a while: Eyes open. Head up. Trust no one. Who remembers some other T-shirt-worthy phrases from earlier episodes? Ive already ordered a dozen in assorted sizes of this one, courtesy of Henry a few weeks ago: I can tell you how to reclaim your soul, but you wont like it. Christmas shopping: Done.The episode seemed deeper to me than some of its recent predecessors, and by its end we had a couple of ingredients in what seems to be a looming storm. The sisters ended up with a journal that their mother told them before disappearing back into the afterlife has a weapon hidden in its pages. We learned that the apparent devil baby created by Henry ages at an alarming rate; by next week, it could be an adult. And Katrina caught a nasty supernatural, blood-blackening disorder from hugging that baby. Something big seems to be coming in Sleepy Hollow. But what will it be?A final thought on this episode: It was almost devoid of the humor that is normally one of this shows best features. Ichabod struggled with a childproof medicine cap early on, and then it was mostly creepiness and tear-shedding the rest of the way (although I did laugh when Frank told Abbie, Dont give me that aiding-and-abetting-a-fugitive look, Mills). I can take one humor-free episode, especially if its as well conceived as this one, but I dont want it to become a habit. So its time to help the writers out with a Top 10 List of Modern Phenomena That Ichabod Hasnt Discovered Yet, the main source of droll comedy in this show. Its hard to keep track, but has Ichabod been to a casino yet? Has he done the Y.M.C.A. dance? Seen a professional-wrestling match? Encountered legalized marijuana? Met a doomsday prepper? Now lets hear your suggestions.",2014-11-17,marijuana

But as the blog Pop Spots points out, that had also been the famous Studio C, where Frank Sinatra, Bob Dylan and many other legends had recorded songs.Listen to the song.Update: A reader reminded us that after topping the pop charts, 52nd Street was reissued in 1982 as the first album on compact disc, in Japan.Kenneth Rosen contributed reporting.New York Today is a weekday roundup that stays live from 6 a.m. till late morning.

He speaks agonizingly about his sexual problems. Viewers watch him marry and, eight months later, divorce.In the film, Body of War, Tomas Young is the body. Co-directed and underwritten by the television personality Phil Donahue, the film sought to show, through Mr. Young, the devastating human cost of a war that the filmmakers argued should have never been fought.Mr. Young died at 34 on Nov. 10 at his home in Seattle. When asked the cause, his mother, Cathy Smith, said, His body just wore out.Body of War received the National Board of Review award for best documentary. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave it strong consideration for an Oscar nomination. Reviews were mixed, but almost all said it was hard hitting. Mr. Young spoke of his ordeal on 60 Minutes, Nightline and Bill Moyers Journal.But the film, though applauded at film festivals, was not released theatrically; its producers could not find a distributor. (It can be found, however, on Internet streaming services.) In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Donahue suggested one possible reason distributors shied from it. Its not a take-your-girl-to-the-movies movie, he said.Another reason may have been its polemic tone. Images of Mr. Youngs agony are interspersed with shots of the congressional debate over the resolution giving President George W. Bush the authority to invade Iraq in March 2003. The film shows Mr. Young in the forefront of demonstrations against the war by veterans and lobbying members of Congress to stop it.Six years after the film came out, Mr. Young drew news media coverage when he announced that pain and depression had pushed him to decide to commit suicide. He wrote an open letter to President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney on behalf of the human detritus your war has left behind, those who will spend their lives in unending pain and grief.The movie had its roots in Mr. Donahues antiwar commentary on his MSNBC talk show in the run-up to the Iraq invasion. In February 2003, the channel canceled his show, citing low ratings, particularly compared with its direct competitor on Fox News, The OReilly Factor, whose host, Bill OReilly, was a strong supporter of the war.The seeds of Body of War were planted in the spring of 2004 at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, where Mr. Young had been taken after sniper fire severed his spine on his fifth day in Iraq. By her account, Ms. Smith asked her son, who had long been interested in politics, inspired by her liberal views, if there was anybody he wanted to meet in Washington. Ralph Nader, he said.She called Mr. Naders office, and he agreed to meet Mr. Young. He asked Mr. Donahue to accompany him. The two had met on Mr. Naders presidential campaign bus in 2000. Mr. Donahue said he was blown away by Mr. Youngs wounds and came to see the young man as a potential vehicle for showing the sacrifices the troops were making in Iraq, which he thought had been deliberately hidden from the public.Mr. Donahue said he had considered writing a book but was persuaded that a movie would be better. He teamed with Ellen Spiro, an experienced filmmaker, who shared producing and directing duties with him. Another veteran of Mr. Naders presidential races, Eddie Vedder of the rock group Pearl Jam, volunteered to write and perform two songs for the film.In the movie, Mr. Young recalls enthusiastically enlisting in the Army after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But he became disillusioned, he says, beginning when he was sent to Iraq rather than Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden had masterminded the attacks.If I had been shot and hurt in Afghanistan, Id have been upset about what I have to go through, but there would be no Body of War film, he said in an interview with The New York Times in 2008. Id take my government check and sit home. I would not have felt my wounds were received in an invalid war.Tomas Vincent Young was born in Boise, Idaho, on Nov. 30, 1979, and grew up in Kansas City, Mo. His mother and father, Thomas Young, divorced when he was a boy. Tomas enlisted in the Army at 17 but was discharged because of a shoulder problem. Returning to Kansas City, he took a succession of minimum-wage jobs. Then came Sept. 11.I called my recruiter after hearing Bush say he was going to smoke the evildoers out of their caves, he told the Kansas newspaper The Topeka Capital-Journal in 2007. His shoulder passed muster in February 2002, and after basic training he landed at Fort Hood, Tex., as a private in the First Cavalry Division.He was shot in Baghdad on April 4, 2004, while lying in an open truck as it rolled through the Sadr City neighborhood. He had emergency surgery in Germany before being flown to Walter Reed.The documentary shows Mr. Young at one point saying goodbye to his younger brother, Nathan, as his brother deploys for the first of two combat tours in Iraq. It shows him marrying his high school sweetheart, Brie Townsend, who says she can handle the challenges they will face. And it shows them divorcing eight months later.While Mr. Young was in a rehab center in Chicago, he met Claudia Cuellar, who had volunteered to visit hospitalized veterans to cheer them up. Though his condition had deteriorated, they wed on April 20, 2012. He decided against suicide.The couple moved to Portland, Ore., because medical marijuana was available there. They then moved to Seattle, partly because Mr. Young had come to regard Mr. Vedder, who lives there, as a friend.Besides his mother, Mr. Young is survived by his wife, his father and his brother Nathan; his sister, Lisa Harper; another brother, Tim Weaver; and two grandmothers.",2014-11-17,marijuana

That suggestion was quickly retracted after it went public.Marijuana-infused foods and drinks have been a booming sector in Colorados new recreational marijuana market.But lawmakers feared the products are too easy to confuse with regular foods and drinks and ordered marijuana regulators to require a new look for marijuana edibles.The department remains concerned that there are products on the market that so closely resemble childrens candy that it can entice children to experiment with marijuana. Marijuana should not seem fun for kids, the agency wrote in its recommendation.The ultimate decision on how to change Colorados edibles market will be made by state lawmakers in 2015.The states Marijuana Enforcement Division is holding work groups with industry representatives, law enforcement and health officials and parent groups to come up with a group recommendation to lawmakers. The final work group meets on Monday.A Health Department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on the revised suggestion, which has not been made public formally.Edible-pot makers were upset at the suggestion, saying it runs afoul of a voter-approved constitutional amendment that guarantees access to retail marijuana in all its forms.State regulations limit potency, serving size and packaging, but there are no regulations on what kinds of foods may contain pot. Edible-pot manufacturers say that limitation would go too far.Were governed to death, and people need to take responsibility for themselves, said Elyse Gordon, owner of Better Baked, a Denver company that makes edible pot products including teas, energy bars and candies.I dont think anyone in the industry is looking to make products for children, and we resent this idea that people arent responsible for the products they bring into their home.Also coming out from the Health Department Monday is a highly anticipated statement about marijuana use by pregnant women and nursing mothers.The agency was directed by the Legislature to review the health effects of maternal marijuana use.",2014-11-17,marijuana

And in the age of terrorism, Ebola and legalized marijuana, Americans may well have grown more paranoid. But dietrologia has become the nicotine of television drama. High-level conspiracies may be banal and unconvincing, but they fuel the craving to watch and see what happens.State of Affairs, which begins Monday on NBC, is the latest cabal-minded series, and it looks like a pastiche of the other two.It stars Katherine Heigl, an alumna of Greys Anatomy, as Charleston Tucker, the presidents most trusted national security adviser. The series has some of the sex and high-stepping melodrama of Scandal on ABC, but its actually closer in spirit to Madam Secretary, the CBS series that stars Ta Leoni as Elizabeth McCord, a maverick secretary of state who suspects that the death of her predecessor was no accident. Like Elizabeth, Charlie, as Charleston is known, is more enmeshed in current affairs than extramarital ones.The narrative of State of Affairs is not as outr as the one in Scandal, but its still preposterous and at times laughable. Thats not a disqualifier; its pretty much a prerequisite for a network action-adventure series. Plausibility isnt the measure, panache is. The Fox series 24 in its heyday had it. So does Scandal. Now, The Blacklist on NBC has it  mostly because James Spader is the star.Ms. Heigl doesnt have Mr. Spaders mystique or inimitable knowing air, so the lapses in logic and probability are all the more obvious.Not that Charlie is easy to pin down. Trying to get over the death of her fianc, who was killed in front of her during a terrorist attack in Afghanistan, Charlie leads a double life  hard-drinking playgirl by night, hard-driving intelligence analyst by day.A watered-down version of Carrie Mathison from Homeland, Charlie takes a lot of liberties at work as well as play but gets away with it because of her privileged relationship with President Constance Payton (Alfre Woodard), the mother of her fianc.Charlies therapist tells her that she is repressing what really happened the night her fianc was killed, and, of course, there is more to the story.Not everything in the show is outlandish; some events are all too realistic. In the pilot, while preparing the presidents intelligence briefing book, Charlie watches a video in which Islamic terrorists slit the throat of a British captive. The masked killers then promise to do the same to another prisoner, an American aid worker. The pilot was filmed before the American journalist James Foley was beheaded on camera by ISIS last August.Unfortunately, the nightmares that television writers dream up increasingly anticipate real events  Madam Secretary also had a botched hostage-rescue scenario that was filmed before the public knew about the real-life failed attempt to save Mr. Foley.After Hillary Rodham Clinton lashed out at her critics at a congressional hearing on Benghazi when she was secretary of state, and after Samantha Power became an outspoken ambassador to the United Nations, it wasnt hard to predict that networks would favor more glamorous, fictional versions.Pilots arent always the best indicator of a shows trajectory, and State of Affairs could twist toward the campy histrionics of Scandal or follow the more grounded, good-government ethos of Madam Secretary.Either way, though, the affairs of state on State of Affairs will turn out to be messed up from within.",2014-11-17,marijuana

A vision might.,"DEMOGRAPHICS is not enough.For years now, its been an article of faith among Democrats that the future belongs to them, thanks to the countrys changing demographic mix. The rising percentage of voters who are women, Americans of color and especially Latinos were always about to turn the country deep blue.I never believed this  largely because I have been hearing it since 1971. That was the year the 26th Amendment passed, lowering the voting age to 18. Democrats had already been the dominant political party since the 1930s, and now with young people getting the vote, a permanent Democratic majority was guaranteed, right?The future failed to arrive on time again this fall. Democrats lost all over America, and they lost big, by much wider margins than predicted. They lost statewide races in the Midwest where Democrats have won repeatedly in presidential elections for more than 20 years. They lost in races against radical right-wing Republicans they might have been expected to defeat, like Sam Brownback in Kansas and Paul R. LePage in Maine.Nor was this months election an anomaly. It was the third disastrous midterm for Democrats in the past 20 years. The party suffered similar or even worse losses at all levels of government in 1994 and 2010, along with a lesser catastrophe in 2002. It now holds fewer elected offices at both the federal and state level than it has at any time since the 1920s.Democratic tacticians maintain that things will be different in 2016, when their base will go to the polls in greater numbers, and when demographics  again  will render the country less white, more Latin and more female. They blame this latest meltdown on terrible candidates, administration flubs and foreign crises. They argue that voters favored Democratic positions in state referendums, from a higher minimum wage to abortion rights and legal marijuana.In other words: Problem, what problem? We Democrats are in great shape, if only we could turn out our base, find good candidates, deal with crises efficiently or get people to vote our way even when they agree with us.The accepted wisdom is that the Democrats hamstrung themselves many years ago, when they passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and thereby lost the Solid South forever. Its a nice story, one that allows everyone to feel good: liberal Democrats, who would like to believe their party was martyred in as noble a cause as there could be, and Clinton-Obama Democrats, who have long cited it as proof that the party needs to move to the right and start appealing to conservative Southern whites again.The only trouble is, its not true.Yes, the South was never solid for Democrats again after 1964, and the party lost five of six presidential elections from 1968 to 1988. But at every other level of government, Democrats remained highly competitive, even dominant, in the South for years to come.Going into the 1994 elections, Democrats still held 16 of the 30 United States Senate seats from the 15 Southern states (which I define as the 11 states of the Confederacy, plus Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri and West Virginia), and nearly two-thirds of the Southern seats in the House. On a state level, the figures were even more one-sided. Democrats held 12 of the 15 Southern governorships, and 29 of the 30 state legislative chambers.Its only in the last two decades that these numbers flipped. In the next Congress, fewer than a third of the Souths representatives will be Democrats; if Mary Landrieu loses her seat in Louisiana, there will be seven Democratic senators in the region. Democrats there will hold four governorships and both chambers in just one legislature.Democrats did lose the South, but they didnt lose it because of the Civil Rights Act. Instead of waiting for all those mean old Southern white men to die, Democrats might be better off asking themselves why so many of them were still voting Democratic just 22 years ago.Nor have Democratic losses in the South been much worse than they were all over the country. To give just one egregious example, Democrats lost the Massachusetts statehouse this year  for the fifth time in their last seven tries.This is a historic shift. From 1931 to 1995, Democrats held majorities in the House of Representatives for all but four years and in the Senate for all but 12. On the state level, they held their own with (or outnumbered) Republicans in governorships and state legislatures for the vast majority of those 64 years.Its been a completely different story since 1994, however, and by next January, Democrats will not only be in the minority in both houses of Congress. They will likely hold 18 statehouses and both chambers in only 11 state legislatures.Suffering a series of historic defeats is not a sign that youre winning. The Democrats no longer please anyone much, neither their depressed base nor the less committed. Meanwhile, Republicans still manage to portray them as wild-eyed socialists. The party does take the White House more often now, but at the state level, and in the midterms, when a third of the senators and all representatives are up for election, the party has been hollowed out.THE trouble was that the Clinton-Obama strategy got things upside down from the start. Why try to cast yourselves as economic moderates and cultural progressives when the disparate elements of your coalition have little in common culturally, but are all struggling with the same wretched economy?The Democratic Party that shot to some 50 years of overwhelming electoral success beginning in the 1930s was helped in part by changing demographics. But many of those who built what George Packer calls the Roosevelt Republic started out as Republicans. Or Bull Moose Progressives, or Populists, or Socialists, or Communists, or simply the politically alienated and disengaged.The people who built that party rallied around big things  and usually big things they had come up with themselves. The reforms that Democrats embraced were almost all culled from grass-roots movements, and they were big enough to erase the lines between cultural and economic issues.Electrifying large swaths of the South and West changed how people lived and worked every day, how their cities grew and their farms survived. The G.I. Bill, to take another of a thousand examples, was intended to reward veterans and stave off a postwar depression, but it also opened up new possibilities of learning and travel (and therefore work) for millions of young men. This blurring of the cultural and the economic includes the civil rights legislation of the 1960s, which threw the weight of the federal government behind the struggle of African-Americans to go about their daily lives with hope and dignity and which did not alienate every white person in the South.Todays Democratic Party, with its finely calibrated, top-down fixes, does not offer anything so transformative. It seems scared of its own shadow, which is probably why it keeps reassuring itself that its triumph is inevitable. It needs instead to fully acknowledge just how devastating the recession was for working people everywhere in America, and what a generation of largely flat wages did to their aspirations even before that. It needs to take on hard fights, even against powerful forces, like pharmaceutical and insurance companies that presume to tell us the limits of what our health care can be or energy companies that would tell us what the worlds climate can endure. It means carving out a place of respect for working men and women in our globalized, finance-driven world.Invite us to dream a little. You dont build an enduring coalition out of who Americans are. You do it out of what we can be.",2014-11-16,marijuana

Today he makes his living playing video games and has 1.5 million YouTube subscribers.","LOS ANGELES  Matt Haag, a professional video game player, makes close to a million dollars a year sitting in a soft chair smashing buttons. It is a fantastically sweet gig, and he will do about anything to keep it.That is why, on a recent morning, he was in a bungalow in Venice Beach, Calif., making pancakes. Not just regular pancakes, but high-protein pancakes with ingredients like flax oil and chia seeds, whose balance of carbohydrates, fat and protein was created by a dietitian hired to teach him how to eat more healthily.The pancakes were just the beginning of a monthlong training session that Red Bull, one of Mr. Haags sponsors, organized for him and his team, OpTic Gaming. Over the next several days, he and his fellow players gave blood while riding stationary bicycles, had their brains mapped by a computer and attended an hourlong yoga class where they learned, among other things, how to stretch their throbbing wrists. The purpose of all this: to help them get better at blowing their opponents away in video games.Three years ago, he was flipping burgers at McDonalds. Today Mr. Haag, 22, skinny and blindingly pale, makes his living playing Call of Duty, a popular series of war games where players run around trying to shoot one another.Mr. Haag has 1.5 million YouTube subscribers along with a lucrative contract to live-stream his daily game sessions online. Known as Nadeshot (shorthand for grenade shot), he travels the world playing tournaments as spectators pack arenas to see him. At home near Chicago, he has a problem with fans showing up at his house.And while most pro gamers have to settle for modest sponsorships with companies that make things like game controllers and headphones, Mr. Haag last year also attracted Red Bull, the energy drink, which has traditionally built its marketing around skateboarders, motocross riders and other extreme-sports athletes. Mr. Haag is one of six people on its roster of e-sports players, and it is showering them with the same attention and training it has lavished on athletes who compete in the real world.For the trip to Los Angeles, Red Bull paid for Mr. Haag and his teammates to live in Venice Beach. During the day, the company shuttled them to its headquarters in Santa Monica for workouts and other training. At night, they lingered in a high-tech studio and played video games into the wee hours.Mr. Haag is the face of the growing business of video games as a spectator sport. Thanks to live tournaments and online video-streaming sites like Twitch, which Amazon bought for $1 billion in August, video games have become something to watch, not just play.But fans need someone to root for, and that is where Mr. Haag comes in. He has the requisite marks of a champion, like tournament victories and a compelling back story. And he certainly looks like a gamer: On the recent morning in Venice, his pancake-making attire consisted of a T-shirt, knee-length shorts and a backward baseball cap.Most important, though, is his compulsion to share his life  on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and YouTube. He is, more or less, the producer, director and star of his own reality show.Mr. Haags YouTube channel is in the top 1 percent of the 220,000 channels tracked by the analytics tool OpenSlate. Beyond YouTube, Mr. Haag has become the No. 1 player on MLG.TV, the site where people watch him play live.What makes him so watchable? A recent survey performed by Jeetendr Sehdev, a marketer who focuses on celebrity branding, said that teenagers found YouTube stars easier to relate to and more candid than famous people from places like Hollywood.Mr. Haags fans are right in line with this thinking. They seem to regard him as an exceptionally interesting friend.For example, Kasey Young, 21, of Cleveland has learned through social media and streaming that Mr. Haag drives a BMW, often eats at Chipotle and likes to say wallbong, a nonsense term he made up with friends. Mr. Young said he now finds himself saying wallbong at work at random times.If he knew me in real life, I feel like we would be really good friends, Mr. Young said.Mr. Haags videos, raw and unproduced, add to this feeling of intimacy. In addition to game video, his YouTube channel has regular updates in which he appears revealing and honest, posting, for example, travel diaries in which he sits on a hotel bed and tells fans about his day. He also put up an old home video in which his awkward younger self makes an alien face for the camera and then pulls up his T-shirt to show off his bony chest.Fans get to see interpersonal drama, like an episode last year when one of his OpTic comrades quit the team and accused Mr. Haag of blaming him for a tough tournament loss. And although he has a mostly male audience and has made his reputation as a video game killer, he is not afraid to be vulnerable.Fans know that Mr. Haags mother suffered from seizures for most of his life. When she died two years ago, he sat on a couch at home and recorded a YouTube video in which he thanked followers for their heartfelt messages on Twitter. He appeared distraught and shaken but also genuinely thankful.Both his fans and his detractors agree that this connection with his public is what sets Mr. Haag apart and makes him a peoples champion, as Sundance DiGiovanni, chief executive of Major League Gaming, a gaming league, put it.If youre talking about YouTube and fan outreach, hes the No. 1 player by far, said Mike Rufail, the owner of Team EnVyUs, OpTics chief rival. But in terms of raw talent, hes a top 15 player  I wouldnt put him in that top three or four guys.Mr. Haag doesnt care what his opponents think. He makes several times his fathers salary playing video games, and earlier this year bought a $3,000 watch. The only thing he wants is to hold onto his job.I think about my future probably at least 10 times a day, he said. I think about what if this all goes away one day? What if for some reason people just arent in your live stream tomorrow? What if people arent clicking on your YouTube videos tomorrow? What if your team doesnt work out and youre not performing that well and you have to quit competitively? What happens when you cant compete anymore and you want to retire because youre going insane?As Mr. Haag was growing up in the Chicago area, his parents did not need to worry about where he was on the weekends: He was usually upstairs playing video games. Parties made him anxious. And instead of marijuana or alcohol, the sugary rush of an energy drink was his drug of choice and still is.He was more of a loner, said his father, Jeff Haag, 50, a carpenter. He gamed a lot.Up in his bedroom, clutching an Xbox controller and surrounded by posters of the Chicago Bulls and Muhammad Ali, Mr. Haag had a place where he belonged. To friends and rivals he met through his Xbox, he was not a wallflower but a fierce competitor who could be a domineering teammate.Countless times I would put my head in the door and be like, Shut the hell up,  his father said. Hes like yelling at people when they werent doing exactly what they were supposed to be doing.Mr. Haags competitive career began seven years ago, when he was 15, with online tournaments organized through his Xbox, as well as small local contests held in banquet halls. Five years ago, his uncle took him to a tournament in Anaheim.The uncle, Greg Haag, remembered that the contest hall was hot and reeked of sweat and warm semiconductors, and that Mr. Haag was disappointed with his fourth-place finish.But the right people had already taken notice. Around the same time, Hector Rodriguez, a onetime insurance analyst who controlled a pickup team, OpTic Gaming, was trying to build it into a real business. He enticed Mr. Haag to join OpTic by offering to pay for travel and lodging at tournaments.Two years later, Mr. Haag went back to California for the Call of Duty championships, only this time with Mr. Rodriguez instead of his uncle. The $1 million purse made it one of the worlds most prominent gaming events.Mr. Haag led OpTic to a first-place finish and the $400,000 top prize. This brought him a wave of publicity and a $100,000 check.Today, Mr. Rodriguez acts as Mr. Haags agent, mentor and chief scheduler. Unlike most agents, he doesnt take a cut; Mr. Haag keeps all of his money from sponsors and contests. But Mr. Rodriguez owns the OpTic brand and controls the merchandise sales along with OpTics live stream and YouTube videos. In essence, this means he makes money from video ads and selling T-shirts.OpTic Gaming is now a big enough business that Mr. Rodriguez rents a house in Hoffman Estates, outside Chicago, where Mr. Haag and his teammates practice Call of Duty all day. Mr. Rodriguez lives a few miles away so he can make sure everyone is working hard  that they are busy playing video games.Mr. Haag and his teammates have become famous, which has made the house a target for pranks. Late last year, someone called 911 and claimed that armed intruders were breaking in, apparently hoping that the police would show up with guns drawn.It worked: Local police appeared with AR-15 rifles. But instead of bad guys, they found Mr. Haag and his roommates playing video games near a stack of pizzas. The pizzas had been ordered earlier in the evening, and were also a prank. Mr. Haag said he and his roommates paid for them because they felt bad for the delivery man.The day after the pancake lessons, Mr. Haag was in Red Bulls game studio wearing a contraption like a swimming cap that was full of wires and attached to a computer. The idea was to see how his brain functioned under the stress of video game combat. This would help Red Bulls trainers and sports therapists design exercises to help him stay calm and shoot better.To perform the test, a Red Bull sports technologist had Mr. Haag fire up Call of Duty and start shooting. Whether or not this will help his performance, it paid instant dividends for his image. The first thing Mr. Haag did after the test was post a photo of himself in the cap of wires to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.Mr. Haag said, Social media is the most important part of what I do. Even though Mr. Haag calls himself a professional video game player, he is really an online video star. The money he wins in contests is tiny compared with the money he makes from his live stream and YouTube videos.His command over his audience is great enough that Major League Gaming recently enticed him to leave Twitch and stream exclusively with its site. He is on track to make around $700,000 from streaming and his YouTube channel this year. Throw in his other sponsorships and contest winnings, and he is well on his way to a million-dollar year.But Mr. Haag is paid per viewer, so he has to keep producing.One night at Red Bulls studios, he played Call of Duty over the Internet for his fans. When Mr. Haag competes, he sits upright in his chair and screams back and forth with his teammates in a way that is reminiscent of a Wall Street trading desk. But this night was more casual: He was jumping from game to game and playing with whoever was online right then.He had filled the stream with hip-hop so his viewers could hear beats and rhyming lyrics over the din of digital gunfire and grenades. His face was lit up by a pair of screens, one with Call of Duty and another with a rolling list of fan questions like How was the Brain Testing? and Nadeshot can you say Whats up Blake? He talked for the entire five or so hours that he played  about the game, about hip-hop, about how his desire for an In-N-Out burger was fighting with his newfound resolve to eat healthily. At times he sang rap lyrics.It looked like a cross between social media and talk radio, if talk radio had a visual component where a bunch of digital characters shoot one another. And as a form of entertainment, it seemed perfectly suited to a world where people jump around browser windows, watching a video in one, checking Facebook in another.The Internet, with its infinite space and insatiable demand, has turned Mr. Haags pastime into a drudging obligation. But it is better than McDonalds, which is why he spends so much time worrying that his game career will end and that he will have to figure something else out.Mr. Haag may be only one year above the legal drinking age, but his fan base is largely teenagers. Just as he and other gamers have upset the media landscape by teaching children to watch video games like TV, they live with the near-constant threat that their audience will abandon them for something or someone else.On another evening, Mr. Haag, bags under his eyes, wanted to take a night off and go back to the house in Venice. He asked his teammates if they wanted to go with him. They declined.Instead of letting his teammates siphon off fans who could be watching him, Mr. Haag changed his plan and stayed for yet another marathon session of streaming.I would love to go home and hang out, but you gotta do what you gotta do, he said. Cant complain too much, playing video games for a living.",2014-11-16,marijuana

Youre surrounded by these enormous circles of white light, but at the center is this almost Rube Goldberg contraption.I think its the place in the city where one might feel the most like they were in the Mark Helprin novel Winters Tale.Like you might pass an hour in the fog of passing time and walk downstairs and find horse-drawn carriages and hoop skirts, he continued. You wouldnt be surprised if time had somehow reversed itself.In the present day, the clock was in danger of being relocated, but the developers reconsidered.Mr. Dunlap said any clock-focused tour of the city should include the old Met Life tower on Madison Square and at Grand Central Terminal, with its information kiosk clock and the clock below the statue of Mercury outside.True clock lovers may also travel to Dante Park, across from Lincoln Center, to see the Time Sculpture by Philip Johnson, and linger beneath Maya Lins Eclipsed Time, a lunar-themed timepiece at Penn Station.Heres what else you need to know.

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/nyregion/shift-on-marijuana-policy-was-a-long-time-coming-and-too-late-for-one-man.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png,"Shift on Marijuana Policy Was a Long Time Coming, and Too Late for One Man","Police will no longer file charges against people who display small amounts of marijuana in public, though that has not helped Anthony Welfare, who lost his job in August over a misdemeanor.","Anthony Welfare closely followed this weeks news that New York City no longer will bring criminal charges against people who are seen with small amounts of marijuana, as long as they are not smoking it in public.I find that funny, Mr. Welfare, 28, said.But not hah-hah funny.Not LOL funny.After seven years of steady work, Mr. Welfare automatically lost his job as a school bus driver in August when a police officer swore under oath that he saw a pipe in the center console of a car in which Mr. Welfare was a passenger. The pipe had a residue of marijuana, the officer said.Therefore, everyone in the car  the driver and his passenger, Mr. Welfare  was openly displaying marijuana, a misdemeanor.Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner William J. Bratton on Monday said police officers would no longer file misdemeanor charges against people who displayed small amounts of marijuana in public. Instead, the officers would charge them with merely possessing the pot, a violation, which is like getting a traffic ticket.The difference is not trivial. The ticket would not have cost Mr. Welfare a job that paid him about $40,000 a year. He was arrested on Aug. 16, the first time he had ever had any trouble with the law. That was a Saturday. By Monday, the bus company he worked for had been notified, and he was fired on the spot. His experience was chronicled last month in this column. (At the time, Mr. Welfare asked that his last name not be revealed.) Since then, the charge against him has been dismissed and his record is once again clean. But he has not yet been able to regain his old job, and to date, he has lost nearly $10,000 in wages.Now the change goes into effect  after what I just been through, Mr. Welfare said.For the most part, the policy change wont affect white pot users, who were not likely to be stopped and told to turn out their pockets, or to be accused of openly displaying marijuana  or its residue  in the center console of a car. Pot in someones pocket is mere possession, not a crime; having it in the open is a misdemeanor. Tricking people into displaying it was called manufacturing misdemeanors. For much of Mayor Michael R. Bloombergs administration, such misdemeanor marijuana arrests took place at the rate of one every 12 minutes, or 50,000 a year. Overwhelmingly, those charged were black, like Mr. Welfare, or Latino. Most had never been in trouble with the law.Mr. Bloomberg and his aides scoffed at the notion that the arrests were a big deal, saying most of those cases were dismissed and sealed. Indeed, that is what happened with Mr. Welfares case  after he was fired. A pot charge can cost people jobs that require clean criminal records, like security guards for city and state agencies, or home health care attendants. For immigrants, there can be other harrowing consequences: A Liberian man was held in an immigration jail for a year pending deportation on a marijuana case before the charge was downgraded, said Mitch Briskey, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society.How did this go on so long? Part of it, Mr. Bratton said, is that a large number of public complaints come to the police about open pot dealing or smoking.But there is more. During the stop-and-frisk era, police precincts set numerical goals for activity by officers, a standard management productivity tool in all lines of work. It was an article of faith that the stops would help drive down crime. But the numbers became an end unto themselves, a toxic force propelling a machine that devoured the people it was supposed to keep safe.Millions of searches yielded only a tiny amount of criminality  and a majority of it was the spuriously manufactured public displays of marijuana. Now that the searches have been curtailed, crime has continued to drop.The Bronx Defenders, which represents poor people, tried in 2012 to fight the marijuana arrests on the grounds that the searches were illegal. In 54 test cases, which lasted an average of eight months, not once were they able to get a hearing before the cases were dismissed anyway.For Mr. Welfare, contesting the search would have kept the case open and delayed the possibility of his return to work, said his lawyer, Marquita Johnson of the Legal Aid Society.No single rogue committed an overt act of bigotry to create a grotesque separate regimen of punishment for blacks and Latinos. The racism was mixed into the concrete that held up the system. It richly deserves the sledgehammer that Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Bratton are now swinging.",2014-11-14,marijuana

Mike Beebes decision followed an October recommendation by the Arkansas Parole Board that Kyle Beebes application for a pardon was with merit.,"Gov. Mike Beebe of Arkansas, before leaving office in January, plans to issue a pardon to his son, who was convicted of a felony drug offense more than a decade ago.The governors decision followed an October recommendation by the Arkansas Parole Board that Kyle Beebes application for a pardon was with merit. Mr. Beebe was convicted in 2003 of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, and his sentence included three years of probation.At the time of my arrest, I was living in a fantasy world, not reality, Kyle Beebe, now 34, wrote in a letter to his father that was included in his June 21 pardon application. I was young and dumb. At that time in my life, I felt like I was missing something, and I tried to fill that emptiness by selling drugs.The letter concluded: Mr. Governor, if you could please find it in your heart to forgive me, I will forever be grateful. I thank you for your consideration.The governor, in an interview with KATV-TV, said that he would have granted the pardon earlier in his tenure, which will conclude in January because of term limits, but waited because his son had not submitted an application for clemency.I would have done it a long time ago if hed have asked, the governor said, but he took his sweet time about asking.Mr. Beebes spokesman, Matt DeCample, on Thursday denied that the governor had acted improperly when he made the decision on his sons pardon, one of more than 700 he has granted since he became governor in 2007.He held his son to the same standard that he holds anyone else to, Mr. DeCample said. If you took the sticker with his sons name off the file, it would look like a lot of other files that have led to pardons.The governor, Mr. DeCample said, has a strong belief in second chances.The seven-member Parole Board said the authorities in White County, where Kyle Beebe was convicted, had not objected to his application for clemency. Six board members supported Mr. Beebes application; the seventh, Dawne Vandiver, did not vote on the application.The governor, an immensely popular Democrat who was state attorney general at the time of his sons conviction, has been embroiled in a controversy about pardons for more than a week.Mr. Beebe said on Nov. 5 that he intended to pardon Michael E. Jackson, who was convicted in a Faulkner County court of Internet stalking of a child.Mr. Jackson is a friend of Mr. Beebes family, and the authorities in Faulkner County, including the sheriff and the prosecutor, opposed his bid for clemency.Although Mr. Beebe defended his plans, his office said Wednesday that officials were reviewing an affidavit in a Faulkner County child-custody case concerning Mr. Jackson.While the accusations are unrelated to that conviction, and there does not appear to be any criminal investigation into the matter, Jacksons pardon will not be granted until, and unless, the accusations are found to be untrue, the governors office said in a statement.",2014-11-14,marijuana

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/nyregion/liberals-growing-frustrated-with-bill-de-blasio.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/13/nyregion/MAYOR1/MAYOR1-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg,De Blasio Balancing His Promises With Reality ,"Mayor Bill de Blasio is championing liberal values nationally, but at home, he is being criticized by the same police critics whose cause he backed during his campaign.","Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday issued a broadside to national Democrats, urging the party to embrace liberal values and attributing its midterm losses to a lack of fidelity to the progressive cause.But at home, things are more complicated.This week, Mr. de Blasio frustrated some liberal advocates by failing to brief them beforehand on changes to the Police Departments enforcement of marijuana laws  an effort that was subsequently dismissed as a sugar pill by Cornel West and others who said the overhaul did not go far enough in addressing the concerns of black and Hispanic New Yorkers.Now, Mr. de Blasio is having to grapple with the same coalition of police critics whose cause he embraced during the mayoral campaign. He has concerns about legislation to be introduced in the City Council on Thursday that would set strict new rules for officers, including a requirement that they receive explicit consent to search suspects in some instances, a move sure to anger the departments rank and file.And in a sign of the critics growing frustration with their onetime champion, an influential police reform group recently cut ties with a public affairs firm that is closely identified with Mr. de Blasio, seeking to be unconstrained from exerting greater pressure on his administration.It is an intriguing moment for a mayor determined to be a beacon of the new left, but who must balance bold rhetoric with the realities of bringing reform in the complex city he governs.On Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio, who swept into office promising to reduce income inequality and promote racial equity, published an op-ed article urging Democrats around the country  many in far more conservative environs than New York City  to adopt his own policy priorities for the 2016 elections.This year, too many Democratic candidates lost sight of those core principles, opting instead to clip their progressive wings, Mr. de Blasio wrote.The essay, on The Huffington Post, was part of a daylong tour of news media outlets favored by the mayors liberal base: He was interviewed by the left-leaning MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes, and he called in to the Rev. Al Sharptons radio show, saying Democrats should be forceful about endorsing progressive ideas.That is the very advice Mr. de Blasio is hearing from some liberals in New York, who say they are disappointed at what they call an incremental approach to the police reforms he campaigned on.Have race relations improved? I cant say, to be perfectly honest, said Antonio Reynoso, a city councilman from Brooklyn who said he wanted faster change at the Police Department.For Mr. de Blasio, who points to an emphasis on training and a reduction in police stops as evidence he is changing the Police Department, pressure from the left is to be expected.Theres always going to be voices, advocates, activists calling for you to do more on a whole host of issues, he said, and always be people who say everything you do is going too far.The mayor, whose poll numbers have stayed generally high, would be likely to lose support from some centrists if he fully adopted measures that advocates like Mr. Reynoso are proposing, which could drastically alter the rules of engagement for police officers.Mr. Reynoso is co-sponsoring a bill that would require officers to explain that searches can be refused without a warrant or probable cause. Officers would have to identify themselves, provide a phone number for a citizens complaint board and get objective proof of consent before searching any person when there is no legal justification.The sponsors say the measure would reduce police intimidation, especially among minorities. But the bill has caught the ire of police unions, and Mr. de Blasio said on Wednesday that he was reluctant to support it.I certainly have concerns, the mayor said at a news conference in Lower Manhattan. We obviously have to protect the rights of our people, but we also have to make sure we are not in any way undermining the ability of law enforcement to do its job.Those remarks are in keeping with Mr. de Blasios more moderate approach to changes at the Police Department, where he has defended the broken windows approach  stopping small crimes to prevent big ones  despite criticism that it disproportionately hurts minorities.Mr. de Blasio kept up his balancing act this week, when he said that low-level marijuana possession would merit a ticket, not an arrest.The move drew criticism from left and right: Police unions said he was going soft on crime; liberals said the change would not keep minorities from being given more tickets than whites.Were going to continue to see serious problems and serious racial disparities, said Joo-Hyun Kang, director of Communities United for Police Reform, which led efforts against stopping and frisking.It would have been good to see him do something really sweeping, said Gabriel Sayegh, a managing director at the Drug Policy Alliance, which seeks to ease marijuana laws. Mr. Sayeghs group was one of several that consulted with city officials about the policy but complained they were not told that an announcement was imminent.On Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio said he could not be more proud with his administrations work on police reform.I would say to any of my critics, with respect, those who think we have not been fast enough, he said: Look at any other 10-month time frame in New York City government history and tell me where you see more movement in terms of real progress in police-community relations.Liberals still want to wait and see. Christina Greer, a professor at Fordham, has criticized Mr. de Blasio for moving slowly on addressing concerns about the police and race. On Wednesday, she said his movement on marijuana regulations was a positive sign.Hes not going to please everyone; thats also the job of mayor, she said. At least he can say, Im moving the needle.",2014-11-13,marijuana

Her latest book, Lets Be Less Stupid, publishes next summer. She says she reads the paper on her computer late at night. I know it is very unfashionable to dislike paper, she says, but I could never get the hang of folding The Times (it always looked as if I was trying to make a hat for a childrens birthday party).  Also, who has time to look for the continuation of the story on Page A16?Does the late-night, online way you read the paper affect what you read? My approach has made me fairly malnourished, news-wise, in the same way that someone who eats only at buffets tends to concentrate on dessert.   Also, it means that I am never sure when anything happened. Often, I know about a development in a story or about the death of a famous person hours before the news is printed in the morning paper. Its like being a visitor from the future.  On the other hand, I sometimes read old news without knowing it was written weeks ago, so I have to be careful not to say things like, Hey, can you believe the Visigoths sacked Rome?! Are there kinds of articles that you always read or that you reliably dont? When a story breaks in the news  say, a junta seizes power in a country you cant find on a map  you have to make a snap decision about whether it will have legs or whether you will never see a report on that subject again.  If it is a story that will become major, you must get in on the ground floor, or otherwise there will be too many political factions and similar sounding names and you will never catch up enough to know whats going on.   Its like buying stock in a current event  you want something thats going to pay off in the long term.  Decades ago, I made a bad judgment call about the crisis in the Mideast, thinking it would blow over in a few days, and consequently, Ive never been straight about, for instance, Hamas versus Hezbollah versus P.L.O. versus Fatah. You can ask me anything about the  Symbionese Liberation Army or the Y2K problem, though.  There was a small not-much-to-it article this week about education in Nepal. I read every word, and now, if things go well for Nepal (which is to say not well), I am poised to become a pundit on Katmandu.And are there kinds of articles you are happy to skip? There are some articles I really appreciate because I dont feel guilty about skipping them. How to Cook a Thanksgiving Dinner was an example this week. Ditto the entire sports section except for occasional baseball news.  Ditto weather events, such as record-breaking cold waves, that take over the headlines, giving me a news holiday.  Nowadays, so much of what I read I forget the next day. In order to minimize this kind of brain spillage, I have developed a strategy for reading a hard news story that involves figuring out when the article has moved on to details Ill never remember and stopping there. Editorials. Do you read them?  Do they ever change your mind?I am a knee-jerk liberal and I want to stay that way no matter how compelling the argument on the other side is. I also have a habit of agreeing with whatever I read last. Therefore, I avoid editorials written by conservative columnists. The libertarians often make some good points and many of them write articulately and persuasively, so I never read anything by them. I basically stick with Krugman, Bruni and Dowd. Obits. Do you read them with special interest? Everyone I know likes obituaries, and Im no different. I feel, though, that Paragraph No. 2, the one that contains the cause of death, should be expanded. I am sure I am not the only one who wants to know the first symptom of the deadly disease. Also, if you could include the deceaseds last words, that would be helpful.Is The Times a good source of material for a humor writer (you)?I am always on the lookout for stories with comedy potential. Unfortunately, so is every other humorist. This week it was disclosed that yet another former Navy SEAL claimed credit for firing the shot that killed Osama. I barely read that item because I knew Andy Borowitz, who writes a hilarious humor column for The New Yorker, would deal with it (as would late-night talk show hosts, who are also funnier than I am).  I couldnt resist reading the amusing and intriguing squib, however, about the invention of a color that is the blackest black. It is called Vantablack. Doesnt that sound like the opposite of Vanna White?  Any good news in the paper this week? This was a good week for fortuitous accidents, which made me happy because I am careless and I like to think something good might result. There was an obituary of the guy who invented CorningWare not on purpose and also a letter to the editor attributing the fall of the Berlin Wall to blunders made by Eastern European politicians.  On the other hand, Paul Krugman says that Obamacare might be felled by a typo in a clause of the Affordable Care Act. This makes me think that if they dont make auto-correct illegal (or should I say: Room swallows next cone dip photocopier eject the paint penis), there might not be any laws left. Of course, theyd probably end up banning automobiles instead, which would be O.K. with me. Last word? The story I most wish Id read when I was in college was the one reporting that New York City police will soon no longer arrest you for possessing a small amount of marijuana. This is like hearing from your parents long after youve moved away from home that you no longer have a curfew. ",2014-11-12,marijuana

Former President George W. Bush made a rare detour into public policy to criticize President Obamas plans in Afghanistan, and Senator Mark Begich appears to have been defeated by the Republican Dan Sullivan in Alaska. But first up, members of Congress return for a session that, for many of them, will be a long goodbye.The lame-duck session that opens on Wednesday on Capitol Hill will bring dozens of congressional careers  the sensational as well as the short-lived  to a close.With more than 50 House members and nearly a dozen senators leaving either by their choice or by the voters, colleagues will spend considerable floor time paying tribute to the dearly departing who left their imprint one way or another.Theres Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who served a record 29 full terms and wrote reams of legislation. And there is Representative Vance McAllister, the Louisiana Republican who served 12 months and was done in by a videotaped extramarital kiss.On the Democratic side, veteran heavyweights like Representatives George Miller and Henry A. Waxman, both of California, will be casting their final votes along with Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa, Carl Levin of Michigan and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia. Lame-duck Republicans include Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, the bane of federal spending, and Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.Several conservatives at the forefront of the House Tea Party movement are also exiting stage right, notably Representative Michele Bachmann, the Minnesota congresswoman who founded the House Tea Party caucus.Senate results are still outstanding in Louisiana, and vote-counting dragged on for a week in Alaska. Hopeful for more lame ducks, Republicans planned ahead and had already invited Alaskas Mr. Sullivan to attend party organizational meetings this week. Carl HulseFormer President George W. Bush has largely stayed out of current policy debates, but as he kicked off a book tour on Tuesday, he expressed concern that withdrawing all American troops from Afghanistan would create an island of instability.In an interview in College Station, Tex., on Tuesday after he presented 41: A Portrait of My Father, his new biography of the elder President Bush, the younger Mr. Bush offered support for President Obamas decision to wage war on the Islamic State, but took issue with his successors plan to pull out of Afghanistan.I do worry that a lack of U.S. presence in Afghanistan will create a vacuum, he said.I understand peoples fatigue and stuff, he added, but the question should be, Is it in the interest of the United States that young girls and women dont suffer?

That withdrawal was actually included in an agreement that Mr. Bush struck with Iraq before leaving office, but some of his former aides have said that Mr. Obama should have tried harder to negotiate a new agreement.Im not going to criticize our president, Mr. Bush said, when asked about that passage. But what I will say is I think he set a necessary goal of defeating the Islamic State. Whether or not the current strategy works, weve got to hope it does work.

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/opinion/thomas-edsall-the-demise-of-the-white-democratic-voter.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/edsall-circular/edsall-circular-superJumbo-v2.png,The Demise of the White Democratic Voter,"In the midterm elections, three out of five whites voted for a Republican House candidate. Why does this keep happening?","It has not escaped the notice of political analysts that 72 percent of whites without college degrees  a rough proxy for what we used to call the white working class  believe that the U.S. economic system generally favors the wealthy. Or that on Nov. 4, these same men and women voted for Republican House candidates 64-34.Similarly, the overwhelmingly white electorates of Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota voted decisively in referendums to raise the minimum wage while simultaneously voting for Republicans, whose party has adamantly rejected legislation to raise the minimum wage.There is an ongoing debate among politicians, political scientists and partisans of both parties over the dismal support of Democratic candidates among whites. Does it result from ideological differences, racial animosity or a perception among many whites that they are excluded from a coalition of minorities, the poor, single women of all races, gays and other previously marginalized constituencies?Arguably, the poor Democratic showing among whites does not represent naked race prejudice, as Obamas election and re-election attest. But it can be seen as a reflection of substantial material interests that affect the very voters who carry greater weight in low turnout midterm Congressional elections.Whites as a whole, who made up 75 percent of this years electorate, voted for Republican House candidates by a 24-point margin, 62-38, the exact same margin by which they supported Republican candidates in the 2010 midterms. In 2006, when opposition to President George W. Bush was intense, Republicans won white voters by eight points, 52-44.The opposition of whites to the Democratic Party is visible not only in voting behavior, but in general opposition to key Democratic policy initiatives, most tellingly in hostility toward the Affordable Care Act. A November 2013 National Journal poll found, for example, that 58 percent of whites said Obamacare would make things worse for people like you and your family, more than double the 25 percent that said that Obamacare would make things better.Asked whether the Affordable Care Act would make things better or worse for the country at large, 60 percent of whites said worse and 35 percent of whites said better.Obamacare shifts health care benefits and tax burdens from upper-income Americans to lower-income Americans, and from largely white constituencies to beneficiaries disproportionately made up of racial and ethnic minorities. The program increases levies on the overwhelmingly white affluent by raising taxes on households making more than $250,000.To achieve its goals, Obamacare reduces spending on Medicare by $500 billion over 10 years, according to the Medicare board of trustees, which oversees the finances of the program. Medicare serves a population that is 77 percent white. Even as reductions in Medicare spending fall disproportionately on white voters, the savings are being used to finance Obamacare, which includes a substantial expansion of Medicaid. Medicaid recipients are overwhelmingly poor and, in 2013, were 41 percent white and 59 percent minority.In addition to expanding Medicaid, the overall goal of Obamacare is to provide health coverage for the uninsured, a population that, in 2010 when the program was enacted, was 47 percent white, and 53 percent black, Hispanic, Asian-American and other minorities.Its not hard to see, then, why a majority of white midterm voters withheld support from Democrats and cast their votes for Republicans.Republicans are not satisfied with winning 62 percent of the white vote. To counter the demographic growth of Democratic constituencies whose votes threaten Republican success in high-turnout presidential elections, Republicans have begun a concerted effort to rupture the partisan loyalty of the remaining white Democratic voters. Their main target is socially liberal, fiscally conservative suburbanites, the weakest reeds in the Democratic coalition. These middle-income white voters do not share the acute economic needs of so-called downscale Democratic voters and they are less reliant on government services.The Republican strategy to win over these more culturally tolerant, but still financially pressed, white voters is to continue to focus on material concerns  on anxiety about rising tax burdens, for example  while downplaying the preoccupation of many of the most visible Republicans with social, moral and cultural repression.The current effectiveness of the anti-tax strategy was demonstrated in the unexpected victory of Larry Hogan, the Republican gubernatorial candidate in deep blue Maryland, who defeated Anthony Brown, the highly favored Democratic lieutenant governor.The average Marylander sees a governor and legislature willing to impose record tax increases on the rest of us that we dont need, dont want and cant afford, Hogan declared at the start of his campaign and repeated relentlessly until Election Day.Hogan won by decisively carrying all the majority white suburbs surrounding Baltimore city, including Howard County, a former bastion of suburban Democratic strength.In Colorado, Cory Gardner, the Republican Senate nominee, joined the Republican assault on Obamacare and taxes:Significantly, Gardner also stiff-armed the Christian right on issues of contraception and abortion in his successful two-point win over Mark Udall, the Democratic incumbent. Gardner highlighted a more culturally tolerant approach when he endorsed over the counter access to the morning after pill  a form of contraception many in the right to life movement consider a form of abortion  and when he renounced past sponsorship of a personhood constitutional amendment titled The Life Begins at Conception Act.In a mea culpa comment rarely heard in campaigns, Gardner told The Denver Post:Despite this, not only did the Christian right stick with Gardner, but white evangelicals provided his margin of victory. These religious voters, who made up 25 percent of the Colorado midterm electorate, voted for Gardner over Udall by a resounding 70 points, 83 to 13. This margin was enough to compensate for Udalls 20-point victory, 57 percent to 37 percent, among the remaining 75 percent of the Colorado electorate.The clear implication of these results for Republican candidates running in 2016 and beyond is that you can break with conservative orthodoxy on some issues to better appeal to a general election electorate without paying the price of losing white Christian support.If Republicans are successful in toning down their candidates, it will take from Democrats a weapon that has proved highly successful in state and federal elections: demonizing Republican Party candidates as a collection of knuckle-dragging Neanderthals.The Democrats portrayal of Republicans has served to motivate both Democratic voters and donors, especially suburban white Democrats, by tapping into their anger and fear of a morally intrusive Republican Party.Anger in politics can play a particularly vital role, motivating some people to participate in ways they might ordinarily not, according to Nicholas Valentino, a professor of communication studies and political science at the University of Michigan, and the lead author of Election Nights Alright for Fighting: The Role of Emotions in Political Participation, a 2011 study of voter motivation.A Democratic tactic designed to focus on mobilizing white voters  the sustained effort led by Senator Harry Reid to demonize the Koch brothers  has not yet, by most accounts, paid off.As they have after past Election Day defeats, Democrats can hope for Republican infighting between the establishment and Tea Party wings. Such internecine conflict, in fact, has already begun.Democrats can also count on greater voter participation by their loyalists in a presidential year, and on advantageous demographic trends: The share of the electorate held by older and working-class whites, the core of the Republican Party, diminishes every year, while Democratic constituencies continue to grow.In the aftermath of the 2012 election, the obligation to change fell upon the Republican Party. With the support of Karl Rove, the Republican National Committee, under its chairman, Reince Priebus, pulled the party to the center, with Priebus producing the famous autopsy report calling for political moderation. To the surprise of many, the partys candidates this year took key suggestions to heart.Insofar as the Republican Party successfully sandpapers its sharp edges, the necessity for change will now shift to the Democrats. Most recently, this kind of metamorphosis was accomplished by Bill Clintons 1992 Southern governors strategy presidential campaign when he defied liberal orthodoxy on such issues as welfare and the death penalty.One question presents itself: how transformative a political leader is Hillary Clinton? Can she avoid entrapment by divisive issues of key importance to competing wings of the center-left coalition: L.G.B.T. rights; marijuana legalization; climate change; gun control; racial profiling; fracking; pension rights for public employee unions; citizenship for undocumented immigrants; and the ever pressing social welfare needs of the countrys poor?In May 2008, with Obama taking the lead, Hillary Clinton committed to continue the race for the nurse on her second shift, for the worker on the line, for the waitress on her feet, for the small-business owner, the farmer, the teacher, the coal miner, the trucker, the soldier, the veteran.As James Oliphant, the National Journals White House correspondent wrote:The white vote in the years since 1992 has become consistently more committed to Republican candidates. Mitt Romney carried whites by a 20-point margin, 59-39, larger than either John McCain, 12 points, or George W. Bush, 17 points.Clinton has her work cut out for her, especially if the Republican nominee heeds the advice of party leaders and makes a concerted effort to further erode  by whatever means necessary  white Democratic support.",2014-11-12,marijuana

Though the charges are often dismissed, the arrests can cost people their jobs and access to housing or the prospect of joining the armed forces.Mayor de Blasio tackled part of this problem on Monday when he announced a new policy under which people found with tiny amounts of marijuana would typically be issued a ticket akin to a traffic summons, instead of being arrested and charged with a crime.The policy, however, does not reach the fundamental problem of discriminatory policing that disproportionately affects minorities, even though whites use marijuana at similar levels. Moreover, by shifting marijuana cases from the regular courts into the summons system, which does not identify the accused by race, the city loses the ability to track the disparate impact that petty marijuana prosecutions are having on minority communities. The city has to make the summons system more transparent.This is not the first effort to reduce unnecessary marijuana arrests. In the 1970s, the State Legislature barred police from arresting people for possessing trivial amounts of the drug unless it was being smoked or displayed in public. The number of arrests plummeted to fewer than 1,000 in 1990. But, by 2011, the number had risen astronomically to 50,000. Part of the increase was related to the police illegally charging people with public possession after tricking them into emptying their pockets during street stops.Arrests dropped to 28,600 last year after the police commissioner at the time, Raymond Kelly, told officers to stay within the law. Mr. de Blasio felt compelled to reduce arrests even further after a report last month showed that in some months his Police Department made more low-level marijuana arrests than were made during comparable periods in the Bloomberg administration. The analysis also showed that 86 percent of the people arrested were black or Latino.Under the new program, people found in possession 25 grams or less of marijuana that is in public view  and not being smoked  would, in most cases, be given a ticket. Thats better than being arrested. But a trip to summons court can also lead to a permanent record and a nightmare encounter with the police system. Courts can issue bench warrants for people who miss court dates, who then can be arrested, handcuffed, fingerprinted and held for days in jail waiting to go before a judge.A class-action suit pending in federal court has also raised serious questions about the fairness of the summons system as a whole. The plaintiffs in the case, Stinson v. City of New York, assert that nearly 700,000 summonses were issued in recent years by officers who lacked probable cause and were acting under pressure to meet quotas.On the face of it, the new marijuana enforcement system should be more rational than the old. But it is still flawed. The only way to judge its success or failure is to find out what happens to the people who are exposed to it. And that requires making the summons court system much more transparent.",2014-11-12,marijuana
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/opinion/are-democrats-losing-the-youth-vote.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png,Are Democrats Losing the Youth Vote?,"The G.O.P. is gaining young voters, because it lost the culture war.","ATLANTA  ONCE again, the youth vote went firmly Democratic in last weeks election  but the actual numbers, combined with some telling survey results, indicate that the partys grip on the young may be loosening.Six years ago, voters aged 18 to 29 favored Barack Obama over his Republican opponent, Senator John McCain, by a ratio of two to one and justified Times announcement that 2008 was The Year of the Youth Vote. Two years previously, in midterm races for the House, the same demographic went for Democrats 60 percent to 38 percent.In 2012, President Obamas advantage slipped, but under-30 voters still gave him a 23-point edge, 60 percent to 37 percent. No wonder this year the president appeared two days before the election at Temple University, where he exhorted the crowd, So I need all of you to go grab your friends, grab your classmates... I need you to vote.But it turned out that 2012 was no anomaly. Turnout for young voters this year was around 21 percent, typical for midterms, but the breakdown was disappointing for the left: Exit poll data show that young voters backed House Democrats 54 percent to 43 percent, half the advantage of 2006 and two percentage points lower than in 2010.The Senate contests were last fought in 2008, a presidential year, and here the plummet was startling. In North Carolina the rate at which young people voted Democratic fell to 54 percent this year from 71 percent in 2008. Virginia saw it slide to 50 percent from 71 percent. In Arkansas and Alaska, a majority of young voters went Republican.Given recent surveys of youth attitudes, though, we shouldnt be surprised. Last April, Harvards Institute of Politics found a growing gap in party loyalty between younger millennials and older ones. In 2010, 18-to-24-year-olds chose to self-identify as Democrat over Republican by 15 percentage points, or 38 percent to 23 percent. By 2014, that gap had narrowed to 10 percentage points, 35 to 25, even as older millennials, between 25 and 29 years old, maintained that 15-percentage-point split. Whats more, 18-to-24-year-olds who called themselves moderate, not liberal or conservative, climbed five points, to 31 percent.A Pew Research Center survey released in March found that while 40 percent of millennials in 2006 considered themselves political independents, now 50 percent of them do. Moreover, 31 percent believe there is not a great deal of difference in what Republicans and Democrats stand for.Strangely, the same surveys show that 18-to-29-year-olds are just as liberal as ever on social issues: They roundly support same-sex marriage and legalization of marijuana, and, according to Pew, They are more likely than older generations to say they support an activist government. What gives?Put simply, the social landscape looks much different now than it did just a few years ago. Millennials mostly dont remember the first election of George W. Bush, which frightened secular liberals into believing that theocratic forces were gathering. And how can they credit a war on women when they see women outnumber men in undergraduate enrollments? Students at nonreligious colleges can pass through four years without hearing a word against marriage equality.So, while Lena Dunham warned in an email blast, The crazy and depressing truth is that there are people running for office right now who could actually affect your life. Particularly your sex life. Particularly if youre a woman, many 22-year-olds just dont see the danger. Its not that they have become less socially liberal; its that social conservatism is a paper tiger. Liberalism has won so handily in the culture and courts that it no longer serves as a rallying cry.When it comes to young voters, liberal politicians are victims of their culture-war success. They have pressed a laissez-faire posture in moral and private matters, and have won. But millennials have adopted not the posture of their liberal elders that fostered group identity (be it union member, disenfranchised minority or F.D.R. Democrat), but a soft libertarianism that makes individual preference king.That pose carries over to politics and blunts lasting commitments to any political organization. Indeed, another finding of youth surveys is mistrust of institutions of any kind, including political parties. Once social conservatism was defeated, the set allegiance to Democratic campaigns was bound to erode.This doesnt mean that the youth vote is going Republican. Party identity is meaningless to half of them, and that rate will rise. They pose a new kind of constituency, fluctuating and unpredictable, socially liberal but willing to back conservatives now and then, interested less in party ideologies than in actual individuals put forward as candidates, such as the cool young black senator in 2008. They form one-sixth to one-eighth of the electorate. If politicians take anything away from 2014, they must find a way to cultivate these voters that moves beyond party labels  indeed, beyond identity politics entirely.",2014-11-12,marijuana

When officers arrived, the men were unresponsive and were taken to Lincoln Medical Center, where they were pronounced dead.The person of interest, who was not identified, had not been arrested or charged as of Monday evening, the police said.The police said that they had not confirmed a motive in the deaths, but that they were investigating whether it was a retaliatory shooting.Neighbors said the shootings appeared to be retaliation after the two victims sat on a cars bumper late on Sunday while it was parked on the street. Four residents of the building who knew the victims described a similar situation in which the car owner took the mens behavior as a sign of disrespect. The residents declined to give their names because of fears of retaliation.At a news conference on Monday about marijuana arrest policies, Robert K. Boyce, the chief of detectives, said that investigators quickly took into custody the person they believe committed the crime. They also recovered a gun at the scene.Chief Boyce said that the motive was not yet known and that it was too early to speculate on what led to the shootings.Mr. Fennell lived in the building where he was killed, the police said. Mr. Page lived about two miles away. The police said they were found shot in the elevator, on a lower floor of the building.On Monday, the family of Mr. Fennell gathered in the driveway of the fire station across the street. His mother said she was grieving.After what happened, were just trying to keep it together, said another woman standing with her, adding that it was Mr. Fennells mothers birthday.Neighbors said the buildings were known as the Vietnam Projects because of the violence there.A man who lived there said he was shocked over Mondays shootings.Over a car, over sitting on a car? he said.

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/nyregion/concerns-in-criminal-justice-system-as-new-york-city-eases-marijuana-policy.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/10/multimedia/deblasio-weed-policy/deblasio-weed-policy-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg,Concerns in Criminal Justice System as New York City Eases Marijuana Policy,"Under the change, people found with small amounts of marijuana will typically be given a ticket and cited for a violation instead of being arrested and charged with a crime.","Mayor Bill de Blasio, who took office promising to reform the Police Department and repair relations with black and Latino communities, on Monday unveiled his plan to change the way the police enforce the law on marijuana possession.Arrests for low-level marijuana possession have had an especially harsh impact on minority communities, and under the change announced on Monday, people found with small amounts of marijuana will typically be given a ticket and cited for a violation instead of being arrested and charged with a crime.The news, outlined by the mayor and his police commissioner, William J. Bratton, at Police Headquarters, marked the most significant criminal justice policy initiative by Mr. de Blasio since he was sworn in as mayor in January.While he stressed that he was not advocating the decriminalization of marijuana, Mr. de Blasio said the impact of enforcement on the people arrested and on the Police Department compelled him to rethink how the police handle low-level marijuana arrests.When an individual is arrested, he said, even for the smallest possession of marijuana, it hurts their chances to get a good job; it hurts their chances to get housing; it hurts their chances to qualify for a student loan. It can literally follow them for the rest of their lives and saddle young people with challenges that, for many, are very difficult to overcome.For a Police Department that has devoted enormous resources to tens of thousands of marijuana arrests a year, the shift in strategy should, the mayor said, allow officers to focus on more serious types of crime by freeing up people who would otherwise be occupied by the administrative tasks lashed to minor marijuana arrests.But the change, detailed in a five-page Police Department operations order that is set to go into effect on Nov. 19, immediately raised questions and concerns in many corners of the criminal justice system.It directs officers who encounter people with 25 grams or less of marijuana, in public view, to issue a noncriminal violation in most instances, rather than arrest them for a misdemeanor.The mayor said the new policy had the support of the citys district attorneys. But Brooklyns top prosecutor, Kenneth P. Thompson, has voiced some concerns. Since September, his office has been dismissing many marijuana cases, and he said that by routinely issuing summonses, the police would be undercutting the role of prosecutors in assessing arrests and charges. That, Mr. Thompson said, left him concerned about the due process rights of those who are given marijuana summonses.As they headed into a meeting with departmental leaders to hear about the new policy, some police union leaders said the changes seemed to run counter to the broken windows strategy of policing, long championed by Mr. Bratton as a way to prevent serious crime by cracking down on low-level offenses.I just see it as another step in giving the streets back to the criminals, said Michael J. Palladino, the head of the citys Detectives Endowment Association, the union representing police detectives. And we keep inching closer and closer to that.Edward Mullins, the head of the citys Sergeants Benevolent Association, said police officers were always looking to make big arrests, to catch bank robbers or to seize guns. But sometimes, he said, marijuana arrests can pop a guy wanted for robbery.People are asking: What is going on? Is this department losing its mind? Has the city lost its mind? he said.At the news conference, Mr. Bratton said officers would still have to use discretion. If marijuana was being burned or smoked, an arrest would be made, he said. If offenders had an active warrant, or were wanted, or could not produce proper identification, they would be taken to the station house, he said.Officials said violations would not constitute a criminal record. They said court appearances, within weeks of the violation, could lead to a fine of up to $100 for a first offense.City officials acknowledged that some elements of the policy shift could be complicated. Summons forms, for instance, do not identify offenders by race, making it potentially difficult for the city to track the effects of the change on groups, like young black and Latino males, who have often been disproportionately stopped in the past.It is also unclear how officials might best appraise the success of the plan, though relevant statistics are likely to include summons and arrest figures and the number of calls placed to 911 or 311 for marijuana complaints.Daniel L. Squadron, a Democratic state senator who represents parts of Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, has introduced a bill in Albany to change the state penal code to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana possession  whether the substance is in public view or not.The mayors action is a big deal to undo a glaring injustice, Mr. Squadron said. But it shows we also need to change state law to create fairness.Critics have said the police and prosecutors have been improperly charging people with possession of marijuana in public view, often after officers ask them to empty their pockets during street stops.In 2011, Raymond W. Kelly, then the police commissioner, issued an order reminding officers to refrain from such arrest practices. Mr. Bratton said such practices were not now in use and the problem had been fixed. By now, the number of marijuana arrests has decreased, roughly mirroring the drastic reduction in the frequency of police stop, question and frisk encounters.Of the 394,539 arrests made last year, marijuana arrests totaled slightly more than 28,000, or a little less than 10 percent of all arrests made in the city. That is down from 50,000 a few years ago.",2014-11-11,marijuana

We thought they were probation officers, he said.The adults were actually academic coaches at the Network for Student Success, a Pulaski effort supported by the United States Education Department to improve retention and graduation rates among black male students. Mr. Slater gave the program a try. He was assigned a success coach, who helped him identify academic goals. He was advised to sit at the front of his class and introduce himself to his instructors. He was urged to dress in a shirt and tie and to overcome his natural shyness to speak in front of groups.In his second year, Mr. Slater was elected president of the student body. He earned an associate degree in business administration from the community college in 2013, and is now working toward a bachelors degree at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.Once I got into the network, I saw that it was just a bunch of brothers in there cracking jokes  that studying was not all about being uptight, he said. I started pulling more and more people in, and letting them know that this is where they needed to be if they wanted to be successful.The higher-education struggles of black men are well chronicled. Over the past 15 years, dozens of colleges have started programs designed specifically to get black men enrolled and help them graduate. So far, they are still significantly outnumbered and outperformed on campus by black women. But efforts to improve their experiences are likely to accelerate since President Obamas announcement in February of the My Brothers Keeper program, which includes philanthropic pledges of $200 million to help young black students.Many African-American boys fall behind early in their schooling and never catch up. Fewer than 20 percent are proficient in math and reading in both fourth and eighth grades. Just over half graduate from high school. Only a third of black men in the United States who attend four-year colleges graduate within six years, compared with 45 percent of Hispanic men, 57 percent of white men, and 64 percent of Asian men. Only 17 percent of all black male students who enter community colleges will earn certificates or associate degrees or transfer to four-year institutions within three years.Advocates say the new programs are not just about helping African-American men, but are also key to meeting overall goals related to college completion.Weve got to address the performance challenges in this cohort if were going to raise Americas overall attainment level, says Arlethia Perry-Johnson, director of the University System of Georgias African-American Male Initiative.The oldest programs have been around for a decade or more. Ohio State Universitys Todd Anthony Bell National Resource Center on the African American Male, which opened in 2004, provides a four-day program just before classes start to 50 to 60 black male freshmen each year, about a third of the black male students in the entering class. The program emphasizes soft skills  such as motivation and study habits  rather than academic instruction. We have found that these soft skills tend to have a greater effect on how successful young men are on our campus, said James L. Moore III, an education professor who directs the center.Each fall the Bell center holds the Gathering of Men, a networking event for black male students, professors, and community professionals. In February it organizes a two-day, off-campus retreat for black male students from Ohio State and other universities. The weekend event features a diverse schedule, including research-paper presentations, yoga, and sessions on financial literacy and how to deal with police officers they might encounter.The Bell centers programs appear to be paying off. Ohio States six-year graduation rate for black male undergraduates is now 67 percent, an increase of 30 percentage points since 2002, noted Mr. Moore.Lnard Tufts, an Ohio State senior majoring in mechanical engineering, said he was often the only black student in his freshman engineering classes. The Bell centers orientation program, he said, introduced him to other academically minded African-American males whom I could lean on for support.Mr. Tufts also participated in the centers Leadership Institute, a series of seminars that helped him develop skills that he is tapping this year as founder of a student group, Dexterity 43210. The organization (its name matches Ohio States ZIP code), which drew 70 students for its first meeting, intends to create an overly complex contraption, he said, and enter it in a Rube Goldberg competition at the Center of Science and Industry, in Columbus.At the University of Maryland at College Park, black undergraduates helped start the Black Male Initiative in 2005, amid concerns about the relatively small number of black professors on the campus. The group initially met on Saturday mornings for undergraduates and black administrators and professors to get to know one another. Now it holds a monthly community forum on issues such as racial profiling and the criminal-justice system, and arranges volunteer opportunities in local schools for black male undergraduates.It started as a tool to help retain black males on a campus that is, in the view of students of color and staff, chilly in terms of the cultural climate, says Solomon Comissiong, a co-founder of the initiative and assistant director of the universitys Nyumburu Cultural Center. Its not just for academic reasons that students arent retained.The Georgia university systems African-American Male Initiative has programs on 27 of the 31 campuses. The system encourages participation by providing matching grants of up to $30,000 per year. Since the efforts inception, in 2002, the number of bachelors degrees earned systemwide by black men has increased 82 percent, to 2,353 in 2013, officials said.Each institution designs its own variations. The Georgia Institute of Technology, for example, offers a multiweek immersion program for new black male students, so that they will more quickly appreciate the level of study required to be successful. Less-selective institutions have created programs that help at-risk students with intrusive advising  abrupt interventions delivered in person when they cut class or fail assignments.We dont have a cookie-cutter approach, because we dont have a cookie-cutter system, Ms. Perry-Johnson says.Some of the most innovative programs nationwide are at community colleges, which enroll more than 70 percent of African-American men who attend public colleges. Some of those institutions, including Baltimore City Community College, receive federal support for their programs from an Education Department program designed to help predominantly black institutions.Baltimore City is receiving $2.37 million over four years for a program that offers mentoring and tutoring as well as bus tickets and books. In addition to helping students financially, the freebies encourage students to attend workshops on topics like time management, note-taking, and balancing academic work with family responsibilities.All participants also participate in what the programs director, Duane O. Reid Jr., calls community mentoring  including volunteering in local elementary schools and at a soup kitchen.The program is on track to graduate about 70 African-American men within three years by next fall, he said, a rate of 45 percent. Thats well above the colleges overall graduation rate for black men, which is roughly 5 percent.Brian Jones, a 43-year-old native of Washington, D.C., who has battled drug addictions and had numerous run-ins with the police over the past two decades, made his way to Baltimore City in 2012 after completing a six-month drug treatment program. The midlife quest for a college degree has not come easy. Mr. Jones had a three-month relapse with synthetic marijuana (spice) last January and has flunked algebra twice. But he is back on track this semester, has nudged his GPA up to 2.6, and hopes eventually to earn a bachelors degree in social work from nearby Coppin State University.He says he is in touch every day with a case manager and an academic adviser supplied by the program, which requires regular check-ins. Ive spent a lot of time wasting my time, Mr. Jones said. Now I think I still have time to correct the mistakes that Ive made.Some scholars say the recent protests in Ferguson, Mo., highlight the need for changes in how colleges help black men succeed, even though the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a police officer there had nothing to do with higher education.Black men are criminalized in our society, and that affects how police officers and others interact with them, says J. Luke Wood, an associate professor of community-college leadership at San Diego State University. Teachers may be thinking, Do I want this student to come to my office hours? Maybe as a white female, I dont want a black male coming to my office to meet with me one on one.Mr. Wood, co-director of a research collaborative that studies efforts to help minority men at community colleges, said many black men were leery of higher education to begin with  they may view it as a female sphere, or may hesitate to seek academic help because of a fear that theyll look dumb.In our research, weve found that it doesnt matter how well you teach  if you dont have a relationship with these guys first, theyre not going to be open to the information, he said.Shaun R. Harper, an associate professor of education at the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of the Center for the Study of Race and Equity in Education, argues that colleges need to spend far more time and money helping professors understand how their actions, or even unconscious biases, may have a negative impact on black men.You can spend hundreds or even thousands of hours helping a black student learn to be resilient and resist harmful racial stereotypes, Mr. Harper said, but if the guy goes back into a classroom and the professor is still behaving in a racist manner, or has unchecked assumptions about the students background, that resilience only goes so far.Yet directors of some programs say they still see large numbers of students who need almost daily support in order to succeed in college. Kareem Moody, who directs the Network for Student Success program at Pulaski Tech, divides incoming students into groups on the basis of the amount of help they will need. A green student, for example, has strong academic skills and motivation and might need advice merely on course scheduling. But a red student, like Mr. Slater  someone who has struggled academically, is uncomfortable with college instructors, or perhaps has had run-ins with the law  will receive far more help.You have a lot of fatherly talks with those guys to close the door on some things that they might be upset about, Mr. Moody says.Mr. Slater, who still spends 15 hours a week at Pulaski working with the network, now shares the lessons he learned from Mr. Moody, which helped him reach the University of Arkansas. For example, email an instructor early, he tells new students, if you know youre going to miss a class or turn in an assignment late.Life happens to all of us, Mr. Slater tells them. You want your professor to remember that youre one of his bright students.",2014-11-10,marijuana

Because their political activism was bad for business.,"The massacre of 43 students from a teachers college in Ayotzinapa has horrified Mexico. Social indignation has reached a boiling point in protests across the country. The demonstrations are both natural and justified  and certainly without precedent in recent decades. Everyone knows that the students had nothing to do with the gangsters or the drug trade. Everyone knows that this was truly a Massacre of the Innocents.The crime, committed in Iguala, a city in the heart of Guerrero state, was carried out by a criminal gang called the Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors), which operates in the Iguala area and controls the municipal police. The criminals surely acted in collusion with the towns mayor and his wife, who have now been caught, holed up in a poor area of Mexico City, after more than a month on the run. Some of those already arrested have confessed to a macabre sequence of kidnapping, torture, execution and the burning of bodies.Guerrero is rich in tourist beach resorts (like Acapulco or Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo) and natural resources like gold, but there is a huge economic divide in the state. Seventy percent of its inhabitants live in poverty. The state has been a violent, ungovernable place since colonial times, and it was a principal theater of all our national wars in the 19th and 20th centuries.In the city of Atoyac, near Acapulco, there was a massacre of peasants in 1967. For me, as an adolescent, and for many Mexicans, it was the end of innocence, the resurgence of underlying violence, the return of Barbarous Mexico (the title of a book written by the American journalist John Kenneth Turner in the early 20th century).That massacre unleashed the Mexican Left, encouraged by the victory of the Cuban Revolution. Much of their activism emerged from the Ayotzinapa teachers college, the Escuela Normal Rural Ral Isidro Burgos. Founded in 1926 and still closely linked to its Marxist roots, the schools heroes were Marx and Lenin, and in the 1970s Che Guevara. One of its students was the guerrilla leader Lucio Cabaas, who in the late 1960s, together with Genaro Vzquez Rojas, declared war on the Mexican state  with broad social support.In those days, Cuba provided material support for revolutionary activism in many Latin American countries. But not in Mexico, the only nation in Latin America to rebuff American pressure to break relations with Cuba. In exchange, the Castro regime neither encouraged nor supplied Mexican revolutionaries. President Luis Echeverra (1970-76) opened Mexicos doors to refugees fleeing military terror in Chile and Argentina, while at the same time he unleashed terror at home (especially in Guerrero) to wipe out leftist guerrilla movements. Guerrero then subsided into an illusory calm, punctuated by scattered but bloody incidents of violence.An ominous new protagonist entered the picture in force at the turn of the century. Guerrero had always been a center of marijuana production, but the newer, more organized drug cartels found the state an ideal site for their business, with its rugged and often impassable hills and old culture of violence. The citizens of Guerrero, meanwhile, were full of lingering resentment over the Guerra Sucia (Dirty War) of the 1970s  and often quite as poor as people living in the most impoverished zones of Africa. At the same time, Mexicos nationwide problem of political corruption became especially acute in Guerrero. In many towns, mayors and their colleagues took bribes from the narcos, associated with them, or, as in Iguala, were even themselves the drug lords.The leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), which has governed Guerrero since 2005, has done almost nothing to break the old links between politics and crime. In fact, the mayor of Iguala and the governor of the state had the support of all of the partys national leaders. The centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) won the presidential election of 2012 with the promise of returning peace and security to the people. But the government has been, at the very least, inattentive and inefficient. The army has a major garrison near Iguala but, inexplicably, has done nothing to inhibit the alliance of criminals and politicians.The state of Guerrero produces 98 percent of the heroin-yielding poppies in Mexico; production has grown exponentially. President Obama recently quoted a report by the United States Drug Enforcement Agency of a 324 percent increase in heroin seizures at the Mexican border between 2009 and 2013.But why kill innocent students? For the simple reason that their political demonstrations, civic protests and revolutionary idealism are bad for business. A man who has been arrested for his involvement in the tragedy added another reason: Because they are unruly.The strong involvement of local government and social forces has brought gains against narco-violence in Monterrey, Tijuana, and even heavily plagued Ciudad Jurez. But in Guerrero, with its low level of education and high incidence of poverty, a similar process is very unlikely. The government of President Enrique Pea Nieto has passed important economic reforms. These will do little good, however, unless the problem of security is faced head-on.The tide of criminal violence in Mexico must not only be contained; it must be stopped and pushed back. The citizens of Mexico, feeling deceived by all political parties and all politicians, have been roused to fury by the events in Iguala. They demand not merely a few arrests, but the detention of all those responsible from top to bottom. Above all, they demand that every possible step be taken to refute those who would say that the country is spiraling out of control or has become a virtual narco-state.It is no exaggeration to say that the viability of democracy in Mexico depends on the outcome.

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/nyregion/in-shift-police-dept-to-stop-low-level-marijuana-arrests-officials-say.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png,"Marijuana May Mean Ticket, Not Arrest, in New York City",The policy change would represent Mayor Bill de Blasios most significant effort since taking office to address the enduring effects of the Police Departments excessive stop-and-frisk practices.,"The New York Police Department, which has been arresting tens of thousands of people a year for low-level marijuana possession, is poised to stop making such arrests and to issue tickets instead, according to law enforcement officials.People found with small amounts of marijuana would be issued court summonses and be allowed to continue on their way without being handcuffed and taken to station houses for fingerprinting.The change would remake the way the police in New York City handle the most common drug offenses and would represent Mayor Bill de Blasios most significant effort since taking office to address the enduring effects of the departments excessive stop-and-frisk practices.Curbing arrests for small-scale marijuana possession has become a cause for criminal justice reform advocates, and this year, the new Brooklyn district attorney, Kenneth P. Thompson, said he would stop prosecuting such cases. But his announcement did not go over well with Mr. de Blasio and his police commissioner, William J. Bratton, who vowed to continue making low-level marijuana arrests.Now, the de Blasio administration is publicly embracing the notion that such small-scale possession merits different treatment. And with the changes, City Hall is moving to retake control of a politically potent issue that has enormous resonance in the black and Latino communities, where a vast majority of small-scale marijuana arrests have taken place.In the first eight months of the year, blacks and Hispanics represented86 percent of those arrested for marijuana possession in the city, according to a study written in part by Harry G. Levine, a sociology professor at Queens College who is a director of the Marijuana Arrest Research Project.Many details of the changes planned by the de Blasio administration are still being discussed at City Hall, and many questions remain unanswered. Under the new policy, for example, will the 25 grams or less that constitutes misdemeanor possession under state law be the threshold below which a summons is issued? Will a lit marijuana cigarette be treated differently from a packet of unsmoked cannabis? Other key questions, such as the cost of the fines or whether a criminal record would typically result from a summons, may not be up to City Hall.A clearer picture is expected to emerge this week, as Mr. de Blasio prepares for his first meeting with the citys five district attorneys. A spokeswoman for the mayor, Marti Adams, declined to comment on the proposed policy change, although officials in two of the district attorneys offices confirmed that the de Blasio administration was working on a new policy for how the police handle marijuana cases.In an interview on Sunday, Mr. Thompson expressed concern about the mayors plan, calling it an end-run around the district attorneys that could end up hurting some of the very people the changes are supposed to help.Since July, the Brooklyn district attorneys office has dismissed 849 misdemeanor marijuana cases involving police arrests, or about 34 percent of the total 2,526 such cases in Brooklyn.Under the proposed changes, it appears that instead of being arrested, those given a ticket for marijuana will be told to appear in a courtroom. But the new policy could push prosecutors out of the process, because summonses issued without an accompanying arrest generally do not receive prosecutorial review.In order to give the public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system, these cases should be subject to prosecutorial review, Mr. Thompson said. By allowing these cases to avoid early review, by issuing a summons, there is a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place. These cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred.Another possible effect of the new policy would be that many of the tickets later convert into arrest warrants if the person misses a court date, he said. There are currently about 1.2 million active warrants in New York relating to missed court dates and unpaid fines for misdemeanors and noncriminal violations. In 2013, people failed to pay or show up to court about a quarter of the time for the 329,198 summons cases on the dockets of the citys lowest level criminal courts, according to court statistics.Under the current practice, more than half of those arrested for marijuana were released a couple of hours after being brought to a station house, according to 2012 data gathered by the Criminal Justice Agency, a nonprofit that assists with bail determinations. They were fingerprinted, checked for warrants and issued a ticket demanding their appearance in court six to eight weeks later. The remainder of those arrested for marijuana possession were put through the system, meaning they were held for up to 24 hours before being arraigned before a judge.In New York, the debate over marijuana arrests has been less about drug decriminalization than it has been about the aggressive stop-and-frisk tactics that came to define the Police Departments crime-fighting strategies. During the Bloomberg administration, the police arrested as many as 50,000 people a year on minor marijuana charges, meaning that some years, approximately one in eight arrests made by the police was for marijuana. In some cases, arrests were made after officers stopped people under dubious circumstances and instructed them to remove any contraband from their pockets.In 1977, the Legislature in New York moved to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana that were not in public view. That meant that carrying a small bag of marijuana hidden in a pocket was supposed to be a ticket-eligible violation that did not amount to a crime.But since the mid-1990s, the police have routinely arrested people they found with marijuana and charged them with a misdemeanor, even though it was only supposed to apply to marijuana that was burning or discovered in public view.In 2011, the police commissioner at the time, Raymond W. Kelly, issued an unusual order reminding officers that the misdemeanor was not the appropriate charge in many cases.In 2013, the police still arrested more than 28,000 people for marijuana possession, and in 2014, the arrests were occurring at a similar pace, Professor Levine said.While campaigning for mayor, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, emphatically criticized the departments marijuana arrest practices. His populist outrage against heavy-handed policing in minority neighborhoods helped propel him into City Hall. But since becoming mayor in January, he has exerted little pressure on the department, instead often deferring to Commissioner Bratton, who has made a national reputation for aggressive street policing combined with an ability to soothe the often-inflamed relations between big-city police departments and the minority neighborhoods they serve.Yet Mr. de Blasio now finds himself under increasing pressure to deliver on his platform of police reform. That pressure began in July after a black Staten Island man died after a police officer put him in a chokehold while trying to arrest him for selling untaxed cigarettes. Since then, the departures of the departments top Hispanic official and its highest-ranking black officer have led a number of minority lawmakers and City Hall allies to begin to question Mr. de Blasios oversight of the police.",2014-11-10,marijuana
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/business/media/with-high-maintenance-vimeo-invests-in-original-content.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/10/business/vimeo2/vimeo2-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg,"With High Maintenance, Vimeo Invests in Original Content","Vimeo, a video-sharing web service built to appeal to fans of higher-quality content than sites like YouTube, is directly funding an original series for the first time and hoping viewers will be willing to pay for it.","High Maintenance, a web series on Vimeo about the many customers of a Brooklyn marijuana dealer, has won a devoted following and plenty of critical acclaim. Each of its first 13 episodes has been watched hundreds of thousands of times. The New Yorker raved that the show, freed of the constraints of formulas imposed by television schedules, radiates new ideas about storytelling.But will viewers pay to watch it?Vimeo, the video-sharing web service owned by IAC, will release three new episodes of High Maintenance on Tuesday. The new episodes  each less than 20 minutes long  are $2 apiece, or $8 for a set that includes three more that will be released in January. This is the first time that Vimeo has funded the series directly, and represents the companys first push into original content, following a recent trend among larger digital companies such as Yahoo, Netflix and Amazon.While Vimeos chief executive, Kerry Trainor, is betting that viewers will pay up, he says his ambitions go beyond generating a new source of revenue. He sees High Maintenance as the perfect show to be a foundation for a prestige television brand, and compares his sites developing identity to that of premium cable in the 1970s, an analogy in which YouTube plays advertising-powered network television to Vimeos HBO.We really feel like Vimeo is in the world to find a higher-quality creator, delivering a different experience than what youd typically find on YouTube, Mr. Trainor said. Not to say that YouTube is bad, but Vimeo on the whole has much more of a premium cable and even a film sensibility. Thats what tends to do well on the platform.Vimeos website is built to appeal to fans who favor the work of auteurs. The language of its on-demand platform promotes the people behind the films almost as vociferously as the projects themselves. One prominent button, indicated by a smiley face, exhorts users to support creativity, explaining that most of the cash goes to the maker.The push into original programming is one of several developments intended to reshape Vimeos revenue model. The service, which had 33 percent growth in both unique users and subscribers this quarter, recently announced that it would introduce a viewer subscription service next year. (Current subscribers pay for the right to use the production tools offered on Vimeo Plus and Vimeo Pro.) The sites on-demand platform, introduced in March 2013, has almost 14,000 titles available for purchase, and its gross revenue has nearly doubled since last quarter.Jessica Casano-Antonellis, Vimeos director of communications, compared the on-demand portion of the site to iTunes in that Vimeo is an open platform where anyone can upload and sell content directly.For the creators of High Maintenance, the biggest fear may be that the shows audience will not be willing to pay for what they used to get free.The psychology behind it is whats become interesting to us, said Katja Blichfeld, who writes and directs the show with her husband, Ben Sinclair. We havent experienced pushback yet, but there have been murmurings of people complaining about having to pay now.For Ms. Blichfeld and Mr. Sinclair, the partnership with Vimeo is an experiment that could help pioneer a way for short-form independent filmmakers to make money from their work.You dont have to have some goliath managing your content and distributing it for you, Mr. Sinclair said. You can get rid of all those middlemen and just get a direct conversation between the artist and the audience.Apart from helping write, direct and edit the show, Mr. Sinclair plays the marijuana dealer. For the most part, his presence is the only element that links individual episodes; otherwise, each focuses on a separate set of characters and tells a stand-alone story. Episodes can vary sharply in tone. The short, comedic Olivia tells the story of two thieving gossips who come across as some of the very worst people in New York; a more meditative episode called Brad Pitts is a window into the life of a woman with stomach cancer.On the show, drugs are rarely glamorized or used as a form of cheap titillation; Cheech and Chong this is not. Ms. Blichfeld and Mr. Sinclair have each used marijuana for 10 years plus, and their comfort with the drug is reflected in their characters. Mr. Sinclairs character, known simply as the guy, is not, for most viewers, a scuzzy criminal, but rather a humane, if somewhat dopey, evolution of the bartender  a 21st-century version of Sam Malone from Cheers.Though its creators insist that nothing about their approach has changed with the Vimeo partnership (other than their ability to finally pay collaborators what they deserve), faithful viewers will note an increased sophistication in the new episodes.At its core though, the show remains the same. At a screening last week, a fan asked Mr. Sinclair what he and Ms. Blichfeld had been doing with all that Vimeo money.Its what weve been doing, plus, Mr. Sinclair replied. Its not a new thing. And its been very comforting to be at Vimeo for that.",2014-11-10,marijuana
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/opinion/sunday/democracys-circuses-triumphs-and-shams.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/09/sunday-review/09QUICJ/09QUICJ-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg,"Democracy&#8217;s Circuses, Triumphs and Shams","Elections were just held in the United States and Ukraine, and the world reflected on the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.","The main event of the past week was, of course, the midterm elections. It was a Republican romp, far greater than any poll predicted, but for those watching it from abroad it was also a striking lesson in the enormous complexity, expense, passion and mystery of the democratic process as practiced in the worlds premier republic.All robust democracies surround elections with a circus atmosphere of stump speeches, TV debates, ceaseless polls, ads and posters. But none can surpass the United States in the range of offices that come up for election every two years, from the entire House of Representatives to scores of senators, governors, judges, local legislators and prosecutors, or the resolutions on issues like legalizing marijuana. And few spend anywhere near as much  around $4 billion was spent on this election.Its not all pretty, what with the prevalence of the attack ads and shameless lies. Nor is the mood of the American electorate understandable to a foreign observer: Why do American voters feel so strong a need to punish President Obama when the economy is in decent shape, unemployment is falling, most troops are home from foreign wars and the political gridlock in Washington is hardly his fault alone?The apparent reason is that Americans are deeply dissatisfied with the way they are being governed. The departing Congress is widely reviled for its dysfunction, polarization and lack of achievement, and at times like this, people punish the president and his party. That may not seem fair or reasonable, but offering a legitimate channel for frustration and anger, and endowing the public with a sense that they can do something about it, is a key component of democracy.Twenty-five years ago, the people of East Berlin did something about their frustrations in a far different way, bursting through the wall that had physically denied them and millions of Eastern Europeans the most elemental freedoms.With the approach of Sundays anniversary, however, many commentaries have focused on the dashed hopes and lost illusions of that joyous moment. Russia is again looming as a threat, China has found ways of combining authoritarian rule with economic might, the United States is widely perceived around the world as having misused its monopoly on superpower, the Middle East is locked in sectarian rivalries that spread vicious terror far beyond the region, and democracy appears on the defensive against populist challenges and economic troubles.None of that should detract from the sheer joy that was Nov. 9, 1989, in Berlin, when people who had lived under the threat of repression for thinking the wrong thought or dreaming the wrong dream suddenly found themselves free. I was there that night, and at many of the other celebrations across Eastern Europe and, yes, Russia, that collectively came to be known as the Fall of the Wall.Many recognized at the time that this was a plunge into the unknown, and many had fears and doubts about where it would all lead. But at the moment when the formidable forces of repression created by the Soviet Union and its minions retreated before the power of the human spirit, there could be only celebration. As there was, unforgettably, that night in Berlin, and as there should be on this anniversary.Over the past 25 years we have learned that building democracy requires more than triumphant moments like that night in Berlin  or the many days and nights of the Arab Spring in Middle Eastern capitals. However exhilarating it may be to topple statues of dictators and sack the offices of the political police, these are symptoms of a failure of the social contract, and not a guarantee that a new one will work better. Democracy is institutions, a culture, a history, a process.Meanwhile, in UkraineDemocracy is not what transpired in the sham elections held on Nov. 2 in Donetsk and Luhansk, the Ukrainian cities and surrounding areas held by pro-Russian separatists. Though many of the people who cast ballots may have honestly believed they were helping end the chaos in which theyve lived for more than half a year now, the elections called by leaders of the self-proclaimed peoples republics served only to freeze the conflict, leaving residents in limbo.The elections come a week after parliamentary elections in the rest of Ukraine, with a predictable victory for parties favoring a closer union with the West. The United States, the European Union and the United Nations refused to recognize the voting in the rebel territories, and the government in Kiev condemned it as a violation of a cease-fire agreement laid out by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in September. One result was that Ukraine cut off all state funding to rogue territories.Russia welcomed the elections, declaring that the peoples republics now had legitimate representatives to negotiate with Kiev on their future status. Moscow can also claim it is responding to legitimate demands for assistance when it funds and otherwise props up the rebel territories. NATO says hundreds of Russian troops are still inside eastern Ukraine training rebel soldiers.For now, the net effect is that Russia has added two more unrecognized states and frozen conflicts to its collection, alongside South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Transnistria. That may suit President Putin just fine, but not his economy: The past week was the worst for the ruble in many years, dropping the Russian currency to all-time lows against the dollar and the euro.After the ElectionsEven if the midterm elections in the United States were not cause for celebration, given the sour mood of the electorate, the low turnout and the partisan attacks, they did demonstrate that there is a way to effect change other than through barricades or sham ballots.The change may not be for the better this time around. It is possible that a Congress now fully in Republican hands will only deepen the ugly duel with the Democratic president that has so damaged Washington in recent years. But there will be new elections in two years.It could also be that a lame-duck president in need of a legacy, a Congress in need of salvaging its brand and a Republican Party looking two years ahead will find ways to cut some deals. Initial signals were mixed, but already on the day after the election there was talk of various walls that could be breached, like reforming the tax code, promoting trade and eliminating the budget deficit.",2014-11-09,marijuana

Im looking for bugs, mildew, things I wouldnt want to ingest, he said, leaning forward to hold the nickel-size flower up to the light. He paused, then took a sip of water from a cup with a Miley Cyrus hologram down its side. This looks clean, he concluded.Mr. Browne, 31, held the bud up to his nose and inhaled. Then he opened his computer. Faint lemony sweetness, he typed, before loading the pot into a small glass pipe.I usually will take one, maybe two hits, he said as he fired up the bowl. Im looking for how it burns, the taste, if its flushed well  meaning you dont want to taste the fertilizers or chemicals. He exhaled, waited and then turned to his computer again. Head high. No initial body effect, he wrote.This is Mr. Brownes job (or, at least, one of his jobs). The longtime resident of Colorado  where marijuana has been legal since January  is a comedian, a producer and a founder (with his fiance) of a mail-order subscription box for hemp products.He is also the first pot critic for The Denver Post, Colorados oldest and largest daily newspaper. Which means that, every week, Mr. Browne takes a city bus from his home in Denvers Highland neighborhood, crosses a street called Green Court and lands at one of the citys downtown marijuana dispensaries to choose his product. Yes, he is paid to smoke it  and then write about the high.The thing people say to me most often is, Dude, you must have the best job ever,  said Mr. Browne, sitting in his living room. Its either that, or, if theyre from out of state, Can you send me pot? The Post has had two pot critics on its roster since it created a spinoff site, The Cannabist, in December. (The newspaper is searching for a third, as well as a sex columnist to write about pot and intimacy.) While adding the jobs  particularly for a mainstream newspaper  created something of a stir, Ricardo Baca, the newspapers newly appointed cannabis editor (and a longtime staff member) said it simply made journalistic sense. We have a restaurant critic and wine reviewers, he said. We have an award-winning craft beer blog. From that logic you do need a pot critic  and maybe a few of them.Mr. Brownes path into the role was unlikely. He grew up in Iowa, where, after high school, he tried his hand as a male model (Ashton Kutcher, another former model, was from his hometown). When that didnt work out, he moved to Colorado (I had just read On the Road,  he said) and enrolled in a technical college, but dropped out. For the next few years he waited tables and worked as a bartender.Pot wasnt legal for recreational use when he first got into the business, helping a friend who had opened a medical dispensary keep the books. (They had been organizing files by first name, Mr. Browne said, laughing.) He wasnt a big pot smoker, but liked the business side of it. He became the companys marketing director and general manager, started a blog and opened up a pot consulting business on the side.He saw the ad for a pot critic on Facebook (where else? he joked) and replied with a visual rsum hed designed himself  complete with a giant photo of a piece of bacon (just for fun, he said). But it wasnt the swine that sold his editor (nor was it simply his writing). He was an authority on weed already, Mr. Baca said. He had valuable experience working inside the industry.Mr. Browne also has a biological gift of sorts: He is a supertaster. That is, somebody who possesses more taste buds than the average person (at least according to an online survey he took).In total so far, Mr. Browne has written 27 reviews. He critiqued a strain called Jack Flash (it practically jumped through my monitor and into my pipe); 303 Kush (almost overwhelming); and wrote about a Willie Nelson-themed varietal called Red Headed Stranger No. 14 (a little less mentally racy but with a strong overall high). And while his taste buds play a role in the critiques, certainly, there is more to it.I think people underestimate cannabis, Mr. Browne said. You wouldnt walk into a restaurant and say, Ill have the wine. So why would you assume people would do that for cannabis? In the same way that pinot grigio and pinot noir may sound similar but are completely different, names like Lemon OG and Lemon Skunk are very different strains with very different flavor components and completely different highs.A typical day for Mr. Browne likely starts by testing a few products. On this particular day, he spent the morning at three dispensaries: LoDo Wellness, on a street called Wazee; Euflora, also known as the Apple store for weed (though, as Mr. Browne pointed out, it actually looked more like a RadioShack); and finally, a shop called Good Chemistry.The key to pot criticism, Mr. Browne said, is knowing your audience. While he tries to keep his language basic enough that a nonsmoker could understand it (I think pot needs smart people to be ambassadors to the masses, he said), he doesnt want to be condescending to those who do. I never want to be that pretentious pot critic, he said.The reviews themselves have a certain formula. Mr. Browne begins with a physical description of the product (is it moist, with the THC visible, or a drier, less tightly packed bud?) as well as the smell and taste (rubber and pepper dominate the jar like a bunch of green army men relegated to miniature mess hall duty, he wrote recently, of an unfortunately titled strain called Alien Napalm).He will find out where the product was harvested (in Napalms case, a veganic grow) and tell the reader where he bought it (because each manufacturer has its own wacky strain names). Sometimes hell describe the sound of the bud firing up (snap, crackle, pop) or what, and how much, he ate after (apple juice and ants on a log, he said, referring to the childrens snack of raisins and peanut butter on top of celery).The most important element of being a pot critic, though, is one that traditional food criticism may lack (at least in this much detail): how the product makes you feel. Seated in his living room testing out the Lemon Kush, Mr. Browne kept detailed notes from the moment he ingested, and observed how it moved through his body. (When writing about Jack Flash, another strain, he once noted that it always gets me straight between the temples.) With the Kush, he observed whether the pot relieved his headache (a little) and tracked, in painstaking detail, how the feeling of the high evolved.In his accounting, Lemon Kush was relatively mellow, but a few months back, he had a different experience with a different strain. After the second hit, I was floored. No thoughts, just pure experience. An instant flow state, he wrote of the Red Headed Stranger No. 14. Ten minutes later, he observed a sudden shift: Im a human coffee, spewing words like dark-roasted drip.In the spirit of service journalism  and, he said, what is pot criticism if not a service?  each of Mr. Brownes reviews ends with a summary. Alien Napalm, for instance, he concluded is great for sleep, pain or increasing appetite (but never use it for an appetizer). The Red Headed Stranger is good for loosening of limbs and muscles. But if thats the effect youre going for, make sure to stay away from Green Crack. (Im no physician, but this is as close as Ive come to marijuana-induced A.D.D., he wrote.)No, being a pot critic doesnt pay the bills (nor does The Post reimburse him for the pot). But, Mr. Browne said, it beats working in a coffee shop (where, for what its worth, hed probably have to take a drug test).I feel lucky to be this person in the middle of a historical moment, and I dont think well see anything really comparable to it, he said, finishing up his day at a taqueria down the street from his house. And, you know, I like pot, I think its a fun topic. Somebody has to cover it. So why cant I be that guy?",2014-11-09,marijuana
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/books/review/ali-bermans-misdirected-and-more.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png,"Ali Bermans Misdirected, and More","These teenagers risk alienation, and worse, when they diverge from the religious beliefs of those around them.","Atheists are a despised minority. According to a recent Pew survey, voters are warier of an atheist candidate than of a lesbian, an adulterer or an erstwhile marijuana user. At the same time, atheist pride is waxing in the United States. Atheist tracts share prominent space at airport bookstores with memoirs about dogs and inspirational volumes for aspiring C.E.O.s. Atheist campus groups are multiplying, and polls show growing numbers of Americans identifying with the label.What kind of young peoples literature can we expect in the early, heady days of a minority-rights movement? Second-wave feminism spawned some horrid writing (case in point, Jill Johnstons stream-of-consciousness Lesbian Nation, from 1973), but it primed readers to listen for a greater range of womens voices, in many ways making possible the current flourishing of American fiction. Three new novels feature teenage characters openly skeptical of Gods existence, with mixed results for readers. These books suggest that while the New Atheism, Teenage Edition, opens up some fresh possibilities for the Y.A. novel, it may inevitably suffer its own growing pains.Misdirected, by Ali Berman, is seemingly born more of anger against religious people than of interest in understanding them. When Bens mother gets a new job, the family moves from Boston to a conservative town in Colorado. Despite being fairly progressive, and irreligious, they enroll him in the far-right Christian Heritage Academy, because it had a much better reputation than the public school  a choice that makes sense only to an author needing to chug along her anti-Christian plot. Ben becomes a pariah for his atheist views, his only friends down-low atheists and Tess, a neighbor and love interest, who is that rarity in town: an open-minded, nonjudgmental Christian.Tesss parents forbid her to consort with Ben, and the teachers at school are no friendlier. Theres a kind of campy comedy to the dialogue at Bens high school. Youre new here, Ben, his science teacher says, when Ben questions creationism, so youll need some time to adjust. He tells Ben to read up on proper biblical science. Because right now youre saying things that will get you a seat in detention . . . and in hell. And I dont think any of us want that, now do we?Um, no? Ben sure doesnt. But he cant keep his New Englandy mouth shut, and hes run out of school, losing Tess in the process. He ultimately wins some redemption, and Tess, but the tied-off ending is one implausibility among many. Most Christian high schools have a robust underground of doubters, and their teachers are surely tactically shrewd enough not to bludgeon a skeptic with threats of hell  at least not in his first week.The first time 14-year-old Jonathan Stiles meets Jesus Jackson, the spiritual contractor and title character of James Ryan Daleys novel, it is two hours after the body of Jonathans big brother, Ryan, was found, lifeless and broken, at the bottom of a 60-foot ravine behind St. Sorens, their high school. Jesus Jackson is a handsome, athletic visitor from another cosmos (or something  we never really know); he acts as a sort of spiritual familiar, counseling Jonathan as he tries to find meaning in a world without his brother.If you take the odd, intermittent Jesus Jackson scenes out of the novel, which you really should, whats left is a rather engaging whodunit, as Jonathan searches for clues to Ryans death. The stock characters in Jesus Jackson are no less stock than those in Misdirected, but they at least have the courage of their teen-melodrama convictions. Evil, drug-using, pseudo-Christian Alistair St. Claire is the best villain a young James Spader never got to play, and Jonathans sidekick, Henry, is a lonely nerd cut from an early draft of a John Hughes script.Above all, Jesus Jackson contains some pretty good adolescent theologizing. It turns out that before he died, Ryan had indoctrinated Jonathan into atheism. In flashbacks, they discuss the contradictions in Scripture and the manifold problems in all man-made religions  this must be the only young adult novel to make time for both Zoroastrianism and Unitarianism. Their spot-on juvenile philosophizing will echo, and bolster, the late-night thoughts of many teenage readers.And given the fate that befalls Ryan, an eminently good guy, his musings on theodicy achieve an added poignancy. God cannot simultaneously be good, loving and all-powerful, Ryan tells a priest, if the world he created dooms millions upon millions of its souls to an eternity of torture. Something has to go. Its for the young reader to decide what.Like the narrator of Jesus Jackson, Matthew, the narrator of Ellen Hopkinss Rumble, has a dead brother, a devout mom and a cheating dad; like the narrator of Misdirected, he has a gay sibling, a Christian girlfriend and at one point an erection (boys in Y.A. novels have more, and more visible, erections than boys in real life). In Rumble, Hopkinss trademark faux-etry, familiar from Crank and her other popular books, at least elevates her description of Matthews erection: A sudden uncomfortable tug  Just south of my belt buckle reminds  me that a locker-heavy hallway is so not  the place to think about such things.  Glad I wore Jockeys today. (By contrast, from Misdirected: Im just glad I already put my napkin on my lap.)Bullied after coming out as gay, Luke, Matthews brother, hanged himself. Matthew blames most everyone, including himself, and hes in the kind of depressive funk that makes high school counselors perk up. At the beginning of the novel, hes sent for guidance after writing an essay accusing God of genocide. (We could in theory go all the way back to Noah.) Meanwhile, his girlfriend, Hayden, has been growing closer to the Lord  leading Matthew, whos in the mood to sin, to grow closer to Haydens best friend, Alexa.Haydens youth pastor, Judah, turns out to be a callous jerk, straight from evangelical central casting. Luke was weak, he tells Matthew about his dead gay brother. Suicide is the ultimate weakness of the mind. . . . Homosexual behavior is weakness of the flesh. This sinister pastoral style is no more believable than at the high school in Misdirected, but here the cartoonish religion is played against Matthews equally cartoonish rage against God, which helps make Rumble a satisfying, pleasingly gloomy, and at times sexy book. Hopkins seems more interested in plot than in atheism. And atheists have every reason to be thankful.",2014-11-09,marijuana

(pop. 5,800), profiled this summer in The Timess series on legalizing marijuana, was the little town that wasnt sure about weed.Its sister community, Crested Butte, wealthier and hipper, already had several marijuana dispensaries, but Gunnison had voted to keep marijuana businesses out of the city. (The constitutional amendment that legalized marijuana in Colorado gave local communities that right.) But when Gunnison voters faced the issue again on Tuesday, with three marijuana-related measures on the ballot  whether to allow recreational and medical sales, and whether to tax them  they approved all three, by wide margins.The results were something of a victory for a local community leader, Matthew Kuehlhorn. Even though he used to run the Gunnison County Substance Abuse Prevention Project, he has taken a strikingly non-doctrinaire stance on marijuana. He has been openly critical of ineffective just say no approaches to drug prevention and likes to say that there are no drug problems, there are only life problems.He has urged the city to tax marijuana sales and earmark revenue for programs like his.Mr. Kuehlhorn recently stepped down from the organization, saying he will work as a consultant with marijuana industry to help them better understand community needs and fears.Theres a chance that some of those fears, anyway, may be overblown. Gunnison residents took marijuanas success at the ballot as a sign of growing acceptance  or acquiescence as pro-marijuana momentum keeps rolling across the country.What looked six months ago like a mounting fight, said The Gunnison Country Times in an editorial just before Election Day, has fizzled to near irrelevance. The paper endorsed all three measures.Also in The Country Times this week: public notices of applications for marijuana-growing operations in Gunnison County, for businesses named Southern Charm Organics and Cannatonic LLC.",2014-11-07,marijuana

(HBO) THIS IS 40 (2012) In this film written and directed by Judd Apatow, Pete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (Leslie Mann) and their daughters (Maude and Iris Apatow, above from left, with Mr. Rudd and Ms. Mann; both are the real-life daughters of Ms. Mann and Mr. Apatow) inhabit a big white house in a nice Los Angeles ZIP code. There, in the course of a hectic week, they undergo a series of crises as the parents milestone birthdays approach: financial woes at Petes record label; an embezzling employee at Debbies boutique; mother-and-daughter hormones; and, not least, the state of their marriage. Do you still even like me? Debbie asks Pete in a moment of vulnerability. This Is 40 is an intensely, at times embarrassingly, personal film, by a man who has worked hard, lucked out and wants to share some of his happiness and its attendant worries with the rest of us, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. In other words, it should not be mistaken for satire.10 A.M.

Especially where her 13-year-old daughter, Shantasia Mason, is concerned. Ms. Robinson makes no secret of her long drug addiction.She lived through it with me, Ms. Robinson, 54, said. Id rather have her know what I went through from me than have somebody else come up to her.Ms. Robinson sneaked her first sips of alcohol at a family party when she was 8 years old, took her first puff of marijuana in middle school and in her early 20s began dabbling in cocaine.It was all drugs every day, Ms. Robinson said. I used to smoke a joint before Id go to work. When I came home, Id stop and do my cocaine. The last thing I did at night before I went to sleep was smoke a joint. On the weekend, my house was the partying house. Wed do drugs all day, and just drink and party.Ms. Robinson was employed in a hotel management job throughout the 1980s. Ms. Robinson, who is also the mother of two sons, said: I was working and paying my own habit. As long as my kids have food in their mouth, and we had a roof over our head, I thought it was O.K. But when I started doing crack, we lost the apartment, we lost the car. The money just went.The thirst for her next fix fueled her desperation. Ms. Robinson said she took to sniffing heroin, erroneously believing it would curb her crack habit. Her addiction brought her to some dark places and taught her a particularly harsh lesson about regret.My mother passed away in 2010 and all she ever said to me was Please get your life together before I close my eyes, Ms. Robinson said. I wasnt ready. I couldnt manage to do it. A recent attempt to remain drug free lasted two and a half years, but she relapsed in 2013  on her mothers birthday.The Administration for Childrens Services removed Shantasia from Ms. Robinsons custody and placed her in kinship foster care with Ms. Robinsons sister. Shantasias father is in poor health and unable to care for her. Knowing that she had squandered two and a half years of progress was devastating, but the prospect of losing her daughter horrified her. Ms. Robinson vowed to change.She has been sober since January, she said, and Shantasia has been returned to her custody. They live in a rent-subsidized apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, and together attend weekly therapy sessions. Ms. Robinson said she maintained a good relationship with both of her sons. One son, 36, works for the Department of Corrections; the other, 26, is incarcerated.Ms. Robinson receives $347 a month in food stamps, and Shantasia gets a monthly Social Security insurance check for $850 from her father. Because of the familys limited income, the childrens services agency referred them to Brooklyn Community Services, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which used $250 to buy MetroCards for Ms. Robinson and her daughter to travel to therapy sessions.She is my biggest cheerleader, Ms. Robinson said of Shantasia. My daughter, even when I was out there, used to tell me every day: Mommy, I love you. Youre the best mommy in the whole world. And I always thought I was. But looking back, I know I wasnt.Ms. Robinson does not shy away from disclosing her lifes mistakes in lurid detail, as a way of teaching Shantasia about actions and their consequences. Shantasia often accompanied her mother to her Narcotics Anonymous meetings.Ms. Robinson is dutiful about attendance. If she misses one, she immediately contacts her sponsor.When my thinking tells me, I dont need to make a meeting, I make two, because I know thats the disease, she said. I know how to get on the phone. I talk to my sponsor every other night. As long as I stay focused, I know Im on the right path. Im going to be all right.Ms. Robinson recently completed an eight-hour class for a security guard certification, and hopes to have a job within the next few months. I know its all about saving my life this time around, Ms. Robinson said. And if I dont do what I need to do, I cant help Shantasia grow up to be the young lady I know she can be.",2014-11-07,marijuana
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/us/aclu-in-dollar50-million-push-to-reduce-jail-sentences.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/07/us/ACLU/ACLU-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg,A.C.L.U. in $50 Million Push to Reduce Jail Sentences,The funding from George Soross Open Society Foundations aims to slash an incarceration rate in the United States that has tripled since 1980.,"With a $50 million foundation grant, the largest in its history, the American Civil Liberties Union plans to mount an eight-year political campaign across the country to make a change of criminal justice policies a key issue in local, state and national elections.The goal of the campaign, financed by George Soross Open Society Foundations, is to slash an incarceration rate that has tripled since 1980. There are currently some 2.2 million prisoners in the United States.The campaign aims to translate into state and federal policy a growing belief among many scholars, as well as of a coalition of liberal, conservative and libertarian political leaders, that the tough-on-crime policies of recent decades have become costly and counterproductive.In that view, widespread drug arrests and severe mandatory sentences are doing more to damage poor communities, especially African-American ones, than to prevent crime, and building ever more prisons that mostly turn out repeat offenders is a bad investment.The campaign is likely to face strong opposition from some law enforcement officials, prosecutor groups and conservative experts who argue that tough sentencing policies have played an important role in driving down crime rates. The Republican electoral victories this week could also stiffen resistance to sweeping change.The grant is going to the political arm of the A.C.L.U., which has far more leeway to lobby for laws, run ads on television and finance political action committees to promote candidates than the groups larger, traditional branch, which relies more on litigation. As a result, the money is not tax-deductible.While the A.C.L.U. has often been associated with liberal causes like ending the death penalty and promoting same-sex marriage, Anthony D. Romero, the groups executive director, said the organization was building ties with conservative leaders promoting alternatives to incarceration and would not hesitate to aid Republican candidates who support needed steps.I think criminal justice reform is one of the few issues where you can break through the partisan gridlock, Mr. Romero said, adding that the group would seek out Republican lobbying firms to help reach legislators.In the latest example of converging views, conservatives including Newt Gingrich and B. Wayne Hughes Jr., a Christian philanthropist, joined the Soros-led foundation and the A.C.L.U. in support of Proposition 47, a California ballot measure to redefine many lower-level felonies, including possession for personal use of hard drugs, as misdemeanors. The change, which passed by a wide margin on Tuesday, is expected to keep tens of thousands of offenders out of prison and save the state hundreds of millions of dollars each year.The Koch brothers, major funders of conservative causes and candidates, have joined in. Koch Industries recently gave a grant of significant six figures to the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers to support the defense of indigents, said Mark Holden, senior vice president and general counsel at Koch Industries.Whether the human cost or the societal cost, what were doing in the criminal justice system isnt working, Mr. Holden said. Were finding common ground with people with different political affiliations, he said, praising the advocacy work of the A.C.L.U. in this field.The A.C.L.U. campaign will be directed by Alison Holcomb, who led the effort in Washington State to legalize marijuana.The group plans to use ads to insert issues like drug policy, mandatory sentences and prison re-entry into early primary states in the presidential elections, such as Iowa and New Hampshire, and then in key battlegrounds like Pennsylvania and Florida, Mr. Romero said.It will also develop a state-by-state database describing who is in prison for what crimes and then target local politicians and prosecutors who promote what Mr. Romero called overincarceration.Mr. Romero said the goal of the campaign was to reduce incarceration by 50 percent in eight years.Todd R. Clear, a criminologist and the provost of Rutgers University-Newark, said he agreed that the time was right for a major shift in justice policies. Efforts to reduce probation revocations and to lighten sentences, especially for nonviolent crimes, have already brought reductions or headed off growth in prisoner numbers in a number of states, he noted, while the federal government is reducing penalties for some drug crimes, although bipartisan bills that would overhaul federal sentencing did not pass this year.But he cautioned that to achieve a decline anywhere near as steep as that proposed by the A.C.L.U., far more politically contentious changes would be necessary.Well have to make sentencing reforms for violent crime, too, he said, including major changes in drug laws and the multidecade sentences often imposed on violent or repeat offenders.Mr. Soros and the Open Society Foundations have long promoted these kinds of changes in American criminal policies, investing roughly $175 million in them since 2004, plus an additional $62.5 million aimed at legalizing marijuana and reducing drug penalties.I think you see a growing consensus that the criminal justice system in America is broken and this is a time to try new approaches, said Christopher Stone, president of the Open Society Foundations and a criminal justice expert, explaining why the group had made the large grant to the A.C.L.U. at this time.",2014-11-07,marijuana

The Investigation Department has been urging the Correction Department for years to improve screening of jail employees but to no avail.Weapons and narcotics remain easily available to any inmate with funds to pay for them, the report said.The report called on the Correction Department to take steps to bolster screening, such as using drug-sniffing dogs at employee entrances. Though the powerful correction officers union has long opposed such searches, the agencys commissioner, Joseph Ponte, told investigators that he would comply.Investigators say that while visitors to city jails bring in some contraband, a large proportion of the illegal trafficking is carried out by uniformed guards and civilian employees. The report described the arrests of six officers and a nurse for contraband over the last year and a half.Given the extent of smuggling that we know goes on and given what we know about whats coming in from visitors, a lot of stuff has to be coming in from guards and employees because this stuff doesnt magically appear, said Mark Peters, the commissioner for the Investigation Department.On Sept. 1, the Correction Department imposed what it described at the time as heightened security measures  including searching guards lunch containers  intended to go after smuggling by employees.It turns out these steps were not sufficient, Mr. Peters said.Last month, the undercover investigator, an employee with the Investigation Department, was able to sneak contraband into all six of the Rikers jails that he tried to enter. The pockets of his cargo pants, according to the report, were bulging with 250 packets of heroin; 24 strips of Suboxone, a pain killer; and half a pound of marijuana.Any kind of serious search by trained professionals should have caught this every time, Mr. Peters said.At one jail, the undercover investigator set off the metal detector twice. When a security officer asked the investigator to empty his pockets, the undercover responded that he already had emptied them, the report said. The officer accepted his answer without further inspection of his pockets.Mr. Peters said correction officers and civilian staff members often did not sell the drugs directly to inmates. Rather they served as couriers, shuttling contraband between people on the outside and the inmates for a fee that can range from $500 to $1,000.Mr. Ponte, in a statement, said he agreed with the Investigation Departments assessment that screening needed to be improved. I have zero tolerance for anyone, including staff, bringing contraband into D.O.C. facilities, he said. As part of D.O.C.s ongoing systemwide reforms, we are working on significant new steps to improve our methods for searching for contraband.In addition to the dogs, Mr. Ponte said that special operations officers would be posted at each entrance to inspect employees, replacing rank-and-file guards. There is also a plan to upgrade screening techniques to conform to federal airport security standards.The report said the Correction Department had agreed to significantly enhance its security procedures.The Department of Investigation said the drug-sniffing dogs and new security teams should be put in place within six months. Mr. Peters said he expected that the dogs would be used for random searches at each of the 10 jails at Rikers several times a week, though he said Mr. Ponte would have the final say about the deployment of the canine units.The success of the new security measures could depend in large part on the response from the correction officers union and its president, Norman Seabrook. In an interview last week, Mr. Seabrook said that even agreeing to the modest changes in September, including checking the lunches, caused friction with the rank-and-file.I took some heat for it, he said.In an emailed statement on Thursday, Mr. Seabrook did not say whether he supported the use of dogs and other new measures. He said he backed the enhanced procedures adopted in September, adding that they provide a safe working environment for everyone.There will always be those in any organization that scam the system, he said. We will do everything to bring about the change needed to protect them, the inmates and nonuniformed staff equally.For the report, the investigation agency observed 15 shift changes and reviewed 50 hours of surveillance video from June through October, monitoring the entry of over 2,500 employees.Even after the heightened security measures imposed in September, the report said that some officers still refused to have their food X-rayed or were allowed to place their lunch containers on top of the X-ray machines without having them scanned.Security officers also permitted some people to enter even though they set off the metal detectors, the report said.Having observed screening procedures for six weeks, the report said, it is clear to D.O.I. that such compliance will not be achieved absent additional drastic interventions.Mr. Peters said he expected that his investigators would continue to monitor the security procedures at Rikers and possibly make more arrests.Narcotics trafficking within Rikers is not just bad because weve got prisoners taking narcotics, Mr. Peters said.

However, they say, the debate wasabsent from the 2014 campaign trail perhaps because it was less controversial, or because candidates feared being seen as soft on crime. This silence creates the risk that a moment of promise will become a missed opportunity for change.But even though candidates avoided any national discussion of the pressing issue, some ballot initiatives could yet influence the criminal justice system.Voters in California decided to pass Proposition 47, a measure aiming to reclassify as misdemeanors rather than felonies the personal possession of a number of illegal drugs, and the theft of property valued at $950 or less. The measure will also result in resentencing thousands of inmates.We hope were setting a precedent for the nation, Lynne Lyman, the state director of the Drug Policy Alliance, told The Los Angeles Times.Although it was overshadowed by other propositions on the states ballot, the measure has divided some of the nations highest lawmakers, and along unusual lines.The proposition was supported by a five major foundations, The Los Angeles Times reports, including Vote Safe, bankrolled by the billionaire and backer of progressive causes George Soros. Brad Pitt, Jay-Z and Cameron Diaz are part of Artists for 47, a group of Hollywood actors and rock stars standing behind the proposition.The actress Olivia Wilde writes for the Huffington Post that she supports the measure as a mother, sympathetic to the women who face steeper obstacles than men in rebuilding their lives after leaving prison. Some of the funds saved on reducing the number of prisoners would go toward K-12 education.Conversely, from $50 million to $100 million of the savings would be funneled each year into mental health care and drug treatment. Democratic State Senator Darrell Steinbergwrote (along with Rusty Selix) an op-ed for The Sacramento Bee focusing on the propositions impact on the ill and addicted. Mr. Steinberg decries Californias approach to mental health programs, including massive cuts: By failing to invest in local treatment and recovery options, it is, sadly, no surprise that people with mental health needs have ended up in our jails, courts and prisons.Joining Mr. Steinberg, Ms. Wilde and Mr. Pitt were allies from a wholly different world.Senator Rand Paul, Republican ofKentucky, a vocal proponent of criminal justice reform, writes for The Orange County Register with B. Wayne Hughes Jr., a conservative California billionaire, that they were surprised at the number of people asking them why, as Republicans, were they working to change our criminal justice system. Why wouldnt we? Mr. Rand and Mr. Hughes say that the system must be changed, because it drains tax dollars, destabilizes families and, worse, isnt making us any safer.Using similar language of the fiscally conservative, Newt Gingrich, the former Republican speaker of the House, also came out supporting the measure(andalso writing with Mr. Hughes).Reducing wasteful corrections spending and practices is long overdue in California, Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Hughes write, pointing out that while the crime rates are similar, the number of inmates is five times larger than it was 50 years ago. And as Californians know, the states prison system ballooned over the last few decades and became so crowded that federal judges have mandated significant reductions.Coming out against the proposition were representatives of Californias law enforcement and voices from both sides of the aisle.Writing for Fox News, WilliamWhalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, calls the early release initiative a roll of dice meets ticking time bomb.Referring to the existing measures that enable the early release of those convicted of child endangerment or short sentences for spousal abuse, Mr. Whalen writes: Such could be Californias future: revolving-door justice that fails at protecting the endangered.Californias Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein agreed in anop-ed for The Los Angeles Daily News that the proposition would not make the state any safer. She points out that stealing a firearm worth less than $950 would be, for instance, classified as a misdemeanor. She writes that the measure would ultimately lead to the release of thousands of dangerous criminals, and a wholesale reclassification of many dangerous felonies as misdemeanors would put the people of California at continued risk going forward.The California Police Chiefs Associationstarted a campaignagainst the initiative.In the end, after shattering some ideological divides, Proposition 47 passed, proving the bipartisan nature of calls for reforming the criminal justice system.It was not the only proposition to pass that ostensibly veers away from the tough on crime stance. Nicole Flatow at Think Progress writes that by supporting these ballots, voters sent a signal that they were ready to reform the system.As part of a larger bipartisan push, voters inNew Jersey supported a bail reformthat would ensure that who was kept behind bars depended on the severity of their crime, and not their income.Washington, D.C., Oregon and Alaska voted to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, which could lead to fewer people in the countrys overcrowded prisons. Ms. Flatow points out that the messages of support for these measures were entirely different in libertarian Alaska, the message focused on the relative safety of marijuana abuse, while in Washington, the vote depended on a significant population of very liberal gentrifiers mixed with longtime African-American residents who are sick and tired of criminal justice policies that arrest African-Americans for pot at eight times the rate of whites.It seems that despite political apathy and partisan polarization, it is possible for Americans to agree on a big issue even if for different reasons.",2014-11-06,marijuana

But first, lets look at what might happen in the final months of a Democratic-led Congress.Republicans may have thrashed them on Tuesday, but Democrats will still hold power in the Senate until the end of the year. And the maneuvering is well underway for what will or wont get done in the lame-duck session that begins next week.These final days present Democrats with a chance to take care of a few agenda items that will be difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish under the coming Republican Congress  moving on stalled nominations perhaps. And Republicans will have the opportunity to dispose of a few headaches before they start fresh in the new year.Top aides to Senator Harry Reid, still the majority leader for the moment, and Speaker John A. Boehner have been going over their plans for the session.Republicans want to find a way to finance the government through next September to take those sticky spending issues off the table for a while. They also hope to extend a series of business tax breaks.One issue involves a Pentagon policy bill. If it gets to the floor, it could inspire a flood of amendments on contentious issues like border security, presidential action on immigration and Ebola preparedness.And considering Senator Mitch McConnells promise as the prospective new majority leader to allow free-flowing amendments next year, it could be a preview of whats to come. Carl HulseIt was like watching someone who has had the weight of the world lifted from his shoulders.Maybe it was the fact that President Obama will never be held responsible for another election. Maybe it was because he could stop going to so many fund-raisers. Or perhaps he was relieved that he could move on his agenda without the fear of offending voters.Whatever the reason, the president was relaxed, calm  cheery, even  as he faced reporters on Wednesday. He said it more than once: I am really optimistic about America. The election results, he said, were disappointing.It doesnt make me mopey, he added. It energizes me.After a similar drubbing four years ago, a grim Mr. Obama seemed burdened by the sagging economy, by the election losses of many friends in the House who had just helped him pass the health care law, and by his own management failures.His tone was then reflective, acknowledging that presidents can lose track of the ways that we connected with folks that got us here in the first place. Losing control of the House was a shellacking that had taught him lessons.There was none of that on Wednesday. Instead, he was upbeat and expressed an eagerness to work with Republicans when he could and around them when he must.Some critics will say he was not sufficiently contrite.Mr. Obama just might not care. Michael D. ShearPresident Obama will posthumously award the Medal of Honor to First Lt. Alonzo H. Cushing of the Army for conspicuous gallantry during the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863.Michelle Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will join the president in the evening for In Person at the White House, where musicians including Mary J. Blige, Common, John Fogerty, Willie Nelson and Romeo Santos will perform.Speaker John A. Boehner holds his weekly briefing at 1:15 p.m.Nearly 800 years since its first issue, the Magna Carta heads to the Library of Congress to be displayed for a new exhibition.Hillary Rodham Clinton was not on any ballot this week, but that didnt stop Republicans on Wednesday from pinning the Democrats losses on her. And why not? President Obama, after all, will not be on any ballot in 2016.Voters were very clear, Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, told a news media gathering in Washington. They want nothing to do with the policies of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky  who, like Mrs. Clinton, seems to be preparing for a presidential run in 2016  was also having a little fun at her expense.Before all the votes had been counted, he put together a Facebook album titled #HillarysLosers featuring photographs of Mrs. Clinton with, among others, Alison Lundergan Grimes of Kentucky, Representative Bruce Braley of Iowa and Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina  all of whom were defeated on Tuesday.Voters sent a message to President Obama and Hillary Clinton, rejecting their policies and many of their candidates, Mr. Paul wrote.Not that Mrs. Clinton was among those rejected candidates. Thats on their wish list for November 2016.

Americans in their teens and 20s were to the left of their elders on social issues. They worried more about poverty. They voted strongly Democratic.In retrospect, we refer to this period as the 1960s, and it didnt last long, let alone forever. Less than a generation after young people were marching for civil rights and against the Vietnam War, they voted overwhelmingly for Ronald Reagan.Today, of course, the young are liberal again, and it seems as if they will be forever. They favor same-sex marriage, marijuana legalization, stricter gun laws, citizenship for illegal immigrants and an activist government that fights climate change and inequality. The Republican Party, as you have probably noticed, does not.But the temporary nature of the 1960s should serve as a reminder that politics change. What seems permanent can become fleeting.

As another officer, David Afanador, approached, Mr. Tribble raised his hands; Officer Afanador swung his gun at the teenagers mouth, breaking his teeth, prosecutors said.The episode on Aug. 29 has led to criminal charges against the two officers, who were arraigned on Wednesday.Officer Afanador, 33, was charged with felony-level assault, along with criminal possession of a weapon and official misconduct. Officer Isaac, 36, was charged with misconduct and misdemeanor assault.We had a 16-year-old boy with his hands up seeking to surrender who was attacked by members of the force who were supposed to protect him, the Brooklyn district attorney, Kenneth P.

But our democratic institutions are in trouble when they cant outpoll cockroaches. Which didnt even campaign.Politics is the noblest of professions, President Eisenhower said in 1954, and politics in the past often seemed a bright path toward improving our country. President Clinton represented a generation that regarded politics as a tool to craft a better world, and President Obama himself mobilized young voters with his gauzy message of hope. He presented himself as the politician who could break Washingtons gridlock and get things done  and weve seen how well that worked.Im in the middle of a book tour now, visiting universities and hearing students speak about yearning to make a difference. But they are turning not to politics as their lever but to social enterprise, to nonprofits, to advocacy, to business. They see that Wendy Kopp, who founded Teach for America in her dorm room at Princeton University, has had more impact on the education system than any current senator, and many have given up on political paths to change.A national exit poll conducted by Edison Research found that a majority of voters disapproved of Republicans and Democrats alike, and only 20 percent trust Washington to do whats right most or all the time.President Obama is licking his wounds in the White House, and he doesnt seem to accept that the election is a judgment on his presidency. Im sorry. When Democrats lose in Colorado and struggle in Virginia, when voters say theyre sending a message to the White House, its time for Obama to shake up his staff, reach out beyond his insular circle of longtime aides, and recalibrate.Critics are right that he should try harder to schmooze with legislators, although Im skeptical that Republicans are that charmable. After all, some polls have shown more than a third in the Republican Party said he was born abroad and about one-fifth suspected that he could be the antichrist.Yet its not just Obama who is looking ragged today. The entire political system is. Political scientists Nolan McCarty, Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal have charted the attitudes of the political parties back to 1879, and they found party polarization in recent years to be greater than at any time since their charts began.Thats partly because Democrats have become more liberal, but mostly because Republicans have become more conservative  indeed, more conservative than at any time since 1879.Politicians have also figured out what works for their own careers: playing to their base, denouncing the other side, and blocking rivals from getting credit for anything. Since many politicians are more vulnerable in a primary than in a general election, theres not much incentive for compromise.After Obama took office, Republicans assiduously tried to block him, even shutting down the federal government. Republican governors prevented their own citizens from getting health insurance through federally financed Medicaid. I see that as obstructionism, but it paid off in these midterms.Bravo to Obamas comments Wednesday about trying to cooperate with Republicans on issues including early education. But Im not holding my breath. Incentives today militate against bipartisan cooperation, and thats one reason the current Congress is on track to be the least productive in the post-World War II era.(Maybe we taxpayers could save money by paying members of Congress not by salary but by the piece, so much for each enacted law?)One bright spot in the midterms was voter action on ballot measures. They did actually break the gridlock. Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia legalized marijuana in some situations. Five states supported an increase in the minimum wage. Washington State approved universal background checks for gun purchases. California reduced prison sentences.So even if politicians are stalemated, voters managed to get things done. Yet we also get the national government we deserve, and thats an indictment of all of us.I find Americas political dysfunction particularly sad because Ive spent much of my journalistic career covering people risking their lives for democracy, and sometimes dying for it  from Taiwan to Ukraine, Congo to South Korea. It was 25 years ago that I saw people massacred near Tiananmen Square for demanding political change. They risked their lives because they dreamed that democracy would improve their lives and give them greater freedom and dignity.For those of us in the United States it was easy. We painlessly inherited democracy, yet Im afraid weve botched it.",2014-11-06,marijuana

And the lessons of that complex pattern  with voters in Oregon, Washington, D.C., and here in Alaska approving recreational marijuana, and in Florida supporting medical marijuana  are already being absorbed for the next wave of state voter referendums, and fights, already planned for 2016.People on both sides of the issue saw the victory in Alaska, where Republicans control most of the state government and liberal ideas rarely get much traction, as a particularly vivid signal flare.One of the really exciting developments from the results last night is that we have now legalized marijuana in a red state, said Taylor Bickford, a spokesman for the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, the main pro-legalization group here.To be sure, the margin of victory was smaller here than in other places, with 52 percent of the voters supporting legalization. But it was a clear majority nonetheless. About 55 percent of voters supported legalization in Oregon, and 69 percent said yes in Washington. In Florida, almost 58 percent of voters supported the first major attempt in the South to legalize marijuana for medical uses.Florida law, though, requires a 60 percent majority for any constitutional amendment, and legalization sponsors said they were already getting ready for another attempt in 2016, a presidential election year that they said would probably draw more young voters who are generally considered a prime base of support.In addition, voters in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada are likely to be able to vote on marijuana laws.But the question of rules and how the laws are put into effect  in the case of Washington, use and possession of marijuana are forbidden on federal land and where Congress can step in on local matters  is complex.None of the new laws take effect immediately, and Oregon has until January 2016 to formulate licensing policies and rules.The rule-writing procedure will differ from that of the first states to legalize, Washington and Colorado in 2012, because regulators will have those two examples to study, said Rob Patridge, the chairman of the Oregon Liquor Control Commission.Mr. Patridge, who is also a district attorney in Klamath County, near the California border, said visits to retail and growing operations in Washington State and Oregon would be part of the rule-writing agenda. The Oregon Legislature could also amend the measure even before the rules are written, he said.Were going to do it Oregons way, Mr. Patridge said.Initiative 71 in Washington, D.C., allows residents to possess up to two ounces of marijuana for personal use and to grow up to six cannabis plants at home. Measure 91 in Oregon allows possession by adults of up to eight ounces and four plants.Ballot Measure 2 in Alaska allows adults to possess one ounce and six plants. In all cases, the minimum age for legal possession of recreational marijuana is 21.But the main opposition group here in Alaska, Vote No on 2, said in a statement that even though the voting was over, the conversation was not.We look forward to a meaningful discussion of an Alaska-based approach to how this drug should be viewed legally and how to protect our communities and our kids from the commercialization of this substance, the statement said.A spokesman for the group, Charles Fedullo, said a meeting would be held on Friday to talk about next steps for volunteers to stay involved. Right now it is just analyzing what is happening and looking for the best way forward, he said.",2014-11-06,marijuana

To the N.F.L.s many backers, Moffitt was a nave idealist who did not know his own luck and would lament his decision.Moffitt, who lives in Seattle, said he had no regrets. Yet his journey into retirement at 27 has been a cautionary tale of how unprepared some professional athletes  even those with money, a four-year college degree and a supportive family  are for life outside the sports bubble.Leaving the N.F.L. on your choice is a transition I hadnt even realized, Moffitt said last week, a day before his 28th birthday. I thought if I made the choice, it would be easy. Im dealing with the fallout.That fallout started immediately. Moffitts life was abuzz for weeks after he told the Broncos president, John Elway, that he was done playing. Besieged with interview requests, he told reporters that playing in the N.F.L. made him feel like a commodity and that the risk of further damage was no longer worth the money or adulation.Yet after the attention faded, Moffitt struggled to replace the structure that defined his football life, with its predictable rhythms and ready-made circle of friends. He produced podcasts, did some public speaking and worked with a writer to shape his thoughts into a book. He went for a screen test and developed a stand-up comedy routine about life as a player that he has performed live.And he partied. Unshackled from the weekly schedules built around Sunday games, he was free to smoke marijuana, binge drink with college buddies and experiment with harder drugs. His relationship with his girlfriend soured, so he took to the road, staying with his parents in Connecticut and meeting up with friends in Los Angeles, Miami, New York and beyond.Just before St. Patricks Day, he hit bottom. After a day of drinking with friends in Chicago, he ended up alone in a basement club. A bouncer spotted him with a sunglasses case that was filled with a gram of cocaine, 10 grams of marijuana and four ecstasy pills. A scuffle ensued, and he was arrested and charged with battery and three counts of drug possession. He was released on his own recognizance a half-day later.The night in jail woke him up. Not only did he face more time in jail, but the story of his arrest was splashed on the Internet. His relationship with his girlfriend dissolved and book publishers withdrew interest in his story.It was like I jumped off a cliff, Moffitt said of his arrest and the negative publicity that followed. Those opportunities fell by the wayside. But it also sent me in a different direction.Before the drug charges were dismissed and he pleaded guilty to the other charge (he was fined $254), Moffitt enrolled in Passages, a high-end rehabilitation clinic in Malibu, Calif. There, he weaned himself off drugs and alcohol and let go of the pressure he felt to meet the expectations that others had for him, though fellow residents at the clinic quizzed him unendingly about his life in the N.F.L.The biggest thing was that I realized so many people were depending on me, and I felt that my only value is my production as a football player, he said. Whether it was expectations or money or the way I live, if I dont meet everyones expectations, Im a loser. It is out of love, but I felt like I was holding up this huge support system that was supposed to be my support system.Moffitts roller-coaster ride is not uncommon, said Bahati VanPelt, the executive director of the Trust, a group funded by the N.F.L. and players union that helps players after they retire. Players spend much of their childhood and their adult lives fixated on football and devote little time to developing skills that will help them afterward.Three-quarters of players drafted in the N.F.L. are gone within four years, either through injury or because they were cut, and they may feel they have failed or are too proud to ask others for help. Some players live away from those who could provide medical and psychological support, and some may not have saved much money.Ever since they were in high school, players are told not to worry about the next play, only this play, said VanPelt, who added that making the transition to life outside the N.F.L. could take from three months to two years. They were an expert in their field, and suddenly theyre expected to be an expert in other fields.Moffitt is still unsure of how he will make a living, though he is interested in the film industry. He has considered driving an Uber cab and doing more standup comedy. In a few months, he said he would leave Seattle and his circle of football friends to start fresh in a new city. He is spending time with Sean Pamphilon, who has made documentaries about football players and witnessed their ups and downs.Theres a duality to John that Im sure you understand: Hes incredibly funny, or he really wants to go inside himself and disappear, Pamphilon said. Im excited to see how he can use his brain while not getting it beaten in.By some standards, Moffitt  who joked that he had outlived Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison, three of his musical heroes, who all died at 27  is more fortunate than many players. He is single and has no children, and he worked with a financial adviser to put away money while he played. He moved into a smaller townhouse in Renton, not far from where the Seahawks, who drafted him in 2011, have their practice facility.He is also close with his parents, who loved that their son had made it to the N.F.L. and were taken aback when he walked away from the game. After Moffitt was arrested, his father did not give him any ultimatums but made it clear that it was up to him to change his behavior.I said, I love you and will visit you in jail, but I dont want to have to visit you in jail,  David Moffitt said. I told him, Youre at a crossroad; there is no in between. Moffitts father said his son was no angel, and he said he recognized that John had partied too much but said, You put it under the rug. Ultimately, he said he was happy that John was at peace with his decision.Hes much more relaxed and not jacked up all the time, the elder Moffitt said. He doesnt have any regrets, and I dont either.",2014-11-06,marijuana

Most were contests of political blame, driven by ideological hatred for President Obama. But when the ballot offered a choice on an actual policy, rather than between candidates with a D or R next to their names, voters made notably liberal decisions in both red and blue states.On at least six high-profile and often contentious issues  minimum wage, marijuana legalization, criminal justice reform, abortion rights, gun control and environmental protection  voters approved ballot measures, in some cases overwhelmingly, that were directly at odds with the positions of many of the Republican winners.MINIMUM WAGE Initiatives to raise the minimum wage appeared on the ballots in four deep-red states  Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota  and passed in all of them. The new hourly minimums range from $8.50 in Arkansas by 2017 to $9.75 in Alaska by 2016. Minimum-wage increases were also approved in San Francisco (to $15 an hour by 2018) and Oakland (to $12.25 an hour by 2015). In all, an estimated 609,000 low-wage workers will see raises from these approved increases.In addition, voters in Illinois and in several cities and counties in Wisconsin approved nonbinding measures calling for minimums of $10 or more. If legislators follow through on the voters will, 1.1 million workers in those states would see raises.The latest increases bring to 29 the number of states that exceed, or soon will exceed, the paltry federal minimum of $7.25 an hour, which has been in place since 2009. They underscore the broad support for higher minimums and suggest that Republicans who continue to oppose a higher federal minimum could pay a price in the 2016 elections, when lower-wage workers and those who support them could turn out in higher numbers.MARIJUANA  Oregon and Alaska became the third and fourth states to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes (Colorado and Washington were the first two), while the District of Columbia repealed all criminal and civil penalties for possession and allowed limited, private cultivation of the drug.Even where pro-legalization measures lost, advocates had reason to feel positive. A proposed constitutional amendment in Florida to legalize medical marijuana received 57 percent of the vote, but it still failed because amendments there require at least 60 percent approval.Before Tuesdays election, it was already clear that Americans had turned against prohibition because more than 30 states had liberalized their marijuana laws. Maybe elected officials, who have lagged behind the public on this issue, will finally have the courage to embrace change.CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM For the second time in three years, Californians voted to shorten the sentences of people serving time in prison. The state  which created the notorious three-strikes law  remains under federal court order to reduce prison overcrowding.In 2012, voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 36, which has led to the early release of more than 1,900 three-strikers serving life in prison. And there has not been an increase in crime. Proposition 47 on this weeks ballot converts low-level drug and property offenses  like shoplifting, writing bad checks or simple drug possession  from felonies to misdemeanors. It is expected to reduce the sentences of as many as 10,000 inmates.On Tuesday, the measure, which enjoyed broad bipartisan support, passed with more than 58 percent of the vote. Many politicians are still afraid of looking soft on crime, but Californias experience shows that voters can lead the way.ABORTION RIGHTS The overwhelming rejection of personhood measures in Colorado and North Dakota dealt another well-deserved blow to the effort by some opponents of reproductive rights to ban all abortions (and some common forms of contraception) by passing laws giving fertilized eggs legal rights and protections that apply to individuals.The defeat in Colorado was not unexpected. Voters there handily quashed earlier personhood initiatives in 2008 and 2010, and they were not deceived by this rounds revised wording. But few expected a similar proposal to be rejected by 64 percent of voters in North Dakota, a conservative state that  like Mississippi, which roundly defeated a personhood initiative three years ago  has just one abortion provider remaining.Unfortunately, opponents of abortion rights scored a victory in Tennessee, where nearly 53 percent of voters approved a state constitutional amendment that gives the Republican-led State Legislature leeway to curtail access to safe and legal abortion care. While nothing will change immediately, there will likely be a rush to enact new abortion restrictions beyond those already in place in the months ahead. But politicians in Tennessee would be wrong to read Tuesdays relatively close vote as a mandate to obliterate a womans fundamental right.GUN CONTROL In the aftermath of the school massacre in 2012 in Newtown, Conn., Congress  caving to the National Rifle Association  did nothing to protect the public from gun violence. In Washington State, a campaign started by outraged church and community leaders fared much better. Initiative 594, which will require criminal and mental-health checks on gun buyers, drew an impressive 60 percent voter support on Tuesday.Just as important, the gun lobbys measure  Initiative 591, which was on the same ballot  would have blocked background checks and was defeated by 55 percent of the vote. Other campaigns are underway at the statehouse level, supported by former New York City mayor Michael Bloombergs well-financed gun-safety movement and others. Opponents decried Mr. Bloombergs campaign as outside interference but got nowhere this time.CONSERVATION Environmentalists who may be singing the blues over the election results can take heart from approval of a record $13 billion in land conservation measures in states and cities across the country. Two were especially significant.In Florida, a constitutional amendment will dedicate $9 billion in real estate transfer taxes over the next 20 years to preserving open spaces, including major investments in the threatened Everglades.New Jersey voters dedicated $2.15 billion in corporate tax revenue to land conservation, also over the next 20 years, rescuing a popular program that was on the verge of extinction. The message for President Obama is that the public will support executive actions to protect threatened wilderness, even if Congress does not.",2014-11-06,marijuana

Its called his condo.","ST. PAUL  Two years ago, Elizabeth Millard discovered a way to put fresh produce into car food. No, shes not the one who smuggled shredded lettuce into the Doritos Cheesy Gordita Crunch-Fiery, a 490-calorie, zero-noun snack from Taco Bell. Rather, Ms. Millard, a sustainable farmer outside the Twin Cities, did something even more unlikely: she grew a crop of microgreens on the passenger-side floor mat of her 2005 VW Beetle convertible.We were shuttling our box of seeds back and forth from our rented greenhouse space to our house, she said the other day. And I tripped and they fell all over the place. Cress, mustards, a little purple mizuna.Ms. Millard added: Being frustrated and lazy, I decided I would clean them up some time in my lifetime. Which means never.It rained the next day. Ms. Millard, now 46, and Karla Pankow, her partner in life and in their C.S.A. business, called Bossy Acres, tracked mud into the car. After that, the June sun busted loose and they threw down the top. I think you can see where this is going.About five days after the incident, I came out to my car in the morning and there was a beautiful flush carpet of microgreens on the passenger side, Ms. Millard said. It looked like a Chia Pet.The accident fed the philosophy behind her new book Indoor Kitchen Gardening: Turn Your Home Into a Year-Round Vegetable Garden (Cool Springs Press). This is a how-to guide that describes Ms. Millards experiments raising crops  sun-loving outdoor plants like herbs, carrots, radishes, potatoes and tomatoes  in her Minneapolis bungalow.I, for one, have daydreamed about owning a conservatory: a bright, climate-controlled growing space with windows, supplemental lights and a handy watering source. And here was Ms. Millard to tell me that I already possessed such a space, and it was called my condo.You dont have to be a plant whisperer to enjoy success in this endeavor. Although, occasionally, you do have to be the bee. In a quest for bug-less indoor pollination, Ms. Millard stimulated the tomatos reproductive parts with her electric toothbrush. (Talk about forbidden fruit.) But what she discovered, and what the book illustrates, is that its possible and even easy to cultivate shoots, greens and the odd root crop with almost no special equipment.The VW microgreens did not become the stuff of a piquant salad. I cant imagine the carpet of your car is a food-safe environment, Ms. Millard said. (What vinaigrette goes with road salt?) Instead, it became a proof of concept. The lesson is: Dont worry about it so much, Ms. Millard said of her indoor garden. If the conditions are right, it will happen.In many ways, the gardening conditions in the northland are best suited to ornamental berries, red-barked shrubs and alcoholism. The professional eschatologists (known elsewhere as meteorologists) were predicting scattered frosts for the night after Ms. Millard paid me a house call. It was early September.The parsley and sage in my backyard could hang on until Thanksgiving. But if I didnt bring the basil inside now, I wouldnt see it again until May or June.While I was outside, I noticed a volunteer tomato seedling and a stray mint. What would be the harm in digging them up and converting them into house pets? (Ms. Millard recommends converting the garage or a three-season porch into a kind of halfway house where the plants can get acclimated.)I asked Ms. Millard about what may still be growing at her house across town. But she had moved out soon after finishing a draft of the book. While she and Ms. Pankow shopped for farmland of their own, they were dwelling in a downscale version of that VW Microgreen: a 25-year-old Coachman fifth-wheel camper they bought from friends for $2,000. The quarters were homey; a previous owner had gone through the effort of painting the wallpaper.Its surprisingly spacious, she said. Its like a New York apartment.Except, presumably, in New York it would have cost $2.65 million in an all-cash transaction and another $1 million for a parking spot.Ms. Millard has good news for the yardless metropolitan. Much of the equipment you need for indoor kitchen gardening is already in the kitchen. Sprouts should grow in a Mason jar with a screen lid for air and drainage. Soak the seeds (Ms. Millard likes the flavor of broccoli). Then, after a day or two, turn the jar upside down and wait.Are the white filaments edible food or some type of brassica thrush? Ms. Millard was noncommittal. I will sprout things if people ask me to, she said. But I have not been a huge fan.Farther down in the cupboards, pie plates or baking sheets make satisfactory planters to grow microgreens or shoots. At the start, plastic wrap can keep the seeds humid. You may even have the shoot seeds in the bulk bin: say, dried peas, raw sunflower seeds or untreated popcorn.Germination isnt a sign of spoilage; its the goal here. Ms. Millard recommends soaking the seeds for a day or two beforehand, changing the water now and again. If you leave them longer than that, theyll give off a really vile smell, she said, like burning moldy feet. At this point, youre not raising food but developing a biological weapons program.The easiest indoor gardening projects look a lot like seed-starting. You dont need much dirt: an inch and a half for sprouts, and maybe half an inch for microgreens (a regular lettuce mix, harvested early). You can do that on a paper towel, she said. Theyre not going to grow into their fullest expression of what they could be. But then, who among us hasnt thought about their own dirt nap and harbored the same self-doubt?Ms. Millard had dragged a full bag of vermiculite as big as a pillowcase up the three flights of stairs. This, of course, was a bit of a sight gag: the white filler looks like Styrofoam and weighs no more. The idea was to mix it with a bagged organic compost she likes, called Cowsmo. But any indoor potting mix with a little fertilizer would do.You want something that drains really well, Ms. Millard said. Dirt from your garden is too dense. As a no-pesticide farmer, she welcomed the chance for a clean start. Theres a book to be written about how to breed common garden bugs in the house, but lets leave that to the newspapers entomology expert.Ms. Millard totes a stack of 20-inch black plastic planting flats almost everywhere she goes, the same way a real estate agent seems to bleed a trail of lawn signs. Get the ones with the bottom watering slits and the translucent lids. They are a masterful piece of industrial design, they cost about $1.50 each and they look just like garbage.A Pyrex casserole dish makes a smarter display. It may help with the drainage to put a low layer of gravel in the bottom, Ms. Millard said, prepping the planter. A few handfuls of soil mix flew into the trays. She was no more delicate with the pea seeds and the popcorn kernels, scattering a single layer over the surface. Being housebound, they wouldnt need a coat of dirt on top.Youll want to sow at the kind of density you would see in front of the stage at Bonnaroo. Once the sprouts come up, Ms. Millard said, you could have someone crowd surf without falling in.At this point, Ms. Millard mentioned a piece of look-for-it-in-the-basement gear: a box fan. A little airflow helps ward off disease and stiffens a plants resolve.My summer corn crop in the yard had been a mixed success. By that I mean it was a success for the squirrels that stripped the stalks clean and a total failure for me, who waited 80 days and got nothing.Depending on your conditions in here, after about two weeks you should be able to harvest them, Ms. Millard said. Cut them like youre giving them the worst haircut in the world.I said, I think Ive given someone that haircut.Ms. Millard said, I think Ive had that haircut.What about lights? This is the question that every lay agronomist seems to ask, Ms. Millard said. Its as if she has proposed a suspect workaround: school without homework, say, or an affair without text messaging (I mean, sex).Ms. Millard dutifully runs through the options in the book. A window with southern exposure will get you somewhere. But the plant will need to be close to the pane, where conditions may be drafty. Incandescent bulbs give off more heat than light. Ms. Millard doesnt spend too much time on specialty lighting systems: HID, LED or plasma. This kind of expertise and budget are the province of the marijuana cultivator. We have a lot to learn from them.Ultimately, Ms. Millard recommends cheap shop lights, with full-spectrum bulbs (t5 or t8) and reflective hoods. The adjustable fixtures are better still: You can start them a couple of inches above the newly sprouted seeds and raise them as your plants grow.Wed moved on to planting herbs and root crops. Untreated potatoes from the farmers market would turn into suitable plants. Just wait for the eyes to form. Ms. Millard suggested putting five or six in a 15-gallon pot. They should get some light during the day, she said. But, potatoes do well with the whole benign-neglect situation. Theyre like children that way.Rounded carrots and radishes wouldnt outgrow their Procrustean beds. She mentioned French baby carrots (carefully bred in France!) and a favorite radish called Parisienne, which had the soul of a carrot. Alas, indoors, they would grow about as fast as the European economy. Carrots take forever, Ms. Millard said. About two months, if youre lucky.In the end, she harvested maybe 10 carrots  not the kind of bounty to run through a juicer. When you spend that much time and love, she said, you slice them up and eat them raw like carpaccio.She wouldnt blame anyone who concluded that indoor kitchen gardening is impractical. Theres something of the hobbyist to it, she said.Before I forget, then, heres a reminder. In New York City, the outdoor planting date for carrots is only 150 days away.",2014-11-06,marijuana

John W. Hickenloopers narrow victory over Bob Beauprez defied a wave of Republican victories in races for governor in usual Democratic strongholds like Maryland, Massachusetts and Illinois.","DENVER   It was getting late on election night, and Gov. John W. Hickenlooper was trailing. Colorados senior United States senator, Mark Udall, had already conceded defeat, and other Democratic politicians were falling here and across the country. Political allies reported encouraging signs  long lines at college-town polling sites, strong support in Colorados suburban counties  but it was never supposed to be this close for Mr. Hickenlooper, a governor who had cast himself as a moderate, pro-energy Democrat at the helm of a growing Western economy.I feel nervous at every moment, Mr. Hickenlooper, watching results roll in, said in a hotel room above Denvers newly refurbished Union Station, his tie loosening with each passing hour. I feel nervous at every moment.By Wednesday morning, thousands of late votes from the Democratic bastions of Denver and Boulder had reversed the gap, giving Mr. Hickenlooper a narrow win that defied a wave of Republican victories in races for governor in usual Democratic strongholds like Maryland, Massachusetts and Illinois.His victory over his Republican challenger, the former congressman Bob Beauprez, also staved off a rout of Democrats in Colorado, a state where Democrats have flourished in recent years. Representative Cory Gardner decisively beat Mr. Udall to become the first Colorado Republican elected to the Senate in more than a decade, and Representative Mike Coffman, a Republican, handily rebuffed a Democratic challenge in a district that had been redrawn to include many immigrants.That Mr. Beauprez, a banker and bison rancher who lost his last bid for governor by 17 points, had come so close to beating Mr. Hickenlooper offered a warning to Democrats about the precariousness of power in a swing state that has embraced legal marijuana but roundly rejected tax increases to fund schools.At a news conference tinged with celebration and giddy relief, Mr. Hickenlooper theatrically wiped his brow and sketched out a second-term agenda that would focus on job growth and an education overhaul. He said he wanted to help the long-term unemployed as well as the economies of cities like Pueblo and Colorado Springs, where growth has lagged.Its a moment, an opportunity, to seize the bit and move forward, Mr. Hickenlooper said, in a nod to the dissatisfaction in conservative rural corners of the state.He said he had talked on the phone with Mr. Gardner, the newly elected senator, who promised that the two leaders would be able to work well together, though he did not say on what.Mr. Beauprez conceded the race for governor on Wednesday afternoon.It was still unclear on Wednesday whether Mr. Hickenlooper would govern with a divided legislature or one that retained Democratic control. County officials in suburban Denver were still sifting through ballots in close races that could determine control of the State Senate, which had a one-vote Democratic majority entering the elections.Colorado Democrats did celebrate at least one comeback: They reclaimed two State Senate seats that had been lost to Republicans in recall elections in September 2013 amid a rash of populist anger over Colorados new laws requiring background checks on private gun sales and limiting the size of ammunition magazines.Mr. Hickenloopers re-election victory was much narrower than his first win, in 2010, when he vaulted into office over a divided, dysfunctional Republican field as a former brewpub owner and Denver mayor who had endeared himself to voters with quirky, positive campaign ads.Mr. Hickenloopers win, by about 26,000 votes as of Wednesday afternoon, and Mr. Udalls 77,000-vote loss suggested a split verdict on Democratic candidates. Voters ratified a governor who had led the state through floods, fires and a mass shooting inside a movie theater, but they ousted a senator who had alienated some voters by focusing relentlessly on his opponents positions on abortion and birth control.One voter who split the ticket, William Kaufman, 25, a law student at the University of Colorado, Boulder, said Mr. Hickenlooper had run on his record while Mr. Udall had run a fear-mongering campaign against Mr. Gardner. As a result, Mr. Kaufman said, he voted for both Mr. Gardner and Mr. Hickenlooper.At the end of the day, he said, I found myself appreciating Hickenloopers track record.",2014-11-06,marijuana

Adults will be allowed to have up to two ounces of marijuana and cultivate some plants for personal use, though the ballot measure would not permit sales; however, the City Council has already started looking into passing a law that would.The victory for marijuana advocates does not mean the drug will be legal immediately  or even at all. Congress has the constitutional authority to intervene in city law, and once the measure is delivered to Capitol Hill, lawmakers will have about two months to stop it from taking effect. Many Republican lawmakers in particular oppose easing restrictions in their own backyard on a drug that remains illegal under federal law. And with control of both chambers, there may be little to stop lawmakers from intervening. Most recently, a Republican congressman tried to block the law that reduced the penalty for some marijuana possession to a $25 fine.Muriel E. Bowsers victory closes the book on an unusually competitive mayoral election for the District of Columbia. In the liberal-leaning city, the Democratic primary has historically been the real contest for mayor, with the winner easily taking the general election. But after upsetting Mayor Vincent C. Gray in the spring, Ms. Bowser, a Democratic councilwoman, faced a strong challenge from David A. Catania, an independent who had won races for one of the City Councils at-large seats.Karl Racine on Tuesday became the first attorney general elected by District of Columbia voters, emerging from a crowded field of Democrats. He distinguished himself with the late endorsement of former President Bill Clinton. Mr. Racine worked as an associate White House counsel in the Clinton administration.Attorneys general were appointed by the mayor before a measure approved by voters in 2010 added it to the electoral slate. But the contest for the top legal official was not added to this years ballot until June, when the citys highest court overruled the City Councils efforts to delay the election until 2018.Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbias longtime nonvoting representative in Congress and an outspoken advocate of granting statehood to her district, trounced her opponents. She will continue to serve in the position created by Congress in 1970, which allows the delegate to speak on the House floor and serve on committees, but not vote.",2014-11-05,marijuana

A proposal to allow medical marijuana failed in Florida.","onalVoters in four states on Tuesday supported measures to raise their minimum wages, bringing the number of states that have passed such laws to 29 and reflecting widespread dissatisfaction with Congresss failure to increase the federal minimum of $7.25.Residents of Washington, D.C., and Oregon voted to allow recreational use of marijuana, following the lead of Colorado and Washington State. But in Florida, a hotly contested measure to expand the use of marijuana for medical treatment, now permitted in 23 states, failed narrowly. Though a majority of voters approved the measure, the margin fell short of the 60 percent it needed to pass.Support for low-wage workers and marijuana legalization were just two issues among the many that voters considered in 146 state ballot measures in 41 states, covering such topics as genetically modified food, the right to bear arms and the right to bait bears.In Massachusetts, voters upheld by a wide margin a 2011 law to allow casino gambling, after heavy spending by gambling interests, and in another lift for workers rights, they required employers to give employees paid sick leave.Though it may seem as if voters had an overwhelming number of issues to decide, the numbers of ballot measures are actually trending down, according to the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California. The number of citizen-led initiatives and referendums was at its lowest in an even-numbered year since 1974, in part because some states have made it more difficult to put measures on the ballot.Just as notable, perhaps, is what was not subject to the popular vote. Amendments defining marriage as a heterosexual institution were missing, as were measures requiring voter identification  though several initiatives dealt with early voting and voter registration. States for the most part avoided the hotly disputed topic of immigration, except in Oregon, where voters rejected a measure that would have allowed illegal immigrants to get drivers licenses.Some ballot measures are used as a political tool to raise voter interest. Republican critics said some of the measures to increase the minimum wage had been placed on the ballot to bolster turnout for vulnerable Democrats, but support for raising the minimum wage has historically crossed party lines.I cant stress how popular of an issue it is among voters regardless of political affiliation, said Tsedeye Gebreselassie, a senior staff lawyer for the National Employment Law Project. And the federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009.Four states  Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota  passed measures to increase the minimum wage. Alaskas measure will increase the minimum wage to $9.75 in 2016, the Arkansas measure raises the minimum wage to $8.50 by 2017, Nebraskas will rise to $9 by 2016 and South Dakotas goes to $8.50. By a wide margin, Illinois voters also recommended an increase to the minimum wage, but the vote was nonbinding.Both advocates and opponents of marijuana legalization had expected voters to approve the Oregon and Washington, D.C., measures.The Washington initiative makes it legal for adults to possess and grow limited amounts of marijuana for personal use, while Oregons allows adults age 21 and over to have up to eight ounces of marijuana in their home, and up to four plants. The manufacture and sale of marijuana products would be licensed and regulated by the State Liquor Control Commission. Congress may attempt to block Washingtons vote on marijuana and Representative Andy Harris, a Republican from Maryland, has already promised to do so.But Mason Tvert, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, which supports legalization, said, The movement toward ending marijuana prohibition will not go backward; its simply a question of how quickly it moves forward,Voters in Alaska also moved to legalized marijuana.In Florida, where the marijuana issue figured in the governors race, the story was different. There, John Morgan, a prominent trial lawyer and a supporter of the Democratic challenger, Charlie Crist, spent $3.8 million supporting the medical marijuana measure, according to Ballotpedia, an online politics encyclopedia that tracks ballot initiatives. Sheldon Adelson, a casino magnate, spent even more, $5.5 million, opposing it, according to committee filings.Mr. Crist favored the measure and even said it might bring more younger voters to the polls, potentially bolstering his support, while the Republican incumbent, Rick Scott, and former Gov. Jeb Bush, also a Republican, opposed it. Support for the measure started strong but slipped in recent polls, and Mr. Crist lost to Mr. Scott.The vast majority of America has not legalized marijuana, so I dont think its a foregone conclusion that the nation will follow Colorado and Washington State, both of which legalized recreational use of marijuana in 2012, said Kevin Sabet, the head of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, which opposes legalizing the recreational use of the drug. As the negative effects show up, it could start to turn people off.Another perennial issue, gambling, has become more urgent as states wrestle with casino closings and bankruptcies. In Massachusetts, a 2011 law allowed for three casinos and one slot-machine parlor, none of which have been built. The initiative to repeal the law attracted deep-pocketed opposition from the gambling industry, which vastly outspent anti-casino groups and argued that gambling would create jobs and that the slot parlor, which was under construction, had already done so.No state has repealed a law expanding gambling since the era of the modern casino began in 1931, according to Clyde W. Barrow, a political scientist at the University of Texas-Pan American.California had perhaps the most expensive ballot measure fight in the country, pitting trial lawyers against doctors over a measure that would have required doctors to take drug and alcohol tests, and would also have raised the cap on pain and suffering awards in medical malpractice cases.The measure failed, as doctors and insurance companies spent heavily to defeat it; together, the two deep-pocketed sides raised more than $70 million.Californias governor, Jerry Brown, who won re-election Tuesday, also spent more on television ads supporting two ballot measures than he did on his own campaign. Both measures passed easily: One authorizes $7.1 billion in water infrastructure projects during a historic drought, and the other requires the state to save more in its rainy-day fund and to pay down more debt.California voters also approved a ballot measure intended to address prison overcrowding by reducing many nonviolent felonies to misdemeanors.Some hot-button issues like abortion and gun control were scarce on this years ballots, but in Colorado, the group Personhood USA backed an amendment to defined an unborn human as a person in Colorados criminal code and wrongful-death act. The group has twice failed to win passage of a broader amendment that would have granted personhood to an unborn human being in all areas of law, and its more limited measure was again rejected by voters on Tuesday.In North Dakota, voters rejected a similar amendment that said life begins at conception. But in Tennessee, voters approved an amendment allowing the legislature to regulate abortion, a power that was denied by a State Supreme Court decision in 2000.Also in Washington, voters approved a measure that would expand background checks on all gun sales as well as transfers, including private transactions. A second, rival measure that would have prevented the state from expanding checks beyond what federal requirements was trailing.",2014-11-05,marijuana

Ad after ad by Republicans and outside conservative groups declared that Mr. Udall voted with the president 99 percent of the time.This guy just follows in lock step with the president, said Dustin Zvonek, of the Colorado chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a group funded by the conservative Koch brothers. Coloradans, it doesnt matter if youre a Republican or a Democrat. They want someone whos independent, whos there for them. Its really a Western thing.Few Republicans doubted Mr. Gardners conservative credentials, which allowed him to quickly pivot to the center to court the unaffiliated voters who make up a third of Colorados electorate. He announced his support for providing birth control pills without a prescription and promised that he would stand up to fellow Republicans when he disagreed with them.Democrats scoffed at the claims as hollow, election-year feints toward bipartisanship. But in the end, it was the Republican from the eastern farming town of Yuma, not the fence-post-slender Democrat who climbs mountains, that Colorado believed would provide a new, more independent voice.Early Wednesday morning, Gov. John W. Hickenlooper edged slightly ahead of his Republican challenger, Bob Beauprez, as the last several thousand votes from Democratic-friendly bastions like Denver and Boulder were counted. But the two men remained separated by less than a percentage point, and it was uncertain whether any winner could be declared or whether the race would head toward an automatic recount.The governors race has focused more on the states economy. A drilling boom, construction downtown and new waves of mountain-loving migrants have helped lower unemployment in Colorado to 4.7 percent.The race also hinged on whether Democratic-supported laws expanding background checks for firearms, limiting the size of ammunition magazines and expanding renewable-energy standards were turning away from Colorados older values, or simply extending them into a new era.At times, both parties treated the election as a battle for the soul of a Western bellwether.Urban growth and the rapidly swelling number of Hispanic residents have helped hand control of the governors mansion and state legislature to Democrats in recent years, and many liberals had hoped that victories this year could help give Colorado new stature as a reliably Democratic foothold in the Mountain West. After years of defeats in statewide races and self-inflicted wounds, Republicans here were desperate for a win demonstrating that  despite the states embrace of legal marijuana, civil unions for same-sex couples and new gun restrictions  Colorado was still a moderate place that would punish politicians who lurched too far leftward.Conservatives, in particular, cast the races for senator and governor as battles between the rural values of ranchers and farmers and the urban leanings of a growing number of constituents living in the suburbs. At a campaign stop earlier this summer, Mr. Beauprez told a group of civic officials from the northeastern corner of the state, Rural Colorado, I think, probably determines the outcome of this election.",2014-11-05,marijuana

Rick Scotts narrow re-election in one of the nations most expensive races means that state government remains firmly in Republican hands. As the nation learned in 2000, that control can influence the outcome of a presidential election.In national contests, Florida is the purplest of states: It has been carried by the winner in five straight presidential races, and it was the most closely contested state in 2000 and 2012. But at the state level, Republicans have had the upper hand for years, and they won every statewide race this year and kept control of the Legislature.Mr. Scotts victory quashed what would have been a remarkable comeback for his opponent, former Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican-turned-Democrat. In exit polls, a strong majority of voters said Mr. Crists party switch was motivated more by political opportunism than real beliefs.Four years ago, Mr. Scott made his first run for public office as a fiscally conservative technocrat, with experience as a venture capitalist and an executive of a hospital chain, and in a boon year for Republicans, he eked out a narrow win.But then he steered farther to the right than many Floridians expected. In his first year, Mr. Scott carried out budget cuts, killed a high-speed rail project and signed a law  later struck down in court  requiring drug testing of welfare applicants. He had not campaigned on social issues, but he signed anti-abortion bills, including one requiring that a woman have an ultrasound before the procedure.An opponent of the Affordable Care Act, he at first rejected its offer of Medicaid expansion, turning down billions of dollars in federal aid, and then took steps making it harder to get low-cost insurance under the law. He reversed his position on Medicaid expansion but did not push it through the Legislature, where it died.His approval ratings fell below 30 percent at onetime, and Mr. Scott was being called the nations most unpopular governor. But with a shift to the center and the help of a strengthening economy, his standing improved. He pulled even with Mr. Crist in polls, with a barrage of ads calling him a flip-flopper on issues like abortion and same-sex marriage.Polls showed that in the final weeks, when the race was too close to call, many voters were unhappy with their choices and unsure of their allegiances.Each party knocked off one incumbent, further reinforcing Floridas status as an unpredictable swing state.A Republican, Carlos Curbelo, defeated Representative Joe Garcia, a Democrat, in the 26th District, at the southern tip of the state. In a district carried by Mitt Romney, Mr. Garcia was expected to have trouble defending a seat he first won two years ago against a damaged Republican incumbent.But in the Second District, in the panhandle, Gwen Graham, daughter of the former Florida governor and senator Bob Graham, unseated Representative Steve Southerland, a two-term Republican.In August, a state judge ruled that the congressional districts drawn by the Legislature were improperly gerrymandered to benefit Republicans, but that it was too late to change them for this years election.A large majority of voters supported a measure that would have made Florida the first Southern state to legalize marijuana for medical use. But it was not enough: The measure fell short of the 60 percent needed to amend the state Constitution.Voters easily approved another constitutional amendment to significantly increase the states purchase of land to preserve water resources and wildlife habitat.",2014-11-05,marijuana

Cory Gardners unseating of Mark Udall, a Democrat, helps push Colorado back into the Republican fold.But an exit poll conducted by Edison Research revealed an interesting twist: Many of Mr. Gardners Republican supporters expressed relatively liberal tendencies (half supported a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, for example) but said that the party that controlled the Senate was an important factor when they considered their vote.Rather than showing an overwhelming endorsement of the candidate, the poll suggested that voters chose to place the Republican Partys national needs first.This race also came down to the wire, but in the end the incumbent, John Hickenlooper, turned back a challenge by Bob Beauprez. Mr. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, has presided over what many see as Colorados shift to the left, including the legalization of marijuana for recreational use and a package of new gun restrictions. These policies have angered Republican residents, and even turned off some Democrats. Mr. Hickenloopers narrow win reveals that voters are still divided over the direction of the state.The language in the states so-called personhood amendment proved too vague for voters to pass. The measure would have accorded personhood to fetuses under the state criminal code, a designation that proponents said would help women whose pregnancies were ended during violent encounters. But opponents said they feared it would ban all abortions in the state. The proposals failure is not a huge surprise  Coloradans have shot down similar efforts in previous years.",2014-11-05,marijuana

But voters surveyed after casting their ballots, both at the polls on Tuesday and by phone for those who voted early, signaled deep dismay with both parties and were at least as negative about Republican congressional leaders as about President Obama.Mr. Obama was at the center of the campaign debate, if not on the ballot, as Republicans sought to exploit his unpopularity by tying Democratic candidates to him, especially in the fight for control of the Senate. A majority of voters said they disapproved of how the president was doing his job, and about eight in 10 of those who disapproved supported Republicans.As bleak as Democrats prospects were, the party succeeded to some degree in its strategy of focusing on female voters, especially minorities and single women, by attacking Republicans for their legislative actions to limit access to abortion and birth control.Democrats won a majority of women, a traditionally supportive group but one that sided with Republicans by a single percentage point in 2010, the previous midterm election year. That setback four years ago was a big factor in enabling Republicans to win control of the House and of many state legislatures and governorships.On Tuesday, single women supported Democrats over Republicans by more than 20 points. In Senate battlegrounds like Colorado, Georgia, Iowa and North Carolina, Democratic candidates also won a majority of women. But it was not enough to avert losses, given the overwhelming support male voters provided for the Republicans.Yet political independents  a group that six years ago helped propel Mr. Obama to the presidency  once again supported Republicans, though by a smaller margin than in 2010. Democrats also failed again in other ways to rebuild Mr. Obamas broad coalition of 2008, losing among middle-aged voters, suburbanites and Catholics, though not as badly as in 2010.Democrats did hold onto groups that form their base: union households, gays, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, younger voters, lower-income Americans, political moderates, Northeasterners, city dwellers, Jewish voters and both those without high school educations and those with graduate degrees.The surveys of voters showed that Republicans also won their core supporters: whites, men, older voters, Southerners, white Protestants, veterans, higher-income people, weekly churchgoers, white evangelical Christians and rural residents. Edison Research conducted the surveys for a consortium of news media organizations.As was true in polls throughout the year, the economy was the top issue on most voters minds. Nearly half selected this issue as their top concern  nearly double the number that picked health care, the next most pressing issue. Fewer than one in five voters named foreign policy or immigration as their primary concern.Despite a range of good economic news of late, including a declining unemployment rate, many voters are not believers.More than three-quarters said they were worried about where the economy is headed in the next year; a majority of those supported Republicans. Voters split evenly on whether the economy is getting better, worsening or staying the same; those who see it getting better backed Democrats by a three-to-one margin while those who foresee conditions getting worse similarly supported Republicans.But perhaps the most telling sign of Americans downbeat state of mind was the measure of their confidence  or lack of it  in the American dream: About half the voters said they expect that the next generation will not enjoy a better life than Americans today. That was a significant increase from 2010. The pessimistic voters backed Republicans two to one, while the half of Americans who believe the next generation will enjoy the same or better lives voted by a similar margin for Democrats.Over all, more than half of voters expressed negative feelings toward both the Democratic and Republican parties. In a cautionary note for Republicans about reading too much into their victories, one-quarter of the voters who supported the partys candidates did so despite harboring bad feelings about the party. Among voters who backed Democrats, a significantly smaller share was negative toward that party.Voters stances on a number of issues emphasized the stark differences between Democrats and Republicans, and suggested why it has been years since many Americans claimed they saw no difference between the parties.Voters closely split on whether same-sex marriage or marijuana should be legal, for example, with those in favor overwhelmingly supporting Democrats and those opposed supporting Republicans by similar margins.On several issues, majorities expressed views in sync with Democrats. A slim majority said abortion should remain legal; supporters favored Democrats and opponents Republicans. A larger majority agreed that climate change is a serious problem, and those who did overwhelmingly supported Democrats, while those who disagreed backed Republicans. And most voters favored allowing immigrants here illegally to have a chance to seek legal status  a position at odds with Republican opposition that hardened in the course of the years campaigns.Voters remain evenly divided over Mr. Obamas signature Affordable Care Act, which Republicans sought for a third election cycle to make an albatross around Democrats necks. On that issue, too, voters who support the law or say it should have gone farther overwhelmingly went for Democrats while opponents chose Republicans.",2014-11-05,marijuana

But these are often misleading. In some states, Republican-leaning regions report their votes first, making Republican candidates seem ahead when theyre not (as often happens in Virginia). In other states, Democratic-leaning areas report first.The best election analysts  on television and elsewhere  acknowledge these patterns. Our goal tonight is to give you a tool to quantify the patterns. In about a dozen of the closest Senate races, we will publish a geographically adjusted estimate of the vote count. These estimates will inevitably involve some uncertainty, as Amanda Cox and Nate Cohn note in their guide to the estimates. But we think they will be more meaningful than raw-vote totals. Once the page with the estimates goes live, later Tuesday, well link to it from The Upshots home page.

Bratton continue to draw criticism over the resignation of Philip Banks III.","Not long after Philip Banks III, the New York Police Departments highest-ranking uniformed officer, abruptly resigned on Friday, Mayor Bill de Blasio phoned several black elected officials to convey his disappointment.By then, Mr. Banks, who is African-American, was already telling people that he resigned because he believed the police commissioner, William J. Bratton, was trying to sideline him. Although he was scheduled to begin a new civilian job that was technically the second-highest-ranking slot on the force, Mr. Banks believed it would distance him from the day-to-day running of the department and confine him to a ceremonial function.In his phone calls, Mr. de Blasio shared that he had long harbored big ambitions for Mr. Banks, thinking of him as someone who might someday succeed Mr. Bratton, the officials recounted.But once Mr. Banks indicated he would resign, he was allowed to leave quickly. Mr. Bratton told reporters on Monday that he had not tried to dissuade Mr. Banks of his intent to leave. (At the same news conference, Mr. Bratton dismissed one question about Mr. Banks, saying, The chief is gone.)Mr. Brattons comments followed an unusual news conference on Sunday, when he and the mayor made a show of unity, trying to disprove reports that City Hall  and in particular Mr. de Blasios wife, Chirlane McCray  was angry that Mr. Bratton had managed to drive out Mr. Banks.Their efforts seemed to have little effect. On Monday, a number of black elected officials  many of whom consider themselves allies of the mayor  suggested that City Hall should exert greater control over the Police Departments leadership.When the top black and brown people resign from the N.Y.P.D., were worried that the atmosphere there is not yet ripe for the change we were hoping to see, said Councilman Jumaane D. Williams of Brooklyn, a Democrat and a vocal critic of the polices stop-and-frisk practices under the Michael R. Bloomberg administration.While taking care to avoid criticizing the mayor explicitly, Council members seemed to express frustration with the pace of police reform on his watch.Several members noted that they were unhappy that the number of arrests for marijuana possession, which overwhelmingly involve black and Latino males and are often the result of unjustified stops and searches, were not declining more rapidly under the new administration.Council members also said they were worried about an overzealous application of the broken windows theory, which holds that curtailing low-level offenses can help root out more serious crime.In month No. 11, we have not seen the changes that we believe should be happening at this time, said Councilwoman Vanessa L. Gibson of the Bronx, a Democrat and the chairwoman of the Councils public safety committee.The widespread support for Mr. Banks was striking, given his ascent to chief of department under Raymond W. Kelly, Mr. Brattons predecessor. Some of Mr. Kellys policing strategies came to be criticized, especially in minority communities, and that public outrage helped to propel Mr. de Blasio into office.Yet Mr. Banks was often the point of contact for black elected officials. Many lawmakers credited him with playing a key role in quelling potentially combustible episodes, like the 2012 police shooting of an unarmed woman who ran a series of red lights in a stolen car and crashed into a minivan, or the death in July of Eric Garner, a Staten Island man whom the police placed in a chokehold while trying to arrest him for the sale of untaxed cigarettes.Its not clear to me that the administration realizes the void left by Chief Banks, Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat, said. His departure is another blow to the credibility of the Police Department, at least as it relates to communities of color.",2014-11-04,marijuana

This year, search volumes are roughly at the same level as four years ago.","Two years ago, a graduate student in economics named Seth Stephens-Davidowitz discovered that Google searches including the word vote or voting could help predict turnout. In places where searches for those terms were more common, turnout was higher, even after controlling for other factors, like voter-registration rates and early-vote volume.You can understand why this might be true. In the days leading up to an election, people planning to vote may look up where their polling place is and what hours it will be open. If they are so-called marginal voters  people who vote in some elections and not others  they would have all the more reason to need such information.Heading into this years election, the search data offers another reason to be skeptical that voter turnout will surge this year  and another reason to believe the Republicans are favored to win Senate control. Nationwide, according to Googles data, voting-related searches are at roughly the same level as they were before the last midterm election, in 2010, when Republicans fared very well. Marginal voters  such as younger and nonwhite ones  lean Democratic, which is why high turnout usually helps Democrats.In several of the battleground Senate states, voting-related searches are actually down. In Kansas, theyre about 30 percent lower than four years ago, even though the states elections four years ago were not nearly as closely fought as this years. Similarly, volume in Iowa is down 11 percent compared with 2010. In Colorado, which did have a close Senate election four years ago, search volume is down 21 percent.The decline in Oregon was especially sharp: 55 percent. While the Democrat there appears to have a comfortable lead in the polls, the state is also voting on two high-profile initiatives, one on marijuana legalization and one on a requirement to label genetically modified foods. Both may be less likely to pass if turnout is low.The data offers better news for Democrats in the South and Alaska. In Louisiana, Alaska, Arkansas and North Carolina, search volume is up at least 15 percent.(Mr. Stephens-Davidowitz, since receiving his doctorate in economics from Harvard, has joined Google as a researcher and also writes occasionally for The New York Times opinion pages.)No data is perfectly predictive, of course. I can imagine a situation in which Democratic get-out-the-vote efforts in Colorado and Iowa include such detailed information about where to vote that people dont need to look up their polling place online. Before we put too much stock in the search data, well want to see whether it predicts turnout over multiple elections.But its nonetheless intriguing. At the same time that response rates to traditional telephone polls are plummeting, we are gaining access to new kinds of data  from online polls, prediction markets and search volume, among other sources. The best election analysts will keep an open mind to all of it, new and old.",2014-11-04,marijuana

But in the case of the District of Columbia, Congress can overrule the voters choice, and Representative Andy Harris, a Republican from Maryland, has signaled his intention to push Congress to do so.Legalization in Colorado has produced mixed results since January. Crime in the state has continued to fall. But there have been some concerns regarding marijuana edibles, which the state public health department recently recommended prohibiting.

John Leland and Mosi Secret, reporters for Metro, wrote an article on Sunday about the industry after attending the East Coast Cannabis Business Expo, Educational Conference and Regulatory Summit, their first glimpse of the people who are eager to get involved in what will become a multimillion-dollar business. Here, John describes the experience. So two reporters walk into a marijuana convention, and the first one says  well, never mind. My collaboration with Mosi Secret on last Sundays Metropolitan cover story about the  coming legal cannabis business in New York began when we crossed paths at a Midtown trade expo where booths promoted everything from medical malpractice insurance to devices for extracting the plants active ingredients. There were Wall Street types, activists from the legalization movement, lots of journalists and everything in between. (One of my favorites was a guy selling a deodorizer to prevent the cash in a marijuana dispensary from smelling like marijuana.)Mosi writes about sin. That is his beat.  I write about, for lack of a better term, sinners, in the sense that none of us is without blemish, and to write about daily life in New York is to engage our imperfect selves. The marijuana business, which New York legalized for medical purposes in July, had something for both of us. It was a rare opportunity to examine a business before it starts. The law gives the state health department 18 months to draft regulations and license up to five companies to grow and dispense the drug. Until then, no one can legally cultivate the first seed (or clone or DNA sequence). So the players are all jockeying for position, but theres no game. Over the next two years they will invent the business. But right now theyre in freeze-frame. Which makes this a fascinating time to talk to them, before reality sets in and the business settles into norms. And it is a profitable time to be a consultant, lobbyist, lawyer or trade show organizers. In what is still a zero million dollar business, those people are the ones making money.Ive reported occasionally about marijuana for decades. (I also wrote about music for High Times in the 1980s). Sources have long been hesitant to discuss their activities for fear of the police; now, as private equity firms are forming to invest in cannabis businesses, they are hesitant to talk for fear of the Securities and Exchange Commission. A wrinkle touched upon in the story but not fully examined: while the medical marijuana business in New York is in neutral, over-the-counter products claiming to contain CBD, or cannabidiol, an active ingredient in cannabis, are proliferating. The products, which are largely unregulated, can sell for hundreds of dollars for a few ounces and are directed at people with very serious illnesses, including immune deficiencies. Many begin in China, which has a history of circulating contaminated products.   Its a story for another day. In the meantime, caveat emptor. ",2014-11-03,marijuana

Among them:AbortionBallot initiative aimed at ending or severely curtailing womens access to safe and legal abortion care will be contributing to the election night drama in three states: Colorado, North Dakota and Tennessee.Colorados Amendment 67 is a repackaged but unimproved version of the absurd and unconstitutional personhood proposals that voters in the state overwhelming rejected in 2008 and 2010. Like the earlier iterations, it would confer on fertilized eggs legal rights and protections that apply to living individuals, making abortion criminal even in cases of rape or incest or to protect a womans health. It is opposed by both the Democratic and Republican candidates in Colorados hard-fought Senate race. Another personhood measure, North Dakotas Constitution Measure 1, stands a better chance of success. It would protect the inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development.The Tennessee initiative backed by that states Republican governor, Bill Haslam, and many members of the Republican-dominated state government, also stands a decent chance. It states that nothing in the Tennessee Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion  potentially opening the floodgates for even more harsh abortion restrictions than the state already has.Time and time again when voters have understood whats at stake they have overwhelmingly rejected these kinds of measures, even in conservative states like Mississippi and South Dakota, noted Jennifer Dalven, the director of the A.C.L.Us Reproductive Freedom Project. The results this round, she said, will turn on getting out the word that the intent is the same:  to make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion.  Dorothy SamuelsMarijuanaThe lonely experiment in legalized recreational marijuana, so far waged by only two states, Colorado and Washington, may get bigger.Residents of Alaska and Oregon will vote on whether to legalize recreational marijuana, and residents of Washington, D.C. will vote on whether to repeal criminal and civil penalties for personal possession and allow limited, private cultivation. Polling in Alaska is all over the place, the Oregon race is too close to call, and it looks like D.C. will go ahead and end prohibition.The editorial board supports legalization generally and these ballot measures in particular. Decades of locking people up for using a drug less harmful than alcohol has done little or nothing to curtail consumption, while ruining the lives of those unlucky enough to get arrested. Juliet LapidosThe Minimum WagePolls suggest that voters in four red states  Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota  are expected to approve binding ballot measures that would raise the minimum wage in their states above the federal level of $7.25 an hour. Those votes should send a strong signal to Republicans who have bitterly opposed a Democratic proposal in Washington to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour by 2016.None of the measures would raise the minimum to the level advocated by Democrats in Congress, which, the editorial board has argued, is in itself not high enough relative to labor productivity and inflation. But these ballot initiatives are important nonetheless because they provide real-word evidence that a higher minimum wage has broad bipartisan support among voters.If Republicans do take control of the Senate as most political pundits are predicting, the party would be smart to renege on the promise Senator Mitch McConnell, who hopes to become majority leader, made earlier this year to Republican donors that he would not schedule a vote on raising the minimum wage.

The laws around it are in flux. As of now, marijuana for medical usage is legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia; two of those states, Colorado and Washington, have legalized recreational use as well (for people 21 and over). The stuff itself, usually green, leafy and intended for smoking, is increasingly available in a form that I have also written about before: It may be a drug, but it can look like candy.  So how, I asked, do we talk about the maybe-legal-for-some-people-in-some-contexts-but-not-for-you drug that can now be munched, smoked or sipped? As Julie Scelfo described in A Familys Truth About Marijuana Depends on the Family, parents are finding different answers to this question, up to and including smoking with teenagers and helping teens 18 and over to secure marijuana legally with medical marijuana cards. A parent who is or has been a user of marijuana may see it differently than a parent who has not. Just as some parents have always preferred to take a more lenient stance on alcohol use, or even the law, than others, some parents will be similarly lenient regarding marijuana.But there remain excellent reasons for taking the classic 80s Just-Say-No approach to marijuana use in teenagers. While the legalization of marijuana for adults or for medical use in some states contributes to a perception that it is safe for all, its effects on developing brains are less clear. Recent research has found a correlation between regular marijuana use at younger ages and impaired neural connectivity, executive function and memory, and poor grades and school performance, although the question of causation is particularly murky in this area: Teens who are already struggling with brain function or school performance may be more likely to embrace marijuana use. Colorados Dont Be a Lab Rat campaign tackles the lack of clarity head on, asking Whos going to risk their brains to find out once and for all what marijuana really does?Beyond the possible neural changes, marijuana use can have big consequences in a teens life. Its still illegal in every state for teenagers to use marijuana. Many high school sports and organized activities take a strict no-tolerance view of marijuana (and alcohol). Students who even attend a party where the drug is used may find themselves off the team or out of the band. (College sports teams, including those at the University of Colorado Boulder, often take a similar approach.)If your teenager isnt a joiner, he may be a traveler. A marijuana conviction, even a minor one, can mean no visa to countries from Canada to China. Marijuana use, even without a conviction, can end job prospects with the military, police and fire departments, or the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and disqualify a student from government internships. Many jobs and even colleges and graduate schools take past drug use (or evidence of it through, perhaps, social media) seriously. Your teenager (or any proponent of legalization) can argue that those limits are shortsighted and should change, but for now, those are the facts. The choice to use marijuana now can limit later life choices.This conversation is also a different one for parents of minority children. Statistically, white teenagers can hope that police and other authorities will look the other way when it comes to marijuana use; black teenagers, in particular, often cannot. Blacks are routinely singled out for marijuana arrests. Minorities are more likely to suffer any possible consequences for its use, and it use can become a pretext for more and harsher police scrutiny of a teen.All that said, Childrens Hospital Colorado reminds parents to have conversations, not lectures. Children make choices all the time that wouldnt be our choices for them, and families regroup, and move forward. Listen to your childs perspective; make sure youre having an ongoing conversation around marijuana, ask questions, and above all, make sure your child knows that if he feels unsafe at any moment, he can call. As the laws around marijuana use change, and with them the ways we consider drug use in the larger culture, that conversation with teenagers will change as well. Parents will also find themselves talking about the ways different families approach marijuana use (you might not share a pipe with your son; his best friends father may feel differently). Well face new conversations with each other about whats appropriate. Few of us would ask a fellow parent not to drink a beer in the presence of our children; we may feel differently about that pipe, and differently still about a serving of THC-laced chocolate, medical or recreational. Like the conversations were having with our kids, this one will continue. What do you say to your teens about marijuana, about your own history with marijuana, or about their own potential use?

As long as Ive been an adult Ive known people who smoke marijuana, and they certainly dont fit the stereotype of skater dude or hippie holdover.Instead they have included the director of a medical charity, an investment banker, the mother of a severely disabled child, an athletic trainer, a salesman, a retiree, a small business owner, a chef and no small number of waiters, athletes and tech professionals.All of these people, who live all over the country, broke the law when they got high, but are otherwise law-abiding citizens. They hold steady jobs. They pay taxes. Some are Republicans. Most are parents. And even if you dont realize it, you know them, or someone just like them, too.Seeing these folks use the drug occasionally while contributing positively to their families and society, shaped my belief that  marijuana should be legal for adults and taxed and regulated in a manner similar to other intoxicants like tobacco and alcohol. But over dinner earlier this year, a friend who I respect very much argued vehemently that using marijuana was a bad thing, could be a gateway drug to more serious substances and should remain illegal and off-limits. This wasnt just a casual opinion: My friend is a clinical director in emergency psychiatry at one of the nations largest psychiatric emergency rooms, and has for more than a decade worked on the front lines where drug abuse intersects with crime and misfortune.And yet, despite the negative effects of the drug for some, another psychiatrist who works with adults and adolescents in Brooklyn, told me that many of her patients expressed the wish that they could treat their anxiety with marijuana because it thoroughly relieves all their symptoms and has fewer side effects than the legal, prescription alternatives.So what is the right thing to believe  and to teach my children  here? And does it matter that my friend who argued so vehemently against marijuana did so after ordering a second sidecar cocktail? And what if we live in a state where marijuana is illegal, but have family members who live where recreational use is approved? In Education Life, I explored how parents are grappling with these issues and took a close-up look at five different parenting approaches. Across the country, parents have wildly divergent ideas about what to teach their children, with some insisting they Just Say No and others offering to roll joints and make nachos. And as hard is it is to teach children about alcohol, despite uniform laws across the country, parents have an even tougher time with marijuana, given such disparate messages from different states, and from state and federal authorities. But in the stories of these five families, we see that marijuana is but one issue among many that parents are concerned about, from binge drinking to sexual assault to prescription drug abuse, and that Americas drug landscape is far too complex today to rely on simplistic aphorisms. Being more casual or accepting of marijuana use is also a privilege of being white and middle-upper class: While illegal use of marijuana is rarely enforced among whites, blacks are routinely singled out for marijuana arrests, forcing black families to have entirely different conversations with their children.Through my reporting and through personal experience, I came to see  the truth about marijuana is that, like most things, there is no one truth. It can be good and it can be bad, and which depends on how and when it is used, how often, and by whom. In a family with a history of drug abuse, marijuana can be deadly. In a family with severe anxiety, it can be a lifesaver. So what should you say to your children? That depends on you, your values, and, of course, your child.

Now, hes seeking to avoid trouble.","Days after James Boyds mother died of a heroin overdose, he attended her wake in handcuffs. He was 17 and in the midst of a 90-day jail sentence for marijuana possession.Mr. Boyd began his history of substance abuse at an early age: As a boy, he and his friends routinely stole cases of wine from neighborhood street peddlers.I was 13 years old, when I started using, said Mr. Boyd, 61. I just blocked everything by drinking and smoking. I killed the pain.The death of his mother catalyzed Mr. Boyds troubled adulthood, which included assault and drug arrests, several prison stints and, eventually, a dependence on an even harder drug: crack cocaine. More than 35 years of his life were sullied by crack addiction, and, all told, he spent 18 years behind bars. Over time, Mr. Boyd became estranged from many of his family members, including his six children.Every year, I could see myself doing drugs or drinking, he said. And this one year, I said: Im going to stop. This one year, Im going to try. I cant keep picking it back up.In March 2010, Mr. Boyd entered a drug rehabilitation program. He has been clean ever since, he says. I did it, and it felt great, he said. I started getting everything back, my sense of smell, taste.He receives treatment for depression at Service Program for Older People, a mental health treatment program, and is taking classes four nights a week at Columbia University in order to earn his high school equivalency diploma by next year.Im learning tools, Mr. Boyd said, and Im learning people.In April 2014, he left Valley Lodge, a shelter for older adults, where he had been living for a year, and moved into a subsidized studio apartment in Harlem. He had little money and no furniture. His monthly income consists of $267 in Social Security benefits, $561 in Social Security disability insurance and $65 in food stamps.With the help of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, a grant of $1,500 was used to furnish the apartment with a couch, lamps and tables, transforming it into not just a more comfortable home but also a suitable place for visitors. When his family is ready to visit, Mr. Boyd said, his new home will be ready too.During the last year, Mr. Boyd has been dusting off many of his neglected relationships, mending the divide with family members and forging bonds with his grandchildren.I dont ask them for anything, he said of his relatives. Just to show me some love, let me know when the barbecue is, because before I would never know.Mr. Boyd said he has also been embraced by parishioners at his church, who have formed a church family that he describes as being as crucial to his sobriety as his own flesh and blood. Three times a week, he attends a Narcotics Anonymous meeting.While he tries to surround himself with noble company, his past experiences have given ingress to paranoia, a constant suspicion that anyone he encounters could be angling to sell him drugs or otherwise seeking to exploit him.People are my biggest fear, Mr. Boyd said. Ive been out there. I know what its like. There are people around you trying to get into your circle, trying to be manipulative. Sometimes its hard for me to do what I have to go do, because somebody is in my way, in my path.And so Mr. Boyd avoids treading where temptation might seize him.Im petrified of the Bronx, he said of the borough where he so often purchased drugs and got high in the past.Of his addictive tendencies, he added: Its still in me. I know its still in me. So I stay away from it.Mr. Boyd said that ruminating on his old habits and what they have cost him tends to get him down. To keep the guilt and the resultant urges at bay, he busies himself with productive tasks, his studies, support group meetings and daily prayer.For me, dwelling gets me into a lot of trouble, he said. So I try not to dwell. I try to be positive. I try to be humble. Thats how Im going to stay clean.",2014-11-03,marijuana

Then his mother boldly moved the family to a leafy suburb.","EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.   Until he was 14, Damontre Moore lived most of his life in a hardscrabble, rough-edged Dallas neighborhood. Then his mother boldly moved the family to a leafy suburb 35 miles to the northeast.It was completely my moms idea, and I hated it, Moore, a second-year Giants defensive end and prospective star, said Friday. I went from a predominantly black area to a community that was predominantly Caucasian. I went from a place where fighting in school was almost an everyday thing to a place where getting in a fight got you suspended and sent to an alternative school.I felt so out of place, and I told my mom over and over I didnt want to be out there.Moores mother, Detra Johnson, who was 32 at the time, had been determined since Moores birth to get her son out of the neighborhood where she and Moores father had been raised.I wanted him to be well-rounded; I wanted him to go to school and play sports with everybody, not just black people, Johnson said. The country, the business world and college campuses are a mix of people, and I wanted him to fit in wherever he went.For Moore, the adjustment to a new city and school, Rowlett High, was not always easy.Lots of different rules and new things to learn, Moore said. Total culture shock.His sports career would also have to wait. As a 6-foot-4 freshman, he was a big, talented athlete, but he did not play a varsity football game until he was a junior, and then he was not a starter.It has been eight years since Moore and his mother left Dallas.Last week at Rowlett High, where Moore is known as Tre, the teachers were circulating a web link to the N.F.L.s Pro Bowl voting because Moore is on the ballot as a special-teams player.Everybody here loves Tre, Rowletts assistant principal, Shae Creel, said. He was a kid who got people to smile. A good, fun-loving kid, and were very proud of him.On Friday, Moore sat outside the Giants locker room absorbing what had been a whirlwind week. It began at a news conference on Monday, with the Giants general manager, Jerry Reese, publicly lobbying the coaches to get Moore on the field more often.Good things seem to happen when hes out there, Reese said.Not surprisingly, in subsequent days Giants coaches indicated that Moore would most likely have a significant role in Monday nights game against Indianapolis.But the reflective, if loquacious, Moore was still ruminating about his mothers determined decision making when he was a young teenager.She worked as a medical assistant and had a second job taking care of at-home patients so I could afford what I needed at the time, Moore said. When I complained about the move, she told me I would thank her later. And after a year or so, I told her that she was right and I appreciated everything she did.There were so many new opportunities. The move opened up my eyes to all the places I could go. It wasnt the only thing, but it was a big step.It was one of several noteworthy steps for a promising N.F.L. player who turned 22 less than two months ago.Moore never lived with both his parents. They were never together, but they were always on the same page when it came to doing whats best for me, Moore said. I spent weekends with my dad and lived with him for longer periods sometimes. I think my mom wanted to make sure I learned things from him, too. And he opened up my eyes to the arts and music.In the Giants locker room, or in the weight room, Moore is often found singing or dancing; he can also be counted on for a prank or two.My dad made me join a choir because he knew I wanted to sing in public but wasnt going to do it on my own, Moore said of his father, Damon Moore. He encouraged me to develop my creative side and introduced me to origami. I spent a lot of enjoyable hours doing that. There were many little lessons.After games, we didnt have the money to go out to dinner like the other kids. Some of them offered to pay for my dinner, and my dad was the one that taught me to accept their offer once and thats it. He said: Dont take handouts. Work hard so you can pay your own way.Eventually Moore earned a starting job at Rowlett, but he was recruited by college teams almost by accident. A Texas A&M; coach was watching video of Rowlett wide receiver Marquise Goodwin, who is now with the Buffalo Bills.All of a sudden, the coach saw Tre chase down someone from sideline to sideline, Creel, the assistant principal, said. He said, I want to know about that tall kid who can run like that.At Texas A&M;, Moore quickly became a standout, playing with the future N.F.L. star Von Miller, whose parents, Gloria and Von Sr., became surrogates while he was on the A&M; campus.We told Damontres mom, Dont worry about him being away from home  youve got another set of eyes down here, Von Miller Sr. said.Moore was arrested and accused of marijuana possession the summer before his sophomore season.I felt terrible for making such a mistake, Moore said. I felt bad having to tell my coaches, but I was terrified to tell my mom.Detra Johnson had been strict in raising her son, forbidding him, for example, to wear tattoos or an earring.I promised my mom that I would learn from what I did wrong and become the mature person she wanted me to be, Moore said.Johnson said: The thing about Damontre is that he was always the youngest in his group  he graduated from high school at 17, left college at 20  but he was also usually the biggest in his group, and because of that people treated him like he was the oldest. But he was still just a kid.There have been no significant or embarrassing off-the-field episodes since.Damontre was a smart, good kid, Von Miller Sr. said. He just needed better judgment, some advice and time to grow.After three productive college seasons, and 26.5 sacks, Moore decided to turn professional. He was at first considered a top-five pick in the 2013 N.F.L. draft, but at the combine he ran one of the slowest times for a defensive end in the 40-yard dash, surprising for a player who had shown plenty of speed at Texas A&M.; In the bench-press test he again lagged far behind the top prospects.Moore became the poster boy for talented players who squandered their opportunities by not staying in shape for the combine. Alarm bells sounded around the N.F.L., and Moore dropped precipitously in the draft rankings.Again, just maturity, Miller said. He didnt take care of business like he was supposed to do. Another life lesson.Moore was at the Millers house on the first days of the draft, as the first and second rounds went by without his name being called.I turned off the TV and left the room crying, Moore said. I was so mad I couldnt see.The Giants took him in the third round, the 81st overall pick.My mom told me that God does everything for a reason, Moore said. I just had to prove myself again.Moore got a tattoo over his right rib cage: a blue poker chip with an 81 inside it.It means that I went 81st but Im really a blue-chip prospect, Moore said. I got it in the most painful place to get a tattoo because I wanted it to be a painful reminder.Moores journey as a Giant has not been all smooth sailing. In his rookie year, he flashed his pass rushing capabilities and blocked a punt. As Reese noted, he seemed to create a degree of havoc in the opposing teams backfield, but the Giants coaches said they could not count on Moore to consistently stick to his run-stopping assignments.He also had a shoulder injury that limited his playing time except on special teams, where he continued to excel.Moore has played more this season, but he is still a reserve. That could change this week. With the Giants defensive line depleted by injuries, Moores chance to shine could well be against the pass-happy Colts.Hes going to be in the playing rotation, Coach Tom Coughlin said. We all want to see what he can do with the opportunity.Moore said it had been difficult to remain patient.But Ive learned that things arent always what they seem and sometimes you have to wait to see whats good for you, he said. I dont mind. When I get out there and do what I can do, the surprise will be even greater. I like when Im surprised by life.Moores mother, who moved her son against his wishes, sees the twists and turns of the last eight years as self-fulfilling.Hes exactly where hes supposed to be, Detra Johnson said. Its like other parts of life; doing the right thing isnt always easy. But hes with a nurturing organization, and they know what they have.Im not worried. Youll see; hell be O.K.",2014-11-03,marijuana

It was the weekly meet-up of the Cannabis and Hemp Association, which formed in May to get a jump on future business.The mood among the 18 people at the table was one of excitement. Oleg Maryasis, 30, a former financial adviser, said he had just met with a group of investors who were eager to sink tens of millions of dollars into the New York cannabis trade.The groups organizer, Scott Giannotti, a bald, heavyset 35-year-old from Long Island whose rsum includes selling cellphones and rapping, and who now sells LED grow lights from China, questioned the meetings special guest, State Senator Diane J. Savino. Ms. Savino, a Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn and Staten Island, was a sponsor of the medical marijuana bill that New York passed last summer, 18 years after it was first proposed; her efforts led Elle magazine to name her one of its 13 most potent women in the pot industry now.Senator, Mr. Giannotti said, what can we do to help you out?Ms. Savino offered some cautionary words. The State Health Department, she said, had not yet written guidelines for the medical marijuana program, and the licenses available for companies keen to participate would be few and costly. And, she added, legalized recreational use, as proposed by State Senator Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat, was unlikely any time soon.Still, Ms. Savino called the legislation a turning point, for the state and the industry. We can probably take in a couple hundred million dollars a year, minimally, she said, referring to potential tax revenue. Youre going to have patients who are acclimated to medical marijuana, doctors who recognize it, communities who realize that if they have a dispensary its not the end of the world. Then youre going to have more demand. In a state this size, the potential is huge.When Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed the Compassionate Care Act in July, it gave the Health Department 18 months to come up with regulations and choose up to five companies to grow and dispense medical marijuana.Now, for the states would-be growers, private equity investors, labor unions, lawyers, lobbyists, consultants, branding firms, suits, stoners and hucksters, the rush is on.This is the moment when old-guard legalizers meet a new breed of capitalist.In October, 900 people flocked to a hotel in Midtown Manhattan for a $900-a-head, three-day East Coast Cannabis Business Expo, Educational Conference and Regulatory Summit, the first of its kind in New York. The events organizers were two veterans of the tanning salon business; the crowd ranged from venture capitalists to chocolatiers to people currently growing illegally, with a smattering of doctors and representatives of at least one nursing home conglomerate. There were vendors of supply-chain tracking software, security services and malpractice insurance, as well as a manufacturer of precision-grade scales from the diamond district. Not a single bong in the house.This is sexy, this is drugs, one speaker, Adam Bierman, a managing partner of MedMen, a California-based consulting company, told a crowded conference room. This is something theres already demand for. This is selling pot.Under New Yorks law, licensed companies will grow and sell their own product, from seed to sale. Doctors can recommend, but not prescribe, it to treat a limited set of conditions, including cancer, multiple sclerosis and AIDS. Though federal law still prohibits the sale and possession of marijuana, the Justice Department advised its prosecutors in 2013 that if state laws to legalize the substance properly limited its spread, and if companies complied with state laws, they should not be prosecuted.Because banks and credit-card companies are federally regulated, the purchase and sale of cannabis has so far been a cash business. New Yorks health commissioner will set the price of the drug, probably based on the street value.New Yorks law is among the most restrictive to be passed by the 23 states that have legalized marijuana use in some form. The 20 dispensaries set to open in a state of nearly 20 million people are likely to be high-volume centers, located away from schools or houses of worship, where patients or caregivers with state identification cards can get up to a months supply of non-smokable product.The emerging industry has drawn people from unlikely precincts. Patrick McCarthy, a lobbyist who spent the last three years pushing legalization for cannabis companies, was once an aide to Gov. George E. Pataki and the executive director of the New York Republican State Committee. Dean Petkanas, who plans to seek a state license, was a chief financial officer at Stratton Oakmont, the penny-stock boiler room operation depicted in The Wolf of Wall Street; Mr. Petkanas now runs a phyto-medical company called KannaLife Sciences that hopes to get F.D.A. approval of a cannabis-based treatment for two types of brain encephalopathy. At the conference, he wore a pinstripe three-piece suit and spoke in torrents.I did a lot of pharmaceutical work on Wall Street when I was in boutique investment banking, he said, skipping over his time at Stratton Oakmont. I spent a lot of time in merchant banking. I really dug in hard. Shares of KannaLifes parent company, Medical Marijuana Inc., have fallen by more than half since earlier this year.The competition to acquire the five available licenses will be fierce and expensive. Application costs alone could run to several hundred thousand dollars; start-up costs could top $20 million. I would suggest that anyone who wants to be serious be prepared to spend at least a million dollars on an application, said Evan Nison, 24, a lobbyist and consultant for cannabis companies and a founder of the New York Cannabis Alliance, which advocates changing the states marijuana laws. Richard N. Gottfried, a Democratic state assemblyman from Manhattan who led the long fight to legalize medical marijuana, cited an unwritten formula of government regulation. When you make a statute very restrictive  and the governor did that in the last hours  you raise the stakes and create a need for more lawyers and consultants, he said.Out-of-state firms able to show they have run successful cannabis operations elsewhere will have an edge in the licensing process. But any hope for quick profits will be limited by the small number of conditions for which New York is allowing the drugs use.Still, the arrival of medical marijuana opens the door to a potentially huge market, said Derek Peterson, 40, a former senior vice president at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. Mr. Peterson now heads Terra Tech, a publicly traded company that already operates a five-acre hydroponic growing facility in New Jersey turning out basil, kale and other produce while awaiting the opening of more local dispensaries, which Gov. Chris Christie opposes.We dont love the way the New York policy works, but over time the legislation can change, Mr. Peterson said. Even if you cant make a significant profit now, you can invest in it for the future. He compared New York to Nevada, where Terra Tech had already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to apply for a license and hired Senator Harry Reids son Rory as a lobbyist. The cost of applying in New York, he said, might run in the high six figures. Cannabis industry cash has begun to flow into New York. Ms. Savino said her campaign donations from out-of-state growers were around $10,000 or $15,000  not much.The amount of money at stake has attracted investors from across the spectrum; from Wall Street to High Times magazine, the 40-year-old counterculture survivor that earlier this year announced that it planned to create a private equity High Times Growth Fund to invest in the cannabis businesses.Unions have also claimed a share. In New York, all licensees will be union shops, a result of two years of lobbying by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which has also been successful in other states. Cannabis is a rare growth sector for organized labor. We saw around the country that these jobs had the potential to be real middle-class jobs if the workers were organized, said Ed Draves, a lobbyist with Bolton St. Johns who led the push for the union. Here in New York, you saw the home health care industry develop, where a lot of the workers were health care workers who couldnt attain health care or pension benefits. We didnt want to see that as we developed this industry.For investors, the business strikes a familiar chord, with the potential for huge growth and high risk. There are a lot of parallels that I draw to what happened in the technology space in the late 90s and early 2000s, said Al Foreman, a former managing director of J.P. Morgans growth equity fund Highbridge Principal Strategies. Since leaving Wall Street last December, Mr. Foreman helped start a private equity group called Tuatara Capital that plans to invest in cannabis industries across the Americas. For lack of another term, Mr. Foreman said, its a new frontier.Tuatara has not yet started raising money, and Mr. Foreman declined to say how much it hopes to amass. But he said there was already interest among investors. And, he added, the nascent cannabis industry is ahead of where the technology sector was 20 years ago.Because people have been buying marijuana for years, he said, its a more easily identifiable consumer base than what you might have seen in the early days of the Internet, when people were still trying to figure out how to get paying customers. Were talking about an industry with real assets and markets where there is existing demand.Mr. Foreman noted that the cultural gap between Wall Street and the purveyors of products like Ghost Train Haze and Holy Grail Kush is not what it once was. Money changes everything. When I took a trip to Denver to walk the halls and the plants and the factories, you realize that these are not kids in the basement, he said. The stereotype is shattered by the level of professionalism. Some of these companies will grow into really large companies.High Times hopes to grow with them, said Michael Kennedy, its controlling owner. Mr. Kennedy, a criminal lawyer who at the magazines inception represented its founder in an investigation into smuggling charges, said High Times was close to launching its private equity fund with two partners  so close that he would not discuss previously disclosed details for fear of violating government rules against soliciting business ahead of a launch. An interview with Mr. Kennedy published by Bloomberg Businessweek in June cited a target of $300 million for the fund.On a recent day, Malcolm MacKinnon, the magazines silver-haired editor, presided over a staff of more than two dozen, with ages ranging from their 20s to their 60s, as they worked quietly on the February issue (the cover story: a showdown between cannabis sativa and cannabis indica). Professionally, Mr. MacKinnon uses the pseudonym Dan Skye, an artifact from less cannabis-friendly times, when he was raising children and coaching Little League.With its run-of-the-mill cubicles, the office felt more like the law firm that shares space with the magazine than the partying High Times suggested by its pages. Asked whether the staff smoked in the office, Mr. MacKinnon replied with a note of sarcasm, Gee, we wouldnt do that because its illegal.The private equity fund continues the magazines efforts to merge with the mainstream. These days, High Times organizes a sprawling trade show and smoke-off called the Cannabis Cup. Once limited to a single annual event in Amsterdam, where competitors vied to provide the most potent herb, the Cannabis Cup is now a domestic affair that draws tens of thousands of attendees to multiple locations. Versions were held in five cities in the United States this year, with speakers and vendors of everything a contemporary cannabis consumer might fancy, except, in some places, cannabis.High Times is now a legacy business, with four decades of experience in a field many are just entering, Mr. MacKinnon said.Everybody wants to talk to us now.That group may include people like Ari Hoffnung, 40, who hopes to get one of the New York licenses. He named his fledgling company Fiorello Pharmaceuticals Inc., in tribute to New York mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia, who opposed the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, when the substance was still legal. For now, Mr. Hoffnung has formed an investor group, while seeking to forge partnerships with companies that have grown and dispensed marijuana in other states.Mr. Hoffnung is a former managing director at Bear Stearns, and was a deputy comptroller when John C. Liu served as the city comptroller. He said he became interested in medical marijuana after seeing folks in my family with A.L.S. and other conditions where cannabis has been proven helpful to relieve pain and suffering.But he had another interest in legal cannabis. While working for Mr. Liu, he took part in a study that asked how many city residents might benefit from the legalization of marijuana, and how much money the city might reap. The numbers were big: 100,000 patients for medical cannabis, and tax revenue of $400 million if recreational use were legalized.The figures, Mr. Hoffnung acknowledged, will not be realized until well into the future, if ever. But the current regulatory conditions, with each state setting its own laws and no distribution across state lines, might be an advantage for smaller companies like his.No major companies want to create a business model and have to replicate it in 23 states, he said. That doesnt allow economies of scale.That could change, especially as businesses press state and federal legislators harder. In New York, the public is already on board, said Mr. McCarthy, the lobbyist, citing polls that show support for medical marijuana at 83 percent in the state, up from just 58 percent a few years ago. The support, he said, is widespread. Theres no drop off from a senior in Buffalo to an independent soccer mom in Suffolk.In the meantime, at the Cannabis and Hemp Association meeting, the aspiring moguls had a regulatory request for Ms. Savino. They wanted more regulation, not less. Specifically, Mr. Giannotti worried about over-the-counter remedies being sold as non-psychoactive hemp oil or CBD oil (CBD, or cannabidiol, is one of the active ingredients in cannabis). Such products are largely unregulated and sell for as much as hundreds of dollars for a small amount. The attendees worried that such companies might taint the industry. Could the state crack down on them?Ms. Savino pulled a bottle of something called Green Cures CBD Oil from her purse, eying it skeptically. People believe what they want to believe, she said. Its hard to protect people from what they think will help.Mr. Maryasis said he hoped the over-the-counter products, which were plentiful at the recent trade show, were not a sign of things to come, especially before regulated medical marijuana becomes available.This sets a bad standard for the industry, he said. We want to lead with genuineness, and not just opportunism.He added: If we do this right, we can be an example to the nation. We dont have to be the first ones to legalize it. We just have to do it right.",2014-11-02,marijuana

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/education/edlife/legally-high-marijuana-on-campus-colorado.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/02/education/edlife/20141102SCENE-slide-S67J/20141102SCENE-slide-S67J-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg,Legally High at a Colorado Campus,"Smoking pot, some say, is now just part of everyday life at the University of Colorado, Boulder.","In an apartment complex just outside the western edge of the University of Colorados flagship campus, a 22-year-old psychology major named Zach has just leaned over an expensive oil rig  a twisting glass tube that he will use to smoke shatter, a hash oil concentrate. Once he lights up, his high will be rapid and intense.Zach spends hundreds of dollars on smoking devices. But he has a side income. This evenings session was preceded by visits to three medical marijuana dispensaries, where, using his state-issued card, he bought pot products to sell to friends at a markup. Runners  campus argot, as in running around buying for others  are an open secret on campus.Zach takes a seat on his overstuffed sectional and tells how it happened: His first day living on campus, a sophomore had taken him to a dispensary for a pizza with marijuana baked in. He asked how he could get his own card, and friends coached him on telling a doctor about anxiety, nausea or back pain. I just said I had a bike accident when I was younger, and that caused lower back pain, which caused nausea and that caused anxiety, he recalls. I was afraid it wouldnt happen, so I just got all three knocked out. He presented a bill mailed to his dorm as proof he was a state resident, which he wasnt, and received a card allowing him to access medical marijuana immediately, two ounces at a time.Some of Zachs clients are under 21 and cannot buy recreational cannabis legally. But others are older students who simply dont want to pay the hefty tax  three times that levied on medical marijuana. So despite the abundance of recreational cannabis products since the first retail shops opened in January, there is still a vibrant black market for medical marijuana, which has been legal in Colorado since 2001 with a doctors recommendation.Theres definitely still the demand, says Zach, who is on track to graduate in December. He makes anywhere from a few dollars to a thousand a month, depending on how much he hustles, but he says that overall sales have declined a bit, what with retail shops, student growers and all the medical cards.Its difficult to say if students are smoking more. There is no long-term data by age, but statewide about 16,000 18- to 24-year-olds are on the medical marijuana registry. Thats 14 percent of all cardholders. City of Boulder tax revenue for medical marijuana for the first six months of 2014 was up 30 percent, at $500,000  about equal to revenue on recreational marijuana.Nationally, marijuana use among young adults has clearly been trending upward. The percentage of college students who reported smoking within the previous year plummeted from a high of 51 percent in 1981 to a low of 26.5 percent in 1991, and has been zigzagging back up, to some 36 percent in 2013, according to the Monitoring the Future Study at the University of Michigan. Data released in September show that one of 20 college students (one of 11 men) gets high daily or near daily, the highest rate since 1981. To put that in perspective, from 1990 to 1994, fewer than one in 50 students used pot that frequently.Experts say that the increase is surely a reflection of relaxed laws governing marijuana in some states, a movement gaining momentum. Floridians will face a ballot initiative on Tuesday on whether to legalize medical marijuana, which is allowed in almost half the states. Alaska, Oregon and District of Columbia voters will decide whether to follow Colorado and Washington State, where recreational marijuana has been legal since 2012.The amendments ban smoking in public  on streets and in parks, shops and restaurants. The same holds for campuses, including university housing.Dr. Donald A. Misch, associate vice chancellor for health and wellness at the University of Colorado, says that his main concern about the way legalization will affect students is that the industry  and associated advertising and commercialization  promotes the notion that cannabis is harmless. Monitoring the Future asks high school seniors if they see great harm in smoking regularly: 60 percent do not. In 2005, 42 percent did not.Dr. Misch is working with other campus officials to increase awareness about the effects of the substance, including its impact on learning. It is not going to turn you into an ax murderer, he says, but what I tell people is: The good news is that marijuana is in many ways better than alcohol. The bad news is its not as benign as many people want you to believe. Tucked away in a windowless basement room in the universitys Wardenburg Health Center, three clean-cut undergraduates are examining how marijuana is affecting them. Breathe,  a sign suggests in the softly lit room. Backpacks slung to the floor, the students form a restless crescent  pencils tapping, legs jiggling  around a new-age rug of concentric circles.Did anybody get in more trouble over the weekend? asks Stephen Bentley, a substance abuse counselor. They hadnt. The session, designed to help them see the discrepancy between getting high and reaching their goals, is one of three they have been mandated to attend. All are under 21 and were caught smoking.Marijuana citations by the campus police are, in fact, down  154 as of Oct. 3, compared with almost 256 in the same period last year. Christina Gonzales, dean of students, says the university is moving from a punitive stance to a more educational approach, easing up on enforcement. But last year, 718 students who had been sent to the health center by the courts or university after a substance-related offense (mostly alcohol) were found to be engaged in pot use that put them at risk.Michael, a sophomore from Colorado, was caught over the summer in a Boulder park for possession. A bike cop came up and saw me exhale. He paid fines and fees of about $150, performed 24 hours of community service and had to complete Mr. Bentleys three-part class. If he stays out of trouble for several months, the court will wipe his record clean. During the summer, he was smoking about five times a week but has slowed down with the start of classes.Mr. Bentley asks the group about problems with memory, which seems to resonate with Michael. If I get high a number of times per week, he says, I notice that my memory slumps a little.Mr. Bentley empathizes. You cant remember your car keys, phone?No, its not like that. If a friend tells me an answer to a problem when Im working on homework and Im not quite there yet, I cant remember it.So, you cant hold it in your mind, Mr. Bentley affirms. No judgment, no confrontation, no labels. This is the mantra.Mr. Bentley and counselors at other universities say they are seeing a small but growing number of students who have been smoking since age 14 and are serious users. He mentions dabs, an exponentially powerful form of marijuana. Last year, he got an email from a member of the housing staff. Students were wielding a butane torch in the dorm. The kids were saying, Were making crme brle on the hot plate. Not exactly. The torches heat a nail. A dab of pot concentrate is placed on the head. Vapors are inhaled.Thats the way things work in this culture, says Mr. Bentley, who has more than 20 years in the addiction field, 10 at Boulder. People on the front lines are playing catch-up a lot of times. Word spread quickly through the staff of the potential fire hazard.Universities are searching for ways to respond to marijuana, the most abused substance on campuses after alcohol. But interventions are often adaptations of programs for heavy drinkers that dont capture the marijuana experience, says Jason R. Kilmer, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Washington. In a typical program for experienced smokers, students answer questions adapted from a widely used index of alcohol-related problems: Has the student ever passed out after using? Got into a fight? But they arent asked about eating too much, coughing and problems with sleep, motivation, memory and attention  top unwanted effects of marijuana named in a recent survey of students by Dr. Kilmer and colleagues. Helping students recognize problems can prompt them to reduce consumption.Some colleges, including the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, Boston College and the University of Southern Indiana, have been adding programs tailored to marijuana users. C.U.-Boulder offers a tier of psychoeducational options  two levels of individual sessions for mild and more serious users, and a group program for moderate and heavier users. For students unable to curb their use, a more extensive program is being planned to help them add structure to their lives and find relaxation alternatives  yoga, maybe.Its a retention strategy as well, Mr. Bentley says. Users, even infrequent, are more likely to drop out, according to a 2013 report from the University of Maryland.Alan J. Budney, a researcher and professor at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, ticks off academic fallout: Not getting to class, changing majors, the B average becomes a C average  they are small things that arent disastrous but they can change the course of where you are heading.Research on universities efforts is scant. Several studies have shown encouraging, if short-term results. Three months after a brief intervention, students from two campuses in the Northwest reported smoking less and experiencing fewer pot-related consequences; ditto for Wilmington students one month after their program.At the heart of the sessions is motivational interviewing, which gets students to voice their own ambivalence about their use and eventually consider changing it.Students first discuss whats good about getting high, how it lubricates social interactions and dissipates boredom and stress. Michael, a driven computer engineering major, tells Mr. Bentleys group that pot helps him feel his emotions. Marijuana changed my point of view on life, not to take things so hard and go easier on myself. And, of course, there are the perception-altering qualities. Ben, a junior, smiles and says: When youre high, watching a movie or going to a concert is freaking awesome.They also discuss whats not so good (words like bad are taboo). Spending too much: I dont want to even think about that, says Kevin, the third member of the group, who smoked multiple times a day as a freshman but has cut back to three or four times a week. Lack of motivation scores, too. And anxiety. If you have anxiety in your life regularly, it amplifies it, Ben offers.As students reveal their dislikes, counselors listen intently for signs of self-medication for anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. But mostly, they listen for any hook that might motivate a student to cut back.Relationship troubles caused by a partners disapproval of their marijuana use is a biggie, says Rebecca Caldwell, director of the substance abuse program in Wilmington. So are slipping grades, a factor motivating the three in Mr. Bentleys session. For an athlete, it might be diminished lung capacity.Because marijuanas effects are subtle, some students dont connect the dots with, say, feeling tired after a nights sleep. Some dont want to see the connection. Pot becomes part of who they are. Oregon State University shut down its group program two years ago and now offers only individual sessions because participants were enabling one another, says Robert C. Reff, director of the substance abuse program.I ask: Who are your friends? How many smoke marijuana? And they say, All of them. Ask students what has changed at the University of Colorado since legalization and most will say: not much.Boulder has a long history with cannabis. Hippies flocked to this oasis of independent thought, drawn by a bustling music scene and student protests. As the city morphed into a counterculture outpost and activist hotbed  passing strict environmental laws, relaxing drug enforcement and opening one of the states first abortion clinics  getting high was not just a way to tune out but also a political statement.The only rules here are no rules, Rob Pudim, a resident, told a Newsweek reporter in a 1980 piece entitled Where the Hip Meet to Trip. The only people in town who arent comfortable, he said, are straight people who need boundaries.The campus still draws from afar. Nearly 40 percent of its 26,000 undergraduates are from out of state  a high percentage for a public university. They are attracted by mountain adventure and a stunning setting. The Flatirons, the steep slabs of rock that dominate the landscape, feel close enough to touch. Many students are here because of the robust science programs; C.U. is a member of the Association of American Universities, an exclusive group of research institutions. And because of its party-school reputation.On a recent Friday, a clutch of students and friends gather around a table garnished for an evening of casual indulgence: beers, playing cards, tubes of medical marijuana and a bong. All are 21, or almost there, and from other states.Several voice sentiments that are shared in other corners of campus. They didnt come here simply because its located in a permissive pot town, but cannabis culture certainly played a role. I could have went to a bunch of sweet public schools, says Erik Mingo, and I chose this one because I knew it was pretty accepted here. I knew people had an open mind.Mr. Mingo dropped out after the spring semester to work at a start-up. He has largely quit smoking, and isnt indulging on this night. I just didnt really need it anymore, he explains. It helped me relax and think about myself and the world, and I just wasnt getting the same return. His priority now is excelling at a demanding job, he says. I was moving on just naturally in my life.The campus is not under a cannabis cloud. Sometimes one sees a lit joint in the open or a vape pen in class, drawing ire from professors. But students and others talk about a shift in how they view cannabis consumption. Once an act of rebellion, it no longer seems to hold symbolic power. Now its just part of everyday life, says Joseph Kaley, 27, who graduated in 2009 and manages a Mexican restaurant on the Hill, an off-campus gathering spot. Mr. Kaley attended three of the campuss famous April 20 smoke-outs, lighting up each time to protest marijuanas criminal status at the time.In 2012, the university successfully shut down 420, saying it had grown so large it was disrupting academic life. Many were angered, particularly by the methods used to ward smokers away: Workers spread smelly fish fertilizer on the quad and anyone without a student identification card was turned away.New students, when asked, see the smoke-out as a piece of quirky campus history. Its just kind of fading from peoples memories, says Wyatt Ryder, 20, the chief of staff of the student government, which last April held a symposium offering an all-inclusive inside dive into the realm of cannabis culture.The goal was to have a very nuanced discussion about marijuana, said Caitlin Pratt, 23, Mr. Ryders colleague in student government. Panelists discussed making money in the industry, the effects of cannabis on the mind and efforts to legalize the substance in other states. One of the most popular panels was led by Nolan Kane, a C.U. professor attempting to map the cannabis genome to better understand marijuanas medical, fuel and biotechnology potential.A few months later, Mr. Ryder attended a national conference for student government representatives. He was accosted with questions  and jokes  about pot culture at his university. Mr. Ryder, who doesnt even smoke, was shocked to be appointed the conferences unofficial marijuana expert.I just think its fascinating, he said, because to us in Colorado, its not such a big deal. But to other people, its a major issue.",2014-11-02,marijuana

Here, how five parents talk to their children about smoking pot.","Ever since smoking pot became ubiquitous among American teenagers in the 1960s, parents have struggled with how to talk to their children about it and how to protect them from its negative effects.Now, in an era of broader acceptance  two states (Washington and Colorado) have legalized recreational use of marijuana for ages 21 and up and 23 states have approved its medical use, all while marijuana remains illegal under federal law  teenagers are clearly getting conflicting, widely disparate messages.The War on Drugs and Just Say No campaigns of the 1980s provided a national moral mandate and a singular template for parents: All drugs are bad. But many parents today believe that the reductionist catchphrase oversimplifies the complex landscape of the nations drug use.Today, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, 18- to 25-year-olds are the biggest abusers of opioid pain relievers, A.D.H.D. stimulants and anti-anxiety drugs. Prescription drugs account for more overdose deaths among this age group than all illegal drugs combined. Alcohol remains the No. 1 health hazard and date-rape drug on college campuses. And a new generation of pen-size, odorless vaporizers, with USB ports for easy recharging, allows students to get high virtually anywhere, even at school.With these realities in mind, more parents seem to be accepting the probability that their teenagers will self-medicate at some point, and they see pot as having more manageable risks than other substances. Rather than adhere to a just say no theology, they are embracing a nuanced, harm-reduction approach. They are even, in some cases, revealing their own use to help create a dialogue with their children.Honesty about drug use is encouraged by Dr. Donald A. Misch, medical director at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who oversees the health of nearly 30,000 students on a campus long considered marijuana-friendly. During an orientation session in August for parents entitled Stress, Risk Taking, AlcoholDrugs and Parents as Partners: What Every C.U. Parent Should Know, Dr. Misch responded to a fathers question about whether to tell his son about his own prior usage. What you should say depends on your family, he advised. As a general rule, I believe in being honest.Dr. Misch, who delivered the lecture 13 times to reach as many parents as possible, assured them that smoking a joint every once in a while posed minimal health risk, but he also warned, with a series of statistics projected on overhead screens, that marijuana can cause eating and sleeping problems, productivity problems, various cognitive difficulties as well as motor vehicle accidents, psychosis and addiction.When you are high or acutely intoxicated with marijuana, you dont make good memories, he said, adding, with some levity, Every time your kid goes to class high, you arent getting your moneys worth.To help parents guide their children away from risky behaviors, Dr. Misch urged parents to stay in touch with their children, especially just before the weekend, and encouraged them to use the universitys online handbook that guides them through what to say, how not to react and how best to leverage parental power, which remains strong even after children have settled in on campus.Even though your son or daughter might not acknowledge it, you still matter, he said. If a student gets in trouble for using marijuana on campus, we can put them on probation, we can throw them out of housing, but what college students consistently report is that the worst thing we can do to them, the absolute death penalty, is call you.Todays parenting approaches to marijuana use range from zero tolerance to reluctant acceptance to outright permission. Here, a look at these perspectives.SHARING A JOINTToni and Barry Fox of Salida, Colo., never hid the fact that they smoked marijuana from Cheyenne, Mr. Foxs daughter from a previous marriage. But during her teenage years they made it clear she wasnt allowed to use any intoxicants. Were adults, our brains are developed, Ms. Fox, 42, recalled explaining to her. She was a teenager, so we had zero tolerance for any substance that would alter her brain development.When Cheyenne got caught smoking a cigarette at school at 16 and had to call home to tell her parents, her father reacted swiftly and firmly. I lost my car for six months, said Cheyenne, now 22 and a recent graduate of Metropolitan State University of Denver. That was the most depressing day of my whole life.Mr. Fox told Cheyenne that if she was interested in trying marijuana once she turned 18, he would assist her, at home under his supervision. She was. So on the afternoon of her birthday he honored his promise. The first time I ever smoked, she said, my dad rolled a joint and handed it to me and told me, Go in the backyard and dont go anywhere. Ill make you nachos in an hour.  The next day, her parents helped her secure a card to access medical marijuana.Ms. Foxs biggest fear for Cheyenne was something happening to her alcohol-based, like being a victim of an assault at a party.I grew up in Minnesota where alcohol was readily available to teenagers, she said. I didnt know a female growing up who didnt have some sexual incident related to intoxication. As a youth, Ms. Fox dealt with the pain of her fathers suicide with alcohol and harder drugs before discovering marijuana. She believes so strongly in marijuanas palliative power that in 2010 she opened a medical marijuana dispensary in Denver, which she converted to a recreational dispensary this year. Cheyenne, who earned a degree in marketing, works at a new, second location.Now, when we smoke marijuana together, says the mom, we talk business.SMOKE, BUT SAFELYMark Klein, 52, a software entrepreneur from Los Altos, Calif., acknowledged to his children that he smokes pot when they reached high school. When my oldest son asked, I wanted to be honest, said Mr. Klein, who has two sons  a college sophomore and a recent graduate  and twin 18-year-old daughters, both freshmen.After trying pot in high school, Mr. Klein sampled it again while in his early 30s and started using it about once a month. Rather than insist that his children avoid marijuana altogether, he talked to them about using it safely, urging them to call him for a ride home rather than drive while high or accept a ride from a stoned friend, and not to indulge in edibles. Its way too easy to keep eating a five-dose cookie when the effects dont show up for 45 minutes, he said. He also drew distinctions between his occasional use and people who smoke pot every day and lose track of their goals.I told them, Dont let marijuana be a big part of your life. Keep your eyes on your objectives.  Mr. Klein says he knows that some of his children have tried marijuana and, despite his own use, he isnt thrilled about it. My desire is that they dont use drugs, dont use alcohol, and dont have sex, but they are teenagers and human beings and so thats probably not going to happen.TOKE TALKSAfter being caught smoking a bong in the family sunroom as teenagers, Arian Creque and her stepbrother Michael cowered while their mother, who opposes anyone in her family using recreational marijuana, yelled at them. But a couple of nights later, when Michael went back to the room to smoke a joint after work, his father surprised him by sauntering up and producing a small metal pipe.I was just floored, said Mr. Creque, now 22. We sat out there for an hour and a half, and we had a blast. We talked about everything from when I started and how much I did, to what was going on in school.As for his father, he didnt love that his teenagers were smoking pot. In a recent conversation in their home in Littleton, Colo., after a 36-hour shift at his longtime tech job, he recalled telling them about his own use (a single toke several times a week to relax after work or help him fall asleep) and sharing stories of his experiences to help them understand moderation. He also encouraged them to avoid parties where a large number of people get intoxicated. I used to tell the kids that if you get over eight or nine people, somebodys going to get drunk, somebodys going to punch somebody, somebody is going to throw up in the yard, he said. When it comes to kicking back with friends, you want to keep it small.Added his son: He was trying to teach me some good life lessons and keep me safe. The younger Mr. Creque, who earned an associate degree in 2012 in business and works at a car dealership, said he smokes several times a day and dabs, using a heated nail to extract an intense fume from the resin. I use marijuana a little too much, he acknowledged.His stepsister, now 21, is working toward a bachelors online at the University of Colorado, Denver. For her, getting high is an antidote to what she describes as near-constant anxiety. My whole thing is my future  whats coming next? I finished my homework, but whats coming next? She sleeps between shifts at the hotel where she works 50 hours a week, and otherwise lives in her parents basement. When I smoke, she said, Im more in the present.POLICING THE PADLast year, Lisa Fields, a 53-year-old single working mother from Los Angeles County, discovered that her teenage son had been smoking pot. Fearing it could lead him down a harmful path, she took a scorched-earth approach to making sure he wouldnt do it again.After he went to sleep, Ms. Fields looked through his backpack and found two enormous joints, professional looking and rolled with a filter. You could definitely tell they were from a dispensary, she said. She stayed up all night reading on the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids website about how to stay calm, what to say to her son and what other steps she could take to keep him clean.In the morning, she confronted him, and warned he could not carry an illegal substance to school or keep it in her house, putting her at risk. After school, she took him to a park  a place where he had room to breathe and express himself  and began asking questions. Next, she tore apart the house, finding not only more marijuana and a glass pipe but also hashish. He told me he knew kids who actually smoked it in school using vapor pens that resemble ink pens, Ms. Fields said.To make concealing things impossible, she removed his bedroom door and took all the drawers out of his dresser, stacking his clothes in open bins.He had to start from ground zero with trust, she said. She ordered him to research and write a paper on how marijuana affects adolescent brain development; she took him for urine and blood tests  I also wanted to scare him, she admitted  and then to his favorite burrito joint, where he revealed how hard it had been to make friends in a new school.Smoking dope had allowed him to fit in. I could have weed at my house, he said, and people want to come over  something Ms. Fields confirmed when she found over $1,200 in credit card charges for takeout food.Ms. Fields, who acknowledges having used marijuana on occasion as an adult, says she had previously supported its legalization, but after seeing how easily her son, a minor, could gain access to drugs sold legally to someone else, she has reconsidered.When people voted to legalize marijuana, they didnt consider how it changes how children feel about drugs, she said. They think its all O.K. and its natural. It gives them a different perspective on the drug.ZERO TOLERANCEA week before starting college at Loyola UniversityMaryland in September, Debbie McBrides 18-year-old son, Connor, had a request: Mom, he asked, can I have a couple of friends over? You dont have to get the beer. Well get it.Ms. McBride could hardly believe her son would even ask such a question, given her zero tolerance for drugs and alcohol. What was he thinking? He said, Im going to college in a week. Ms. McBride, 51, who works for a portfolio manager and teaches youth at a Morristown, N.J., church, began talking to her two sons about the dangers of drugs when they were in middle school. On the refrigerator, she hung an article about research on marijuanas effects. I have this part highlighted, she said, reading aloud. "" The brain undergoes active development until about age 21. She says that the national debate over legalization  polls show slightly more than half of Americans favoring it  and the tacit acceptance of teenage drinking in their suburban community have made it more difficult for her children to accept her message about illicit use of substances.She and Connor arrived at many graduation parties to find kegs in the backyard. If drinking is tolerated, he wanted to know, why not pot? And my answer to that is alcohol itself is not illegal. Its the age that is illegal. Marijuana is illegal for even me.Its really hard to teach your kids the lesson that marijuana is bad for you when its legalized in other states, she said. She is fairly certain her boys would never dare smoke pot. If she caught them, they probably think I would take them to the police.",2014-11-02,marijuana

It could mean that theres some sort of drug learning taking place, speculated Jodi Gilman, at her computer screen at the Massachusetts General Hospital-Harvard Center for Addiction Medicine. Was the brain adapting to marijuana exposure, rewiring the reward system to demand the drug?Dr. Gilman was reviewing a composite scan of the brains of 20 pot smokers, ages 18 to 25. What she and fellow researchers at Harvard and Northwestern University found within those scans surprised them. Even in the seven participants who smoked only once or twice a week, there was evidence of structural differences in two significant regions of the brain. The more the subjects smoked, the greater the differences.Moderate marijuana use by healthy adults seems to pose little risk, and there are potential medical benefits, including easing nausea and pain. But it has long been known that, with the brain developing into the mid-20s, young people who smoke early and often are more likely to have learning and mental health problems. Now researchers suggest existing studies are no longer sufficient. Much of whats known is based on studies conducted years ago with much less powerful pot.Marijuana samples seized by the federal Drug Enforcement Agency show the concentration of THC, the drugs psychoactive compound, rising from a mean of 3.75 percent in 1995 to 13 percent in 2013. Potency seesaws depending on the strain and form. Fresh Baked, which sells recreational marijuana in Boulder, Colo., offers Green Crack, with a THC content of about 21 percent, and Phnom Penh, with about 8 percent. The level in a concentrate called Bubble Hash is about 70 percent; cartridges for vaporizers, much like e-cigarettes, range from 15 to 30 percent THC.High-THC marijuana is associated with paranoia and psychosis, according to a June article in The New England Journal of Medicine. We have seen very, very significant increases in emergency room admissions associated with marijuana use that cant be accounted for solely on basis of changes in prevalence rates, said Nora D. Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and a co-author of the THC study. It can only be explained by the fact that current marijuana has higher potency associated with much greater risk for adverse effects. Emergency room visits related to marijuana have nearly doubled, from 66,000 in 2004 to 129,000 in 2011, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.Higher potency may also accelerate addiction. You dont have to work so hard to get high, said Alan J. Budney, a researcher and professor at Dartmouths medical school. As you make it easier to get high, it makes a person more vulnerable to addiction. Among adults, the rate is one of 11; for teenagers, one of six.Concerns over increasing potency, and rising usage among the young, is giving new urgency to research.For the Harvard-Northwestern study, published in the April issue of The Journal of Neuroscience, the team scanned the brains of 40 young adults, most from Boston-area colleges. Half were nonusers; half reported smoking for one to six years and showed no signs of dependence. Besides the seven light smokers, nine used three to five days a week and four used, on average, daily. All smokers showed abnormalities in the shape, density and volume of the nucleus accumbens, which is at the core of motivation, the core of pleasure and pain, and every decision that you make, explained Dr. Hans Breiter, a co-author of the study and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwesterns medical school.Similar changes affected the amygdala, which is fundamental in processing emotions, memories and fear responses.What is already known is that in casual users, THC can disrupt focus, working memory, decision making and motivation for about 24 hours. The fact that we can see these structural effects in the brain could indicate that the effects of THC are longer lasting than we previously thought, said Dr. Gilman, an instructor in psychology at Harvards medical school.The study was preliminary and small, and attempts to replicate it are underway. Meanwhile, Dr. Gilman is trying to figure out how the findings relate to brain function and behavior.One day in September, she was assessing Emma, a student who said her smoking  almost every day  didnt interfere with school, work or other obligations. For $100 to go toward study-abroad plans, Emma politely plowed through nearly three hours of tests on cognitive functions that are or might be affected by THC, like the ability to delay gratification (would it be better to have $30 tonight or $45 in 15 days?) and motivation (a choice between computer games, the harder one offering a bigger payoff). For memory, Emma listened to lists of words, repeating back those she recalled. Next came risk. Would she bungee jump? Eat high-cholesterol food? (These kids tend to be risk takers, particularly with their own health and safety, Dr. Gilman said.)A final test: Did Emma crave a joint? Her response: somewhat.Dr. Gilman is concerned about pots impact on the college population. This is when they are making some major life decisions, she said, choosing a major, making long-lasting friendships.Dr. Volkow noted another problem: Partying on a Saturday night may hinder studying for a test or writing a paper due on Monday. Maybe you wont have the motivation to study, because theres no reward, no incentive, she said.Evidence of long-term effects is also building. A study released in 2012 showed that teenagers who were found to be dependent on pot before age 18 and who continued using it into adulthood lost an average of eight I.Q. points by age 38. And last year at Northwestern, Dr. Breiter and colleagues also saw changes in the nucleus accumbens among adults in their early 20s who had smoked daily for three years but had stopped for at least two years.They had impaired working memories as well. Working memory is key for learning, Dr. Breiter said. If I were to design a substance that is bad for college students, it would be marijuana.",2014-11-02,marijuana

They have about a 70 percent chance of doing so, according to the latest forecast from The Upshot. They appear to be in strong position to win four seats held by Democrats  in Arkansas, Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia. The task could be complicated if they lose Republican-held seats in Georgia, Kansas and Kentucky  three races that remain close. The other Senate races that will likely will determine the balance of power are in purple states currently held by Democrats  Alaska, Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire and North Carolina. In Louisiana, a three-way race could mean no candidate gets 50 percent, leading to a runoff, which would not be held until December.The House: Republicans will almost certainly maintain control. The big question is how many seats they will pick up and whether a bigger majority will make Speaker John A. Boehners job easier or harder, as he tries to keep his caucus together.Statehouses: Some of the most compelling races have been for governor. In Wisconsin, a win by Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, could help him emerge as a strong candidate for president in 2016. Former Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida is trying to reclaim his seat, this time as a Democrat. In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback faces a backlash from voters and a potential Republican revolt. In Connecticut, the rematch of the 2010 contest between Gov. Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, and Thomas Foley, his Republican challenger, is one of the closest races in the country. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York is expected to win re-election easily against the Republican candidate, Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive.What else to watch: The most talked-about ballot initiatives have to do with the legalization of marijuana and an increase in the minimum wage. There are also interesting down-ballot races, and The Times has provided a helpful guide for all 50 states.The electorate: The mood of the national electorate is very uneasy, with the threat of Ebola and the rise of the Islamic State adding to an undercurrent of economic anxiety. President Obamas unpopularity is hindering Democrats, but Republicans are also viewed unfavorably. Though Republicans have sought to nationalize the election, the political environment varies from state to state, as demonstrated in a series of state portraits The Times published on Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Louisiana and North Carolina.",2014-11-01,marijuana

Ultimately, it determines the outcome between competing visions for the country.","With many maps depicting the condition of Americans lives  showing the poverty level, for instance, or unemployment  state lines are meaningless. Joblessness doesnt suddenly jump when you cross from eastern Colorado to western Nebraska or from Westchester County in New York to Fairfield County in Connecticut.But a map that we published this week, showing where people had gained health insurance over the last year, was different. The state lines on that map were often stark. In Pennsylvania, relatively few people have gained insurance. In neighboring West Virginia, many have. There were similar contrasts between Wyoming and its neighboring states, between Tennessee and its neighbors and elsewhere.Those borders are a reminder of how much elections matter. And were only four days away from the midterm elections.The states where health-insurance coverage rates have risen sharply are states where governors and legislatures have expanded Medicaid, as the Affordable Care Act, the health overhaul passed in 2010, allows them to do. The states where coverage rates have risen less are those where local officials opted not to expand the program. In many states, next weeks elections will help determine what happens next.Here at The Upshot, were obviously fascinated by the horse-race aspect of elections, and we make no apologies for that. You cant cover politics intelligently if you ignore the horse race, because the candidates and campaigns all make decisions based on the state of the horse race. But we are also fascinated by the reasons that elections ultimately matter.They are contests between competing visions for the country. In the case of the new health care law, elections are contests between people who believe that the government should not force people to acquire health insurance and people who believe the government should make sure everyone can have health insurance.Im not objective, but Im especially proud of the work my colleagues have been doing over the last few weeks on all these fronts. Amanda Cox and Josh Katz have built a fabulous Senate forecasting model that, crucially, allows readers to compare the numbers in all of the other high-profile models. (Check out this piece, on the 11 most interesting Senate races, by Josh and Gregor Aisch.)Nate Cohn, meanwhile, continues to offer original insights on the campaign, whether about the problems with polls or the Democrats recent success with early voters, among many other topics.

Should marijuana be legal? Should legalized gambling be expanded? And should Montanas state auditor, who does not audit the state, instead be called the Commissioner of Securities and Insurance?Voters will decide 147 statewide questions in all, ranging from the profound to the mundane. Here are a few key themes to watch for on election night.Minimum wage: The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. Four states (Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota) will consider proposals to raise it, to levels ranging from $8 to $9.75. Illinois will vote on a nonbinding advisory question about whether the minimum wage should be $10. Michigan voters, however, will not vote on a minimum-wage increase because lawmakers there enacted one in May, under pressure from groups collecting signatures to pass a larger increase by initiative.Drugs and alcohol: Colorado and Washington legalized recreational marijuana by ballot initiative in 2012; this year, Alaska, the District of Columbia and Oregon will consider doing the same. Florida will vote on legalizing marijuana for medical use. Arkansas will consider a proposal to legalize alcohol sales statewide; currently, about half the states counties are dry.Gambling: Eight states will vote on proposals to expand legal gambling. In two, the question is whether legislatively approved expansions should be ratified: in Massachusetts, voters will decide whether to go ahead with three casinos that the legislature authorized, while Californians will consider rejecting a state law that authorizes the North Fork band of Mono Indians to open a casino in the Central Valley, on a site 36 miles away from the actual tribal settlement. Another tribe that operates a nearby casino has led the opposition to off-reservation gambling.Colorado, Rhode Island and South Dakota will decide whether to legalize more kinds of gambling games at existing facilities. (For example, blackjack is currently legal in Deadwood, S.D., but craps and roulette are not.) Kansas, South Carolina and Tennessee will vote on allowing raffles or lotteries as nonprofit fund-raising vehicles.Hunting: Alabama and Mississippi voters will decide whether to establish a constitutional right to hunt. Maine voters will decide whether to ban bear-baiting and using dogs to hunt bears. And the only statewide ballot questions in Michigan are two nearly identical proposals to reject state laws authorizing wolf hunting  but it doesnt really matter how people vote on them, since the states legislature enacted a new law to ensure that its authorization of a wolf hunt would stand, even if voters reject the other two laws.Transportation funding: Several states are considering how much money to dedicate to transportation. Texas will vote on a constitutional amendment to divert certain oil and gas extraction taxes to shore up its transportation fund. Maryland and Wisconsin may amend their constitutions to prevent legislators from raiding transportation funds to pay for other parts of government. Massachusetts legislators have indexed the states gasoline tax to inflation so that transportation revenues would keep up with inflation; voters are now being asked to repeal indexation.Voting: Montana will decide whether to abolish same-day voter registration; Missouri will consider amending its constitution to allow early voting, but only during business hours on six weekdays before the election. Early-voting advocates had hoped for a more expansive early voting period.Bait-and-switch questions: Arkansass Issue 3 is titled The Arkansas Elected Officials Ethics, Transparency, and Financial Reform Amendment of 2014. Its most important effect, however, would be to lengthen term limits in the states legislature from a maximum of 8 years to 16.Californias Proposition 46 is called Drug and Alcohol Testing of Doctors. Medical Negligence Lawsuits. Proponents advertisements have focused on the aspect of the law that would require doctors to submit to random drug and alcohol tests. But the core of the dispute over Prop 46 is whether the cap on pain and suffering damages in medical negligence lawsuits should be raised to $1.1 million from $250,000. As Adam Nagourney reported for The Times in August:Base-activating measures: Illinois voters will consider three questions on hot-button issues for the left: raising the minimum wage, requiring prescription drug plans to cover contraception and imposing a tax on millionaires to fund education. However, all three questions are purely advisory and will have no force of law. Republicans in Illinois have criticized the questions as using the referendum process to drive turnout, rather than for lawmaking.Of course, using referendums for base activation isnt a strategy unique to the left; Republicans sought to put proposals against same-sex marriage on ballots in 2004 in part to increase turnout among social conservatives. And this year there are some largely symbolic questions coming from the right, including those right-to-hunt measures in the South and a state constitutional amendment to ban the use of Sharia law in Alabama; a similar proposal adopted by Oklahoma voters in 2010 was thrown out by federal courts.Are we really voting on this? In general, state constitutions can be amended only by popular vote, and the overinclusiveness of those constitutions can lead to voters being asked to weigh in on some very mundane questions.For example, New York voters will decide whether to allow the state legislature to distribute proposed legislation to its members electronically. Currently, a paper copy of every proposed bill must be placed on every members desk three days before voting, leading to the use of 19 million sheets of paper in every two-year session. The paper-bills requirement is in the constitution, so the legislature cant stop the printing without voters permission.Wyoming voters will decide whether nonresidents of the state may sit on the University of Wyoming board of trustees. Again, yes, thats a matter in the state constitution that the legislature couldnt change without voter approval.And then theres the issue of the Montana state auditor. Despite her title, the state auditors job is regulating the securities and insurance industries. State Auditor Monica Lindeen thinks that confuses the public, and shes already started using the title Commissioner of Securities and Insurance. Making that change official requires amending the constitution, which legislators voted to do last year; now, voter approval is required.But this is not the first time Montanans have weighed in on what the auditor should be called. In 2006, when the legislature put a question on the ballot asking whether to rename the office as Insurance Commissioner, 64 percent of voters rejected the proposal. Perhaps this time will be different.",2014-10-31,marijuana
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/us/new-scrutiny-on-sweets-with-ascent-of-marijuana-in-colorado.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/30/us/EDIBLES1/EDIBLES1-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg,New Scrutiny on Sweets With Ascent of Marijuana in Colorado,"A Denver marijuana-store owner and the police teamed up for a video warning parents that the drug can mimic Sour Patch Kids, Jolly Ranchers and gummy bears.","DENVER   As Halloween approached, the Denver Police Department and a marijuana-store owner teamed up to film a public service video that could exist only in this weird new world of legalized pot.Marijuana, they cautioned parents of trick-or-treaters, does not always look like marijuana. More and more these days, it can mimic Sour Patch Kids, Jolly Ranchers and gummy bears, and the police urged parents to double-check their childrens Halloween haul for any suspicious-looking candies that might be infused with marijuana.Theres really no way to tell the difference, Patrick Johnson, the owner of Urban Dispensary, says in the video. He added, Its best just to toss that stuff into the trash.To some marijuana advocates, the warning belongs with shadowy urban legends about poisoned chocolates and candy bars spiked with razor blades. There have not been any reported cases of marijuana-laced treats being passed out on Halloween here, and edible marijuana comes in drab packages that look nothing like regular candy. Still, the Halloween message underscored a growing concern among parents groups and regulators that the abundant new varieties of legal, edible marijuana just look too much like regular food.Since recreational marijuana sales began here in January, edible pot has become a top seller at dispensaries across Colorado, a sweet and tasty way for wary first-timers to sample marijuana, or for people to get high without coughing and reeking of smoke. But a spate of accidental ingestions by children and adults, and two deaths tied to edibles this year, have prompted widespread calls to clamp down on the edible corner of the marijuana market.While some companies are making mandarin-flavored sodas and rich dark-chocolate bars infused with the drug, advocates for tighter marijuana regulation say that others are simply coating brightly colored bulk candy and child-friendly breakfast cereals with cannabis oil and selling it at a huge markup. And critics argue that even seasoned marijuana consumers are getting sick or losing control after eating marijuana snacks that proved far more potent than they had realized. A single candy bar or soda could be packed with enough THC  the major psychoactive chemical in marijuana  to serve 10 people.Under new rules approved by state regulators, some potent candies that once contained 100-milligram doses of THC are being pared back to 10 milligrams a serving, the amount that has been designated as a discrete dose. And starting next February, more edibles will come in childproof packages and will be wrapped up in plastic and foil sheets similar to those that encase prescription pills.But some officials think the new rules do not go far enough.This month, Colorados public health department went so far as to recommend a ban on almost all forms of edible marijuana, from brownies to cookies and chewy candies, saying their proliferation was confusing consumers and baiting children who could not tell the difference. The proposal has not gained much traction, but it showed the deep divisions between marijuana makers and public health officials who are now sparring over how to package edibles, whether they need clearer labels and markings, and exactly how strictly they should be regulated.Julie Dooley and a business partner started making marijuana-infused treats years before voters in Colorado and Washington State became the first to make marijuana legal for adult recreational users. It helped ease their health problems and worked for women with anxiety problems. These users wanted to consume discreetly around their children, so baking with cannabis-rich butter seemed like an ideal choice. Today, Ms. Dooleys company, Julies Baked Goods, sells granola, granola bars, sunflower seeds and chocolates infused with cannabis to more than 30 dispensaries around the state.Ms. Dooley said she was aghast at the proposal to ban her granola, and said it appeared illegal under Amendment 64, the voter-approved measure that enshrined marijuana legalization in Colorados Constitution. But it also showed that regulators did not understand the industry, she said.They clearly did not consider why we created edibles in the first place, she said. We believe wholeheartedly that this is a medicine.She and other marijuana-business owners said the fear surrounding edibles had outstripped reality. During the first half of the year, emergency-room doctors at Childrens Hospital Colorado raised alarms after treating nine children who had accidentally eaten marijuana  more than the entire number of such cases in 2013. Since the end of May, the hospital has had five additional cases of children sickened by eating marijuana.Theres no crisis, theres no emergency, Ms. Dooley said. The fear is so huge right now.But officials with Colorados poison-control center say that calls about young children exposed to marijuana had risen from 11 in 2010 to 26 last year, after recreational marijuana was legalized but before retail sales began. Adults, too, have been fooled. In August, seven people attending Denvers county fair said they accidentally ate marijuana-laced chocolates from a vendor at the fairs inaugural Pot Pavilion who had assured them the candies were marijuana-free.We cannot tell which is infused and which is not, said Gina Carbone, a founding member of Smart Colorado, which advocates tighter controls to keep marijuana away from children.One Colorado company has begun wooing worried parents with $15 marijuana-testing kits that use a THC-sensitive solution to quickly determine whether an innocuous-looking cookie or candy is packing a hidden punch.And some advocates say edibles should have a mark or stamp that identifies them unmistakably as marijuana, the same way the Hersheys brand is stamped right on a chocolate bar, or how M&M; candies and Jelly Belly jelly beans are each airbrushed with an insignia.But makers of edibles have resisted the idea, saying it would cost tens of thousands of dollars to buy the necessary equipment, raising the price of edibles and potentially driving more customers out of the stores and back onto the black market. And there are practical problems, they say: How do you put a unique stamp on a soft toffee chew or a package of granola? And some makers say that branding a chocolate bar as MARIJUANA might actually have perverse effects, making it more attractive to curious children.Lindsay Topping, the marketing director of Dixie Elixirs and Edibles, a Denver-based maker of marijuana-infused drinks and candies, said the company was already preparing a new line of child-resistant packages. But ultimately, she said, the safety of an edible depended largely on the customer.I cant control how a parent stores this, she said. Its out of my hands once it gets into that home.",2014-10-30,marijuana

Then, as crime fell, minor arrests in the heart of the city went down too.But almost everywhere else, they skyrocketed.The brunt of those arrests fell on young black and Hispanic men, according to a wide-ranging report on misdemeanor arrests, released on Tuesday by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.And when arrestees reached the courtroom in recent years, the report found, nearly half saw the charges against them  for everything from jumping the turnstile to minor drug possession to assault  dismissed or dropped altogether.The report, drawing on state and local arrest data since 1980, presents the clearest picture to date of a three-decade long shift in crime policy in New York City, beginning when crime was on the rise and ending last year when it reached historically low levels.Thirty-four years ago, felony arrests outpaced those for misdemeanor crimes, hitting a peak in 1989 with 149,204 felony arrests. By last year, however, the two categories had not only flipped, the report found, but the arrest rate for lower-level crimes had eclipsed those for more serious offenses, rising 190 percent by 2013, when the police made 225,684 such arrests.In presenting the report at a breakfast forum on Tuesday, Jeremy Travis, the president of John Jay College, said the steep rise in misdemeanors marked a profound change in our city.While the study, by Preeti Chauhan, an assistant professor at John Jay, does not attempt to explain the reasons for the change, it provides a stark illustration in charts and figures of a policing strategy increasingly based on preventing major crime by aggressively pursuing minor offenses. The strategy is closely associated with Police Commissioner William J. Bratton and is emulated around the country.As stop-and-frisk numbers have diminished across the city, the high number of low-level arrests has come under scrutiny. Mr. Bratton and Mayor Bill de Blasio have said officers can use discretion in how they address minor offenses, while at the same time stressing that complaints from residents drive much of misdemeanor enforcement.The first principle is that police respond to complaints, said Elizabeth Glazer, the head of the Mayors Office of Criminal Justice. Thats their job. Thats their customer service.The report found that about half of the misdemeanor arrests over time were in response to complaints or serious offenses such as assaults, theft, drunken driving or weapons possession. The other half were for lower-level offenses, including marijuana possession or trespassing.In an introduction to the 114-page report, Mr. Travis said the data documents the exercise of discretion by the police, city prosecutors and the courts.A pair of charts tracking the most common misdemeanor charges suggest how officers are using that discretion. Arrests for more serious offenses, like assault, gradually rose, and those for crimes like theft declined first before slowly increasing, the report found. But arrests spiked and dipped over the past 30 years for lesser offenses like drug possession and turnstile jumping, a hallmark of Mr. Brattons crime-fighting approach in the early 1990s.Arrests for prostitution, a quintessential sign of disorder in the broken windows model, declined over the last two decades, the report found. But marijuana arrests soared beginning in the early 1990s, peaking at nearly 28 percent of all misdemeanor arrests in 2000 before tapering to 15 percent of arrests last year. By comparison, the report found, marijuana arrests in five other cities in New York State never reached that proportion of misdemeanor offenses.Once those charges reached the courtroom, nearly half ended in some form of dismissal or with prosecutors simply declining to pursue the case.In 2011, the report found, city district attorneys declined to prosecute 10.7 percent of misdemeanors, and did so in 7.6 percent of cases the next year. Elsewhere around New York State, that rate hovered near zero.Mr. Bratton, who sat in the audience on Tuesday but was not a speaker, viewed an early draft of the analysis and provided feedback, as did George L. Kelling, the criminologist whose broken windows theory of addressing minor disorder helped shape Mr. Brattons thinking on crime.The arrests documented in the report vary widely by precinct and have changed over the years.In 1993, four of the top five precincts for misdemeanor arrests were in Manhattan, including Chelsea and two Midtown precincts. By 2013, the Midtown South precinct remained a hot spot, but arrests there had declined, while misdemeanor arrests soared in East New York in Brooklyn, East Harlem in Manhattan and Morris Heights and Mott Haven in the Bronx.The report found one relative constant over the years: Black and Hispanic men made up a far greater portion of those arrested than whites, even as misdemeanor arrests increased across the board for all ethnic groups. The arrest rate for black men in particular nearly doubled from 1990 to 2013.",2014-10-29,marijuana
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/us/for-marijuana-a-second-wave-of-votes-to-legalize.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/29/us/MARIJUANA1/MARIJUANA1-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg,"For Marijuana, a Second Wave of Votes to Legalize","Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C., will decide whether to join Colorado and Washington State in allowing recreational use by adults.","KEIZER, Ore.   Two years after voters in Colorado and Washington State broke the ice as the first states to legalize sales of recreational marijuana to adults, residents of Oregon, Alaska and Washington, D.C., will vote next week on ballot measures patterned on those of the two pioneers. People on both sides of the issue say these initiatives could determine whether there will be a national tide of legalization.A changing political landscape has weakened anti-marijuana efforts. As the libertarian movement in the Republican Party has gained force, with leaders like Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, supporting decriminalization of marijuana and others going even further, an anchor of the conservative opposition to legalization has eroded.And Democrats have found that supporting legalization  once an invitation to be labeled soft on crime  no longer carries the risk it once did, as public discussion of prison overcrowding and law enforcement budgets has reframed the issue.National groups that have long advocated legalization have provided labor and money, along with help from a legal marijuana industry that did not exist in 2012. The old antidrug coalition has struggled to find traction and money. Supporters of legalization have outdone opponents fund-raising here in Oregon by more than 25 to 1, and in Alaska by about 9 to 1.The support coalition is definitely broader, and the opposition has splintered, said Corey Cook, an associate professor of politics at the University of San Francisco who follows the marijuana debate.The contrast between the pro- and anti-legalization forces was apparent on a recent day in Oregon. In downtown Portland, scruffy hipsters with clipboards buttonholed passers-by, registering voters and urging them to vote yes on Measure 91, while political consultants put the final touches on a $2 million ad barrage.Nearby, opponents organized one of their major events in Keizer, a suburb of Salem, the state capital. Titled Marijuana and Our Youth, the session included two hours of PowerPoints and passionate denunciations of the drug. But no one even mentioned Measure 91: Audience participants and organizers, many of them from government-funded nonprofit groups involved in drug treatment services, were afraid of violating laws that ban politicking with public money.Opponents were, by their own admission, late in forming a united organization, and their campaign had only about $10,000 for advertising, with spots running on two Portland radio stations starting last weekend.Theyve done a pretty good job of shutting everybody up, said Joshua K. Marquis, the district attorney in Clatsop County and an opponent of legalization, referring to the pro-91 forces.The pro-legalization campaigns in Oregon and Alaska are financed largely by national organizations. In Alaska, 84 percent of the $867,000 raised by legalization proponents at Yes on Ballot Measure 2 has come from the Marijuana Policy Project, a group based in Washington, D.C., with an advisory board that includes actors, musicians and politicians, including Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party candidate for president in 2012. Opponents to legalization in Alaska have raised only $97,000.In Oregon, the Drug Policy Alliance, based in New York and backed by the billionaire investor George Soros, has led the charge, contributing at least $780,000 this year, according to state records, making up about 35 percent of the cash raised by the main committee supporting legalization.Marijuana-related businesses or investors in Colorado, Washington and California have contributed at least $60,000. Contributors included O.penVAPE, a company based in Denver that sells products for consuming concentrates like hash oil; Privateer Holdings, a marijuana investment firm in Seattle; and Vicente Sederberg, which calls itself The Marijuana Law Firm.There has been some well-funded opposition to legalization, especially in Florida, where voters will decide whether to become the first state in the South to allow marijuana for certain medical uses. There, Sheldon G. Adelson, a casino executive from Las Vegas, has contributed $5 million to opponents of medical marijuana, about 86 percent of the total raised by the main committee fighting the legislation.But in Oregon, there has been no sugar daddy, as Mr. Marquis, the county prosecutor, put it. Opponents have raised only about $179,000.Initiative 71 in Washington, D.C., would allow residents to possess up to two ounces of marijuana for personal use and grow up to six cannabis plants at home. Measure 91 in Oregon would allow possession by adults of up to eight ounces of marijuana and four plants.Ballot Measure 2 in Alaska would allow adult possession of one ounce and six plants.Supporters of legalization in Oregon and Alaska said that money was crucial to overcoming what they say was years of incorrect information and distortion by law enforcement and antidrug groups about marijuanas risks.The opposition made good traction for 50 years, and it was built around locking people up. A massive industry was built around it, said Richard Branson, the entrepreneur who founded Virgin Group and a member of the Drug Policy Alliances international honorary board.Opponents said they were facing, for the first time, an emerging industrial complex.This is not about independent Alaskans smoking marijuana in their homes, but a commercialization and industrialization of an industry, said Charles Fedullo, a spokesman for Big Marijuana Big Mistake, which opposes Ballot Measure 2 in Alaska.Changes required for the meeting about marijuana and youth here in Keizer, opponents of legalization say, offers a case study in the tough new tactics of pro-legalization groups.A few weeks before the Marijuana and Our Youth meeting, legalization supporters pointed out to federal and state authorities that a small drug treatment center funded by government grants was sponsoring a tour of the state by Kevin A. Sabet, a co-founder of a national anti-legalization group, Smart Approaches to Marijuana. They reminded all parties that federal and state laws prohibited the use of public funds to influence elections.The State of Oregon agreed and issued a stern warning that any group receiving public money  a list that included 70 counties, tribes, schools and nonprofit agencies that provide drug treatment or substance-abuse prevention programs  had best tread carefully.The result was a sudden silence in the antidrug contingent and a muted meeting here in Keizer. Even though private funds were substituted to avoid the appearance of impropriety, talk of Measure 91, organizers said, was taken off the table out of concern for jobs and future government grants. A central constituency in the opposition, heavy on health care professionals, was stifled.Both sides said the new terrain offered a glimpse toward the next wave of states, notably California, where supporters are gearing up for a vote in 2016. But there are strange historical echoes, too. Alaska and Oregon were both pioneers of marijuana law in the 1970s. Oregons Legislature debated full legalization in 1973 and ended up passing the nations first law decriminalizing possession of small amounts. Alaskas Supreme Court held in 1975 that possession of marijuana in ones home was protected by constitutional privacy law.Whether the antidrug coalition of the past is dead or just sleeping, both sides agree that the old arguments no longer work.Todays parents are yesterdays children who were smoking marijuana and have personal experience, and, therefore, the kind of advertisement which shows fried eggs doesnt really cut it with them, Mr. Soros said in an interview this year. He was referring to an antidrug television campaign that showed a sizzling egg in a pan and the tagline, This is your brain on drugs.But the pressure is also on proponents, they say, not to fall short, because every new state is a kind of test case.If we win, I think it shows that public opinion has decisively changed  weve won in two election cycles, said Peter Zuckerman, a spokesman for New Approach Oregon, the main group supporting legalization. If we lose, I think it becomes much harder, he said. We have to maintain the momentum.Professor Sabet, of the department of psychiatry in the College of Medicine at the University of Florida, founded his anti-legalization group with Patrick J. Kennedy, a former Democratic congressman from Rhode Island. He said an interview that on the surface, the fight against legalization probably looks unwinnable here.It looks bad  I want to be on the other team, he said, laughing. Turning serious, Professor Sabet said that experiences in Washington and Colorado were exposing flaws in legal marijuana  from greater exposure to young people to questions of highway safety  that he thinks will turn off many voters, even though opponents of the ballot measures lack the money to shout their message.Legalization in practice has been the biggest enemy of legalization, he said.",2014-10-29,marijuana

He lied to agents when he could have helped. He concealed when he could have assisted, Carmen M. Ortiz, United States attorney for the district of Massachusetts, said Tuesday in a statement.The two other friends who were in Mr. Tsarnaevs dorm room  Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov  are awaiting sentencing on obstruction of justice charges.Mr. Philliposs defense was that he had not intentionally lied to F.B.I. agents  rather that he had smoked so much marijuana on the day the items were removed that he was unable to accurately answer their questions.Michael Dukakis, a former Massachusetts governor and the 1988 Democratic presidential nominee, testified on Mr. Philliposs behalf, saying he had been a longtime friend of the family.Mr. Phillipos, who was not accused of removing the items from the room, faces up to eight years in prison for each of the two counts. Lying to an F.B.I. agent usually carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison for each count, but the jury determined that he had lied during the course of a federal terrorism investigation. Sentencing has been scheduled for late January.Federal prosecutors say Mr. Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, planted two bombs on Boylston Street near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured. Mr. Tsarnaev was arrested three days later while his brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a shootout with the police. Mr. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to more than two dozen federal charges.",2014-10-29,marijuana

He was found not guilty of a fourth charge, attempted robbery in the first degree.The verdict came after a nearly monthlong trial in State Supreme Court in the Bronx, in which prosecutors played video and audio recordings of Officer Ramos plotting with a police informer in October and November 2009 to drive a van carrying heroin from the Bronx to Brooklyn for $10,000, and to steal money from a black-market electronics buyer and the hotel room of an out-of-town drug dealer.Officer Ramos, who did not testify at his trial, looked upset as the verdict was announced in a largely empty courtroom after less than a day of deliberation by the jury. Officer Ramos, who has been held in jail, had previously been suspended from the Police Department.Officer Ramoss lawyer, Matthew J. Kluger, patted him on the back in support. Later, outside court, Mr. Kluger said they would wait to hear the sentence before deciding whether to appeal. Mr. Ramos is disappointed with the narcotics charge, he said, but well regroup and figure out where to go.Officer Ramos is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 1 by Justice Michael A. Gross. He faces eight to 20 years in prison on the narcotics charge.The trial was just the beginning of a long court battle for Officer Ramos, the son of a police officer; he had been on the job for 17 years before his arrest. He faces additional charges in five other indictments, the most serious of which stem from an accusation in 2012 that he conspired with his wife to use money from his police pension to try to have a witness against him murdered.It was the investigation into Officer Ramos that exposed a routine practice among police officers to make traffic and parking tickets disappear for friends and relatives. The investigation eventually led to more than two dozen wiretaps and the indictments of 16 police officers, including Officer Ramos. Earlier this month, Lt. Jennara Cobb was the first officer to be tried. She was convicted by a judge of divulging information about the investigation in what prosecutors said was an effort to warn other officers.The investigation of Officer Ramos started with a tip in December 2008 that marijuana was being sold by a man who managed two barber shops owned by Officer Ramos in the 40th Precinct, in the South Bronx. The man, Lee King, also lived in Officer Ramoss apartment, drove his car and used his police-issued placard, prosecutors said.The police started listening to Mr. Kings cellphone, and later, to Officer Ramoss two cellphones. By fall 2009, they had enlisted an informer, Harry Mingo, who conspired with Officer Ramos to steal money from an out-of-town drug dealer and an electronics buyer, both of whom were in fact undercover police officers. They also met with a Miami drug dealer (also an undercover police officer), and later Officer Ramos drove a van for the supposed drug dealer from the Bronx to Brooklyn, prosecutors said.During the trial, Mr. Kluger repeatedly sought to discredit Mr. Mingo and to portray Officer Ramos to the jury as a police officer who had made mistakes but had never committed a crime. Mr. Kluger argued that Officer Ramos was repeatedly caught up in plots devised by internal police investigators and that he did not know that the van he drove was supposedly carrying narcotics.But Omer Wiczyk, the prosecutor, countered that there was simply overwhelming evidence against Officer Ramos that showed, time and again, that he had been all too willing to illegally profit from his badge and connections. That man is guilty, Mr. Wiczyk told jurors on Friday. The law applies to everyone equally. Apply it here. Convict him.In a statement, the Bronx district attorney, Robert T. Johnson, said Officer Ramos clearly shunted to the side the duty he has to the people of New York City.",2014-10-28,marijuana

He was pronounced dead at New York Hospital Queens.The deadly encounter, in Flushing, echoed the brutal hatchet attack on Thursday in Jamaica, Queens. That attack left two officers wounded, one severely, and the suspect, described by the police as a self-radicalized extremist bent on killing officers, dead.There did not appear to be any political overtones to the confrontation early Sunday, which the police said stemmed from an effort to arrest the man, whose name was not immediately released.He first entered the emergency room at the hospital complaining of difficulty breathing sometime late Saturday or early Sunday.He was discharged around 2:30 a.m., the police said, but returned roughly an hour later with a kitchen knife and demanded syringes. He left without any violence, the police said, and hospital workers called 911.After reviewing hospital video footage, four uniformed officers, including a sergeant, began searching for him in an area around Kissena Boulevard. Around 8:20 a.m., the officers believed they spotted the man near Ash Avenue.The officers split up and intercepted him on a pedestrian path, the police said. There, the man, knife in hand, and two officers confronted one other; one fired. He was taken back to the hospital where he had been twice before.A kitchen knife was found in the mans right front pocket, the police said.The police said the man had two arrests last year: He was accused of stealing three Xbox games from a store, and he was charged with weapons possession for having a switchblade and tear gas in a local laundromat.In an unrelated episode hours earlier, a 22-year-old woman died at a police precinct station house in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, after what the police described as an apparent seizure. The woman, Jasmine Lawrence of the Bronx, had been arrested with two men around 8 p.m. Saturday on charges of selling marijuana on Bedford Avenue near Dean Street.No force was used in her arrest, the police said, and she did not request medical attention. She was placed alone in a holding cell, to separate her from the male arrestees, the police said.Just before midnight, she appeared to have a seizure, the police said. An ambulance arrived in seven minutes. About an hour later, she was pronounced dead at Woodhull Medical Center. The cause of death had yet to be determined by the New York City medical examiner.",2014-10-27,marijuana

Under President Jos Mujica, who cannot run for re-election this year, it has won approval of laws legalizing marijuana, same-sex marriage and abortion.But Luis Lacalle Pou, 41, a leader of the conservative National Party, has mounted a strong challenge to Mr. Vzquez. Mr. Lacalle Pou, a lawyer and a son of a president of Uruguay in the 1990s, is vowing to scale back plans for the government to take the leading role in growing and selling marijuana, while also focusing on worries over rising crime and quality of schools.Before the race began, security and education had emerged as two important concerns, said Rosario Queirolo, a professor of political science at Catholic University in Montevideo. Voters are looking to issues beyond economic demands.Mr. Mujica, 79, has presided over robust growth during his five-year term while lifting Uruguays international profile. Although Mr. Mujica retains high approval ratings, big parts of the population are resistant to his social changes. Uruguay allows re-election for presidents only after intervening terms.Though Uruguay remains one of Latin Americas safest nations, an increase in violent crime has rattled many residents. In addition to the voting for president and legislators, Uruguayans also voted Sunday in a plebiscite to determine whether the age at which someone can be criminally charged as an adult should be lowered to 16 from 18.We see too much aggressiveness in the streets, said Susana Rodrguez, 66, a pensioner who supports Mr. Lacalle Pou. Crime is getting out of control.Official results in the election were not expected to be released until after Sunday.Mr. Vzquez, a doctor and a moderate leftist who was president from 2005 to 2010, also signaled during the race that he was open to watering down Uruguays marijuana law, which was approved last year. He has also expressed opposition to the legalization of first-trimester abortions, which was approved in 2012, and vetoed similar legislation as president in 2008.Still, for many voters the election came down to a choice between supporting continuity for the governing Broad Front, or a shift toward more conservative policies. Some drew comparisons between Mr. Lacalle Pou and his father, who unsuccessfully sought to privatize state-controlled companies in the 1990s.I think hell bring back the same policies as his father, looking after large economic interests without worrying about those at the bottom, said Manuel Vila, 67, of Montevideo.",2014-10-27,marijuana

The foot soldiers in the battle for control of the Senate come well armed. With data-infused smartphones and tablets in hand, they have an unprecedented amount of information about the potential voters they are trying to persuade and more money than ever in a midterm election to do it.This fusion of old-school door knocking and an overlay of data analytics has been changing elections for at least three cycles, but each advance builds on its predecessor with voters largely unaware why the canvassers know so much about them.So now, even before Emma Benson, a field director for the conservative political organization Americans for Prosperity, knocks on a door, she has more than 700 data points about the person behind it, like magazine subscriptions, car ownership (make, model, year), propensity for voting, and likes and dislikes mined from Facebook and Twitter, from rock bands to baseball teams. All fodder for her pitch for voters to throw out Senator Kay Hagan, a Democrat.With the political tide against them, Democrats last chance to hold their Senate majority comes down to a vigorous get-out-the-vote effort. But the fight has changed. Republicans, outflanked by a superior Democratic turnout operation in the past two presidential elections, have been spending tens of millions of dollars to improve data collection to achieve a rough parity.The left is still ahead on the ground  they just have more resources, said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, referring more to turnout muscle than to money. Yet the steeper climb is for Democrats, whose support among young, female and minority voters historically drops off in midterm elections. President Obamas approval ratings are hovering near all-time lows, and Republicans have successfully persuaded their core supporters that the election is a referendum on him.In few states has the ground game been as intense as in North Carolina, where Ms. Hagan is locked in a close race with Thom Tillis, a Republican. Maria Palmer, a Chapel Hill town councilwoman working a phone bank for Ms. Hagan, understands why, from her outreach to Hispanic voters. Many of them were not planning on voting, said Ms. Palmer, who is from Peru. Theyre angry there has been no immigration reform. Theyre angry with a lot of things.Some of the grass-roots campaign efforts have an underground dimension. Mysterious fliers with a grainy image of a lynching have appeared in black neighborhoods, warning voters that if Ms. Hagan loses, Mr. Obama will be impeached. A conservative group is running online ads to draw young voters away from Ms. Hagan and to the Libertarian candidate, Sean Haugh; the ads say, Get Haugh, get high, promoting his position to legalize marijuana.And if voters are confused about who exactly is trying to get them to the polls, there is good reason. Americans for Prosperity on the right and Planned Parenthood, labor-backed Working America and the League of Conservation Voters, among others, on the left are augmenting the robust efforts by the campaigns and the parties themselves.Americans for Prosperity, financed by the billionaire brothers David H. and Charles G. Koch, is the most significant player on the Republican side, providing far more clout than either Mr. Tillis or the Republican Party.As far as large-scale, smart operations, nobody on our side compares, said Donald Bryson, Americans for Prosperitys North Carolina director.For all the labor and money spent on turnout, dividends often pay out in the margins, affecting only a few percentage points, but can swing a close election.On Wednesday, Seth Noble went door to door on Penny Lane in Cary with a brief soft sell. Would you take a two-question survey? Just two questions? Mr. Noble, 24, a North Carolina State University senior working for the North Carolina Republican Party, asked potential voters. Ms. Hagan or Mr. Tillis? Voting early or on Nov. 4?The night before in Chapel Hill, Pat Wellington, a Hagan volunteer, worked her way through an online call sheet at a campaign phone bank. I really do think the best thing to do is vote early, because if you wait until Election Day, Im afraid its going to be very busy, she told a likely Hagan voter, before reminding him of his neighborhood early voting location.Workers like Ms. Wellington and Mr. Noble are, in the end, critical to any ground campaign, no matter how sophisticated data collection and targeting models are, said Sasha Issenberg, author of The Victory Lab: The Secret Science of Winning Campaigns.The great irony of the modern ground game is its this meeting of incredibly modern analytics and data married to very old-fashioned delivery devices, he said. Its people knocking on doors; its people making phone calls out of phone banks; but the calculations that are determining which door and which phone are different.Democratic strategists concede they have to do it better than Republicans, given the anger at the president.Theres a lot more fluidity to the Democratic voting base than the Republican one, said Mitch Stewart, who ran turnout operations for Mr. Obamas campaigns.The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ramped up its commitment, creating the Bannock Street project,"" a multimillion dollar, data-driven effort to persuade, register and turn out voters.The easiest way to look at it is our strategy to winning is expanding the voting universe, said Preston Elliott, Hagans campaign manager, in an interview in his Greensboro office. Its a little more machineish than just catching a wave and riding momentum.Republicans say they are catching up. In Raleigh, campaign workers and volunteers showed off a new smartphone app that helps canvassers target their door knocks. But Republican officials refused to reveal volunteer numbers, paid staff totals, field office locations or a tabulation of voter contacts. Nor would they allow reporters to recount the phone-bank pitch, the secret sauce, as they called it.Democratic groups are also using smartphone technology to make canvassing more efficient. On a Monday night in Durham, Ekundayo Akinloye, a field manager for Working America, the community arm of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., walked in an upscale neighborhood. An iPhone app helped her choose which doors to knock, with a goal of 20 to 30 an hour, and as well as a dozen IDs  a voters key issue and which candidate he or she is likely to support.When one voter cited her top concern as womens rights, womens rights, womens rights, Ms. Akinloye immediately put the information into her phone, and it was sent to headquarters to refine targeting.The Hagan campaign said that through its coordinated effort, Forward North Carolina, it has more than 40 offices throughout the state, a paid staff of more than 100 and roughly 10,000 volunteers knocking on doors. By constantly refining its universe of potential voters with real-time data, Mr. Elliott said, the Hagan team has also been able to identify some folks who looked like Republicans, but when we modeled them some more, we saw they were a little more movable.Americans for Prosperity, in contrast, has 47 paid staff members in the state, up from nine in 2012, said Mr. Bryson, the groups state director.Planned Parenthood, while it is not allowed to coordinate directly with the Hagan campaign, is also aiding the effort here through its political arm, Planned Parenthood Votes.As part of its catch-and-release program, it is calling voters and recording them talking about why voting is important. Building on research that shows holding voters accountable for their own promises can increase the likelihood a voter will show up to the polls, Planned Parenthood Votes is planning to call the voters back on Election Day and the day before and play their message to them, reminding them why voting matters.In Cary, Mr. Noble was undeterred by the occasional slammed door. Bob Hays reluctantly agreed to take his two-question survey and declared himself undecided in the Senate race.That one is up in the air for me right now, he said. Thom Tillis and Kay Hagan have really been taking some shots at each other. Its gotten ruthless.Maybe, he added, Ms. Hagan has annoyed me more.That seemed like an invitation to press the Republican case. Mr. Noble instead gingerly handed over a Republican door hanger and moved on.",2014-10-26,marijuana
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/world/americas/ottawa-canada-gunmans-radicalism-deepened-as-life-crumbled.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/26/nyregion/25GUNMAN-sub/25GUNMAN-sub-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg,Ottawa Gunmans Radicalism Deepened as Life Crumbled,"Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was troubled and unstable, and he initially may have sought religion as an attempt to scaffold a disintegrating life.","OTTAWA  A loner. A drug addict. A criminal. A drifter. And lately, an Islamic radical.Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the bearded, 32-year-old gunman who was shot dead Wednesday after killing a soldier and storming Canadas Parliament, aptly fit each of those descriptions. In the tumultuous wake of what Canadas prime minister has called a terrorist act, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeaus radicalism has become the defining one.But a closer examination of his past draws a somewhat different portrait: one of an increasingly troubled, mentally unstable man who initially may have embraced religion not as a political cause, but as an attempt to scaffold a disintegrating life.Much remains unknown about the assault, including how Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau, a convicted criminal, managed to acquire the single-action Winchester deer-hunting rifle he used in the attack, killing a ceremonial guard, Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, at the National War Memorial and leaving three people in the national parliamentary complex lightly injured. Investigators have said they do not know whether he acted spontaneously or deliberately, or why.The law enforcement authorities also say they have yet to find anyone who assisted Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau. And on Thursday, the commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police suggested that his principal motivation was frustration over his failure to secure a passport, apparently so he could join Islamist fighters in Syria.Indeed, a counselor at a Vancouver Salvation Army shelter, Paul Jarjapka, said Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau had told him as much before setting off to Ottawa last month. Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau had become exasperated over passport issues, he said in an interview, adding that his understanding was that he was going to address that.That would fit an emerging pattern of terrorist acts not just in Canada, but throughout the West: homegrown zealots, often disaffected young men who have embraced radical Islam and act alone, or without evidence of direct aid from foreign jihadist groups. One such act occurred on Monday, when a 25-year-old man who had recently adopted radical Islam ran over two Canadian soldiers near Montreal, killing one. On Thursday, another attack bearing similar characteristics occurred in Queens, when a man attacked two police officers with a hatchet.One analyst of terrorism and intelligence, Wesley Wark of the University of Ottawas Graduate School of Public and International affairs, said he believed the terrorist threat posed by Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau had been politically overblown. But the proliferation of homegrown terrorism is, for now, a more pressing danger than the threat of attacks by foreign groups, he added. Weve been forced to recalibrate and rethink.Prime Minister Stephen Harper has asserted that Mondays automobile attack in Quebec was inspired by calls from the Islamic State to kill Canadians and foreigners from other nations battling the movements advance in Syria and Iraq. While that remains unproven, some analysts say the group has deftly seized on the attacks to make it appear as if they have cadres of supporters abroad without having built an infrastructure to support them.The Al Qaeda fan boys never did this, definitely not in so coordinated a fashion in so close a time, said Will McCants, a scholar of Islamist militancy at the Brookings Institution. Al Qaedas constant calls for Muslims in the West to instigate their own attacks fell on deaf ears but the ISIS guys are just really energized, said Mr. McCants, using a common acronym for the group that now calls itself the Islamic State.Since the Western-led airstrikes began in Iraq and Syria, the Islamic States social media message to Muslims living in the West has changed sharply, from come join the attack to we are being attacked and what are you doing? You are just sitting there! said Mokhtar Awad, a researcher at the liberal Center for American Progress in Washington who was visiting Cairo.They are trying to shame Muslims, he said. If you cant join us over here, at least do what you can over there.Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau appears to have come to Ottawa this month to get the papers he needed to travel to Syria, where Islamic State forces are deeply involved in that nations civil war. Besides seeking a Canadian passport to leave the country, Canadian news organizations reported on Friday, he sought unsuccessfully to renew an expired Libyan passport that could have enabled him to travel in the Middle East.Details of Mr. Zehaf-Bibeaus life are hard to come by. But his radicalism seems only to have strengthened as his grip on ordinary life grew weak. And his hold appears to have begun to slip in the late 1990s, when his family fell apart.Mr. Zehaf-Bibeaus parents are from starkly different backgrounds: His father, Bulgasem Zehaf, was born in Tripoli, Libya, in 1955, according to court records, and had been married and divorced. It is not clear when he arrived in Canada, but for about a decade, he ran a cafe  named after the city of his birth  on a street near McGill University in downtown Montreal.Mr. Zehaf-Bibeaus mother, Susan Bibeau, was born in Montreal in 1961, and gave birth to her son in 1982 in Laval, a Montreal suburb. His parents married when he was 6. His early years were so unremarkable that the headmaster of his private high school, College Laval, was unable to remember him even after consulting yearbooks.He was a student without a history, said the headmaster, Michel Baillargeon. He would not stand out.That would soon change. In late 1998, Mr. Zehaf filed for divorce from Ms. Bibeau, citing adultery, and they divorced in 1999. Ms. Bibeau was granted primary custody of Michael, then about 16, living in their Laval home. A neighbor recalled that the son was always throwing wild parties at night.Michael Zehaf-Bibeau transferred to a public high school. His yearbook photograph shows a smiling, heavy-lidded young man with a wisp of a mustache and hair parted in the middle.It was around that time that he began to have run-ins with the law.From 2001 to 2005, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau was arrested repeatedly: for stealing a credit card, for marijuana possession, for driving under the influence. He was sentenced to two years in prison for possessing a weapon related to a robbery, and served nine months, only to be arrested again and sent to jail for 60 days for possessing marijuana and PCP.In 2007, he traveled to Libya, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported on Friday, using a Libyan passport he had acquired in 2000 by virtue of his fathers citizenship. Sometime after returning, he left Montreal and headed west; Ms. Bibeau, the deputy chairwoman of the immigration division of the Refugee and Immigration Board of Canada, said in a statement that until last week, she had not seen her son in five years.He drifted to a tunnel-drilling job in British Columbia, then to a one-room flat in Burnaby, a suburb of Vancouver. By 2011, he had converted to Islam and was praying at the Masjid al-Salaam and Education Center, an impressive mosque known for its community outreach programs involving Muslims and non-Muslims alike.Yet he did not remain there long. He didnt like the constant presence of non-Muslims there, said Aasim Rashid, a spokesman for the British Columbia Muslim Association. He thought it should be just Muslims. Mosque leaders suggested that he pray elsewhere, and he left  but returned and somehow entered the mosque at night to sleep.The mosques leaders changed the locks.Mr. Zehaf-Bibeaus life was crumbling, and he responded with an odd act of desperation: in December 2011, he walked into a police station in Burnaby and said he had committed armed robbery in Montreal a decade earlier, and wanted to be jailed. The police could find no record of the robbery, and turned him away.The next night, he tried to rob a McDonalds restaurant with a sharpened stick. When the police were summoned, he sat outside to wait for them. Im a crack addict, he told a judge, according to a court transcript, and at the same time Im a religious person, and I want to sacrifice freedom and good things for a year maybe, so when I come out Ill appreciate things in life more and be clean.Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau spent 66 days in jail, in part because he threatened to commit more crimes if released, but a psychiatric examination pronounced him fit and not certifiable, a prosecutor said in court.In recent years, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau regularly found refuge at the Beacon, a shelter in Vancouver run by the Salvation Army. Mr. Jarjapka, the counselor at the charitys shelters, said he spoke with him often, and described him as immersed both in his faith and in a pitched struggle with addiction.He was doing heroin to take the edge off the crack, he said.Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau spoke constantly of his frustration with the involvement of the United States in the Middle East, Mr. Jarjapka said, and the two feuded regularly over his support for the Islamic State. His arguments were extreme  American bombing in Syria was the moral equivalent of bombing a loaded school bus in the United States, he told Mr. Jarjapka  but they were not delusional.His viewpoint was bizarre, he said. The guy was not deranged. He was articulate. He was intelligent. His rationale was warped.Mr. Jarjapka said he last saw Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau about three weeks ago, when he appeared at the shelters front desk with his bags packed.He said Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau told him, Im hitchhiking back east.",2014-10-25,marijuana
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/opinion/no-progress-on-marijuana-arrests.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png,No Progress on Marijuana Arrests ,The de Blasio administration needs to really do something about the targeting of young black and Latino men.,"When he ran for mayor, Bill de Blasio condemned police practices under which young black and Latino men were unfairly  sometimes illegally  charged with possessing tiny amounts of marijuana, placing them at risk of losing jobs, access to housing or eligibility for military service even though such charges are often dismissed.His promise to address this problem was supported in minority communities that bear the brunt of this destructive policy. But a new analysis of state data shows that low-level marijuana arrests during the de Blasio administration have continued at roughly the same level as under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Thats not what the voters signed up for.Since 1977, state law has barred arrests for possession of trivial amounts of the drug unless it is being smoked or displayed in public. In 1990, there were fewer than 1,000 such arrests in New York City. Yet in 2011, that number had shot up to an astonishing 50,000.By then it was clear that police officers were illegally charging people with public possession by tricking them into removing the drug from their pockets during constitutionally questionable searches. Arrests for this misdemeanor dropped to 28,600 last year  still more than any city in the world  after Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly ordered officers to follow the law.Defense lawyers, however, say that defendants who have noncriminal amounts of marijuana are still being cuffed and taken to jail by officers who purposely seek out concealed amounts of marijuana. This week, for example, Jim Dwyer of The Times reviewed a case in which the occupants of a car were taken to jail for a marijuana pipe  containing only residue  that was allegedly in public view when cops riffled through the car and found it.The new analysis of state arrest data on people caught with tiny amounts of the drug, by the Marijuana Arrest Research Project and the Drug Policy Alliance, shows that between March and August this year, during the de Blasio administration, officers made 15,324 misdemeanor arrests under the statute that contains the public view provision  or about 500 more than in the comparable period in 2013, during the Bloomberg administration.Despite the common argument that such arrests take criminals off the streets, three-quarters of those arrested had no prior criminal conviction. The report notes that the people arrested for marijuana possession are not criminals; they are ordinary high school and college students and young workers who will be saddled with arrest records that colleges, employers, landlords, creditors and occupational licensing boards can easily find online.Race drives arrests, with black neighborhoods having arrest rates many times those of white neighborhoods with residents of the same class and income levels. Moreover, 86 percent of people arrested were black or Latino, despite data showing that whites and minorities use marijuana at similar rates. The report attributes the racial imbalance in arrests to the fact that police officers patrolling white neighborhoods typically do not search the vehicles and pockets of white citizens, thus allowing them to go about their lives without fear of arrest and incarceration.Mr. de Blasios team has produced contrived numbers in an unpersuasive attempt to prove that the arrest picture is somewhat improved. But theres no hiding the fact that New York City is still administering unfair police practices that disproportionately penalize communities of color and damage the lives of the overwhelmingly young people who are targeted. Public anger around this issue will continue to grow until Mr. de Blasio changes the very ugly status quo.",2014-10-25,marijuana

Getting a nice text from dad, whos away on a trip. Then suddenly  dark shadow on a window. Somebodys smashing the front door open! Next thing you know, theres police tape around the house, blinking lights on emergency vehicles.It happens like that, says a somber narrator. The police cant get there in time. How you defend yourself is up to you. Its your choice. But Mary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights. Vote like your safety depends on it. Defend your freedom. Defeat Mary Landrieu.Guns are a big issue in some of the hottest elections around the country this year, but there hasnt been much national discussion about it. Perhaps weve been too busy worrying whether terrorists are infecting themselves with Ebola and sneaking across the Mexican border.But now, as usual, were returning to the issue because of a terrible school shooting.The latest  a high school freshman boy with a gun in the schools cafeteria  occurred in the state of Washington, which also happens to be ground zero for the election-year gun debate. At least thats the way the movement against gun violence sees it. Theres a voter initiative on the ballot that would require background checks for gun sales at gun shows or online. We need to be laser focused on getting this policy passed, said Brian Malte of the Brady Campaign.Think about this. Its really remarkable. Two years after the Sandy Hook tragedy, the top gun-control priority in the United States is still background checks. There is nothing controversial about the idea that people who buy guns should be screened to make sure they dont have a criminal record or serious mental illness. Americans favor it by huge majorities. Even gun owners support it. Yet were still struggling with it.The problem, of course, is the National Rifle Association, which does not actually represent gun owners nearly as ferociously as it represents gun sellers. The background check bill is on the ballot under voter initiative because the Washington State Legislature was too frightened of the N.R.A. to take it up. This in a state that managed to pass a right-to-die law, approve gay marriage and legalize the sale of marijuana.The N.R.A. has worked hard to cultivate its reputation for terrifying implacability. Lets return for a minute to Senator Mary Landrieu, whos in a very tough re-election race. Last year, in the wake of Sandy Hook, she voted for a watered-down background check bill. It failed to get the requisite 60 votes in the Senate, but the N.R.A. is not forgetting.Nor is it a fan of compromise. Landrieu has tried to straddle the middle on gun issues; she voted last year for the N.R.A.s own top priority, a bill to create an enormous loophole in concealed weapons laws. As a reward, she got a D rating and the murdered-mom ad. In Colorado, the embattled Senator Mark Udall, who has a similar voting record, is getting the same treatment.The N.R.A.s vision of the world is purposefully dark and utterly irrational. Its been running a series of what it regards as positive ads, which are so grim they do suggest that its time to grab a rifle and head for the bunker. In one, a mournful-looking woman asks whether theres still anything worth fighting for in a world that demands we submit, succumb, and believe in nothing. It is, she continues, a world full of cowards who pretend they dont notice the elderly man fall ...Now when was the last time you saw people ignore an elderly man who falls down? I live in what is supposed to be a hard-hearted city, but when an old person trips and hits the ground, there is a veritable stampede to get him upright.The ad running against people like Landrieu makes no sense whatsoever. If that background-check bill had become law, the doomed mother would still have been able to buy a gun for protection unless she happened to be a convicted felon. And while we have many, many, many things to worry about these days, the prospect of an armed stranger breaking through the front door and murdering the family is not high on the list. Unless the intruder was actually a former abusive spouse or boyfriend, in which case a background check would have been extremely helpful in keeping him unarmed.A shooting like the one in Washington State is so shocking that it seems almost improper to suggest that people respond by passing an extremely mild gun control measure.

But when he got to the question on the job application  Have you ever been convicted of a crime?  he shifted nervously in his seat.If he checked the yes box, he would almost certainly not get the job as a hospital janitor.He checked the box.A moment later, a human resources employee looking over his shoulder told him not to bother with the rest of the form. She said I should stop right there, that there was no need to continue filling out the application because I was done with the process, he said.Mr. White, convicted of possessing a handgun without a license 10 years ago, is one of the 60,000 people with a criminal record who live in Washington, and who, along with the 8,000 city residents who are released from prison each year, have a difficult time finding decent jobs.To ease these residents re-entry into society, Washingtons City Council this summer approved legislation that forbids asking about criminal history on most job applications, a step being considered by Georgia, Michigan and New York, among other states.After more than 25 years of tough-on-crime laws and the incarceration of millions of low-level drug offenders, the effort is part of a bipartisan re-evaluation of the criminal justice system and reflects a growing concern that large numbers of people, especially African-Americans  who have been jailed disproportionately  remain marginalized from the work force and at greater risk of returning to crime.The reappraisal, joined by such conservative luminaries as Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, includes a movement to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana, endeavors to expunge the criminal records of nonviolent offenders and reassessing parole and probation rules so violators are not automatically reincarcerated.Theres been a shift in people away from wanting to get even, said Marc A. Levin, the policy director for Right on Crime, a conservative anti-crime group in Texas. People are focused now on getting results. It really is a great benefit to public safety if ex-offenders are able to get jobs, find places to live and get occupational licenses  whether its from the perspective of the ex-offender or those of us who are going to live next to them.With an estimated one in three American adults having been arrested at some point in their lives, and 16 million people  about 7.5 percent of the adult population  who are felons or former felons, the question of how to reintegrate the 700,000 people who are released from prison each year has become increasingly urgent.During the past several months, states and cities as varied as Illinois; Nebraska; New Jersey; Indianapolis; Louisville, Ky.; and New Orleans and have adopted so-called Ban the Box laws. In total, some 70 cities and 13 states have passed such laws  most in the past four years.The laws generally prohibit employers from asking applicants about criminal records as an initial step in the hiring process and from running criminal background checks until job seekers are considered serious candidates for an opening.Studies have found that ex-offenders, particularly African-Americans, are far less likely to be called back for job interviews if they check the criminal history box on applications, even though research has shown that those possessing a criminal record are no more apt to commit a crime in the workplace than colleagues who have never been convicted.Still, most of the Ban the Box laws have been enacted so recently that there is little conclusive evidence that they reduce recidivism or unemployment among ex-offenders. Surveys conducted in Minneapolis and Durham, N.C., after those cities passed laws showed that fewer job applicants had been rejected for public sector work because of a criminal conviction.Ex-offenders, who have been at the fore in pushing for the laws, say preventing employers from inquiring about their criminal pasts in first interviews is critical in removing prejudices against them that make it tough to get work, find a place to live, regain their voting rights, receive federal student aid or obtain professional licenses.Marilyn Scales, 52, a New York City resident convicted of selling drugs in the 1990s, said telling the truth on job forms had made her virtually unemployable, even though she was released from prison 17 years ago.When I answer that question honestly, I never get a call back, she said. I feel like Im still paying for my crimes 20 years later.But researchers say Ban the Box laws and other reform measures have gained popularity with lawmakers because of fiscal constraints as much as a desire to aid ex-offenders.Cities and states emerging from the recession are being forced to cut corrections costs  which total more than $52 billion annually  and have begun to focus on reducing prison populations by discouraging recidivism.The changes come as the United States continues to have the worlds largest prison population, even though crime is far below its 1990s levels, when illegal drugs ravaged urban neighborhoods.When a lot of these laws passed, there was anxiety about crack cocaine and black homicide rates and arguments that some criminals were super predators,  said Steven Raphael, a public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley. That was a powerful argument, especially for legislators, so a lot of the re-evaluation happening now has to do with the budgetary implications of prisons.While most Ban the Box legislation has covered only public employers, Washington, San Francisco, Minnesota and Massachusetts, among other cities and states, also have prohibited private workplaces from asking the criminal-history questions on introductory forms or in initial interviews. Several of the nations largest private employers, including Walmart, Target and Home Depot, have adopted the rules as well, the companies said.The laws still allow employers to conduct criminal background checks before making hires and to inquire about criminal histories, but not until after the first interview. The laws typically exempt hiring in law enforcement, schools and day care centers.And while federal law prohibits discrimination against job seekers based solely on criminal history, employers are permitted to deny jobs to ex-offenders if a crime is deemed to be directly related to the work  for example, if a person convicted of theft is applying to be a cashier.Many of those returning from prison to their old neighborhoods are African-American men, who have incarceration rates far higher than any other group  one in 12 African-American men of working age (18-64) are imprisoned, according to a 2010 Pew Charitable Trust study, compared with one in 87 working-age white men  a circumstance that has raised concerns about the creation of a permanent underclass of men and women freed from prison with little hope of ever finding work.If we are going to block their path and not give them options to reintegrate  if they cant get a job and the opportunity to earn a livelihood  what alternative do they have? said Jim Scheer, a Republican state senator from Nebraska who describes himself as tough on crime but was still an outspoken advocate of the states Ban the Box law, approved 46-to-0 in April.There have been assertions however that, paradoxically, the laws might encourage discrimination against minorities.If youre not going to allow somebody without a criminal record to say, I dont have a criminal record, the hiring officer can say, I bet this person has a criminal record, and Im not going to hire them,  said Adam T. Klein, an employment discrimination lawyer at Outten & Golden, a New York law firm.Jack Mozloom, a spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business, a lobbying group, said he was concerned that hiring decisions were being taken away from businesses.Does everybody deserve a second chance? Of course, Mr. Mozloom said. But its up to me as the guy taking the risk to decide that this person is worth taking the risk. The fact that they have a criminal record proves that at one point in their lives they werent trustworthy.Mr. White, the ex-offender now seeking janitorial work, said the Washington hospitals human resource officer had not asked him what he had been convicted of  or for any other details about his crime.She didnt know that I didnt have to serve time, Mr. White said. All she knew was that I checked the box, and as far as she was concerned, I didnt deserve a shot. I was somehow too dangerous to clean the floors.",2014-10-24,marijuana

The Parliament buildings, somber and gothic, push into the sky above the river. An expanse of green lawn slopes down to Wellington Street with its tourists and a hot dog vendor. The whole place would be imposing if the locals treated it with deference. But we dont.Theres no security stopping pedestrians from getting onto the hill. On any given day youre likely to find people on the lawn playing soccer or doing yoga. There are almost always protesters of some sort  usually polite and not that obtrusive. Activists calling for marijuana legalization occasionally gather to smoke pot.Ive always been proud of the relaxed feel of the place, its accessibility and, frankly, its lack of visible security. It fits with my ideal of a government that isnt separate from or above the people it serves. You dont see portraits of our prime minister in Canadian schools or public buildings, either. After all, hes not our head of state, and the government is Her Majestys; he merely runs it.On Wednesday, a gunman exploited this openness at the heart of Canadas democracy. After murdering the Canadian soldier Cpl. Nathan Cirillo at the nearby National War Memorial, he ran into the main Parliament building and was just outside members caucus rooms when he was shot dead.The attack occurred only two days after a man thought to be a radical Islamist used a car to run over Canadian soldiers in Quebec, killing Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent.Wednesdays gunman has been identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a 32-year-old Quebec man with a criminal record involving drugs and uttering threats. A Twitter account supportive of the Islamic State, the jihadist group rampaging through Syria and Iraq, published a photograph of him on Wednesday. According to a Globe and Mail report on Wednesday, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau had been designated a high-risk traveler by Canadian authorities who recently seized his passport. But police later stated the report was inaccurate and that he had not been identified as a security threat.The question is whether this attack is related to Canadas recent decision to join the international coalition against the Islamic State. In August, Canada committed special forces trainers and advisers, and ferried arms to Kurdish forces in northern Iraq. In September, an Islamic State spokesman then urged the groups supporters to attack Canadians.A spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper responded by saying, We will not be cowed by threats. This month, Canada escalated its intervention in Iraq to a combat mission, deploying six fighter jets, two refueling planes, a surveillance aircraft and support personnel.We dont know what motivated Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau to kill, and its risky to ascribe political or geostrategic motives to murder. I was recently in northern Iraq, where thousands have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced by the Islamic State because of their religion or ethnicity, rather than as an attempt to influence any countrys policy.But if Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau followed an extreme and perverted interpretation of Islam, its reasonable to wonder if Canadas participation in the combat mission in Iraq influenced him, whether he intended to punish Canada; to pressure it to withdraw from the coalition; to change the country he was attacking.If so, he miscalculated. Canadas combat mission is certainly politically divisive here. An Oct. 7 vote on it in the House of Commons split the governing Conservative Party from the opposition Liberals and New Democratic Party. But to say Canadians have mixed feelings about going to war in Iraq is different from claiming were easily scared.On Wednesday, the Canadian senator Jim Munson declared, Our days of innocence ended today.Im not sure how innocent Canada was before the attack. Its true weve avoided much of the domestic strife and terror that has afflicted so many other countries, including our closest friend and neighbor, the United States, and weve done so without draconian security measures. Our security services have thwarted attacks, and perhaps until now weve simply been fortunate. Our society, bilingual and multiethnic, is mostly at ease with itself.Weve also fought two devastating world wars and recently concluded a 12-year mission in Afghanistan that took the lives of 158 soldiers. Weve had a peaceful and functional democracy for 147 years. Theres luck involved. But theres also resilience.Yesterdays attack was tragic and obscene and yet far too puny to fundamentally rattle this country. Mr. Harper made it clear that the attack would not blunt Canadas antiterrorism efforts abroad. It will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts to work with our allies around the world and fight against the terrorist organizations who brutalize those in other countries with the hope of bringing their savagery to our shores, he said. Canadian members of Parliament will continue to debate the merits of military intervention in Iraq, and other foreign policies, based on their perceptions of whats best for Canada, and what we can and should do abroad. Yesterdays attack wont change that.As for Parliament Hill, it and downtown Ottawa had a far less placid atmosphere Wednesday. There were hundreds of armed men and women, dogs, sirens and, briefly, the faint smell of gunpowder. And yet the police were professional and respectful. Onlookers were calm. The hill may never fully return to what it was before, but I hope it comes close. Locked gates would seem out of place here.Oct. 24, 2014: This opinion article has been updated to reflect the news.",2014-10-24,marijuana

Its especially hard when you are living with schizophrenia and think everyone is making fun of you.,"I have a hard time making friends. Getting to trust people well enough to call them a friend takes a lot of work. Its especially hard when you are living with schizophrenia and think everyone is making fun of you. Schizophrenia is the devil on your shoulder that keeps whispering in your ear and, no matter what you try, the little demon wont stop. He hasnt stopped in the almost nine years Ive lived with the illness, and hes not about to stop now. Hes just quieted down a bit. Id call him my companion but that would imply a degree of friendship, and theres no way in hell Im the little devils friend. I have plenty of acquaintances, and a couple hundred friends on Facebook. But real friends, mostly family, I can count on one hand. For me, making friends is like climbing a vertical rock wall with no ropes, requiring a degree of thrill-seeking, and a good deal of risk. For someone to be my friend, they have to accept that Im crazy, and even getting to the point of telling them that is daunting when all you hear is the devils whispering that theyre making snap judgments about you or will be going back to their real friends and laughing about you. But interestingly, in my efforts to make friends, coffee shops have helped. The simple routine of going to get your fix of liquid energy every day provides a sort of breeding ground for community. You see these people every day,whether you like it or not and, over time, friendships form.I used to live in a small town called Niwot, about five miles down the highway from Boulder, where I now live. Every morning around 6 I would go to Winot Coffee, the small independent coffee shop, and every morning, without fail, there was a guy my age sitting outside with his computer smoking clove cigarettes. Given the regularity of seeing him every morning, and given that we were some of the only 20-somethings in town, we got to talking. He was something of an intellectual, heavily involved with the writings of Noam Chomsky, foreign policy, our dependency on oil and the non-GMO food movement. And eventually, through our morning chats, we became friends. I told him about my struggles with mental illness, and he told me about the history of the conflict in the Middle East. He seemed trustworthy, though I could never be sure,, and I never could shake the notion he was judging me as stupid, or simple. I went over to his house for the first time one evening and found it piled floor to ceiling with strange books on metaphysics and Native American history. He lived in in a deep grove of trees and grew kale and marijuana in his backyard. We ate vegan pizza, and I met his girlfriend, who was 11 years older than him. One morning at the coffee shop he came to me for advice. He said he was having a hard time with anxiety, that he wasnt sure of anything anymore. We talked for several hours that morning, exploring the nuances of our anxiety. I shared with him my irrational fear that people were speculating about my virginity, and he told me about his overarching feeling that the world was collapsing in around him. I think it was too much, because the next day at the coffee shop he wasnt there, and I never saw him again. Sometimes being too vulnerable can throw someone off. It was like we had stepped over a line where the friendship got too deep. There are others, though, who have made it into my inner circle and stuck around. Id be nothing without their ever-constant ear and their sometimes dark humor that can bring a smile to my face when I want nothing else but to curl up in bed. I have one friend, Brianna, who has seen me at my worst. I met her a few years ago when I was sitting outside a coffee shop writing in a journal and she waved at me and came over and asked me what I was writing. I was skeptical at first, seeing her blue hair and the wild look in her eyes. I told her what I was writing was nothing, but then she started asking me questions, and before I knew it two hours had passed and she knew that I had been diagnosed schizophrenic after a trip to the U.N. where I thought I was a prophet and was trying to save the world. It seemed like every time I went to that coffee shop she was there, and it was nice to have someone to sit with and to talk with. She and I are vastly different people. We dont listen to the same music: shes into early British punk, hardcore stuff, and Im on the mellower side, preferring Dave Matthews or Blues Traveler. Shes a fervent anarchist and Im, again, mellower, taking no sides but believing that everyone should treat each other kindly. There are times when her quirkiness really gets on my nerves, like when she tells me her stories about magic and fairies, or getting drunk with bikers, and theres just no way I can relate. She lived in a shack with her boyfriend without water and electricity in the Texas desert for several years and traveled the country selling coffee for an independent coffee shop. Shes so caring, though, and describes herself as a demon wrangler, working with violent people in mental hospitals and prisons, talking them down from suicide and putting themselves in danger. Six years on, shes done the same for me. Shes stuck around despite my delusions that people are out to get me, and shes asked me out for coffee during some pretty deep periods of depression. I wouldnt be as nearly as stable as I am today without her. Somehow we get along.  Im grateful to have her  and a few others, out of the thousands of people Ive met. Because without them, theres a good chance Id still be out in the streets, thinking I was a prophet and talking about aliens and the coming apocalypse. You only really need one or two good friends anyway. Michael Hedrick is a writer in Boulder, Colo.

(It was the longest of the seven.)Attendees claimed they had repelled rain by praying to the actor Joe Pesci, as Mr. Carlin once said he had, reasoning that Mr. Pesci looks like a guy who can get things done.And when the crowd had mostly cleared, Mr. Carlins older brother, Patrick, 83, crossed Morningside Drive with a family friend from the neighborhood  where the Carlin family had lived  settled into a familiar perch beneath a tree and smoked marijuana, just off George Carlin Way.This, the elder Carlin said, lifting a joint to his lips, is how you honor George Carlin.For the last three years, honoring George Carlin has proved exceedingly complicated. The push to rename a block after him, led by a local comedian, Kevin Bartini, stalled amid protests from Mr. Carlins former school and Catholic parish on West 121st Street, Corpus Christi Church. Leaders argued that the comedians vulgarity and remarks about the Catholic Church made him a problematic role model.Last summer, it seemed that a compromise had been reached. Mr. Carlins name would appear on one block, the one between Amsterdam Avenue and Morningside Drive, excluding the church. But because of a clerical error, a bill signed into law in July declared a two-block stretch, church and all, as Mr. Carlins.Aides to Councilman Mark D. Levine, the intermittently profane lawmaker who represents the neighborhood, said the mistake would be corrected in December. No signs will be placed on the churchs block in the meantime.In an interview Wednesday, the parishs pastor, the Rev. Daniel OReilly, said the church was at peace with the arrangement.Mr. Bartini noted that the sign would stand about 75 feet to the right of where we wanted it.So the children are safe, he added.In a ceremony led by Mr. Carlins daughter, Kelly, friends, relatives and fans recalled a more nuanced relationship between Mr. Carlin and the church of his youth. Sally Wade, Mr. Carlins companion for several years before his death in 2008, said he kept in touch with a handful of nuns for the rest of his life.They would send him books of poetry, she said, her voice breaking.Despite his frequent jabs at religion (I used to be Irish Catholic. Now Im an American), Mr. Carlin first tested material on classmates and clergy members at the school, and credited it with helping him learn to think independently. They gave me the tools, he said in 1995, to reject my faith.",2014-10-23,marijuana

An indictment against him was unsealed the same day.","MEXICO CITY   They have gone down with guns blazing on country roads and in opulent mansions, more quietly while sleeping in seaside condominiums and even, most recently, while dining in fine restaurants. But their downfalls have almost always occurred in Mexico.Now comes the arrest of a man whom the authorities in Mexico and the United States describe as the leader of a major drug trafficking gang  while he was shopping in Texas.Juan Francisco Senz-Tamez, 23, who American officials said led the Gulf Cartel after clawing his way to the top only last year, was arrested Oct. 9 while shopping in Edinburg, Tex., just over the border from Reynosa, Mexico, a violent industrial city that was his base, the officials said. A 2013 indictment charging him with conspiring to traffic cocaine and marijuana into the United States and launder millions of dollars there was unsealed Tuesday in Federal District Court in Beaumont, Tex.Crime analysts said it was unusual for suspected organized crime leaders from Mexico to be apprehended in the United States, although they are believed to visit just like thousands of law-abiding Mexicans.They move back and forth across the border like shuttlecocks, said George W. Grayson, a professor at the College of William & Mary who studies drug trafficking groups.Mr. Senz-Tamezs youth also struck experts as unusual. Most leaders of drug cartels have years, if not decades, of experience before claiming the throne. But Michele M. Leonhart, the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, said in a statement that he had taken control of the operation last year after the arrest of Mario Ramirez-Trevio in Mexico.Ms. Leonhart said he had moved quickly, if steadily, up the ranks, from lookout to regional boss and, finally, its leader.Still, his name was not well known among those who follow the Mexican underworld, and determining the top leadership can be a dicey proposition in such a cutthroat, secretive business.Few details of the arrest were released, including precisely where Mr. Senz-Tamez was shopping. Neither Drug Enforcement Administration officials nor his lawyer, Crispin Quintanilla, answered messages.Mexican government officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had not received permission from superiors to speak publicly, said the arrest had come as a result of information that they and Interpol had exchanged with the Americans, including data to help identify Mr. Senz-Tamez.His detention followed a string of arrests and killings of leaders of the major drug trafficking organizations by law enforcement in Mexico and the United States.The leadership struggles have also resulted in splintering of the gangs, which has often led to violent power struggles and a scramble for new sources of revenue, like extortion and kidnapping. Tamaulipas State, where Reynosa is, has been one of Mexicos most violent in recent years, with a string of lethal shootouts, abductions and other crimes.The gangs are every day more fragmented, said Steven S. Dudley, a director of InsightCrime.org, which tracks Latin American crime. In principle, this is what the government wants, but in places like Tamaulipas, this has not resulted in less violence. In fact, this process has contributed to making the state one of the most violent in Mexico.",2014-10-22,marijuana

Rick Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist illustrated just how diametrically opposed the two men are stylistically and on almost every issue.,"MIAMI   By the time the heated governor versus governor debate in Florida ended Tuesday night, it was clear no man had a fan.The debate between Gov. Rick Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist live on CNN (which barred all fans) illustrated just how diametrically opposed the two men are stylistically and on almost every issue: the minimum wage, climate change, immigration, Cuba and medical marijuana.But it also exposed the extreme hostility the two men appear to have for each other in a race that still has them neck and neck despite a long, costly barrage of negative advertising. That animosity came to the fore last week after a disagreement over Mr. Crists fan kept Mr. Scott offstage for seven minutes during the second debate.Tuesdays face-off focused mostly on Floridas economy, and the two men argued sharply, in large part, about money: which candidate has too much or once had too much, who was unethical about making it or accepting it, and whether Floridians in low-wage jobs deserve more of it. The back-and-forth between the men, each flashing his average-guy credentials, was meant to score points with middle-class voters.Mr. Crist, now a Democrat, accused Mr. Scott, a multimillionaire Republican, of being too rich to connect with people in his private jet and his oceanfront mansion. And he jabbed at Mr. Scott, saying the way the governor made his money was pretty unsavory. The reference was to ColumbiaHCA, the health care company Mr. Scott once headed, which was found guilty of Medicare fraud.But Mr. Scott shot back, saying that unlike Mr. Crist, he was raised by a mother with little money and watched as his family lost its car and struggled to put food on the table and buy Christmas presents.Charlie never went through that, Mr. Scott said. He never had to worry about money. Earlier, he derided Mr. Crist, who was a Republican as governor and recently became a Democrat, as someone whose principles are based on political expediency, not honesty.Mr. Crist snapped back, We lived in a small apartment in Atlanta when my father was going to medical school, adding that his father delivered newspapers to make ends meet. You dont know me, and you cant tell my story.The hourlong debate, moderated by Jake Tapper, went on to touch on the major issues confronting voters. Foremost was job creation, an important issue in a state that was among the hardest hit during the recession.Repeating his campaign-trail mantra, Mr. Scott reminded voters that since taking office in 2011 he has created more than 650,000 jobs. Under Mr. Crist, the governor said, more than 800,000 jobs were lost in the state. This state is now on a roll, Mr. Scott said.But Mr. Crist quickly pointed out that as governor from 2007 to 2011 he had little control over a recession that walloped the United States and the rest of the country. Florida suffered greatly because of the implosion of the real estate market, he said.I was not responsible for the global economic meltdown any more than Rick was responsible for the national economic recovery, Mr. Crist said.Mr. Crist has been a forceful proponent of raising the minimum wage in Florida to $10.10, arguing that nobody can make a living on the current wage, $7.93. Asked about the possibility that a raise could cost Florida thousands of jobs, Mr. Crist said it would be unfair not to increase it.People deserve it, Mr. Crist said. How can somebody get by on $7.93 an hour?But Mr. Scott, who opposes an increase, said Mr. Crist, rather than raise the minimum wage when he served as governor, cut wages altogether because of job losses. How many more jobs can you lose? Mr. Scott asked. You should be known as a zero-wage governor.The two men also parted ways on a proposed constitutional amendment to permit medical marijuana in the state. Mr. Crist, whose law partner spearheaded the effort, is for it, and Mr. Scott opposes it. And they contradicted each other on Cuba, an important issue to many Cuban-American voters in South Florida. Mr. Crist seeks to lift the United States economic embargo, saying it has failed to work for five decades. Mr. Scott disagreed, calling the Castro brothers terrorists.Mr. Scott has come under fire for failing to acknowledge climate change, and he punted on a question about why he had taken that position.At the end, each man was asked what he wanted a do-over on. Mr. Scott said he wished he had more time to court more companies to come to Florida.Mr. Crist said, For me, its pretty obvious: the opportunity to serve you again as your governor.",2014-10-22,marijuana

By this years standards, thats pretty forthright, especially compared with Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democrat running for the Senate in Kentucky, who refuses to discuss her presidential vote.Only one Democratic Senate candidate this cycle has been willing to appear with the president on the stump: Gary Peters in Michigan. The others have spent months keeping their distance from Mr. Obama and some of his best policies. Even Ms. Nunn just started running a television ad complaining that an attack ad by her Republican opponent, David Perdue, featured a misleading photo of her and Mr. Obama. The photo was actually taken at an event honoring President George H.W. Bush, she said.The panicky Democratic flight away from President Obama  and from some of the partys most important positions  is not a surprise. Mr. Obama remains highly unpopular among white voters, particularly in Southern states where candidates like Ms. Nunn, Ms. Grimes and several others are struggling to establish leads. But one of the reasons for his unpopularity is that nervous members of his own party have done a poor job of defending his policies over the nearly six years of his presidency, allowing a Republican narrative of failure to take hold.Few voters know that the 2009 stimulus bill contributed heavily to the nations economic recovery, saving and creating 2.5 million jobs. Not a word of it is spoken on the campaign trail, where little credit is also given to the White House for months of promising economic news.Similarly, the Affordable Care Act, one of the most far-reaching and beneficial laws to have been passed by Congress in years, gets little respect even among the Democratic candidates who voted for it. Though none support the Republican position of repeal, most talk about the need to fix the health law, as if it were a wreck alongside the road rather than a vehicle providing millions of people with health coverage.When I think about the health care law, frustrated, disappointed, you can put a lot of words toward it, but every day I work to try to fix it, said Senator Mark Begich of Alaska, in a radio ad. (Mr. Begich voted for the law.) In a recent debate, Senator Kay Hagan, a Democrat of North Carolina, talked mostly about the common-sense fixes she wants to make to the law.Several Democratic candidates, including Ms. Hagan, Ms. Nunn, and Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas, quickly adopted the right-wing talking point that President Obama needs to impose a travel ban on all residents of African countries with Ebola cases, even though most public-health experts say such a ban would be ineffective and could make the situation worse.Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, who has fought loudly against the presidents energy policies, has scurried so far to the right that she even opposes legalizing marijuana for medical purposes, though her leading Republican opponent supports it.Many of these candidates are running in difficult political environments and are being careful about what they say or dont say in hopes of preserving Democratic control of the Senate. They run the risk, though, of alienating important constituencies who prefer a party with a spine, especially black voters, who remain very supportive of Mr. Obama. By not standing firmly for their own policies, Democrats send a message to voters that the unending Republican criticism of the president is legitimate. There is much that is going right in this country, and there is still time for Democrats to say so.",2014-10-22,marijuana

He immediately lost a job that he had held for seven years as a school bus driver. It had already cost him close to $7,000 in lost wages.For this account, Anthony, 28, asked that only his first name be used, because he has never before had any trouble with the police, and wants to go back to work.When Bill de Blasio was running for mayor last year, he noted that marijuana arrests, which fall most heavily on black and Latino males, have disastrous consequences, and pledged to curtail the practice of ratcheting up what should be a minor violation of the law into a misdemeanor.This week, a report showed that such arrests were continuing at about the same pace as last year; the de Blasio mayoralty had not appreciably changed the number of such cases. The Legal Aid Society has a roster of clients across the city who face misdemeanor charges for possession of minuscule amounts of pot because, it was charged, they were openly displaying it. About 75 percent of those charged had no prior criminal convictions, and more than 80 percent were black or Latino, according to the report, from the Marijuana Arrest Research Project and the Drug Policy Alliance.The case of Anthony, a black man, is a powerful illustration of how disruptive such a charge can be. On Aug. 16, he said, he was getting a ride to his home in Jamaica, Queens, after a few hours in a park. I wasnt even in the car 10 minutes, he said. We got pulled over on Sutphin and Rockaway Boulevard. They said it was a brake light. Asked for the usual, license and registration. Mind you, Im the passenger, Im not thinking about it.The driver was ordered out of the car and searched. Then Anthony was told to get out. A moment later, an officer rooted around in the car, he said, and both men were handcuffed.He said it was a weed pipe in the center console, Anthony said. I said: Why am I getting arrested? Im just the passenger.Anyone in a car where contraband is found can be charged with possession, said Marquita Johnson, a staff attorney with the Legal Aid Society who is representing Anthony.In a formal complaint, the officer said he recovered a marijuana pipe containing marijuana residue from the center console of said vehicle.Such a tiny amount of pot, if thats what was actually in the pipe, would normally be considered a violation. But it was elevated to a misdemeanor by the police officers statement that the pipe was in a public place open to public view.Perhaps that is true, though one wonders why anyone, being pulled over by the police, would not close a center console if the pot pipe really had been visible. Anthony insisted that he would never have gotten in the car had he known it was there.I dont involve myself around that, he said. Im a working citizen.The police officers issued the driver and Anthony desk appearance tickets, meaning they had to appear in court this week, more than two months after the stop.I come back to work that Monday, and they said, We got to let you go because youve been arrested and your fingerprints came back to us in Albany, Anthony said. They knew the date, the time. They said, Well give you your job back once you prove your innocence.Anthony puts his annual salary at about $40,000. By this week, when the case finally went to court, Anthony was out more than two months pay. The driver showed up and, in a quick negotiation, pleaded guilty to a traffic violation and agreed to pay a fine of $180. Since Anthony was not behind the wheel, he could not make the same deal.The district attorneys office offered to dismiss the case in a year if Anthony stayed out trouble. But that would mean a full year out of work. A new offer was made: dismissal after 90 days. That would still be an additional three months of out of work, on top of the two he had already lost. The case was adjourned.Asked Tuesday about the marijuana arrests, a spokesman for the mayor offered statistics that showed a slight decrease, as opposed to the slight increase in the report.But there was really no difference.Ive worked all my life, Anthony said. This is hard to get used to.",2014-10-22,marijuana

Hang a High Times centerfold on your wall, acquire a few Grateful Dead concert tapes, tie-dye a T-shirt and you could plausibly reinvent yourself as a hippie.High Times turns 40 this year, and with marijuana laws loosening in America, its easy to forget how radical an outrider of the counterculture this magazine was. Its editors were (and are) brave, subversive and funny. Theyve tended to take nothing seriously except for one crucial thing: the way so many lives have been destroyed by an inept and misguided war on drugs.To celebrate the magazines anniversary, we have High Times: A 40-Year History of the Worlds Most Infamous Magazine, a coffee table book for low, sticky coffee tables. Its a lot of fun, this volume, packed with toasted social history and stoner wit. But it also bangs home, again and again, a righteous moral point.Its a point that Michael Kennedy, the magazines longtime general counsel, puts this way in his introduction: At High Times we will never forget what was done in the name of law enforcement to our scarred arrestees, and those who still rot in prison for daring to try to enjoy themselves peacefully and harmlessly.High Times was founded in 1974 by Tom Forade, a crusading journalist who was among the first to use pie tossing as a form of protest. (At a 1970 hearing, he memorably plastered a cottage-cheese pie upon of a member of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography.)In his foreword to this book, Tommy Chong (of the ur-stoner comedy team Cheech & Chong) underscores what the magazines debut meant: We always knew that there were other stoners out there, but until High Times magazine came along, no publication had devoted everything to the weed.Fun fact: Mr. Chong has appeared on the magazines cover eight times, more than any other human.After starting High Times, Mr. Forade ran the Underground Press Syndicate, later called the Alternative Press Syndicate. He was also a fairly serious pot smuggler, according to Dan Skye, a longtime High Times editorMr. Forades sideline may explain his magazines early focus on news you can use, trafficking division. High Times headlines included Best Smuggling Ships, A Consumers Guide to Scales and (my favorite) How to Fly Low.Mr. Forade committed suicide in New York in 1978, when he was just 33. By this time, though, High Times was an obvious success. Circulation numbers are hard to come by, but Mr. Skye cites an article saying that in 1978, the magazine had four million readers a month. The celebrities on its covers in the 1970s included Bob Marley, and Truman Capote grinning next to Andy Warhol. Gregg Allman and Cher made a more ignominious appearance on a 1978 cover as informer couple of the year.The essays and journalism in High Times were not mere bong water. William S. Burroughs, Charles Bukowski and Tom Robbins wrote regularly for the magazine. You flip through the covers reprinted here (this book has more images than text) and see headlines like Aldous Huxley on Moksha Yag and Paul Bowles on Kif. There were interviews with Susan Sontag and Noam Chomsky.High Times brought an entire underground economy (pipes, rolling papers, elaborate bongs, Pocahontas headbands) out of the closet. If this book has a narrative arc, its in watching the editorial focus switch from garish travel stories (Secret Hash-Making in Mexico) to a cheerful Home Depot-like do-it-yourself ethos.During the 1980s, a High Times editor named Danny Danko writes, the word homegrown went from a term of derision to one of praise. You began to see headlines like Light Intensity: How Much Is Enough? and How to Grow 10-Pound Monster Plants.There were dark times. In 1989, the Drug Enforcement Administration raided the shops of many retailers that advertised in the magazine and seized customer lists.In 2004, High Times briefly (and disastrously) tried to drop marijuana coverage and become a literary magazine, under a new publisher and editors who included John Buffalo Mailer, Norman Mailers son. After a few months of this dire experiment, a headline read: The Buds Are Back!These days, High Times is riding, like a prom queen on a Mustang convertible during a homecoming parade, Americas increasing embrace of legalized marijuana. (An editorial in The New York Times recently called on the federal government to repeal the ban on marijuana.) The magazine began hosting its Cannabis Cup awards in 1988. This years Cannabis Cup, in Denver, was attended by some 37,000 people.This book circles repeatedly around to the subjects of race and class. The war on drugs was always really a war on marijuana, Mr. Kennedy suggests, because it was easier for cops. Criminals dealing drugs like heroin and cocaine, he writes, would actually shoot back.Thus the war on drugs was waged mostly on hippies and slackers and the underprivileged. We were dirty and disposable, Mr. Kennedy writes, and tens of millions of us were incarcerated for having fun.Its probably time to confess a personal debt to High Times. Im not a pot smoker. Weed often makes me paranoid, and in the evenings, Id rather sip from a kylix of cold gin. Once or twice a year at a party, though, standing in someones backyard, Ill take a hit or two of a joint thats going around, just so I dont feel like a dweeb.One of these occasions turned out to be just before I learned Id have to take a urine test to be hired by The New York Times. I was terrified and later outraged that a tiny indiscretion, if thats the correct word, might prevent me from getting a job I badly wanted.So I purchased my first-ever issue of High Times. This was 1999. I scanned the rainbow assortment of ads, and I phoned for a mail-order shipment of detox tea with which I power-flushed my kidneys for a miserable week.Would I have passed the urine test anyway? Almost certainly. Was not doing the cleanse a risk worth taking? Definitely not. It was a moronic close call that gave me increased sympathy for people who had their lives upended for little good purpose, butterflies of a thousand species, each broken on the same wheel.So thank you, High Times, for fighting a long and lonely fight. Count me in with Bob Marley, who says in an interview printed here: Ooo-eee! Ooo-eee! High Times! He adds, High Times only de bes.",2014-10-22,marijuana

So What Should We Say?,"Marijuana is legal in some states and under some circumstances, and can now be munched and drunk as well as smoked. How does that change the way we talk about it with our kids?","Marijuana has changed. The laws around it are in flux; as of this writing, marijuana for medical use is legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia; two of those states (Colorado and Washington) have legalized recreational use as well.  The stuff itself, once green, leafy and intended for smoking, has undergone a transformation that Ive written about before: It may be a drug, but it looks like candy.  Those changes in themselves  are not cause for alarm (nor is the idea of rogue marijuana-using households slipping their $8 THC-laced gummy bears into trick-or-treaters buckets). It does mean that the way we talk with our children about marijuana needs to change as well. The phrase smoking pot, while far from entirely outdated, is no longer necessarily an accurate description of the way our children are likely to first encounter marijuana. The legalization of marijuana in all its complexities shifts marijuana more in the direction of alcohol when it comes to talking about how the people around us (and parents themselves) may use it. Yet while many parents may give a child a sip of beer or wine, its hard to imagine even the most enthusiastic embracer of legalization offering a nibble or a puff. For the time being at least, marijuana still occupies a different space in most peoples minds. So how do we talk about the maybe-legal-for-some-people-in-some-contexts-but-not-for-you drug that can now be munched, smoked or drank? Ill be asking just that on Twitter tomorrow  from 9 to 10 a.m. Eastern time, in a chat with Dr. Amy Sass, medical director of the Adolescent Clinic at Childrens Colorado; Becky Updike, vice president of Child and Family Services, Lutheran Family Services Rocky Mountains and formerly Colorados first appointed child protection ombudsman; and Dr. Kelly Caywood, clinical psychologist at Childrens Hospital Colorado (which organized the Twitter chat).Ill be asking questions like: My friends use marijuana. My child plays at their house. How should I start the conversation about that, and what should I ask? And yes, I know that question sounds silly if you replace marijuana with beer, but should we and do we equate the two, or are there other concerns? Other questions: If Ive used marijuana, do I admit it to my kids? and What are some signs that my child has been using marijuana  now that I might not smell the smoke?

The proposal was one of several ideas presented to a state-sponsored working group considering safety regulations for the marijuana industry.But health officials quickly backed away from the plan after the A.P. article appeared. As the Denver Post reported, edibles account for nearly half of the states cannabis business. Forcing all those soda- and candy-makers out of business or underground would be a head-spinning retreat for Colorados world-leading legalization experiment. It would also seem to clearly violate the Constitutional amendment, overwhelmingly approved by Colorado voters, to make marijuana in its many forms legal, and to regulate it like alcohol.As The Post also makes clear, it is proving difficult to come up with simple, surefire rules about the size, look, potency and potential risk of edibles. Everyone seems to agree that regulation is desirable, but how is that supposed to happen? By airbrushing warnings on individual gummy candies? By making all marijuana chocolates a telltale shade of gray? Its easy to see why some health officials thought the simplest thing to do with edibles would be to just get rid of them.The problem is that its too late for that. There seems little chance that Colorado will impose what Twitter jokesters have been calling Maureens Law, after the Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd, who had a bad night in a Denver hotel after eating marijuana-infused candy.Besides, for all the concern, opponents have not much evidence to show that edible marijuana is a public-health crisis.Halloween is nearly here. Parents in Colorado and the other legalization state, Washington, have been hearing warnings about adulterated candies and stoned trick-or-treaters. Next month we will know how much of that the fear was justified.",2014-10-21,marijuana

Other cities are increasing their share of these valuable residents at an even higher rate and have reached a high overall percentage, led by Denver, San Diego, Nashville, Salt Lake City and Portland, Ore., according to a report published Monday by City Observatory, a new think tank.And as young people continue to spurn the suburbs for urban living, more of them are moving to the very heart of cities  even in economically troubled places like Buffalo and Cleveland. The number of college-educated people age 25 to 34 living within three miles of city centers has surged, up 37 percent since 2000, even as the total population of these neighborhoods has slightly shrunk.Some cities are attracting young talent while their overall population falls, like Pittsburgh and New Orleans. And in a reversal, others that used to be magnets, like Atlanta and Charlotte, are struggling to attract them at the same rate.Even as Americans over all have become less likely to move, young, college-educated people continue to move at a high clip  about a million cross state lines each year, and these so-called young and the restless dont tend to settle down until their mid-30s. Where they end up provides a map of the cities that have a chance to be the economic powerhouses of the future.There is a very strong track record of places that attract talent becoming places of long-term success, said Edward Glaeser, an economist at Harvard and author of Triumph of the City. The most successful economic development policy is to attract and retain smart people and then get out of their way.The economic effects reach beyond the work the young people do, according to Enrico Moretti, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of The New Geography of Jobs. For every college graduate who takes a job in an innovation industry, he found, five additional jobs are eventually created in that city, such as for waiters, carpenters, doctors, architects and teachers.Its a type of growth that feeds on itself  the more young workers you have, the more companies are interested in locating their operations in that area and the more young people are going to move there, he said.About 25 percent more young college graduates live in major metropolitan areas today than in 2000, which is double the percentage increase in cities total population. All the 51 biggest metros except Detroit have gained young talent, either from net migration to the cities or from residents graduating from college, according to the report. It is based on data from the federal American Community Survey and written by Joe Cortright, an economist who runs City Observatory and Impresa, a consulting firm on regional economies.Denver has become one of the most powerful magnets. Its population of the young and educated is up 47 percent since 2000, nearly double the percentage increase in the New York metro area. And 7.5 percent of Denvers population is in this group, more than the national average of 5.2 percent and more than anywhere but Washington, the Bay Area and Boston.Denver has many of the tangible things young people want, economists say, including mountains, sunshine and jobs in booming industries like tech. Perhaps more important, it also has the ones that give cities the perception of cultural cool, like microbreweries and bike-sharing and an acceptance of marijuana and same-sex marriage.With lots of cultural things to do and getting away to the mountains, you can have the work-play balance more than any place Ive ever lived, said Colleen Douglass, 27, a video producer at Craftsy, a start-up with online classes for crafts. Theres this really thriving start-up scene here, and the sense we can be in a place we love and work at a cool new company but not live in Silicon Valley.Other cities that have had significant increases in a young and educated population and that now have more than their share include San Diego, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Nashville, Salt Lake City and Portland, Ore.At the other end of the spectrum are the cities where less than 4 percent of the population are young college graduates. Among those, Detroit lost about 10 percent of this group, while Providence gained just 6 percent and Memphis 10 percent.Atlanta, one of the biggest net gainers of young graduates in the 1990s, has taken a sharp turn. Its young, educated population has increased just 2.8 percent since 2000, significantly less than its overall population. It is suffering the consequences of overenthusiasm for new houses and new jobs before the crash, economists say.The population of young, educated people in Dallas, Charlotte and Raleigh is also growing more slowly than their populations as a whole.The effects of the migration of the young and the restless are most vividly seen in urban cores. In 1980, young adults were 10 percent more likely than other people to live in these areas, according to the report from City Observatory, which is sponsored by the Knight Foundation. In 2010, they were 51 percent more likely, and those with college degrees were 126 percent more likely. The trend extends to all the largest metropolitan areas except Detroit and Birmingham, Ala.Of the metropolitan areas with the most populous city centers, Washington and Philadelphia showed the largest increases of young adults living there, at 75 and 78 percent. Other cities that have made big gains in that category are Baltimore, Los Angeles, San Diego, Dallas, Miami and St. Louis. Washington also had the largest share of young college graduates over all, at 8.1 percent.They want something exciting, culturally fun, involving a lot of diversity  and their fathers suburban lifestyle doesnt seem to be all that thrilling to many of them, Mr. Glaeser said.How many eventually desert the city centers as they age remains to be seen, but demographers predict that many will stay. They say that could not only bolster city economies, but also lead to decreases in crime and improvements in public schools. If the trends continue, places like Pittsburgh and Buffalo could develop a new reputation  as role models for resurgence.",2014-10-20,marijuana
