See related article.Chanting I cant breathe  Mr. Garners dying words  and carrying signs, they blocked traffic in Times Square, pushed against police barricades near the Christmas tree lighting at Rockefeller Center, and lay down en masse at Columbus Circle. At least 30 protesters were arrested, the police said.Mayor Bill de Blasio said he understood the protesters anger but urged them to remain peaceful.Anyone who believes in the values of this country should feel called to action right now, the mayor said.Mr. Garner, 43, died in July after officers tried to arrest him for selling untaxed cigarettes. The medical examiner concluded that Mr. Garner died from a chokehold applied by Officer Daniel Pantaleo and the compression of his chest by police officers.The decision was awaited across the country as tension lingered from a Missouri grand jurys refusal last month to indict an officer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson. Mr. Garner was also black and unarmed. His fatal encounter with the police was captured on video.We will continue to bring you updates here as this story develops.

A line of police scooters briefly blocked the group from proceeding, then retreated, leaving the highway to the marchers.With a shout, the protesters continued on. But at 48th Street, the protesters encountered another line of police scooters. As a helicopter hovered above, the headlights of halted traffic illuminated the highway. The protesters stood for several minutes chanting Hands up, dont shoot. The line of police officers remained impassive. Then many of the marchers turned around and left the highway at 49th Street.

The group turned east, declaring their intention to go to Rockefeller Center, where the Christmas tree lighting ceremony was scheduled. But a maze of metal police barricades on Avenue of the Americas kept the marchers away. At one point, dozens of marchers attempted to push through the barricades. And at at least two points, marchers attempted to push through while chanting, We have a right to public space, and We have the right to cross the street.In both instances, police officers pushed back on the barricades and kept the marchers on the sidewalk.At 53rd Street, however, marchers escaped the barricades and took to the roadways, marching down the center of the street before turning south and marching against traffic on Madison Avenue.

Members of the crowd brandished signs that read Black Lives Matter and We Want Justice. They chanted I cant breathe, a reference to words that Mr. Garner spoke before he died, and We want a public trial, no indictment is denial. Stan Williams, 32, a union organizer from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, said that he was stunned by the news that the grand jury in Staten Island had not returned an indictment.

The circumstances surrounding his death were nothing short of tragic. And while there will be people who disagree with todays grand jury decision, it is important that we respect the legal process and rule of law. At the same time, the justice system also allows for additional investigations and reviews, and it may be appropriate for the federal government to do so in this case. And if there are improvements to be made and lessons to be learned, we at the state level are ready to act to better the system.I stand with the Garner family and urge those wishing to voice their opposition to todays ruling to do so peacefully.

The death of Eric Garner is a tragedy that demands accountability. Nobody unarmed should die on a New York City street corner for suspected low-level offenses.

Mr. Jeffries said. We are better than this as a country.Several of the delegation members noted with outrage that the officer who put Mr. Garner in a chokehold, Daniel Pantaleo, is not being charged with any offense at all, not even misdemeanor assault.Representative Yvette D.

Im hoping that the frustration and anger and outrage that results from yet another miscarriage of justice will be channeled toward really exposing how this bias affects our entire criminal justice system, and that we can really get some reform. JULIE HIRSCHFIELD DAVISThe grand jurys decision today comes 139 days after Mr. Garner died at the hands of officers on Bay Street in Tompkinsville  on Staten Island. See timeline of developments in the case. ANDY NEWMANMayor Bill de Blasio, who is expected to speak this afternoon about the grand jurys decision, issued a statement saying that todays outcome is one that many in our city did not want. Mr. de Blasio noted that many New Yorkers would be angry by the decision and would have a right to publicly display their displeasure, but he urged demonstrators to be peaceful. He also said the city would fully cooperate with an ongoing federal investigation.Mr. de Blasios full statement:This is a deeply emotional day  for the Garner family, and all New Yorkers. His death was a terrible tragedy that no family should have to endure. This is a subject that is never far from my familys minds  or our hearts. And Eric Garners death put a spotlight on police-community relations and civil rights  some of the most critical issues our nation faces today.Todays outcome is one that many in our city did not want. Yet New York City owns a proud and powerful tradition of expressing ourselves through nonviolent protest. We trust that those unhappy with todays grand jury decision will make their views known in the same peaceful, constructive way.  We all agree that demonstrations and free speech are valuable contributions to debate, and that violence and disorder are not only wrong  but hurt the critically important goals we are trying to achieve together.These goals  of bringing police and community closer together and changing the culture of law enforcement  are why we have introduced so many reforms this year.  It starts at the top with Commissioner Bratton  a strong, proven change agent. We have dramatically reduced the overuse and abuse of stop-and-frisk. We have initiated a comprehensive plan to retrain the entire N.Y.P.D. to reduce the use of excessive force and to work with the community. We have changed our marijuana policy to reduce low-level arrests, and we have launched a new pilot program for body cameras for officers to improve transparency and accountability.These are the long-term reforms we are making to ensure we dont endure tragedies like this one again in the future.  But we also know that this chapter is not yet complete. The grand jury is but one part of the process. There will still be an N.Y.P.D. internal investigation. And we know the U.S. attorney is continuing her investigation. Should the federal government choose to act, we stand ready to cooperate.Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  one of our nations most profound thinkers on these issues  taught us something very simple:  Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. The problem of police-community relations and civil rights is not just an issue for people of color  or young people  or people who get stopped by police. This is a fundamental issue for every American who cares about justice. All of us must work together to make this right  to work for justice  and to build the kind of city  and nation  we need to be.The Staten Island district attorney, Daniel M. Donovan Jr., said he had sought a court order that would allow him to release the proceedings of the grand jury. Mr. Donovan said he had done so because  unlike other jurisdictions that have statutes that permit a district attorney to disclose specific details regarding what took place during a grand jury proceeding, New York law does not permit a district attorney to engage in such disclosure. State law does make an exception, Mr. Donovan said, upon a showing of a compelling and particularized need for access.  Mr. Donovan said his request was being considered.Read Mr. Donovans full statement. THE NEW YORK TIMESWilliam Fitzpatrick, president-elect of the National District Attorneys Association and the district attorney in Syracuse, said recently that under New York law, it was not possible to release grand jury materials as Missouri prosecutors had in the Michael Brown case.

Go to Union Square NOW & at 5pm! http:t.cohpNnkzzN68 Sunsara Taylor (@SunsaraTaylor) 3 Dec 14Shortly after the grand jury reached its decision, Officer Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who used a chokehold on Eric Garner, issued the following statement:I became a police officer to help people and to protect those who cant protect themselves.  It is never my intention to harm anyone and I feel very bad about the death of Mr. Garner.  My family and I include him and his family in our prayers and I hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss. THE NEW YORK TIMESWhile Officer Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who used the chokehold that led to Eric Garners death, may not face an indictment, he still faces an internal inquiry by the Police Department.The officer is currently on suspension and will remain on suspension while the department moves forward with its administrative process, said Police Commissioner William J. Bratton, responding to a question, hours before the decision, about what would happen to Officer Pantaleo if the grand jury did not indict. In other words, he said, if there are no criminal charges filed against the officer, the next action will be in the department for us to review if there were any violations of administrative processes. NIKITA STEWARTThe Rev. Al Sharpton, with Eric Garners relatives on Nov. 24, said on Wednesday, we have no confidence in the state grand juries.Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York TimesReached by phone at 2:35 p.m. on Wednesday, the Rev. Al Sharpton said that lawyers for Mr. Garners relatives had been notified by the Staten Island district attorneys office that there was no indictment in the case.Mr. Sharpton could not immediately describe their reaction, but said, I can just tell you that there was not a whole lot of surprise because we have been saying all along that we have no confidence in state grand juries.That is why, he said, he had met with federal prosecutors from the United States attorneys office in the Eastern District, to ask them to take over the case.People thought we were being extreme, Mr. Sharpton said. But now, I think you can see, we have no confidence in the state grand juries, whether in Ferguson or in New York, because there is an intrinsic relationship between state prosecutors and the police; they depend on the police for their evidence, they run for office and depend on the unions for endorsements.Mr. Sharpton said the nations attention was drawn to such issues, since so many fatal encounters between the police and civilians have occurred in a short period of time.How many people have to die before we wake up and understand this? Mr. Sharpton said.He said he would appear at 7:30 p.m. at the headquarters of the organization he leads, the National Action Network, along with Mr. Garners relatives to discuss the grand jurys decision. AL BAKERThe decision not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo is a stark contrast to how a similar chokehold case played out in the Bronx 20 years ago  one that was widely seen as a possible signpost for how the Garner grand jury might act.In 1994, Anthony Baez, 29, was playing a late-night game of football when a stray toss landed on a police car. Officer Francis X. Livoti confronted Mr. Baez and placed him in a chokehold. Mr. Baez, who had asthma, died of asphyxiation. The case closely resembles the one on Staten Island, minus any video.A grand jury in the Bronx indicted Officer Livoti on charges of criminally negligent homicide. He elected to have his case heard by a judge, not a jury. Officer Livoti faced the lesser charge of manslaughter, in which the defendant is accused of killing a person while intending to cause serious injury. In a negligence case, the prosecution need not prove that the defendant had any such intent, but rather, failed to perceive the risk in his actions, a risk a reasonable person would have foreseen.The judge, Gerald Sheindlin, acquitted Officer Livoti   perhaps a lesson in how difficult it is to get a conviction in these circumstances. MICHAEL WILSONWere astounded by the outcome of the grand jury process and that after hearing months of evidence and having deliberated that they would find no true bill as to any potential criminal charge, Jonathan C. Moore, the lawyer for the Garner family, said in a brief phone interview.Its very upsetting to us  we obviously hope that the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District, Loretta Lynch, will take a close look at this.We think people should express their objections to this grand jury verdict, but we urge on behalf of the family that any protest be peaceful, Mr. Moore added.

Bratton, speaking at a press conference earlier in the day, said that he expected any protests to be peaceful and the police were prepared to deal with anyone seeking to cause trouble.We have had quite a bit of time to prepare for the events that will unfold here for the next few days, Mr. Bratton said.Since the decision not to indict the white police officer who shot an unarmed teenager in Ferguson, Mo., prompted protests across the nation, there have been 31 arrests of protesters in the city, he said.While seeking to ensure that people can voice their opinions, Mr. Bratton said the police would take forceful action against those who used the protests to break the law. MARC SANTORAMayor Bill de Blasio abruptly canceled a bill signing after news broke that the grand jury would not indict the officer.

Grand larcenies  including the thefts of Apple devices that officials said drove an overall crime increase two years ago  are also down, by roughly 3 percent.And after a record-low 335 homicides in 2013, the city has seen 290 killings in the first 11 months of this year, a number unheard-of two decades ago.When I came into this job, people always talked about last year  last year was an amazing year in this city in terms of bringing down crime, Mr. de Blasio said. We saw what was possible. The citys crime rate continues to go down.Even shootings, which had increased by more than 10 percent earlier this year, have receded amid a push by the Police Department to stamp out troublesome pockets of gun violence. There were just over 1,000 shootings in the first 11 months of this year, about a 4 percent increase over last year.The announcement on Tuesday, which, at the beginning of December, came earlier than in years past, appeared timed to precede a decision by a Staten Island grand jury that is investigating officers actions in the case of Eric Garner, who died after a police chokehold during an arrest in July.The announcement also comes less than two weeks after an officer shot and killed an unarmed man, Akai Gurley, while patrolling a Brooklyn housing development in what the police described as an accidental shooting. Both Mr. Garner and Mr. Gurley were black.For Mr. de Blasio and his police commissioner, William J. Bratton, the numbers provided a kind of cushion for the criminal justice and policing reforms that both men are putting into place.Officers will this week begin a pilot program of wearing body cameras in three police commands, Mr. Bratton said on Tuesday, and a wholesale retraining of the departments patrol force is also starting. A new marijuana policy aimed at reducing low-level arrests, which was announced in November, has already resulted in a 61.2 percent decline in arrests in its first two full weeks.We can see with our own eyes, we can experience in our own lives, a safer city, Mr. de Blasio said, and a city that is becoming more unified.The decline in the citys crime rate, while deeper in many categories than other cities, mirrors a nationwide downward trend from heights of violent crime in the 1990s. How much any one mayor or one police commissioner has control over crime has remained a subject of debate.Indeed, Mr. de Blasio pointed to 20 years of momentum that he inherited, referring to an arc of continuous progress across different mayors, different commissioners. He expressed pride in the performance of the Police Department over the first 11 months of this year, and declined to describe the continued decline as vindication of his reform-minded policies.Others were more ready to do so.Bravo! wrote Joseph J. Lhota on Twitter, who as the Republican candidate for mayor last year ran ads predicting a return to the crime-plagued streets of the early 1990s if Mr. de Blasio were elected.With a month still to go before the end of the year, the favorable crime numbers appeared to render a verdict on at least one question: Would a vast decline in the number of recorded stop-and-frisk encounters create an opening for violence to return? So far, Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Bratton said, the answer has been no.Mr. Bratton said that by the end of the year there would be fewer than 50,000 such stops, down from a high of over 685,000 in 2011. That sharp decline, like crime over all, began well before Mr. de Blasio took office and has continued.Two years ago, in front of a graduating Police Academy class in Madison Square Garden, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced what was then a record low for homicides  419.On Tuesday, Mr. de Blasio chose a community center gymnasium in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, for his announcement. In the surrounding Ingersoll public housing development, crime has gone down 18.6 percent, he said.Elsewhere, however, the citys public housing developments have presented a more complicated picture. Some have seen double-digit declines, while in others, like the Bushwick Houses in Brooklyn, shootings and violence are up.With fewer crimes, detectives have found themselves with more time to devote to investigations, said Robert K. Boyce, the chief of detectives. The rate at which homicide cases are closed  usually with an arrest  reached 77 percent this year.Its the highest Ive seen, said Chief Boyce, who joined the department in 1983.",2014-12-03,marijuana

But a month in, the teenager, Sang Aung Bau Hkum, was feeding his own addiction: heroin, the drug of choice among the men who work the bleak terrain of gouged earthen pits, shared needles and dwindling hope here in the jungles of northern Myanmar.Three years later he finally found what he had come for  a jade rock as green as a summer leaf. He spent some of the $6,000 that a Chinese trader paid him on a motorcycle, a cellphone and gambling.The rest disappeared into my veins, he said, tapping the crook in his left arm as dozens of other gaunt miners in varying states of withdrawal passed the time at a rudimentary rehabilitation clinic here. The Chinese bosses know were addicted to heroin, but they dont care. Their minds are filled with jade.Mr. Sang Aung Bau Hkum, now 24, is just one face of a trade  like blood diamonds in Africa  that is turning good fortune into misery.Driven by an insatiable demand from the growing Chinese middle class, Myanmars jade industry is booming and should be showering the nation, one of the worlds poorest, with unprecedented prosperity. Instead, much of the wealth it generates remains in control of elite members of the military, the rebel leaders fighting them for greater autonomy and the Chinese financiers with whom both sides collude to smuggle billions of dollars worth of the gem into China, according to jade miners, mining companies and international human rights groups.Such rampant corruption has not only robbed the government of billions in tax revenue for rebuilding after decades of military rule, it has also helped finance a bloody ethnic conflict and unleashed an epidemic of heroin use and H.I.V. infection among the Kachin minority who work the mines.The drug and jade trades have become a toxic mix, with heroin  made from opium poppies that long ago turned Myanmar into a top producer of illicit drugs  keeping a pliant work force toiling in harsh conditions as the Burmese authorities and Chinese business people turn a blind eye.At a time when Myanmar is experimenting with democratic governance after nearly 50 years of military dictatorship, its handling of the jade industry has become a test of the new civilian leaders and their commitment to supporting human rights and rooting out corruption, as well as an early check on whether they will reject the former juntas kleptocratic dealings with China.So far, experts say, they have failed.Washington is worried enough about the link between jade and violence  and the effect on democratic change  that it kept in place a ban on the gem from Myanmar, also known as Burma, even after it suspended almost every other sanction against the country since the civilian government came to power in 2011. But critics say the sanctions are useless because China attaches no such conditions.The multibillion-dollar jade business should be driving peaceful development in Kachin and Myanmar as a whole, said Mike Davis from Global Witness, an anticorruption organization. Instead it is empowering the same elite that brought the country to its knees and poses the biggest threat to peace and democratic reform.Poverty Amid RichesThe fountainhead of Myanmars jade wealth is here in the mountains of Kachin State, which is rich in natural resources and poor in just about everything else. The countrys northernmost territory, Kachin shares a long border with China and is home to the Kachin ethnic group, a largely Christian minority with ambitions to gain more autonomy.Myitkyina, the down-and-out state capital, is the gateway to the most active mining region, containing what experts say is the worlds biggest and most valuable trove of jade. With its broken sidewalks, stray dogs and cemeteries littered with syringes, Myitkyina is a potent symbol of the regions ills. The citys tea shops have a thriving illegal side business in selling heroin, one of the few trades that have grown alongside the jade industry.In every house, there is an addict, said Gareng Bang Aung, a local heroin user.The city is the closest Westerners can get to the mining area, Hpakant. The government says it keeps the area closed because of sporadic fighting with the Kachin rebel army, but activists see a darker purpose: to hide the illegal jade and drug trades flourishing there. The only foreigners allowed past the military checkpoints, they say, are the Chinese who run the mines or go there to buy gems.The lack of access adds to the mysteries of the jade industry, whose inner workings are deliberately obscured. Even the simplest information is not publicly available  including which companies operate the mines and how many are Chinese-run or financed despite laws banning foreign ownership. But interviews with jade miners and executives in Myitkyina, and with gem traders, diplomats and nongovernmental organizations elsewhere, reveal a dizzyingly corrupt and brutal industry funded almost completely by Chinese trade.Their descriptions of the harsh conditions at the mines were corroborated by rare footage filmed there by a local journalist hired by The New York Times.The video from inside the checkpoints shows lush rolling hills scarred by craters that descend for hundreds of feet into pits. There, hundreds of men worked in the searing heat, picking through rocks with rudimentary shovels, or their hands, in search of the gem.In some cases, the miners shoot water from high-powered hoses to break up the rock walls, a dangerous practice that sometimes triggers landslides.Also visible in the footage: an open-air heroin shooting gallery, hard up against a mine.Corruption Fuels ConflictMyanmars jade industry took off in the 1980s after the introduction of market reforms in China. For the first time since Mao Zedong began banning private enterprise in 1949, entrepreneurs betting that the gemstone would become big business in China started jumping into the trade. Their financing helped build an industry that churns out the Buddha figurines and thick bracelets that have become status symbols for Chinas middle class. The burgeoning market transformed the Kachin insurgency, which had started in 1961 as a fight mostly about political independence, into a raging battle that extends to natural resources. A 1994 cease-fire stopped the violence, but gave the Burmese junta and its Chinese backers control over the best tracts in Hpakant.The cease-fire fell apart in 2011, with jade fueling the conflict by funneling money to both sides. Local news media say about 120,000 people have been displaced by the fighting that included military airstrikes in Kachin; the death toll remains in dispute.In an interview, Dau Hka, a senior official with the political wing of the rebel Kachin Independence Army, described a sophisticated revenue collection system in which mining companies that want to operate in areas under the rebels control donate money to them, providing half their operating budget.The donations arent exactly legal, he acknowledged.The K.I.A. also makes money by working with Chinese companies to smuggle jade through the jungle into China, according to activists and a Chinese jade importer. Theyll call us beforehand, and well come in a convoy to pick up the goods, said the trader, who would give only his surname, Chun. The rebels, he added, demand cash on delivery.Yet the fighters spoils pale in comparison to those enjoyed by the powerful Burmese military elite, whose companies receive the choicest tracts of mining land from the government, according to miners and international rights groups. Like the K.I.A., some military officers are also involved in smuggling, extracting bribes to allow the illicit practice, activists say.The top dogs are the Burmese military, said Mr. Davis of Global Witness, which has investigated the Burmese jade trade.Perhaps half or more of the jade that is mined, those who study the industry say, vanishes into the black market. The Ministry of Mines, in an email response to detailed questions, denied that smuggling is a major problem. Although official jade sales generate significant tax revenue, David Dapice of Harvard Universitys Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, which did an extensive study of the jade trade, estimated that the government is losing billions a year to illegal trading. Possibly the greater tragedy, however, is the heroin epidemic ravaging a new generation of Kachin.Heroins High TollFor decades, heroin was rare in Kachin State. The surge in the jade trade changed all that, creating a market for drugs among the thousands of Kachin laborers who flocked to the mines seeking an escape from poverty.But Ze Hkaung Lazum, 27, said the mines proved to be a trap. Heroin, he said, is sold in bamboo huts like vegetables in a market for between $4 and $8 a hit. Miners squat in the open, next to piles of used needles, with syringes hanging from their arms. If the drug fails to take the workers meager earnings, the prostitutes waiting nearby are happy to oblige for $6 per 20-minute session. Within months, Mr. Ze Hkaung Lazum was a frequent customer of both.Some miners, like Bum Hkrang, a 24-year-old recovering addict, say they need the drug to steel themselves for the backbreaking and dangerous work their Burmese and Chinese bosses demand; others say they simply fell into addiction because the drug was so available, with some heroin dealers accepting jade as payment.Try digging all day with an iron rod and see how you feel, he said, adding that he had abandoned his university studies for the promise of fast riches. Heroin, he discovered, gave him enough energy to work 24 hours straight.Miners say at least four out of five workers are habitual drug users. Users who overdose are buried near the mines, amid groves of bamboo.Over time, heroin abuse spilled into the broader population.Like many locals, Tang Goon, who works on an antidrug project, believes the government is distributing heroin to weaken the ethnic insurgency, with the military allowing pushers past their checkpoints. Heroin is their weapon, he said.But whether the trade is driven by politics or simple greed, the toll has been devastating.Kachin activists estimate that a sizable majority of Kachin youths are addicts; the World Health Organization has said about 30 percent of injecting drug users in Myitkyina have contracted H.I.V.With virtually no funding from a central government focused on other priorities, the Kachin rely on church rehabilitation centers that preach a spiritual, if controversial, solution to addiction.At one, the Change in Christ center outside Myitkyina, the founder, Thang Raw, runs a treatment program based on rapturous hymnal sessions and baptismal-like dunks in a concrete water tank that are meant to soothe the agony of withdrawal.The treatment did little to help Mung Hkwang, 21, who despite the sweltering heat lay shivering recently inside the centers thatch-roofed dormitory. His ankle, tattooed with a marijuana leaf, was shackled to his bed to keep him from running away to feed his habit.It ruined my life and destroyed my education, he said.Just weeks later, Mr. Mung Hkwang ran away and died from a heroin overdose.The Hand of ChinaThere are plenty of culprits in Myanmars illicit jade and drug trades. But many human rights activists reserve their harshest criticism for China, which they say is content to profit from the mounting chaos that has engulfed Myanmars jade industry.China prioritizes naked greed over any concern for the local population or how the jade is extracted, said David Mathieson, a senior researcher on Myanmar for Human Rights Watch.Jade has fired the Chinese imagination for thousands of years. According to legend, the birth of Confucius was prophesied by a unicorn who gave his mother a jade tablet heralding his destiny. To this day, many Chinese believe the stone wards off misfortune and heals the body.Jade, from ancient to modern times, is a symbol of grace to Chinese people, said Zhi Feina, 34, a civil servant and repeat customer at the Beijing Colorful Yunnan Company, an opulent three-story jade emporium in Beijing where she was trying on bracelets.The state-affiliated Gems & Jewelry Trade Association of China estimates that annual sales of jade are as high as $5 billion, more than half of which comes from Burmese jade.In a rare admission, Chinas ambassador to Myanmar, Yang Houlan, confirmed that some Chinese are breaking Burmese laws, but he said Beijing was trying to clamp down.There are some businessmen engaged in illegal activities who, attracted by outsize profits, cross the border to mine or smuggle jade, he said in an email, adding that the two nations have stepped up cooperation on border controls and money-laundering investigations. But there are some parts of this illicit trade that, like drugs, cant be stamped out.Activists dispute the notion that the governments are serious about cracking down. Without a stronger push for reform from China, they say, they have little hope that conditions will improve.So far, there does not appear to be an appetite for major change. During an interview, Shi Hongyue, vice secretary general of the Gems & Jewelry Trade Association of China, refused to even discuss the ills plaguing the Burmese jade trade.When pressed about heroin at the mines, Mr. Shi was dismissive. Honestly, he said, the amount of drugs theyre using isnt really that much.",2014-12-02,marijuana

These young men and women are healthy and dont expect to be asked very much, or little beyond the usual waiting room questionnaire.My job, as I see it, is not only to respond to any requests or questions, but also to ask them about the things 18- to 25-year-olds do: attend college (or consider it), search for employment, separate from (or return to live with) parents, find romantic partners, shrug off one-night stands, run out of money, feel confused or depressed or anxious, experiment with drugs and alcohol.The last topic is of special concern for me. Ive seen too many people get sidetracked by drugs; I dont want to miss any signs.Early in my career, I wasnt planning to act as a therapist  I was trained mostly to listen to hearts and lungs and feel for lymph nodes  but once I started seeing young adults I discovered the unspoken problems and hidden distress I should be looking for. Not that these young patients think of encounters with me as psychotherapy, God forbid; were just talking.In my experience, most young adults rarely, if ever, have a personal, 30-minute conversation with an adult. They talk mostly to people their own age. To my patients Im a curious stranger with whom theyre stuck for a while in a small room. Fortunately, most of them like talking about themselves, about their decisions and doubts. They know that after half an hour we will part company, that what theyve told me goes no further. If I do my job well, they might just stumble into telling their story.Lidia, 22, and soon to graduate college, comes in wearing jeans and a T-shirt that reads OBEY. Some minutes after weve discussed the reason for this appointment  eczema  I say: Im interested in how you would compare yourself today to your 18-year-old self. Do you feel like youre moving along into adulthood?She looks surprised by my question. But to hear about Lidias life, I need to be broadly interested and indirect. The question defuses the pressure of asking about private things and gets her talking.Im better at handling problems than I was a few years ago, she says. I dont depend on my parents for everything. In the old days, when I had trouble with a roommate, I might have called my parents and moved home. Now I just wait for the lease to end.I want to hear a full self-portrait, so I ask, What things are most important to you at the moment?Getting a job, completing school, putting my parents minds at ease, making my own happiness even if it feels hard at times or I dont know what will make me happy.By bringing up happiness, she has given me an opening to wander into the topic of drugs.Does marijuana or alcohol play a part in your happiness? I ask.I dont drink much because I dont like feeling hung over, but Im smoking more weed than I was last year. Im flipping between if I should stop and if Im just gonna have some fun. Back and forth.Marijuana use peaks between the ages of 19 and 22. According to surveys, 15 to 20 percent of this age group has smoked in the past month. Yet these young adults often have exaggerated perceptions about their peers use, estimating more than half the people their age smoke pot. Sometimes I set them straight about the norms, but with Lidia I withhold this information because I dont want to break the flow of our conversation.Rather than ask about the specifics  the amount and her frequency of use  and put her on the spot, I ask, Its hard to think about the next week, but where do you think youd like your marijuana use to be in a year?Look back to when you were 18, Im suggesting again, and now look forward.I dont want to stop completely because it would weird out my friends. But I could if I had to, like if my job was going to test me, or if I had to save money.I listen carefully for the reasons Lidia gives, trying to hear if I should be worried that her marijuana use is problematic. Im not overly troubled when she says, I dont think marijuana affects me like it does a lot of people. She may underestimate the effects of marijuana or perhaps marijuana does not affect her negatively at all. Whats key is that she doesnt mention that she smokes to forget her troubles, or because shes sad or nervous, phrases that would suggest theres a larger problem.With David I worry. David, 19, short-haired and big-eared, a part-time community college student, informs me that he wants to be a great decision-maker. He reports the pride of owning a new laptop, telling me bills create discipline. But then, as if the word discipline reminds him of something, he says: My mom is going back to jail. She didnt make the right decisions in the free world. He adds: That makes me push toward drugs. It helps me deal with it.David isnt sure how to deal with the stress hes under. I want to be a man of stature, but theres pressure on my shoulders, he says. Im not sure how to cope with what Im going through.As with Lidia, there is no specific amount or frequency of marijuana use that is acceptable or unacceptable; there is no magic number Im waiting for David to announce so that I can give him a label, and offer him counsel. But if someone is smoking daily and during daylight hours, I pay special attention, so when David tells me he smokes either before or after noon, a red flag goes up.Heres what Im trying to differentiate: Is this person using marijuana for fun, because its what friends do when theyre together, or to mitigate negative feelings? Using marijuana to cope is often a marker for other pathology  serious mental health problems, anxiety, attention deficit disorder, concurrent alcohol abuse, major depression. Thats what Ill want to hear more about next time with David.Although Im concerned about his drug use and his admission of distress, this first visit is an orientation, an introduction. I will ask him to come see me again, and soon. Sometimes a person like David will return for more primary care, interested in himself, worried about himself, intrigued by the idiosyncrasies of an adult conversation, and I will continue to evaluate him. Sometimes people like David never reappear, perhaps embarrassed by what theyve admitted or upset by my prying.Life often changes dramatically in a matter of months at their age, sometimes physically, but more often psychically. New pleasures come along, and also new risks, new forms of distress that are deep and real and need attention. But this is not likely to be revealed unless a young adult is encouraged to find his or her way to a primary care doctor, and unless that doctor accepts that this may be the one conversation with an adult for this patient this season, and tries to understand whats happening in the full life of a David or a Lidia, a young adult who may have arrived asking simply for a refill.Some details have been altered to protect patient privacy.Michael Stein, a professor of medicine and of health services, policy and practice at Brown University, is the author of The Addict: One Patient, One Doctor, One Year and The Lonely Patient: How We Experience Illness.",2014-12-01,marijuana

Mr. Lacalle Pou called Dr. Vzquez on Sunday night to congratulate him after several unofficial exit polls showed Dr. Vzquez winning by a comfortable margin. Official results are expected on Monday.The election came after a stretch in which Uruguays president, Jos Mujica, 79, a former guerrilla, raised the countrys profile with legislation that legalized abortion and same-sex marriage and created the marijuana market. He is set to leave office with high approval ratings.Dr. Vzquez is more moderate than Mr. Mujica, having vetoed an abortion law during his first term as president. He has also expressed opposition to parts of the marijuana law, a position shared by many Uruguayans as broad skepticism persists over the project. Still, he has said that he would enforce the law.A more important issue for many Uruguayans involved the handling of economic policy by the Broad Front, a coalition of left-wing parties, with Uruguay registering average growth of nearly 6 percent a year during the last nine years. Even as growth slowed this year, cautious economic policies were seen as shielding the country from external shocks.Practically 70 percent of Uruguayans hold a positive or very positive view of the economic situation in the country, said Jorge Lanzaro, a professor of political science at Uruguays University of the Republic. This helps a great deal.In returning Dr. Vzquez to the presidency, voters endorsed a candidate with less pizzazz on the international stage than Mr. Mujica, who eschewed many of the benefits enjoyed by heads of state. But during his first term, Dr. Vzquez also governed with his own style, reserving one morning each week to continue practicing medicine. Many voters felt comfortable having him back.We need continuity because of the government that the Broad Front has delivered, said Dr. Laura Tasende, 31, a surgeon who is now doing her residency. Still, she emphasized that improvements were needed in some areas. Education has to be a priority, because it allows people to raise their living standards so they dont need to go out and commit crimes.An increase in violent crime also weighed on voters, and Mr. Lacalle Pou, the conservative challenger and son of a former president, ran on a platform seeking to crack down on crime, reduce inflation and improve Uruguays schools. While most voters opted for his opponent, Mr. Lacalle Pou emerged as a fresh face for some.",2014-12-01,marijuana

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/30/pageoneplus/corrections-november-30-2014.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png,"Corrections: November 30, 2014","Corrections appearing in print on Sunday, November 30, 2014.","FRONT PAGEAn article last Sunday about the environmental record and state regulation of the North Dakota oil industry erroneously attributed a distinction to an oil spill last fall on the farm of Steven and Patricia Jensen near Tioga. It is considered the largest on-land oil spill in recent American history, not the largest ever.INTERNATIONALA news analysis article last Sunday about the rising tensions between Israelis and Palestinians that center on disputes over the plateau in the Old City of Jerusalem that is known as the Temple Mount by Jews and the Noble Sanctuary by Muslims referred incorrectly to the Islamic Waqf, the council that oversees the site. It is administered by Jordan, not by Palestinians, although most of the people who run the site day to day are Palestinian. The article also referred imprecisely to the tunnels at the Western Wall, which is below the plateau. While they run alongside the wall, and below the level of the exposed portion where Jews gather to pray, the tunnels do not run directly under the wall.An article last Sunday about Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, who recently became only the second Chinese Christian governor of Jakarta, Indonesia, the capital of an overwhelmingly Muslim nation, misstated the role of Bambang Harymurti, who commented on prejudices against Chinese Indonesians. He is a former editor in chief of Tempo magazine, a leading Indonesian weekly, not a founder.SPORTSThe Sports of The Times column last Sunday, about the comic opera of the Washington Redskins season, misidentified, in some editions, the social media site where Washington receiver DeSean Jackson published a message that said you could not play in an epic way with basic people. It was an Instagram post, not a tweet. (A link to the Instagram post was published on Jacksons Twitter page.)An article in some copies last Sunday about Harvards 31-24 victory over Yale in football misstated the number of times Harvards team has finished a football season undefeated. It is 17, not 18.ARTS & LEISUREAn article on Nov. 16 about elite universities investing in museums and performance spaces misstated the number of years the Harvard Art Museums were closed for renovations. It was six years, not more than eight years. The article also erroneously included an architect as a designer of the Lewis Center for the Arts at Princeton. Steven Holl was the sole designer; Chris McVoy, a partner with Steven Holl Architects, did not work on it. (Mr. McVoy was co-designer of a museum at Virginia Commonwealth University.)An article on Nov. 16 about the choreographer Jonah Bokaer referred incorrectly to a Chaconne that George Balanchine choreographed. It is by Christoph Willibald Gluck, not by Bach. (One of Mr. Bokaers projects was a Bach Chaconne.)BOOK REVIEWA subheading last Sunday with a review of All My Puny Sorrows, a novel by Miriam Toews, misidentified the Canadian city to which the heroine travels to spend time with her sister. It is Winnipeg  not Toronto, which is where the heroine herself lives.MAGAZINEAn answer in the Talk feature on Nov. 9, an interview with the cartoonist Garry Trudeau, referred incorrectly to a New York Times article about hazing at George W. Bushs fraternity, Delta Kappa Epsilon, at Yale, which Trudeau also attended. The article was reported and written by Steven R. Weisman, then a senior at Yale and a campus correspondent for the paper. The Times did not send a staff reporter to New Haven to cover the story and interview Bush. (Weisman went on to work for The Times for 40 years.) And another answer misstated the year that various cancellations of the comic strip Doonesbury generated 10 wire-service stories. It was 1985, not 1983.REAL ESTATEThe Living In column last Sunday, about Rockville Centre, N.Y., referred incorrectly to students at South Side High School who participated in the International Baccalaureate Diploma program, a pre-university curriculum for juniors and seniors, in 2013-14. Eighty-eight percent of graduates, not 37 percent of students, completed at least one course; 37 percent of graduates earned the diploma.STYLESAn article last Sunday about the designation of vape as the 2014 Word of the Year by Oxford Dictionaries, which chose it because of its relevance to the expanding legalization of marijuana, referred imprecisely to a Colorado law that took effect on Jan. 1 of this year. It legalized retail sales of marijuana, not its recreational use, which became legal in the state a year earlier.BUSINESSThe Economic View column last Sunday, about patterns of spending on luxury goods, misidentified the metal from which a Reinast toothbrush, costing $4,200, is made. It is titanium, not platinum.OPINIONAn opinion essay on Nov. 16 about sexual assault on college campuses misspelled the given name of a legal scholar. She is Catharine A. MacKinnon, not Catherine.The Times welcomes comments and suggestions, or complaints about errors that warrant correction.
