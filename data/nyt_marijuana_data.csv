Months of anger and frustration, in the end, led only to more anger and frustration.Shops were looted and burned on Fergusons main street. There were smoke bombs, tear gas, thrown rocks and random gunshots. In Ferguson, the aftermath of the shooting death of Michael Brown was almost as bitter and hollow as his killing itself.Brien Redmon, 31, stood in the cold watching a burning police car and sporadic looting after the announcement that there would be no indictments for Mr. Browns death at 18.This is not about vandalizing, he said. This is about fighting a police organization that doesnt care about the lives they serve.Thomas Perry, 30, was equally bitter. I support my people who are out there doing it, he said. For years theyve been taking from us. We dont care.The situation seemed to worsen as the night wore on, with fires and looting mostly limited to certain areas, but seemingly on the edge of spinning out of control. Officials said firefighters and police officers had been shot at during the evening.Thousands of people took to the streets in cities across the country  from Los Angeles to Atlanta to New York  to protest the grand jurys decision, and in most places the demonstrations were peaceful.In New York City, a rowdy group of hundreds of protesters made its way up Seventh Avenue through Times Square, halting traffic as police officers raced on foot to keep up. No justice, no peace, the group yelled as cars honked and tourists snapped photos from the sidewalks.Everybody is frustrated, said Hugh Jackson, 28, who just moved to New York from Atlanta and wore an American-flag-print bandanna over his mouth as he passed Carnegie Hall. Referring to a young black man killed a few days ago in Brooklyn, Mr. Jackson added that youre kind of numb to it at a certain point. Its so systematic.In Philadelphia, a large but orderly crowd gathered downtown, singing, playing drums and chanting, Justice for Mike Brown.In South Los Angeles, a crowd of protesters chanted, From Ferguson to L.A., these killer cops have got to pay, while about half a dozen police officers stood nearby. By 7:30 p.m., the crowd that gathered in a South Los Angeles park had dwindled to about 70 people. Chanting had given way to somber speeches.Were not here to socialize. Were here to demand justice, said Melina Abdullah, a professor and chairwoman of the Pan-African studies department at California State University, Los Angeles.But in Ferguson, the destruction that erupted in fits and starts after the announcement was part of a scene of seething anger, frustration and grief that ebbed and flowed all day before the announcement and after it.About 200 people stood in the cold in front of the Ferguson Police Department, listening on radios as the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney, Robert P. McCulloch, read his statement on Monday, reality dawning that they were not going to hear what they wanted.During Mr. McCullochs announcement, Mr. Browns mother, Lesley McSpadden, and stepfather, Louis Head, stepped up onto a platform where protest leaders were standing.Defend himself from what! Ms. McSpadden yelled, when Mr. McCulloch spoke of Officer Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Mr. Brown, defending himself.She bowed her head and tears started streaming down her cheeks.Everybody wants me to be calm, she said, her eyes covered with sunglasses. You know what them bullets did to my son! They still dont care! she yelled. They never going to care! Ms. McSpadden then sank her head into her husbands chest and bounced as she wept vigorously.Mr. Head then turned and began to yell.Burn this down! he repeatedly shouted, inserting an expletive.The crowd then began to roar. Some rushed toward the fence near where the police were lined up. Representatives for the family helped them down off the platform and ushered them away, through the crowd. Officers in riot helmets and shields came out. Soon came the smoke bombs, the random sounds of bullets, the chaos that was almost as predictable as the verdict everyone expected.The scene in downtown Ferguson near the police station grew increasingly unruly after a group of protesters tried to overturn a St. Louis County police car that was parked just off the road. As the police arrived, protesters threw rocks and broke the windows of at least two police cars. The police responded with tear gas, its strong odor permeating the frigid night air.Nearby, the sound of glass breaking could be heard. El Palenque, a Mexican restaurant near the Ferguson Police Department, had broken windows. Gunshots could also be heard outside the station.Protesters ran down South Florissant Road, out of sight of the police, and broke windows at several businesses, including a Beauty World store that they looted. Bursts of apparent gunfire were heard repeatedly.The looting was a remarkable change in tone after what had been a mostly somber response to the news that Officer Wilson would not be charged. Officers initially stayed behind a skirmish line outside the Ferguson police station, and many demonstrators stewed peacefully in the street for roughly an hour.But slowly, tension built and people began running north away from the police. Officers did not initially pursue them, and the first widespread looting occurred at that point.The police eventually followed, warning over a loudspeaker that anyone who did not disperse would be arrested. Cars sped off in all directions as people  peaceful protesters and looters alike  darted through the street.Closing in, the authorities warned over a bullhorn that the assembly was no longer lawful.There were numerous stretches of this city late Monday night where all remained calm. Stores had I Love Ferguson signs in the windows. The red bows and holiday lights wrapped around the light poles downtown were still perfectly intact.But there were pockets that felt like a city under siege.A Little Caesars Pizza shop was in flames. There were shattered windows at a UMB Bank branch. Thick smoke poured from the busted front entrance of a Walgreens pharmacy. Men stepped in but quickly stepped out, complaining that it was too difficult to see anything because of the smoke. The sound of gunfire occasionally rang out in the distance, and the acidic smell and aftertaste of tear gas filled the air. One man exited the Walgreens store and jokingly asked aloud if anyone wanted cigarettes.At the intersection of North Florissant Road and Hereford Avenue  Ferguson, a city since 1894, reads the sign at the corner  firefighters worked on putting out the Little Caesars blaze, but there were no police or fire officials at Walgreens. The fire inside continued to burn. Spectators drove up to the store, as did news crews. All the while, the pharmacys high-pitched security bell echoed, the soundtrack of the evenings drama.Not often you get to see anarchy, huh? one man taking pictures outside Walgreens said.The Brown family, before and after the announcement, was talking about systemic change, not violence, but like most in the crowd, it spent the evening battling emotions, not always winning.As day turned to night on Monday and the prosecutors announcement got closer, the frustration had swelled on the streets in the heart of Ferguson, setting the stage for an outburst that had been months in the making.Many demonstrators, long resigned to the notion that they would not get the outcome they wanted, seemed to respond spontaneously, from raw emotion. How they would express their outrage, and how far law enforcement would allow them to go, came with no easy answers. What was certain was that people felt they were part of something larger.I only saw this stuff in school, said Courtney Ford, 30, an educator who is black and who lives in St. Louis. He left work to observe the protesters holding court across the street from the Ferguson Police Department.The Selma marches, and Martin Luther King, and the civil rights activists, he continued. But now, this is life. This is history. Im just out here really as a witness.By about 5 p.m., hours before the announcement of the grand jurys decision, crowds started gathering across from the station, their energy rising as the night went on.A small crowd of roughly 50 protesters chanted, sang and shouted, all while watched by dozens of reporters, photographers and other spectators. The protesters were a postmodern, post-Ferguson amalgam of political views, ages, ethnicities. A few men in black-and-white clergy collars stood next to a circle of young black men and women who rapped their anti-police slogans.No justice, a man with a bullhorn yelled.No peace, the crowd replied.No racist , he continued.Police, they answered.A middle-aged white woman wove through the crowd, yelling, We need to shut this down across America! and handing out fliers.The woman, Jessie Davis, was a supporter of the Revolutionary Communist Party and came here from Chicago.Someone held a protest sign made out of a Cheerios box. The pungent scent of marijuana filled the air at one point. A few parents brought their children. One protester hurried through the crowd, saying into a walkie-talkie, Whats your location? A young African-American man  in one of the ghoulish Guy Fawkes masks that have become a staple of the protests  was approached and asked what he hoped to accomplish. He said nothing, shrugged and walked away.Shortly after 5:30 p.m., a few protesters walked across the street and began shaking the metal barricades that blocked the entrance to the police stations parking lot. One of them wore a Guy Fawkes mask. Another wore a bandanna across his face. They pushed and pulled the barricades until several sections came unlocked. One of the protesters stretched his arms in the victory pose: The barricade was down, and the protesters across the street cheered.",2014-11-25,marijuana
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/11/24/whats-in-a-slug/,http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/11/24/blogs/slugs2/slugs2-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg,Whats in a Slug?,"Kyle Massey, an assistant news editor, explains the naming convention used for unpublished articles.","Kyle Massey is an assistant news editor. He has worked at The Times since 1999.OBAMA was the slug.No, thats not an insult to the president.In newspaper jargon, a slug is the name given to an article, and at The Times, stories about Mr. Obama generally get one of two names. If the piece is produced on the National Desk, custom requires using the presidents name. On the International Desk, the slug is PREXY.Why? There is much in a name, especially in the newsroom. The naming of articles requires more coordination, foresight and concern than you might expect. The name can also be crucial in pitching stories to front-page editors. Each article must have a unique name, and some desks own particular slugs. Country names are the province of the International Desk. If Business wants to write about the Japanese economy, for example, it cannot use the slug JAPAN, which International reserves for any news out of Japan; Business has to use JAPANECON, or some other alternative. Business also sidesteps conflicts by using currency names  even defunct ones. A monetary story about Greece is likely to be slugged DRACHMA, even though the country now uses the euro.Once Foreign and Culture had the same slug on two stories, and the Culture story ate the Foreign slug, said Marc Lacey, the weekend editor, meaning that the one article had overwritten the other in the computer system. An earlier draft of the story had to be found on deadline and restored. The term slug derives from the days of hot-metal printing, when printers set type by hand in a small form called a stick. Later huge Linotype machines turned molten lead into casts of letters, lines, sentences and paragraphs. A line of lead in both eras was known as a slug.Slugs make life easier around the newsroom, Mr. Lacey wrote in an email. Instead of saying, Would you please shorten that article about President Obamas immigration announcement by 300 words? we say things like, Take 300 out of IMMIG. DIPLO can go a little long. REPUBS is strong.Before The Times adopted a new print production system, slugs were four letters long. Britain would be shortened to BRIT, for example. But this was a problem with Pakistan, whose four-letter abbreviated form, PAKI, is an ethnic slur. Thus, the slug often became STAN.Classic slugs are still used. SCOTUS was a biggie for Supreme Court stories, the longtime reporter and columnist Clyde Haberman said, citing the acronym for Supreme Court of the United States. SLAY was preferred for murder stories because KILL could be confused with the order to drop a story, he added, recalling that the newsroom often sent kill orders when articles needed to be spiked.JEWS, if I remember correctly, was frowned on as a slug because of the kill problem, Mr. Haberman said. No one wanted an order to KILL JEWS to wind up by mistake in print. I think Sports avoided the word PUCK altogether, for fairly obvious reasons.Evergreen slugs include HEALTH, cranked out by Robert Pear, who estimates that more than half of his stories are so slugged; CONG, a holdover from the four-letter days; IMMIG; and, all too often, SHOOT. David Dunlap, a Times reporter for decades, said that his standing slug after 911, REBUILD, was used at a time when ground zero was seeing anything but rebuilding.Mr. Lacey said that slugs might appear insignificant, but they arent. A jazzy slug gives a story a more exciting feel at first glance than a humdrum one, he said. Right now, we have a story slugged FAKESHEIK in our system. Now thats a story I want to read.He said that tricky editors had learned to give a story that had been held over for several days a sexier name. He recalled a story slugged WAR that reached the front page only after being renamed PEACE. Mr. Habermans tactics were just as sneaky. Back when New York was returning from the brink of bankruptcy, articles were often slugged FISCAL.There was a drought that hit the city back then, compelling City Hall to impose restrictions on water use   no hosing down sidewalks, no glasses of water in restaurants unless the customer specifically asked, etc., Mr. Haberman wrote in an email. I wrote the story on the new policy, and slugged it FISCAL. Questioned about the unusual slug by Harold Gal, the night city editor, Mr. Haberman had a reply ready: Because if its slugged FISCAL, its sure to go on Page 1.Kevin Roche, an editor in news technology, pointed out that slugs sometimes have suffixes describing layout formats. A floater is a picture unaccompanied by an article, and a refer, pronounced reefer, is a summary item on the front page promoting an article on an inside page. Hence, he said, one night a few weeks ago we had balloon-floater and marijuana-refer. ",2014-11-24,marijuana
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/24/business/media/home-birth-film-prepares-for-redelivery-worldwide.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/24/business/ricki/ricki-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg,"Home-Birth Film by Ricki Lake Prepares for Redelivery, Worldwide","An expanded version of The Business of Being Born, a documentary by the actress Ricki Lake that some experts say plays down the risks of delivering babies at home, will debut on Netflix.","One of the most talked about and provocative documentaries about childbirth is having its own rebirth.The Business of Being Born, the 2008 film by the former talk show host Ricki Lake questioning the American medical systems approach to childbirth and presenting the benefits of home birth, will be rereleased digitally in late January, becoming available globally for the first time. The updated version of the documentary, which also spawned a DVD series and a book, will include interviews with celebrities like the actress and model Stacy Keibler who were swayed by the film and, like Ms. Lake, gave birth at home.Doctors, doulas and mothers say that The Business of Being Born has influenced childbirth in the United States. But six years after it first came out  and on the cusp of its updated release  the documentary is still criticized by some members of the American medical system who argue that Ms. Lakes enthusiasm for at-home births does not show how dangerous it can be.The film remains a top-watched documentary on Netflix and ranks consistently in the top 100 for documentaries on iTunes. It has also been screened to thousands of students in schools across the nation, according to the nonprofit Choices in Childbirth.She is the most accessible media celebrity to women of the childbearing age, said Tanya Wills, who says she was so influenced by Ms. Lakes film that she had two home births, became a doula and is finishing the midwifery program at Yales School of Nursing. Ricki Lake is sort of the older sister to all of us saying, Ive been through this and this is what I learned and this is what it can be for you. There was a strong reaction against the documentary following its original release. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released a statement saying it believes that hospitals and birthing centers are the safest setting for birth. In a recent interview, Dr. Amos Grunebaum, director of obstetrics at NewYork-Presbyterian HospitalWeill Cornell Medical Center, noted that while home births still made up only less than 1 percent of total births, there have been more conversations since the film came out about at-home birth, and his hospital has tried to take a more human approach to childbirth. He said his hospital has lowered its cesarean-section delivery rates to 32.7 percent from 39.3 percent. This summer, his hospital also hired a midwife to better educate staff about midwifery. But he warned that the United States home-birth system was less developed than those in Europe.If theres anything we learned from the documentary, it is to teach their pregnant patients to bring their home to the hospital and not bring their hospital setting to the home, Dr. Grunebaum said.Danielle Repp, a trained doula and a stay-at-home mother who is writing a book about home birth in the United States, says she was inspired by Ms. Lakes documentary to have an at-home birth. But she ultimately delivered at a hospital because her health insurance would not cover the costs of giving birth at home. Ms. Repp wound up having a postpartum hemorrhage and says she was grateful to have delivered in a hospital. She questions whether the media lavishes too much attention on celebrities who deliver their babies at home, including the supermodels Gisele Bndchen and Cindy Crawford.Its the celebrity thing to do, said Ms. Repp, who says that despite her experience, home birth should remain an option, and that Ms. Lakes film helps people make informed decisions.Ms. Lake, known for acting in the films Cry Baby and Hairspray as well as for her talk show, which ran for more than a decade, said the film was inspired by her experience delivering her son Owen in her New York apartment. She said that she made the film because she was contemplating her legacy after the September 11th attacks, and that her only goal was not to lose money. Ms. Lake spent $450,000 of her own money to develop the film, and she says she has not covered her costs. She sold the film to New Line Cinema and Netflix for $300,000.It was just one of those labors of love that had an incredibly long shelf life, Ms. Lake said. I dont look at it as trying to get women to make the choices I made. I just want them to know they have choices.The expanded version of the documentary will available on the films website.The rerelease also coincides with the plan by Ms. Lake, along with her producing partner Abby Epstein, to use the film to build a broader documentary brand focused on health and womens issues. This year, when they lent their names to a first-time filmmaker for the documentary Breastmilk, it became the fourth-most-purchased documentary in the iTunes store shortly after its release. They have raised $350,000 of the $500,000 they need for the documentary Weed the People, which explores the use of marijuana to fight cancer, especially among children, and is expected to be finished in late 2015. The following year, they plan to develop a documentary inspired by Holly Grigg-Spalls birth control book Sweetening the Pill, which Ms. Lake optioned in January. And Ms. Epstein is offering support to the filmmaker Julie Marron on her documentary, Happygram, about mammograms.Ricki and Abby have the unique position to grow the community they have built around their films, said Marc Schiller, whose firm, Bond Strategy and Influence, is advising the women on the films digital distribution. Its really evolving how we think about documentaries.Netflix declined to provide figures on how many times The Business of Being Born had been watched, but Ms. Epstein said that based on her conversations with the streaming service, the film had held steady in its viewership since 2008. Choices in Childbirth, which started screening a 30-minute version of the documentary in 2012, estimates that about 50,000 students have seen the documentary. Clare Friedrich, program manager for The Business of Being Born: Classroom Edition, said that about 50 college students and recent graduates had volunteered as regional representatives to screen the film in even more schools nationwide.But even Ms. Lakes biggest fans stress that trying to mimic the idyllic home birth experience Ms. Lake had in the film can prove difficult and often dangerous. While the film includes footage of Ms. Lakes successful home birth, it also shows Ms. Epsteins problematic home birth  she is rushed to the hospital, has an emergency C-section and her baby winds up in the neonatal intensive care unit.Misha Vayner, a 34-year-old mother who gave birth to her daughter, Dru Bella, on March 29th, said that she was so influenced by the documentary that she tried to have an at-home birth. She interviewed 20 midwives to find a match. Then at 36 weeks, the pair of midwives she hired dropped her as a patient and would not give up her medical records. The midwife she ultimately hired showed up at the birth with a broken blood pressure monitor and ate and chatted on the phone through her labor, even though her daughter was asynclitic, meaning her head was cocked to the side. She said a backup midwife ultimately helped deliver her daughter.Because I had my inner strength, I just rolled her out, Ms. Vayner said about the birth. I did go through some hell to get there.For the new audiences about to see the film, Ms. Lake encourages them to think about their options, not to use her experience as a blueprint.Its an entertaining film, Ms. Lake said. No one should go into this and watch our film and recreate what they see on screen.",2014-11-24,marijuana
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/24/us/politics/marion-s-barry-jr-former-mayor-of-washington-dies-at-78.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/24/us/politics/24barry-img/24barry-img-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg,"Marion Barry, Washingtons Mayor for Life, Even After Prison, Dies at 78",Mr. Barry was a flamboyant and polarizing mayor of the nations capital who went to prison on a cocaine charge and then made one of the most improbable comebacks in the history of American politics.,"WASHINGTON  Marion S. Barry Jr., a sharecroppers son and civil rights pioneer who became a flamboyant and polarizing mayor of Washington, went to prison on a cocaine charge and then recaptured City Hall in one of the most improbable comebacks in the history of American politics, died early Sunday in Washington. He was 78.Mr. Barry died at United Medical Center in Southeast Washington just hours after he was released from Howard University Hospital on Saturday. He had admitted himself on Thursday, saying he did not feel well, although no specific medical problems were mentioned. The District of Columbias Medical Examiners office ruled that he died of heart disease.Mr. Barry had various health problems in recent years, including undergoing a kidney transplant in 2009. His death comes just months after the publication of his autobiography, Mayor for Life: The Incredible Story of Marion Barry Jr.Elected mayor four times  in 1978, 1982, 1986 and 1994  Mr. Barry left the mayors office for good early in 1999 and then worked as an investment banker. But politics was never far from his mind. In 2004 he was elected to the District of Columbia Council from a hard-pressed section in Southeast Washington, a district he represented until his death.Mr. Barry was a charismatic yet confounding politician. Admirers saw him as a Robin Hood who gave hope to poor black residents. His detractors saw a shameless rogue who almost ruined the city by stuffing its payroll with cronies and hacks and letting services decay. Indisputably, he was a political Lazarus with a gift for convincing his followers that their hopes and disappointments were his, too.On Jan. 18, 1990, Mayor Barry was arrested in a Washington hotel room while smoking crack cocaine and groping a woman who was not his wife. The arrest, videotaped in an undercover operation, caused a sensation, but it was hardly a surprise: The public had known of his womanizing for years, and there had been rumors of drug use. Nor was he a stranger to the bottle.Convicted of a misdemeanor cocaine possession, Mr. Barry was sentenced to six months in prison. His fall from grace was especially poignant for those old enough to remember the bright promise and idealism of his youth.He was born on March 6, 1936, in Itta Bena, Miss. His father, also named Marion, died when he was 4, and his mother, Mattie, moved to Memphis, where she remarried. Her new husband, David Cummings, was a butcher, and she worked as a domestic to support eight children.Young Marion picked cotton, waited on tables and delivered newspapers. He became an Eagle Scout and earned a degree in chemistry from LeMoyne College in Memphis in 1958.His middle initial, S., originally stood for nothing, but in the late 1950s he adopted the middle name Shepilov, after Dmitri T. Shepilov, a purged member of the Soviet Communist Party. As a sophomore, Mr. Barry joined the LeMoyne chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and became chapter president his senior year.While studying for his masters degree at Fisk University in Nashville, he organized a campus N.A.A.C.P. chapter. Early in 1960, he helped organize the first lunch counter sit-ins in Nashville. That April, he and other student leaders met with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to establish the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Mr. Barry became its first national chairman.After a year as a teaching assistant at the University of Kansas, he began studying for a doctorate in chemistry at the University of Tennessee. He abandoned his studies a few credits short and began working full time for S.N.C.C.In June 1965 he moved to Washington, where reporters occasionally referred to him as a dashiki-clad militant. A powerful speaker and street campaigner, he began pressing for home rule for the District of Columbia. He had found fertile political soil, since residents had only recently won the right to vote in presidential elections and had virtually no say in governing themselves.In 1967, Mr. Barry started a jobs program for poor blacks, winning federal grants worth several million dollars. He won his first election in February 1970, to a citizens board created to smooth relations between police officers and black residents. He was later president of the school board and a member of the City Council.On March 9, 1977, he was shot during a takeover of a Washington office building by members of the Hanafi Muslim sect. The bullet narrowly missed his heart, but Mr. Barry was back at work by the end of the month.The next year he ran for mayor and defeated the incumbent, Walter E. Washington, who had become the District of Columbias first elected mayor four years earlier, and the City Council president, Sterling Tucker, in the Democratic primary, making his election in November a certainty in that overwhelmingly Democratic city.Our Drive Toward GreatnessLet this day signal our drive toward greatness, he told a cheering crowd on Jan. 2, 1979, as he was sworn in for the first time by Justice Thurgood Marshall of the Supreme Court.At first, Washington seemed to undergo a renaissance with Mr. Barry as mayor. Downtown boomed as vacant lots and abandoned buildings gave way to smart new offices, hotels and restaurants. But as the political honeymoon faded, Mr. Barrys critics complained that conditions in the poorest black neighborhoods were deteriorating even as he used the city government as an employment agency for his followers.His detractors said he held on to power by cynically telling blacks that the only alternative to him was restoration of a quasi-colonial white power. Indeed, he exploited memories of the decades in which congressional chairmen, typically white Southerners, gave short shrift to the Washington beyond the gleaming edifices of the federal government.Several people close to Mr. Barry were implicated in scandals. A deputy mayor was sent to prison for embezzling city funds. One of Mr. Barrys former wives (he was married four times) went to prison for embezzling money from the job-training and antipoverty organization he had founded. When she was released, he found her another city job.His defenders pointed to Washingtons unique situation as a city with no state to look to for financial aid, no heavy industry to tax and many tax-exempt government buildings. Many people who work in Washington commute from Maryland and Virginia and pay no District of Columbia taxes.Part of Mr. Barrys tenure coincided with a nationwide crack cocaine epidemic, and Washingtons poorest neighborhoods suffered as much as any in the country. At its nadir, Washington had both the highest infant mortality rate and the highest homicide rate of any city in the United States. Drugs were peddled openly on many corners, and homeless people slept on heating grates within sight of the White House. The Fire Department could handle only a single two-alarm blaze at a time.Young black men fared badly year after year. One study found that by 1991, 42 percent of the districts black men ages 18 to 35 were in prison, on probation or on parole, released on bond or sought by the police.More and more middle-class people, black and white, fled to the suburbs after despairing of getting a good public education for their children, getting their garbage picked up or getting their streets plowed after snowstorms.But the mayor seemed not to worry about such complaints, just as he seemed not to care about appearing to be hypocritical. In October 1986, for instance, he announced that he would convene a D.C. drug summit of experts to discuss the cocaine epidemic at a time when the mayor himself was rumored to be a user.I may not be perfect, he said a month later, after his election to a third term, but I am perfect for Washington.In January 1987, Mr. Barry went to Los Angeles for the Super Bowl game between the New York Giants and the Denver Broncos at the Rose Bowl. His detractors noted that while he was watching football and partying afterward in sunny Southern California, his constituents were being buried under a knee-deep snowfall that clogged Washington streets.The mayors Super Bowl vacation was interrupted by a visit to a hospital. Mr. Barry said he had suffered a flare-up of his hiatal hernia. An associate said he had overdosed. There would be other medical crises in which he claimed exhaustion or indigestion and people close to him blamed alcohol or drugs.But the mayor seemed immune to embarrassment. In early 1988, with the District of Columbias government slumping under debt and its payroll bloated, he led a delegation of 17 city officials to the Virgin Islands. The stated purpose of the junket was to help the islands officials overhaul their personnel system.Arrest and ReturnIn 1989 Mr. Barry was called before a federal grand jury investigating whether a woman had sold drugs to city officials, including the mayor. He acknowledged having had a relationship with her but denied buying drugs.He was arrested just as he was about to announce that he was running for mayor again. In 1990, after a two-month trial, he was convicted of one misdemeanor count of drug possession and acquitted of another misdemeanor. The jury could not agree on another 12 counts, including three felony charges that he had lied to the grand jury.The verdict was a near-victory for Mr. Barry. Had he been convicted of a felony, he could not have sought office again. But in 1990, Mr. Barry suffered the only electoral defeat of his career. As an independent, he finished third in a race for an at-large City Council seat.After serving his sentence in a minimum-security prison in Virginia, he was easily elected to the City Council in 1992.In the 1994 Democratic primary for mayor, he defeated Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, who had been unable in her single term to turn the city around, and several other candidates.Amazing grace, how sweet it sounds to save a wretch like me! he exulted on the night of Sept. 13, 1994. In November, he cruised to victory over his Republican opponent.But the problems that had dogged the city during his first three terms continued into his fourth. The government sagged under the weight of accumulated debt. The payroll remained heavy, even though the citys population had been dwindling for years: While Mr. Barry was in office, the city lost 115,000 residents, leaving it with just over 520,000 in January 1999, the fewest since 1933. (By 2013, the districts population had increased to about 646,000, according to the Census Bureau.)In April 1995 an exasperated Congress created the District of Columbia Financial Control Board to oversee city spending. In August 1997, Congress stripped Mr. Barry of much of his remaining power, turning over nine major operating departments to the board.Mr. Barry called the move a rape of democracy. Though he was now a figurehead, there was widespread speculation that he would try for still another term. But on May 21, 1998, he announced that he would not.For all of you who have supported me, I love you so much, he said that day. I love this city. The control board shined a spotlight on Anthony A. Williams, a bow-tied number cruncher who had been credited with helping the city out of its mess as its chief financial officer. Mr. Williams was elected mayor in 1998 and served two terms marked by a more businesslike, if less colorful, approach to governing.Although the trial on cocaine charges was Mr. Barrys most serious encounter with the law, it was but one of many run-ins with the authorities. In July 2000 Mr. Barry was accused of shoving a female janitor in a restroom at Baltimore-Washington International Airport. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and was sentenced to community service.In March 2002 he announced that he would run for City Council, but he withdrew after the United States Park Police found traces of crack cocaine and marijuana in his car, which was illegally parked, later that month. No charges were filed, and Mr. Barry said he had been framed.Despite his clashes with the law, he won a City Council seat in 2004. The next year he pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges for failing to file income tax returns for the year 2000. He was placed on probation for three years. Yet he continued to defy the I.R.S., neglecting for the next several years to file returns. He finally settled with the tax agency in 2009, saying that his failure to file had been the result of his health.He had no such excuse in 2010, when the City Council stripped him of a committee chairmanship and censured him for steering a consulting contract to a sometime girlfriend (who had once had him arrested on accusations of stalking her, though the charges were later dropped). Mr. Barry apologized for his lack of sound judgment on the contract.Mr. Barry also had trouble on the road. In August 2014, after he was slightly injured in a crash while driving on the wrong side of the street, it was revealed that he had accumulated some $2,800 in fines for moving violations and parking infractions. He finally paid up.Various theories have been advanced to explain how Mr. Barry survived scandals that made him a laughingstock for television comedians and would have destroyed lesser politicians. Writing in The New Yorker in 1994 about that years mayoral campaign, David Remnick saw that Mr. Barrys flaws actually helped him, especially among impoverished black people who feared that white businessmen and other elitists were conspiring to take back the power that black Washingtonians had gained.No one has a more acute feeling for the divides of the city and their political possibilities than Marion Barry, Mr. Remnick wrote after spending considerable time with the mayor on the campaign trail.Looking BackWhat Barry grasps intuitively  and what comes as a shock to most whites  is the political potential of conspiracy thinking, Mr. Remnick wrote. Indeed, years afterward, Mr. Barry blamed a racist conspiracy for his trial and imprisonment for cocaine. They didnt want me creating all of these opportunities for black folks, he wrote in his autobiography, published by Simon & Schuster in June.Co-written by Omar Tyree, Mayor for Life indulged in some revisionist history and selective amnesia. As Marc Fisher pointed out in reviewing the book for The Washington Post, Mr. Barry asserted at one point that news media reports of his womanizing were all unfounded. Yet a hundred pages later, Mr. Barry conceded that he got involved with women who sometimes were not good for me.In an interview with The New York Times shortly after the books release, Mr. Barry denied that his personal troubles and run-ins with the law had hindered the progress he sought for the poorest Washington residents.I serve as an inspiration for those who are going through all kinds of things, Mr. Barry said. Whatever storm theyre going through, they can learn from me.Mr. Barry is survived by his wife, Cora Masters Barry, and his son, Marion Christopher Barry.What Mr. Barry bequeathed to Washington, and his motives, are likely to be debated for years.One reason he was so good at the political game, some of his friends thought, was because so little of it really meant anything to him, David Halberstam wrote in The Children in 1998, about the early days of the civil rights movement. He was largely free of causes, save his own. His agenda was always primarily about himself.But Mr. Fisher, in his review of Mr. Barrys book, wrote that no other mayor has come close to his achievement in providing first jobs for poor young black residents. Nevertheless, Mr. Fisher added, black poverty remains deeply entrenched in the District, and his administration had little to show for its efforts to curb crime or improve schools.Sam Smith, editor of The Progressive Review, who knew Mr. Barry since 1966, had a subtler perspective in the twilight of his public career:Its like going out into a field and seeing an old rusting-out hulk of a car and trying to imagine what it was like when it was brand-new. What people are seeing now is that corroded shell of what Barry was, and if you dont remember that, its very hard to see.",2014-11-24,marijuana
