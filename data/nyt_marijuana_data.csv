Young  Army Veteran  Dies at 34  Critic of Iraq War in Film,Mr  Young was the subject of a film that showed the devastating human cost of the war and argued that it should have never been fought ,Paralyzed from the chest down  the Iraq War veteran is seen in a 2007 documentary film taking dozens of pills for spasms  pain and depression  He speaks agonizingly about his sexual problems  Viewers watch him marry and  eight months later  divorce In the film  Body of War  Tomas Young is the body  Co directed and underwritten by the television personality Phil Donahue  the film sought to show  through Mr  Young  the devastating human cost of a war that the filmmakers argued should have never been fought Mr  Young died at 34 on Nov  10 at his home in Seattle  When asked the cause  his mother  Cathy Smith  said  His body just wore out Body of War received the National Board of Review award for best documentary  The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave it strong consideration for an Oscar nomination  Reviews were mixed  but almost all said it was hard hitting  Mr  Young spoke of his ordeal on 60 Minutes  Nightline and Bill Moyers Journal But the film  though applauded at film festivals  was not released theatrically  its producers could not find a distributor   It can be found  however  on Internet streaming services  In an interview on Wednesday  Mr  Donahue suggested one possible reason distributors shied from it  Its not a take your girl to the movies movie  he said Another reason may have been its polemic tone  Images of Mr  Youngs agony are interspersed with shots of the congressional debate over the resolution giving President George W  Bush the authority to invade Iraq in March 2003  The film shows Mr  Young in the forefront of demonstrations against the war by veterans and lobbying members of Congress to stop it Six years after the film came out  Mr  Young drew news media coverage when he announced that pain and depression had pushed him to decide to commit suicide  He wrote an open letter to President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney on behalf of the human detritus your war has left behind  those who will spend their lives in unending pain and grief The movie had its roots in Mr  Donahues antiwar commentary on his MSNBC talk show in the run up to the Iraq invasion  In February 2003  the channel canceled his show  citing low ratings  particularly compared with its direct competitor on Fox News  The OReilly Factor  whose host  Bill OReilly  was a strong supporter of the war The seeds of Body of War were planted in the spring of 2004 at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington  where Mr  Young had been taken after sniper fire severed his spine on his fifth day in Iraq  By her account  Ms  Smith asked her son  who had long been interested in politics  inspired by her liberal views  if there was anybody he wanted to meet in Washington  Ralph Nader  he said She called Mr  Naders office  and he agreed to meet Mr  Young  He asked Mr  Donahue to accompany him  The two had met on Mr  Naders presidential campaign bus in 2000  Mr  Donahue said he was blown away by Mr  Youngs wounds and came to see the young man as a potential vehicle for showing the sacrifices the troops were making in Iraq  which he thought had been deliberately hidden from the public Mr  Donahue said he had considered writing a book but was persuaded that a movie would be better  He teamed with Ellen Spiro  an experienced filmmaker  who shared producing and directing duties with him  Another veteran of Mr  Naders presidential races  Eddie Vedder of the rock group Pearl Jam  volunteered to write and perform two songs for the film In the movie  Mr  Young recalls enthusiastically enlisting in the Army after the terrorist attacks of Sept  11  2001  But he became disillusioned  he says  beginning when he was sent to Iraq rather than Afghanistan  where Osama bin Laden had masterminded the attacks If I had been shot and hurt in Afghanistan  Id have been upset about what I have to go through  but there would be no Body of War film  he said in an interview with The New York Times in 2008  Id take my government check and sit home  I would not have felt my wounds were received in an invalid war Tomas Vincent Young was born in Boise  Idaho  on Nov  30  1979  and grew up in Kansas City  Mo  His mother and father  Thomas Young  divorced when he was a boy  Tomas enlisted in the Army at 17 but was discharged because of a shoulder problem  Returning to Kansas City  he took a succession of minimum wage jobs  Then came Sept  11 I called my recruiter after hearing Bush say he was going to smoke the evildoers out of their caves  he told the Kansas newspaper The Topeka Capital Journal in 2007  His shoulder passed muster in February 2002  and after basic training he landed at Fort Hood  Tex  as a private in the First Cavalry Division He was shot in Baghdad on April 4  2004  while lying in an open truck as it rolled through the Sadr City neighborhood  He had emergency surgery in Germany before being flown to Walter Reed The documentary shows Mr  Young at one point saying goodbye to his younger brother  Nathan  as his brother deploys for the first of two combat tours in Iraq  It shows him marrying his high school sweetheart  Brie Townsend  who says she can handle the challenges they will face  And it shows them divorcing eight months later While Mr  Young was in a rehab center in Chicago  he met Claudia Cuellar  who had volunteered to visit hospitalized veterans to cheer them up  Though his condition had deteriorated  they wed on April 20  2012  He decided against suicide The couple moved to Portland  Ore  because medical marijuana was available there  They then moved to Seattle  partly because Mr  Young had come to regard Mr  Vedder  who lives there  as a friend Besides his mother  Mr  Young is survived by his wife  his father and his brother Nathan  his sister  Lisa Harper  another brother  Tim Weaver  and two grandmothers ,20141117,marijuana

Democrats,Demographics will not save them  A vision might ,DEMOGRAPHICS is not enough For years now  its been an article of faith among Democrats that the future belongs to them  thanks to the countrys changing demographic mix  The rising percentage of voters who are women  Americans of color and especially Latinos were always about to turn the country deep blue I never believed this  largely because I have been hearing it since 1971  That was the year the 26th Amendment passed  lowering the voting age to 18  Democrats had already been the dominant political party since the 1930s  and now with young people getting the vote  a permanent Democratic majority was guaranteed  right The future failed to arrive on time again this fall  Democrats lost all over America  and they lost big  by much wider margins than predicted  They lost statewide races in the Midwest where Democrats have won repeatedly in presidential elections for more than 20 years  They lost in races against radical right wing Republicans they might have been expected to defeat  like Sam Brownback in Kansas and Paul R  LePage in Maine Nor was this months election an anomaly  It was the third disastrous midterm for Democrats in the past 20 years  The party suffered similar or even worse losses at all levels of government in 1994 and 2010  along with a lesser catastrophe in 2002  It now holds fewer elected offices at both the federal and state level than it has at any time since the 1920s Democratic tacticians maintain that things will be different in 2016  when their base will go to the polls in greater numbers  and when demographics  again  will render the country less white  more Latin and more female  They blame this latest meltdown on terrible candidates  administration flubs and foreign crises  They argue that voters favored Democratic positions in state referendums  from a higher minimum wage to abortion rights and legal marijuana In other words  Problem  what problem  We Democrats are in great shape  if only we could turn out our base  find good candidates  deal with crises efficiently or get people to vote our way even when they agree with us The accepted wisdom is that the Democrats hamstrung themselves many years ago  when they passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964  and thereby lost the Solid South forever  Its a nice story  one that allows everyone to feel good  liberal Democrats  who would like to believe their party was martyred in as noble a cause as there could be  and Clinton Obama Democrats  who have long cited it as proof that the party needs to move to the right and start appealing to conservative Southern whites again The only trouble is  its not true Yes  the South was never solid for Democrats again after 1964  and the party lost five of six presidential elections from 1968 to 1988  But at every other level of government  Democrats remained highly competitive  even dominant  in the South for years to come Going into the 1994 elections  Democrats still held 16 of the 30 United States Senate seats from the 15 Southern states  which I define as the 11 states of the Confederacy  plus Kentucky  Maryland  Missouri and West Virginia  and nearly two thirds of the Southern seats in the House  On a state level  the figures were even more one sided  Democrats held 12 of the 15 Southern governorships  and 29 of the 30 state legislative chambers Its only in the last two decades that these numbers flipped  In the next Congress  fewer than a third of the Souths representatives will be Democrats  if Mary Landrieu loses her seat in Louisiana  there will be seven Democratic senators in the region  Democrats there will hold four governorships and both chambers in just one legislature Democrats did lose the South  but they didnt lose it because of the Civil Rights Act  Instead of waiting for all those mean old Southern white men to die  Democrats might be better off asking themselves why so many of them were still voting Democratic just 22 years ago Nor have Democratic losses in the South been much worse than they were all over the country  To give just one egregious example  Democrats lost the Massachusetts statehouse this year  for the fifth time in their last seven tries This is a historic shift  From 1931 to 1995  Democrats held majorities in the House of Representatives for all but four years and in the Senate for all but 12  On the state level  they held their own with  or outnumbered  Republicans in governorships and state legislatures for the vast majority of those 64 years Its been a completely different story since 1994  however  and by next January  Democrats will not only be in the minority in both houses of Congress  They will likely hold 18 statehouses and both chambers in only 11 state legislatures Suffering a series of historic defeats is not a sign that youre winning  The Democrats no longer please anyone much  neither their depressed base nor the less committed  Meanwhile  Republicans still manage to portray them as wild eyed socialists  The party does take the White House more often now  but at the state level  and in the midterms  when a third of the senators and all representatives are up for election  the party has been hollowed out THE trouble was that the Clinton Obama strategy got things upside down from the start  Why try to cast yourselves as economic moderates and cultural progressives when the disparate elements of your coalition have little in common culturally  but are all struggling with the same wretched economy The Democratic Party that shot to some 50 years of overwhelming electoral success beginning in the 1930s was helped in part by changing demographics  But many of those who built what George Packer calls the Roosevelt Republic started out as Republicans  Or Bull Moose Progressives  or Populists  or Socialists  or Communists  or simply the politically alienated and disengaged The people who built that party rallied around big things  and usually big things they had come up with themselves  The reforms that Democrats embraced were almost all culled from grass roots movements  and they were big enough to erase the lines between cultural and economic issues Electrifying large swaths of the South and West changed how people lived and worked every day  how their cities grew and their farms survived  The G I  Bill  to take another of a thousand examples  was intended to reward veterans and stave off a postwar depression  but it also opened up new possibilities of learning and travel  and therefore work  for millions of young men  This blurring of the cultural and the economic includes the civil rights legislation of the 1960s  which threw the weight of the federal government behind the struggle of African Americans to go about their daily lives with hope and dignity and which did not alienate every white person in the South Todays Democratic Party  with its finely calibrated  top down fixes  does not offer anything so transformative  It seems scared of its own shadow  which is probably why it keeps reassuring itself that its triumph is inevitable  It needs instead to fully acknowledge just how devastating the recession was for working people everywhere in America  and what a generation of largely flat wages did to their aspirations even before that  It needs to take on hard fights  even against powerful forces  like pharmaceutical and insurance companies that presume to tell us the limits of what our health care can be or energy companies that would tell us what the worlds climate can endure  It means carving out a place of respect for working men and women in our globalized  finance driven world Invite us to dream a little  You dont build an enduring coalition out of who Americans are  You do it out of what we can be ,20141116,marijuana

 1 With a Bullet   Nadeshot  Becomes a Call of Duty Star,Three years ago  Matt Haag was flipping burgers at McDonald s  Today he makes his living playing video games and has 1 5 million YouTube subscribers ,LOS ANGELES  Matt Haag  a professional video game player  makes close to a million dollars a year sitting in a soft chair smashing buttons  It is a fantastically sweet gig  and he will do about anything to keep it That is why  on a recent morning  he was in a bungalow in Venice Beach  Calif  making pancakes  Not just regular pancakes  but high protein pancakes with ingredients like flax oil and chia seeds  whose balance of carbohydrates  fat and protein was created by a dietitian hired to teach him how to eat more healthily The pancakes were just the beginning of a monthlong training session that Red Bull  one of Mr  Haags sponsors  organized for him and his team  OpTic Gaming  Over the next several days  he and his fellow players gave blood while riding stationary bicycles  had their brains mapped by a computer and attended an hourlong yoga class where they learned  among other things  how to stretch their throbbing wrists  The purpose of all this  to help them get better at blowing their opponents away in video games Three years ago  he was flipping burgers at McDonalds  Today Mr  Haag  22  skinny and blindingly pale  makes his living playing Call of Duty  a popular series of war games where players run around trying to shoot one another Mr  Haag has 1 5 million YouTube subscribers along with a lucrative contract to live stream his daily game sessions online  Known as Nadeshot  shorthand for grenade shot  he travels the world playing tournaments as spectators pack arenas to see him  At home near Chicago  he has a problem with fans showing up at his house And while most pro gamers have to settle for modest sponsorships with companies that make things like game controllers and headphones  Mr  Haag last year also attracted Red Bull  the energy drink  which has traditionally built its marketing around skateboarders  motocross riders and other extreme sports athletes  Mr  Haag is one of six people on its roster of e sports players  and it is showering them with the same attention and training it has lavished on athletes who compete in the real world For the trip to Los Angeles  Red Bull paid for Mr  Haag and his teammates to live in Venice Beach  During the day  the company shuttled them to its headquarters in Santa Monica for workouts and other training  At night  they lingered in a high tech studio and played video games into the wee hours Mr  Haag is the face of the growing business of video games as a spectator sport  Thanks to live tournaments and online video streaming sites like Twitch  which Amazon bought for  1 billion in August  video games have become something to watch  not just play But fans need someone to root for  and that is where Mr  Haag comes in  He has the requisite marks of a champion  like tournament victories and a compelling back story  And he certainly looks like a gamer  On the recent morning in Venice  his pancake making attire consisted of a T shirt  knee length shorts and a backward baseball cap Most important  though  is his compulsion to share his life  on Twitter  Instagram  Facebook and YouTube  He is  more or less  the producer  director and star of his own reality show Mr  Haags YouTube channel is in the top 1 percent of the 220 000 channels tracked by the analytics tool OpenSlate  Beyond YouTube  Mr  Haag has become the No  1 player on MLG TV  the site where people watch him play live What makes him so watchable  A recent survey performed by Jeetendr Sehdev  a marketer who focuses on celebrity branding  said that teenagers found YouTube stars easier to relate to and more candid than famous people from places like Hollywood Mr  Haags fans are right in line with this thinking  They seem to regard him as an exceptionally interesting friend For example  Kasey Young  21  of Cleveland has learned through social media and streaming that Mr  Haag drives a BMW  often eats at Chipotle and likes to say wallbong  a nonsense term he made up with friends  Mr  Young said he now finds himself saying wallbong at work at random times If he knew me in real life  I feel like we would be really good friends  Mr  Young said Mr  Haags videos  raw and unproduced  add to this feeling of intimacy  In addition to game video  his YouTube channel has regular updates in which he appears revealing and honest  posting  for example  travel diaries in which he sits on a hotel bed and tells fans about his day  He also put up an old home video in which his awkward younger self makes an alien face for the camera and then pulls up his T shirt to show off his bony chest Fans get to see interpersonal drama  like an episode last year when one of his OpTic comrades quit the team and accused Mr  Haag of blaming him for a tough tournament loss  And although he has a mostly male audience and has made his reputation as a video game killer  he is not afraid to be vulnerable Fans know that Mr  Haags mother suffered from seizures for most of his life  When she died two years ago  he sat on a couch at home and recorded a YouTube video in which he thanked followers for their heartfelt messages on Twitter  He appeared distraught and shaken but also genuinely thankful Both his fans and his detractors agree that this connection with his public is what sets Mr  Haag apart and makes him a peoples champion  as Sundance DiGiovanni  chief executive of Major League Gaming  a gaming league  put it If youre talking about YouTube and fan outreach  hes the No  1 player by far  said Mike Rufail  the owner of Team EnVyUs  OpTics chief rival  But in terms of raw talent  hes a top 15 player  I wouldnt put him in that top three or four guys Mr  Haag doesnt care what his opponents think  He makes several times his fathers salary playing video games  and earlier this year bought a  3 000 watch  The only thing he wants is to hold onto his job I think about my future probably at least 10 times a day  he said  I think about what if this all goes away one day  What if for some reason people just arent in your live stream tomorrow  What if people arent clicking on your YouTube videos tomorrow  What if your team doesnt work out and youre not performing that well and you have to quit competitively  What happens when you cant compete anymore and you want to retire because youre going insane As Mr  Haag was growing up in the Chicago area  his parents did not need to worry about where he was on the weekends  He was usually upstairs playing video games  Parties made him anxious  And instead of marijuana or alcohol  the sugary rush of an energy drink was his drug of choice and still is He was more of a loner  said his father  Jeff Haag  50  a carpenter  He gamed a lot Up in his bedroom  clutching an Xbox controller and surrounded by posters of the Chicago Bulls and Muhammad Ali  Mr  Haag had a place where he belonged  To friends and rivals he met through his Xbox  he was not a wallflower but a fierce competitor who could be a domineering teammate Countless times I would put my head in the door and be like  Shut the hell up   his father said  Hes like yelling at people when they werent doing exactly what they were supposed to be doing Mr  Haags competitive career began seven years ago  when he was 15  with online tournaments organized through his Xbox  as well as small local contests held in banquet halls  Five years ago  his uncle took him to a tournament in Anaheim The uncle  Greg Haag  remembered that the contest hall was hot and reeked of sweat and warm semiconductors  and that Mr  Haag was disappointed with his fourth place finish But the right people had already taken notice  Around the same time  Hector Rodriguez  a onetime insurance analyst who controlled a pickup team  OpTic Gaming  was trying to build it into a real business  He enticed Mr  Haag to join OpTic by offering to pay for travel and lodging at tournaments Two years later  Mr  Haag went back to California for the Call of Duty championships  only this time with Mr  Rodriguez instead of his uncle  The  1 million purse made it one of the worlds most prominent gaming events Mr  Haag led OpTic to a first place finish and the  400 000 top prize  This brought him a wave of publicity and a  100 000 check Today  Mr  Rodriguez acts as Mr  Haags agent  mentor and chief scheduler  Unlike most agents  he doesnt take a cut  Mr  Haag keeps all of his money from sponsors and contests  But Mr  Rodriguez owns the OpTic brand and controls the merchandise sales along with OpTics live stream and YouTube videos  In essence  this means he makes money from video ads and selling T shirts OpTic Gaming is now a big enough business that Mr  Rodriguez rents a house in Hoffman Estates  outside Chicago  where Mr  Haag and his teammates practice Call of Duty all day  Mr  Rodriguez lives a few miles away so he can make sure everyone is working hard  that they are busy playing video games Mr  Haag and his teammates have become famous  which has made the house a target for pranks  Late last year  someone called 911 and claimed that armed intruders were breaking in  apparently hoping that the police would show up with guns drawn It worked  Local police appeared with AR 15 rifles  But instead of bad guys  they found Mr  Haag and his roommates playing video games near a stack of pizzas  The pizzas had been ordered earlier in the evening  and were also a prank  Mr  Haag said he and his roommates paid for them because they felt bad for the delivery man The day after the pancake lessons  Mr  Haag was in Red Bulls game studio wearing a contraption like a swimming cap that was full of wires and attached to a computer  The idea was to see how his brain functioned under the stress of video game combat  This would help Red Bulls trainers and sports therapists design exercises to help him stay calm and shoot better To perform the test  a Red Bull sports technologist had Mr  Haag fire up Call of Duty and start shooting  Whether or not this will help his performance  it paid instant dividends for his image  The first thing Mr  Haag did after the test was post a photo of himself in the cap of wires to Twitter  Facebook and Instagram Mr  Haag said  Social media is the most important part of what I do  Even though Mr  Haag calls himself a professional video game player  he is really an online video star  The money he wins in contests is tiny compared with the money he makes from his live stream and YouTube videos His command over his audience is great enough that Major League Gaming recently enticed him to leave Twitch and stream exclusively with its site  He is on track to make around  700 000 from streaming and his YouTube channel this year  Throw in his other sponsorships and contest winnings  and he is well on his way to a million dollar year But Mr  Haag is paid per viewer  so he has to keep producing One night at Red Bulls studios  he played Call of Duty over the Internet for his fans  When Mr  Haag competes  he sits upright in his chair and screams back and forth with his teammates in a way that is reminiscent of a Wall Street trading desk  But this night was more casual  He was jumping from game to game and playing with whoever was online right then He had filled the stream with hip hop so his viewers could hear beats and rhyming lyrics over the din of digital gunfire and grenades  His face was lit up by a pair of screens  one with Call of Duty and another with a rolling list of fan questions like How was the Brain Testing  and Nadeshot can you say Whats up Blake  He talked for the entire five or so hours that he played  about the game  about hip hop  about how his desire for an In N Out burger was fighting with his newfound resolve to eat healthily  At times he sang rap lyrics It looked like a cross between social media and talk radio  if talk radio had a visual component where a bunch of digital characters shoot one another  And as a form of entertainment  it seemed perfectly suited to a world where people jump around browser windows  watching a video in one  checking Facebook in another The Internet  with its infinite space and insatiable demand  has turned Mr  Haags pastime into a drudging obligation  But it is better than McDonalds  which is why he spends so much time worrying that his game career will end and that he will have to figure something else out Mr  Haag may be only one year above the legal drinking age  but his fan base is largely teenagers  Just as he and other gamers have upset the media landscape by teaching children to watch video games like TV  they live with the near constant threat that their audience will abandon them for something or someone else On another evening  Mr  Haag  bags under his eyes  wanted to take a night off and go back to the house in Venice  He asked his teammates if they wanted to go with him  They declined Instead of letting his teammates siphon off fans who could be watching him  Mr  Haag changed his plan and stayed for yet another marathon session of streaming I would love to go home and hang out  but you gotta do what you gotta do  he said  Cant complain too much  playing video games for a living ,20141116,marijuana

Youre surrounded by these enormous circles of white light  but at the center is this almost Rube Goldberg contraption I think its the place in the city where one might feel the most like they were in

time had somehow reversed itself In the present day  the clock was in danger of being relocated  but the developers reconsidered Mr  Dunlap said any clock focused tour of the city should include the old Met Life tower on Madison Square and at Grand Central Terminal  with its information kiosk clock and the clock below the statue of Mercury outside True clock lovers may also travel to Dante Park

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/nyregion/liberals-growing-frustrated-with-bill-de-blasio.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/13/nyregion/MAYOR1/MAYOR1-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg,De Blasio Balancing His Promises With Reality ,Mayor Bill de Blasio is championing liberal values nationally  but at home  he is being criticized by the same police critics whose cause he backed during his campaign ,Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday issued a broadside to national Democrats  urging the party to embrace liberal values and attributing its midterm losses to a lack of fidelity to the progressive cause But at home  things are more complicated This week  Mr  de Blasio frustrated some liberal advocates by failing to brief them beforehand on changes to the Police Departments enforcement of marijuana laws  an effort that was subsequently dismissed as a sugar pill by Cornel West and others who said the overhaul did not go far enough in addressing the concerns of black and Hispanic New Yorkers Now  Mr  de Blasio is having to grapple with the same coalition of police critics whose cause he embraced during the mayoral campaign  He has concerns about legislation to be introduced in the City Council on Thursday that would set strict new rules for officers  including a requirement that they receive explicit consent to search suspects in some instances  a move sure to anger the departments rank and file And in a sign of the critics growing frustration with their onetime champion  an influential police reform group recently cut ties with a public affairs firm that is closely identified with Mr  de Blasio  seeking to be unconstrained from exerting greater pressure on his administration It is an intriguing moment for a mayor determined to be a beacon of the new left  but who must balance bold rhetoric with the realities of bringing reform in the complex city he governs On Wednesday  Mr  de Blasio  who swept into office promising to reduce income inequality and promote racial equity  published an op ed article urging Democrats around the country  many in far more conservative environs than New York City  to adopt his own policy priorities for the 2016 elections This year  too many Democratic candidates lost sight of those core principles  opting instead to clip their progressive wings  Mr  de Blasio wrote The essay  on The Huffington Post  was part of a daylong tour of news media outlets favored by the mayors liberal base  He was interviewed by the left leaning MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes  and he called in to the Rev  Al Sharptons radio show  saying Democrats should be forceful about endorsing progressive ideas That is the very advice Mr  de Blasio is hearing from some liberals in New York  who say they are disappointed at what they call an incremental approach to the police reforms he campaigned on Have race relations improved  I cant say  to be perfectly honest  said Antonio Reynoso  a city councilman from Brooklyn who said he wanted faster change at the Police Department For Mr  de Blasio  who points to an emphasis on training and a reduction in police stops as evidence he is changing the Police Department  pressure from the left is to be expected Theres always going to be voices  advocates  activists calling for you to do more on a whole host of issues  he said  and always be people who say everything you do is going too far The mayor  whose poll numbers have stayed generally high  would be likely to lose support from some centrists if he fully adopted measures that advocates like Mr  Reynoso are proposing  which could drastically alter the rules of engagement for police officers Mr  Reynoso is co sponsoring a bill that would require officers to explain that searches can be refused without a warrant or probable cause  Officers would have to identify themselves  provide a phone number for a citizens complaint board and get objective proof of consent before searching any person when there is no legal justification The sponsors say the measure would reduce police intimidation  especially among minorities  But the bill has caught the ire of police unions  and Mr  de Blasio said on Wednesday that he was reluctant to support it I certainly have concerns  the mayor said at a news conference in Lower Manhattan  We obviously have to protect the rights of our people  but we also have to make sure we are not in any way undermining the ability of law enforcement to do its job Those remarks are in keeping with Mr  de Blasios more moderate approach to changes at the Police Department  where he has defended the broken windows approach  stopping small crimes to prevent big ones  despite criticism that it disproportionately hurts minorities Mr  de Blasio kept up his balancing act this week  when he said that low level marijuana possession would merit a ticket  not an arrest The move drew criticism from left and right  Police unions said he was going soft on crime  liberals said the change would not keep minorities from being given more tickets than whites Were going to continue to see serious problems and serious racial disparities  said Joo Hyun Kang  director of Communities United for Police Reform  which led efforts against stopping and frisking It would have been good to see him do something really sweeping  said Gabriel Sayegh  a managing director at the Drug Policy Alliance  which seeks to ease marijuana laws  Mr  Sayeghs group was one of several that consulted with city officials about the policy but complained they were not told that an announcement was imminent On Wednesday  Mr  de Blasio said he could not be more proud with his administrations work on police reform I would say to any of my critics  with respect  those who think we have not been fast enough  he said  Look at any other 10 month time frame in New York City government history and tell me where you see more movement in terms of real progress in police community relations Liberals still want to wait and see  Christina Greer  a professor at Fordham  has criticized Mr  de Blasio for moving slowly on addressing concerns about the police and race  On Wednesday  she said his movement on marijuana regulations was a positive sign Hes not going to please everyone  thats also the job of mayor  she said  At least he can say  Im moving the needle ,20141113,marijuana

With Patricia Marx,The staff writer for The New Yorker   and author whose latest book   Let s Be Less Stupid  publishes this summer   says she reads the paper on her computer late at night ,Patricia Marx is a staff writer for The New Yorker and an author  Her latest book  Lets Be Less Stupid  publishes next summer  She says she reads the paper on her computer late at night  I know it is very unfashionable to dislike paper  she says  but I could never get the hang of folding The Times  it always looked as if I was trying to make a hat for a childrens birthday party   Also  who has time to look for the continuation of the story on Page A16 Does the late night  online way you read the paper affect what you read  My approach has made me fairly malnourished  news wise  in the same way that someone who eats only at buffets tends to concentrate on dessert    Also  it means that I am never sure when anything happened  Often  I know about a development in a story or about the death of a famous person hours before the news is printed in the morning paper  Its like being a visitor from the future   On the other hand  I sometimes read old news without knowing it was written weeks ago  so I have to be careful not to say things like  Hey  can you believe the Visigoths sacked Rome  Are there kinds of articles that you always read or that you reliably dont  When a story breaks in the news  say  a junta seizes power in a country you cant find on a map  you have to make a snap decision about whether it will have legs or whether you will never see a report on that subject again   If it is a story that will become major  you must get in on the ground floor  or otherwise there will be too many political factions and similar sounding names and you will never catch up enough to know whats going on    Its like buying stock in a current event  you want something thats going to pay off in the long term   Decades ago  I made a bad judgment call about the crisis in the Mideast  thinking it would blow over in a few days  and consequently  Ive never been straight about  for instance  Hamas versus Hezbollah versus P L O  versus Fatah  You can ask me anything about the  Symbionese Liberation Army or the Y2K problem  though   There was a small not much to it article this week about education in Nepal  I read every word  and now  if things go well for Nepal  which is to say not well  I am poised to become a pundit on Katmandu And are there kinds of articles you are happy to skip  There are some articles I really appreciate because I dont feel guilty about skipping them  How to Cook a Thanksgiving Dinner was an example this week  Ditto the entire sports section except for occasional baseball news   Ditto weather events  such as record breaking cold waves  that take over the headlines  giving me a news holiday   Nowadays  so much of what I read I forget the next day  In order to minimize this kind of brain spillage  I have developed a strategy for reading a hard news story that involves figuring out when the article has moved on to details Ill never remember and stopping there  Editorials  Do you read them   Do they ever change your mind I am a knee jerk liberal and I want to stay that way no matter how compelling the argument on the other side is  I also have a habit of agreeing with whatever I read last  Therefore  I avoid editorials written by conservative columnists  The libertarians often make some good points and many of them write articulately and persuasively  so I never read anything by them  I basically stick with Krugman  Bruni and Dowd  Obits  Do you read them with special interest  Everyone I know likes obituaries  and Im no different  I feel  though  that Paragraph No  2  the one that contains the cause of death  should be expanded  I am sure I am not the only one who wants to know the first symptom of the deadly disease  Also  if you could include the deceaseds last words  that would be helpful Is The Times a good source of material for a humor writer  you I am always on the lookout for stories with comedy potential  Unfortunately  so is every other humorist  This week it was disclosed that yet another former Navy SEAL claimed credit for firing the shot that killed Osama  I barely read that item because I knew Andy Borowitz  who writes a hilarious humor column for The New Yorker  would deal with it  as would late night talk show hosts  who are also funnier than I am   I couldnt resist reading the amusing and intriguing squib  however  about the invention of a color that is the blackest black  It is called Vantablack  Doesnt that sound like the opposite of Vanna White   Any good news in the paper this week  This was a good week for fortuitous accidents  which made me happy because I am careless and I like to think something good might result  There was an obituary of the guy who invented CorningWare not on purpose and also a letter to the editor attributing the fall of the Berlin Wall to blunders made by Eastern European politicians   On the other hand  Paul Krugman says that Obamacare might be felled by a typo in a clause of the Affordable Care Act  This makes me think that if they dont make auto correct illegal  or should I say  Room swallows next cone dip photocopier eject the paint penis  there might not be any laws left  Of course  theyd probably end up banning automobiles instead  which would be O K  with me  Last word  The story I most wish Id read when I was in college was the one reporting that New York City police will soon no longer arrest you for possessing a small amount of marijuana  This is like hearing from your parents long after youve moved away from home that you no longer have a curfew  ,20141112,marijuana

biography of the elder President Bush  the younger Mr  Bush offered support for President Obamas decision to wage war on the Islamic State  but took issue with his successors plan to pull out of

the United States that young girls and women dont suffer  Most audiences agree its in our interest My worry  as is Lauras by the way  is if we leave too soon that women and children  young girls  are going to suffer In his book  Mr  Bush seemed to implicitly criticize Mr  Obamas decision to pull all troops out of Iraq in 2011  attributing the rise of the Islamic State to subsequent developments and decisions  That withdrawal was actually included in an agreement that Mr  Bush struck with Iraq before leaving office  but some of his former aides have said that Mr  Obama should have tried harder to negotiate a new agreement Im not going to criticize our president  Mr  Bush said  when asked about that passage  But what I will say is I think he set a necessary goal of defeating the

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/opinion/thomas-edsall-the-demise-of-the-white-democratic-voter.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/edsall-circular/edsall-circular-superJumbo-v2.png,The Demise of the White Democratic Voter,In the midterm elections  three out of five whites voted for a Republican House candidate  Why does this keep happening ,It has not escaped the notice of political analysts that 72 percent of whites without college degrees  a rough proxy for what we used to call the white working class  believe that the U S  economic system generally favors the wealthy  Or that on Nov  4  these same men and women voted for Republican House candidates 64 34 Similarly  the overwhelmingly white electorates of Alaska  Arkansas  Nebraska and South Dakota voted decisively in referendums to raise the minimum wage while simultaneously voting for Republicans  whose party has adamantly rejected legislation to raise the minimum wage There is an ongoing debate among politicians  political scientists and partisans of both parties over the dismal support of Democratic candidates among whites  Does it result from ideological differences  racial animosity or a perception among many whites that they are excluded from a coalition of minorities  the poor  single women of all races  gays and other previously marginalized constituencies Arguably  the poor Democratic showing among whites does not represent naked race prejudice  as Obamas election and re election attest  But it can be seen as a reflection of substantial material interests that affect the very voters who carry greater weight in low turnout midterm Congressional elections Whites as a whole  who made up 75 percent of this years electorate  voted for Republican House candidates by a 24 point margin  62 38  the exact same margin by which they supported Republican candidates in the 2010 midterms  In 2006  when opposition to President George W  Bush was intense  Republicans won white voters by eight points  52 44 The opposition of whites to the Democratic Party is visible not only in voting behavior  but in general opposition to key Democratic policy initiatives  most tellingly in hostility toward the Affordable Care Act  A November 2013 National Journal poll found  for example  that 58 percent of whites said Obamacare would make things worse for people like you and your family  more than double the 25 percent that said that Obamacare would make things better Asked whether the Affordable Care Act would make things better or worse for the country at large  60 percent of whites said worse and 35 percent of whites said better Obamacare shifts health care benefits and tax burdens from upper income Americans to lower income Americans  and from largely white constituencies to beneficiaries disproportionately made up of racial and ethnic minorities  The program increases levies on the overwhelmingly white affluent by raising taxes on households making more than  250 000 To achieve its goals  Obamacare reduces spending on Medicare by  500 billion over 10 years  according to the Medicare board of trustees  which oversees the finances of the program  Medicare serves a population that is 77 percent white  Even as reductions in Medicare spending fall disproportionately on white voters  the savings are being used to finance Obamacare  which includes a substantial expansion of Medicaid  Medicaid recipients are overwhelmingly poor and  in 2013  were 41 percent white and 59 percent minority In addition to expanding Medicaid  the overall goal of Obamacare is to provide health coverage for the uninsured  a population that  in 2010 when the program was enacted  was 47 percent white  and 53 percent black  Hispanic  Asian American and other minorities Its not hard to see  then  why a majority of white midterm voters withheld support from Democrats and cast their votes for Republicans Republicans are not satisfied with winning 62 percent of the white vote  To counter the demographic growth of Democratic constituencies whose votes threaten Republican success in high turnout presidential elections  Republicans have begun a concerted effort to rupture the partisan loyalty of the remaining white Democratic voters  Their main target is socially liberal  fiscally conservative suburbanites  the weakest reeds in the Democratic coalition  These middle income white voters do not share the acute economic needs of so called downscale Democratic voters and they are less reliant on government services The Republican strategy to win over these more culturally tolerant  but still financially pressed  white voters is to continue to focus on material concerns  on anxiety about rising tax burdens  for example  while downplaying the preoccupation of many of the most visible Republicans with social  moral and cultural repression The current effectiveness of the anti tax strategy was demonstrated in the unexpected victory of Larry Hogan  the Republican gubernatorial candidate in deep blue Maryland  who defeated Anthony Brown  the highly favored Democratic lieutenant governor The average Marylander sees a governor and legislature willing to impose record tax increases on the rest of us that we dont need  dont want and cant afford  Hogan declared at the start of his campaign and repeated relentlessly until Election Day Hogan won by decisively carrying all the majority white suburbs surrounding Baltimore city  including Howard County  a former bastion of suburban Democratic strength In Colorado  Cory Gardner  the Republican Senate nominee  joined the Republican assault on Obamacare and taxes Significantly  Gardner also stiff armed the Christian right on issues of contraception and abortion in his successful two point win over Mark Udall  the Democratic incumbent  Gardner highlighted a more culturally tolerant approach when he endorsed over the counter access to the morning after pill  a form of contraception many in the right to life movement consider a form of abortion  and when he renounced past sponsorship of a personhood constitutional amendment titled The Life Begins at Conception Act In a mea culpa comment rarely heard in campaigns  Gardner told The Denver Post Despite this  not only did the Christian right stick with Gardner  but white evangelicals provided his margin of victory  These religious voters  who made up 25 percent of the Colorado midterm electorate  voted for Gardner over Udall by a resounding 70 points  83 to 13  This margin was enough to compensate for Udalls 20 point victory  57 percent to 37 percent  among the remaining 75 percent of the Colorado electorate The clear implication of these results for Republican candidates running in 2016 and beyond is that you can break with conservative orthodoxy on some issues to better appeal to a general election electorate without paying the price of losing white Christian support If Republicans are successful in toning down their candidates  it will take from Democrats a weapon that has proved highly successful in state and federal elections  demonizing Republican Party candidates as a collection of knuckle dragging Neanderthals The Democrats portrayal of Republicans has served to motivate both Democratic voters and donors  especially suburban white Democrats  by tapping into their anger and fear of a morally intrusive Republican Party Anger in politics can play a particularly vital role  motivating some people to participate in ways they might ordinarily not  according to Nicholas Valentino  a professor of communication studies and political science at the University of Michigan  and the lead author of Election Nights Alright for Fighting  The Role of Emotions in Political Participation  a 2011 study of voter motivation A Democratic tactic designed to focus on mobilizing white voters  the sustained effort led by Senator Harry Reid to demonize the Koch brothers  has not yet  by most accounts  paid off As they have after past Election Day defeats  Democrats can hope for Republican infighting between the establishment and Tea Party wings  Such internecine conflict  in fact  has already begun Democrats can also count on greater voter participation by their loyalists in a presidential year  and on advantageous demographic trends  The share of the electorate held by older and working class whites  the core of the Republican Party  diminishes every year  while Democratic constituencies continue to grow In the aftermath of the 2012 election  the obligation to change fell upon the Republican Party  With the support of Karl Rove  the Republican National Committee  under its chairman  Reince Priebus  pulled the party to the center  with Priebus producing the famous autopsy report calling for political moderation  To the surprise of many  the partys candidates this year took key suggestions to heart Insofar as the Republican Party successfully sandpapers its sharp edges  the necessity for change will now shift to the Democrats  Most recently  this kind of metamorphosis was accomplished by Bill Clintons 1992 Southern governors strategy presidential campaign when he defied liberal orthodoxy on such issues as welfare and the death penalty One question presents itself  how transformative a political leader is Hillary Clinton  Can she avoid entrapment by divisive issues of key importance to competing wings of the center left coalition  L G B T  rights  marijuana legalization  climate change  gun control  racial profiling  fracking  pension rights for public employee unions  citizenship for undocumented immigrants  and the ever pressing social welfare needs of the countrys poor In May 2008  with Obama taking the lead  Hillary Clinton committed to continue the race for the nurse on her second shift  for the worker on the line  for the waitress on her feet  for the small business owner  the farmer  the teacher  the coal miner  the trucker  the soldier  the veteran As James Oliphant  the National Journals White House correspondent wrote The white vote in the years since 1992 has become consistently more committed to Republican candidates  Mitt Romney carried whites by a 20 point margin  59 39  larger than either John McCain  12 points  or George W  Bush  17 points Clinton has her work cut out for her  especially if the Republican nominee heeds the advice of party leaders and makes a concerted effort to further erode  by whatever means necessary  white Democratic support ,20141112,marijuana

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/opinion/are-democrats-losing-the-youth-vote.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png,Are Democrats Losing the Youth Vote ,The G O P  is gaining young voters  because it lost the culture war ,ATLANTA  ONCE again  the youth vote went firmly Democratic in last weeks election  but the actual numbers  combined with some telling survey results  indicate that the partys grip on the young may be loosening Six years ago  voters aged 18 to 29 favored Barack Obama over his Republican opponent  Senator John McCain  by a ratio of two to one and justified Times announcement that 2008 was The Year of the Youth Vote  Two years previously  in midterm races for the House  the same demographic went for Democrats 60 percent to 38 percent In 2012  President Obamas advantage slipped  but under 30 voters still gave him a 23 point edge  60 percent to 37 percent  No wonder this year the president appeared two days before the election at Temple University  where he exhorted the crowd  So I need all of you to go grab your friends  grab your classmates  I need you to vote But it turned out that 2012 was no anomaly  Turnout for young voters this year was around 21 percent  typical for midterms  but the breakdown was disappointing for the left  Exit poll data show that young voters backed House Democrats 54 percent to 43 percent  half the advantage of 2006 and two percentage points lower than in 2010 The Senate contests were last fought in 2008  a presidential year  and here the plummet was startling  In North Carolina the rate at which young people voted Democratic fell to 54 percent this year from 71 percent in 2008  Virginia saw it slide to 50 percent from 71 percent  In Arkansas and Alaska  a majority of young voters went Republican Given recent surveys of youth attitudes  though  we shouldnt be surprised  Last April  Harvards Institute of Politics found a growing gap in party loyalty between younger millennials and older ones  In 2010  18 to 24 year olds chose to self identify as Democrat over Republican by 15 percentage points  or 38 percent to 23 percent  By 2014  that gap had narrowed to 10 percentage points  35 to 25  even as older millennials  between 25 and 29 years old  maintained that 15 percentage point split  Whats more  18 to 24 year olds who called themselves moderate  not liberal or conservative  climbed five points  to 31 percent A Pew Research Center survey released in March found that while 40 percent of millennials in 2006 considered themselves political independents  now 50 percent of them do  Moreover  31 percent believe there is not a great deal of difference in what Republicans and Democrats stand for Strangely  the same surveys show that 18 to 29 year olds are just as liberal as ever on social issues  They roundly support same sex marriage and legalization of marijuana  and  according to Pew  They are more likely than older generations to say they support an activist government  What gives Put simply  the social landscape looks much different now than it did just a few years ago  Millennials mostly dont remember the first election of George W  Bush  which frightened secular liberals into believing that theocratic forces were gathering  And how can they credit a war on women when they see women outnumber men in undergraduate enrollments  Students at nonreligious colleges can pass through four years without hearing a word against marriage equality So  while Lena Dunham warned in an email blast  The crazy and depressing truth is that there are people running for office right now who could actually affect your life  Particularly your sex life  Particularly if youre a woman  many 22 year olds just dont see the danger  Its not that they have become less socially liberal  its that social conservatism is a paper tiger  Liberalism has won so handily in the culture and courts that it no longer serves as a rallying cry When it comes to young voters  liberal politicians are victims of their culture war success  They have pressed a laissez faire posture in moral and private matters  and have won  But millennials have adopted not the posture of their liberal elders that fostered group identity  be it union member  disenfranchised minority or F D R  Democrat  but a soft libertarianism that makes individual preference king That pose carries over to politics and blunts lasting commitments to any political organization  Indeed  another finding of youth surveys is mistrust of institutions of any kind  including political parties  Once social conservatism was defeated  the set allegiance to Democratic campaigns was bound to erode This doesnt mean that the youth vote is going Republican  Party identity is meaningless to half of them  and that rate will rise  They pose a new kind of constituency  fluctuating and unpredictable  socially liberal but willing to back conservatives now and then  interested less in party ideologies than in actual individuals put forward as candidates  such as the cool young black senator in 2008  They form one sixth to one eighth of the electorate  If politicians take anything away from 2014  they must find a way to cultivate these voters that moves beyond party labels  indeed  beyond identity politics entirely ,20141112,marijuana

in Criminal Justice System as New York City Eases Marijuana Policy,Under the change  people found with small amounts of marijuana will typically be given a ticket and cited for a violation instead of being arrested and charged with a crime ,Mayor Bill de Blasio  who took office promising to reform the Police Department and repair relations with black and Latino communities  on Monday unveiled his plan to change the way the police enforce the law on marijuana possession Arrests for low level marijuana possession have had an especially harsh impact on minority communities  and under the change announced on Monday  people found with small amounts of marijuana will typically be given a ticket and cited for a violation instead of being arrested and charged with a crime The news  outlined by the mayor and his police commissioner  William J  Bratton  at Police Headquarters  marked the most significant criminal justice policy initiative by Mr  de Blasio since he was sworn in as mayor in January While he stressed that he was not advocating the decriminalization of marijuana  Mr  de Blasio said the impact of enforcement on the people arrested and on the Police Department compelled him to rethink how the police handle low level marijuana arrests When an individual is arrested  he said  even for the smallest possession of marijuana  it hurts their chances to get a good job  it hurts their chances to get housing  it hurts their chances to qualify for a student loan  It can literally follow them for the rest of their lives and saddle young people with challenges that  for many  are very difficult to overcome For a Police Department that has devoted enormous resources to tens of thousands of marijuana arrests a year  the shift in strategy should  the mayor said  allow officers to focus on more serious types of crime by freeing up people who would otherwise be occupied by the administrative tasks lashed to minor marijuana arrests But the change  detailed in a five page Police Department operations order that is set to go into effect on Nov  19  immediately raised questions and concerns in many corners of the criminal justice system It directs officers who encounter people with 25 grams or less of marijuana  in public view  to issue a noncriminal violation in most instances  rather than arrest them for a misdemeanor The mayor said the new policy had the support of the citys district attorneys  But Brooklyns top prosecutor  Kenneth P  Thompson  has voiced some concerns  Since September  his office has been dismissing many marijuana cases  and he said that by routinely issuing summonses  the police would be undercutting the role of prosecutors in assessing arrests and charges  That  Mr  Thompson said  left him concerned about the due process rights of those who are given marijuana summonses As they headed into a meeting with departmental leaders to hear about the new policy  some police union leaders said the changes seemed to run counter to the broken windows strategy of policing  long championed by Mr  Bratton as a way to prevent serious crime by cracking down on low level offenses I just see it as another step in giving the streets back to the criminals  said Michael J  Palladino  the head of the citys Detectives Endowment Association  the union representing police detectives  And we keep inching closer and closer to that Edward Mullins  the head of the citys Sergeants Benevolent Association  said police officers were always looking to make big arrests  to catch bank robbers or to seize guns  But sometimes  he said  marijuana arrests can pop a guy wanted for robbery People are asking  What is going on  Is this department losing its mind  Has the city lost its mind  he said At the news conference  Mr  Bratton said officers would still have to use discretion  If marijuana was being burned or smoked  an arrest would be made  he said  If offenders had an active warrant  or were wanted  or could not produce proper identification  they would be taken to the station house  he said Officials said violations would not constitute a criminal record  They said court appearances  within weeks of the violation  could lead to a fine of up to  100 for a first offense City officials acknowledged that some elements of the policy shift could be complicated  Summons forms  for instance  do not identify offenders by race  making it potentially difficult for the city to track the effects of the change on groups  like young black and Latino males  who have often been disproportionately stopped in the past It is also unclear how officials might best appraise the success of the plan  though relevant statistics are likely to include summons and arrest figures and the number of calls placed to 911 or 311 for marijuana complaints Daniel L  Squadron  a Democratic state senator who represents parts of Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan  has introduced a bill in Albany to change the state penal code to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana possession  whether the substance is in public view or not The mayors action is a big deal to undo a glaring injustice  Mr  Squadron said  But it shows we also need to change state law to create fairness Critics have said the police and prosecutors have been improperly charging people with possession of marijuana in public view  often after officers ask them to empty their pockets during street stops In 2011  Raymond W  Kelly  then the police commissioner  issued an order reminding officers to refrain from such arrest practices  Mr  Bratton said such practices were not now in use and the problem had been fixed  By now  the number of marijuana arrests has decreased  roughly mirroring the drastic reduction in the frequency of police stop  question and frisk encounters Of the 394 539 arrests made last year  marijuana arrests totaled slightly more than 28 000  or a little less than 10 percent of all arrests made in the city  That is down from 50 000 a few years ago

U S  Campuses  Networking and Nurturing to Retain Black Men,Dozens of colleges have started programs designed specifically to get black men enrolled and help them graduate ,Cameron Slater spent nearly a decade on the streets in Little Rock  Ark   he says he saw four friends die within three months  before he enrolled at Pulaski Technical College after a nudge from his pastor In his first year  he and his friends noticed some adults on the campus  in North Little Rock  who always seemed to be chatting with black male undergraduates  We thought they were probation officers  he said The adults were actually academic coaches at the Network for Student Success  a Pulaski effort supported by the United States Education Department to improve retention and graduation rates among black male students  Mr  Slater gave the program a try  He was assigned a success coach  who helped him identify academic goals  He was advised to sit at the front of his class and introduce himself to his instructors  He was urged to dress in a shirt and tie and to overcome his natural shyness to speak in front of groups In his second year  Mr  Slater was elected president of the student body  He earned an associate degree in business administration from the community college in 2013  and is now working toward a bachelors degree at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock Once I got into the network  I saw that it was just a bunch of brothers in there cracking jokes  that studying was not all about being uptight  he said  I started pulling more and more people in  and letting them know that this is where they needed to be if they wanted to be successful The higher education struggles of black men are well chronicled  Over the past 15 years  dozens of colleges have started programs designed specifically to get black men enrolled and help them graduate  So far  they are still significantly outnumbered and outperformed on campus by black women  But efforts to improve their experiences are likely to accelerate since President Obamas announcement in February of the My Brothers Keeper program  which includes philanthropic pledges of  200 million to help young black students Many African American boys fall behind early in their schooling and never catch up  Fewer than 20 percent are proficient in math and reading in both fourth and eighth grades  Just over half graduate from high school  Only a third of black men in the United States who attend four year colleges graduate within six years  compared with 45 percent of Hispanic men  57 percent of white men  and 64 percent of Asian men  Only 17 percent of all black male students who enter community colleges will earn certificates or associate degrees or transfer to four year institutions within three years Advocates say the new programs are not just about helping African American men  but are also key to meeting overall goals related to college completion Weve got to address the performance challenges in this cohort if were going to raise Americas overall attainment level  says Arlethia Perry Johnson  director of the University System of Georgias African American Male Initiative The oldest programs have been around for a decade or more  Ohio State Universitys Todd Anthony Bell National Resource Center on the African American Male  which opened in 2004  provides a four day program just before classes start to 50 to 60 black male freshmen each year  about a third of the black male students in the entering class  The program emphasizes soft skills  such as motivation and study habits  rather than academic instruction  We have found that these soft skills tend to have a greater effect on how successful young men are on our campus  said James L  Moore III  an education professor who directs the center Each fall the Bell center holds the Gathering of Men  a networking event for black male students  professors  and community professionals  In February it organizes a two day  off campus retreat for black male students from Ohio State and other universities  The weekend event features a diverse schedule  including research paper presentations  yoga  and sessions on financial literacy and how to deal with police officers they might encounter The Bell centers programs appear to be paying off  Ohio States six year graduation rate for black male undergraduates is now 67 percent  an increase of 30 percentage points since 2002  noted Mr  Moore Lnard Tufts  an Ohio State senior majoring in mechanical engineering  said he was often the only black student in his freshman engineering classes  The Bell centers orientation program  he said  introduced him to other academically minded African American males whom I could lean on for support Mr  Tufts also participated in the centers Leadership Institute  a series of seminars that helped him develop skills that he is tapping this year as founder of a student group  Dexterity 43210  The organization  its name matches Ohio States ZIP code  which drew 70 students for its first meeting  intends to create an overly complex contraption  he said  and enter it in a Rube Goldberg competition at the Center of Science and Industry  in Columbus At the University of Maryland at College Park  black undergraduates helped start the Black Male Initiative in 2005  amid concerns about the relatively small number of black professors on the campus  The group initially met on Saturday mornings for undergraduates and black administrators and professors to get to know one another  Now it holds a monthly community forum on issues such as racial profiling and the criminal justice system  and arranges volunteer opportunities in local schools for black male undergraduates It started as a tool to help retain black males on a campus that is  in the view of students of color and staff  chilly in terms of the cultural climate  says Solomon Comissiong  a co founder of the initiative and assistant director of the universitys Nyumburu Cultural Center  Its not just for academic reasons that students arent retained The Georgia university systems African American Male Initiative has programs on 27 of the 31 campuses  The system encourages participation by providing matching grants of up to  30 000 per year  Since the efforts inception  in 2002  the number of bachelors degrees earned systemwide by black men has increased 82 percent  to 2 353 in 2013  officials said Each institution designs its own variations  The Georgia Institute of Technology  for example  offers a multiweek immersion program for new black male students  so that they will more quickly appreciate the level of study required to be successful  Less selective institutions have created programs that help at risk students with intrusive advising  abrupt interventions delivered in person when they cut class or fail assignments We dont have a cookie cutter approach  because we dont have a cookie cutter system  Ms  Perry Johnson says Some of the most innovative programs nationwide are at community colleges  which enroll more than 70 percent of African American men who attend public colleges  Some of those institutions  including Baltimore City Community College  receive federal support for their programs from an Education Department program designed to help predominantly black institutions Baltimore City is receiving  2 37 million over four years for a program that offers mentoring and tutoring as well as bus tickets and books  In addition to helping students financially  the freebies encourage students to attend workshops on topics like time management  note taking  and balancing academic work with family responsibilities All participants also participate in what the programs director  Duane O  Reid Jr  calls community mentoring  including volunteering in local elementary schools and at a soup kitchen The program is on track to graduate about 70 African American men within three years by next fall  he said  a rate of 45 percent  Thats well above the colleges overall graduation rate for black men  which is roughly 5 percent Brian Jones  a 43 year old native of Washington  D C  who has battled drug addictions and had numerous run ins with the police over the past two decades  made his way to Baltimore City in 2012 after completing a six month drug treatment program  The midlife quest for a college degree has not come easy  Mr  Jones had a three month relapse with synthetic marijuana  spice  last January and has flunked algebra twice  But he is back on track this semester  has nudged his GPA up to 2 6  and hopes eventually to earn a bachelors degree in social work from nearby Coppin State University He says he is in touch every day with a case manager and an academic adviser supplied by the program  which requires regular check ins  Ive spent a lot of time wasting my time  Mr  Jones said  Now I think I still have time to correct the mistakes that Ive made Some scholars say the recent protests in Ferguson  Mo  highlight the need for changes in how colleges help black men succeed  even though the shooting of Michael Brown  an unarmed black teenager  by a police officer there had nothing to do with higher education Black men are criminalized in our society  and that affects how police officers and others interact with them  says J  Luke Wood  an associate professor of community college leadership at San Diego State University  Teachers may be thinking  Do I want this student to come to my office hours  Maybe as a white female  I dont want a black male coming to my office to meet with me one on one Mr  Wood  co director of a research collaborative that studies efforts to help minority men at community colleges  said many black men were leery of higher education to begin with  they may view it as a female sphere  or may hesitate to seek academic help because of a fear that theyll look dumb In our research  weve found that it doesnt matter how well you teach  if you dont have a relationship with these guys first  theyre not going to be open to the information  he said Shaun R  Harper  an associate professor of education at the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of the Center for the Study of Race and Equity in Education  argues that colleges need to spend far more time and money helping professors understand how their actions  or even unconscious biases  may have a negative impact on black men You can spend hundreds or even thousands of hours helping a black student learn to be resilient and resist harmful racial stereotypes  Mr  Harper said  but if the guy goes back into a classroom and the professor is still behaving in a racist manner  or has unchecked assumptions about the students background  that resilience only goes so far Yet directors of some programs say they still see large numbers of students who need almost daily support in order to succeed in college  Kareem Moody  who directs the Network for Student Success program at Pulaski Tech  divides incoming students into groups on the basis of the amount of help they will need  A green student  for example  has strong academic skills and motivation and might need advice merely on course scheduling  But a red student  like Mr  Slater  someone who has struggled academically  is uncomfortable with college instructors  or perhaps has had run ins with the law  will receive far more help You have a lot of fatherly talks with those guys to close the door on some things that they might be upset about  Mr  Moody says Mr  Slater  who still spends 15 hours a week at Pulaski working with the network  now shares the lessons he learned from Mr  Moody  which helped him reach the University of Arkansas  For example  email an instructor early  he tells new students  if you know youre going to miss a class or turn in an assignment late Life happens to all of us  Mr  Slater tells them  You want your professor to remember that youre one of his bright students ,20141110,marijuana

s Barbarous Tragedy,Why were the 43 innocent students from Ayotzinapa massacred  Because their political activism was bad for business ,The massacre of 43 students from a teachers college in Ayotzinapa has horrified Mexico  Social indignation has reached a boiling point in protests across the country  The demonstrations are both natural and justified  and certainly without precedent in recent decades  Everyone knows that the students had nothing to do with the gangsters or the drug trade  Everyone knows that this was truly a Massacre of the Innocents The crime  committed in Iguala  a city in the heart of Guerrero state  was carried out by a criminal gang called the Guerreros Unidos  United Warriors  which operates in the Iguala area and controls the municipal police  The criminals surely acted in collusion with the towns mayor and his wife  who have now been caught  holed up in a poor area of Mexico City  after more than a month on the run  Some of those already arrested have confessed to a macabre sequence of kidnapping  torture  execution and the burning of bodies Guerrero is rich in tourist beach resorts  like Acapulco or Ixtapa Zihuatanejo  and natural resources like gold  but there is a huge economic divide in the state  Seventy percent of its inhabitants live in poverty  The state has been a violent  ungovernable place since colonial times  and it was a principal theater of all our national wars in the 19th and 20th centuries In the city of Atoyac  near Acapulco  there was a massacre of peasants in 1967  For me  as an adolescent  and for many Mexicans  it was the end of innocence  the resurgence of underlying violence  the return of Barbarous Mexico  the title of a book written by the American journalist John Kenneth Turner in the early 20th century That massacre unleashed the Mexican Left  encouraged by the victory of the Cuban Revolution  Much of their activism emerged from the Ayotzinapa teachers college  the Escuela Normal Rural Ral Isidro Burgos  Founded in 1926 and still closely linked to its Marxist roots  the schools heroes were Marx and Lenin  and in the 1970s Che Guevara  One of its students was the guerrilla leader Lucio Cabaas  who in the late 1960s  together with Genaro Vzquez Rojas  declared war on the Mexican state  with broad social support In those days  Cuba provided material support for revolutionary activism in many Latin American countries  But not in Mexico  the only nation in Latin America to rebuff American pressure to break relations with Cuba  In exchange  the Castro regime neither encouraged nor supplied Mexican revolutionaries  President Luis Echeverra  1970 76  opened Mexicos doors to refugees fleeing military terror in Chile and Argentina  while at the same time he unleashed terror at home  especially in Guerrero  to wipe out leftist guerrilla movements  Guerrero then subsided into an illusory calm  punctuated by scattered but bloody incidents of violence An ominous new protagonist entered the picture in force at the turn of the century  Guerrero had always been a center of marijuana production  but the newer  more organized drug cartels found the state an ideal site for their business  with its rugged and often impassable hills and old culture of violence  The citizens of Guerrero  meanwhile  were full of lingering resentment over the Guerra Sucia  Dirty War  of the 1970s  and often quite as poor as people living in the most impoverished zones of Africa  At the same time  Mexicos nationwide problem of political corruption became especially acute in Guerrero  In many towns  mayors and their colleagues took bribes from the narcos  associated with them  or  as in Iguala  were even themselves the drug lords The leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution  PRD  which has governed Guerrero since 2005  has done almost nothing to break the old links between politics and crime  In fact  the mayor of Iguala and the governor of the state had the support of all of the partys national leaders  The centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party  PRI  won the presidential election of 2012 with the promise of returning peace and security to the people  But the government has been  at the very least  inattentive and inefficient  The army has a major garrison near Iguala but  inexplicably  has done nothing to inhibit the alliance of criminals and politicians The state of Guerrero produces 98 percent of the heroin yielding poppies in Mexico  production has grown exponentially  President Obama recently quoted a report by the United States Drug Enforcement Agency of a 324 percent increase in heroin seizures at the Mexican border between 2009 and 2013 But why kill innocent students  For the simple reason that their political demonstrations  civic protests and revolutionary idealism are bad for business  A man who has been arrested for his involvement in the tragedy added another reason  Because they are unruly The strong involvement of local government and social forces has brought gains against narco violence in Monterrey  Tijuana  and even heavily plagued Ciudad Jurez  But in Guerrero  with its low level of education and high incidence of poverty  a similar process is very unlikely  The government of President Enrique Pea Nieto has passed important economic reforms  These will do little good  however  unless the problem of security is faced head on The tide of criminal violence in Mexico must not only be contained  it must be stopped and pushed back  The citizens of Mexico  feeling deceived by all political parties and all politicians  have been roused to fury by the events in Iguala  They demand not merely a few arrests  but the detention of all those responsible from top to bottom  Above all  they demand that every possible step be taken to refute those who would say that the country is spiraling out of control or has become a virtual narco state It is no exaggeration to say that the viability of democracy in Mexico depends on the outcome  Enrique Krauze  is a historian  the editor of the literary magazine Letras Libres and the author of Redeemers  Ideas and Power in Latin America  This article was

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/nyregion/in-shift-police-dept-to-stop-low-level-marijuana-arrests-officials-say.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png,Marijuana May Mean Ticket  Not Arrest  in New York City,The policy change would represent Mayor Bill de Blasio s most significant effort since taking office to address the enduring effects of the Police Department s excessive stop and frisk practices ,The New York Police Department  which has been arresting tens of thousands of people a year for low level marijuana possession  is poised to stop making such arrests and to issue tickets instead  according to law enforcement officials People found with small amounts of marijuana would be issued court summonses and be allowed to continue on their way without being handcuffed and taken to station houses for fingerprinting The change would remake the way the police in New York City handle the most common drug offenses and would represent Mayor Bill de Blasios most significant effort since taking office to address the enduring effects of the departments excessive stop and frisk practices Curbing arrests for small scale marijuana possession has become a cause for criminal justice reform advocates  and this year  the new Brooklyn district attorney  Kenneth P  Thompson  said he would stop prosecuting such cases  But his announcement did not go over well with Mr  de Blasio and his police commissioner  William J  Bratton  who vowed to continue making low level marijuana arrests Now  the de Blasio administration is publicly embracing the notion that such small scale possession merits different treatment  And with the changes  City Hall is moving to retake control of a politically potent issue that has enormous resonance in the black and Latino communities  where a vast majority of small scale marijuana arrests have taken place In the first eight months of the year  blacks and Hispanics represented86 percent of those arrested for marijuana possession in the city  according to a study written in part by Harry G  Levine  a sociology professor at Queens College who is a director of the Marijuana Arrest Research Project Many details of the changes planned by the de Blasio administration are still being discussed at City Hall  and many questions remain unanswered  Under the new policy  for example  will the 25 grams or less that constitutes misdemeanor possession under state law be the threshold below which a summons is issued  Will a lit marijuana cigarette be treated differently from a packet of unsmoked cannabis  Other key questions  such as the cost of the fines or whether a criminal record would typically result from a summons  may not be up to City Hall A clearer picture is expected to emerge this week  as Mr  de Blasio prepares for his first meeting with the citys five district attorneys  A spokeswoman for the mayor  Marti Adams  declined to comment on the proposed policy change  although officials in two of the district attorneys offices confirmed that the de Blasio administration was working on a new policy for how the police handle marijuana cases In an interview on Sunday  Mr  Thompson expressed concern about the mayors plan  calling it an end run around the district attorneys that could end up hurting some of the very people the changes are supposed to help Since July  the Brooklyn district attorneys office has dismissed 849 misdemeanor marijuana cases involving police arrests  or about 34 percent of the total 2 526 such cases in Brooklyn Under the proposed changes  it appears that instead of being arrested  those given a ticket for marijuana will be told to appear in a courtroom  But the new policy could push prosecutors out of the process  because summonses issued without an accompanying arrest generally do not receive prosecutorial review In order to give the public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system  these cases should be subject to prosecutorial review  Mr  Thompson said  By allowing these cases to avoid early review  by issuing a summons  there is a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place  These cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred Another possible effect of the new policy would be that many of the tickets later convert into arrest warrants if the person misses a court date  he said  There are currently about 1 2 million active warrants in New York relating to missed court dates and unpaid fines for misdemeanors and noncriminal violations  In 2013  people failed to pay or show up to court about a quarter of the time for the 329 198 summons cases on the dockets of the citys lowest level criminal courts  according to court statistics Under the current practice  more than half of those arrested for marijuana were released a couple of hours after being brought to a station house  according to 2012 data gathered by the Criminal Justice Agency  a nonprofit that assists with bail determinations  They were fingerprinted  checked for warrants and issued a ticket demanding their appearance in court six to eight weeks later  The remainder of those arrested for marijuana possession were put through the system  meaning they were held for up to 24 hours before being arraigned before a judge In New York  the debate over marijuana arrests has been less about drug decriminalization than it has been about the aggressive stop and frisk tactics that came to define the Police Departments crime fighting strategies  During the Bloomberg administration  the police arrested as many as 50 000 people a year on minor marijuana charges  meaning that some years  approximately one in eight arrests made by the police was for marijuana  In some cases  arrests were made after officers stopped people under dubious circumstances and instructed them to remove any contraband from their pockets In 1977  the Legislature in New York moved to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana that were not in public view  That meant that carrying a small bag of marijuana hidden in a pocket was supposed to be a ticket eligible violation that did not amount to a crime But since the mid 1990s  the police have routinely arrested people they found with marijuana and charged them with a misdemeanor  even though it was only supposed to apply to marijuana that was burning or discovered in public view In 2011  the police commissioner at the time  Raymond W  Kelly  issued an unusual order reminding officers that the misdemeanor was not the appropriate charge in many cases In 2013  the police still arrested more than 28 000 people for marijuana possession  and in 2014  the arrests were occurring at a similar pace  Professor Levine said While campaigning for mayor  Mr  de Blasio  a Democrat  emphatically criticized the departments marijuana arrest practices  His populist outrage against heavy handed policing in minority neighborhoods helped propel him into City Hall  But since becoming mayor in January  he has exerted little pressure on the department  instead often deferring to Commissioner Bratton  who has made a national reputation for aggressive street policing combined with an ability to soothe the often inflamed relations between big city police departments and the minority neighborhoods they serve Yet Mr  de Blasio now finds himself under increasing pressure to deliver on his platform of police reform  That pressure began in July after a black Staten Island man died after a police officer put him in a chokehold while trying to arrest him for selling untaxed cigarettes  Since then  the departures of the departments top Hispanic official and its highest ranking black officer have led a number of minority lawmakers and City Hall allies to begin to question Mr  de Blasios oversight of the police ,20141110,marijuana

 High Maintenance  Vimeo Invests in Original Content,Vimeo  a video sharing web service built to appeal to fans of higher quality content than sites like YouTube  is directly funding an original series for the first time and hoping viewers will be willing to pay for it ,High Maintenance  a web series on Vimeo about the many customers of a Brooklyn marijuana dealer  has won a devoted following and plenty of critical acclaim  Each of its first 13 episodes has been watched hundreds of thousands of times  The New Yorker raved that the show  freed of the constraints of formulas imposed by television schedules  radiates new ideas about storytelling But will viewers pay to watch it Vimeo  the video sharing web service owned by IAC  will release three new episodes of High Maintenance on Tuesday  The new episodes  each less than 20 minutes long  are  2 apiece  or  8 for a set that includes three more that will be released in January  This is the first time that Vimeo has funded the series directly  and represents the companys first push into original content  following a recent trend among larger digital companies such as Yahoo  Netflix and Amazon While Vimeos chief executive  Kerry Trainor  is betting that viewers will pay up  he says his ambitions go beyond generating a new source of revenue  He sees High Maintenance as the perfect show to be a foundation for a prestige television brand  and compares his sites developing identity to that of premium cable in the 1970s  an analogy in which YouTube plays advertising powered network television to Vimeos HBO We really feel like Vimeo is in the world to find a higher quality creator  delivering a different experience than what youd typically find on YouTube  Mr  Trainor said  Not to say that YouTube is bad  but Vimeo on the whole has much more of a premium cable and even a film sensibility  Thats what tends to do well on the platform Vimeos website is built to appeal to fans who favor the work of auteurs  The language of its on demand platform promotes the people behind the films almost as vociferously as the projects themselves  One prominent button  indicated by a smiley face  exhorts users to support creativity  explaining that most of the cash goes to the maker The push into original programming is one of several developments intended to reshape Vimeos revenue model  The service  which had 33 percent growth in both unique users and subscribers this quarter  recently announced that it would introduce a viewer subscription service next year   Current subscribers pay for the right to use the production tools offered on Vimeo Plus and Vimeo Pro  The sites on demand platform  introduced in March 2013  has almost 14 000 titles available for purchase  and its gross revenue has nearly doubled since last quarter Jessica Casano Antonellis  Vimeos director of communications  compared the on demand portion of the site to iTunes in that Vimeo is an open platform where anyone can upload and sell content directly For the creators of High Maintenance  the biggest fear may be that the shows audience will not be willing to pay for what they used to get free The psychology behind it is whats become interesting to us  said Katja Blichfeld  who writes and directs the show with her husband  Ben Sinclair  We havent experienced pushback yet  but there have been murmurings of people complaining about having to pay now For Ms  Blichfeld and Mr  Sinclair  the partnership with Vimeo is an experiment that could help pioneer a way for short form independent filmmakers to make money from their work You dont have to have some goliath managing your content and distributing it for you  Mr  Sinclair said  You can get rid of all those middlemen and just get a direct conversation between the artist and the audience Apart from helping write  direct and edit the show  Mr  Sinclair plays the marijuana dealer  For the most part  his presence is the only element that links individual episodes  otherwise  each focuses on a separate set of characters and tells a stand alone story  Episodes can vary sharply in tone  The short  comedic Olivia tells the story of two thieving gossips who come across as some of the very worst people in New York  a more meditative episode called Brad Pitts is a window into the life of a woman with stomach cancer On the show  drugs are rarely glamorized or used as a form of cheap titillation  Cheech and Chong this is not  Ms  Blichfeld and Mr  Sinclair have each used marijuana for 10 years plus  and their comfort with the drug is reflected in their characters  Mr  Sinclairs character  known simply as the guy  is not  for most viewers  a scuzzy criminal  but rather a humane  if somewhat dopey  evolution of the bartender  a 21st century version of Sam Malone from Cheers Though its creators insist that nothing about their approach has changed with the Vimeo partnership  other than their ability to finally pay collaborators what they deserve  faithful viewers will note an increased sophistication in the new episodes At its core though  the show remains the same  At a screening last week  a fan asked Mr  Sinclair what he and Ms  Blichfeld had been doing with all that Vimeo money Its what weve been doing  plus  Mr  Sinclair replied  Its not a new thing  And its been very comforting to be at Vimeo for that ,20141110,marijuana

8217 s Circuses  Triumphs and Shams,Elections were just held in the United States and Ukraine  and the world reflected on the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall ,The main event of the past week was  of course  the midterm elections  It was a Republican romp  far greater than any poll predicted  but for those watching it from abroad it was also a striking lesson in the enormous complexity  expense  passion and mystery of the democratic process as practiced in the worlds premier republic All robust democracies surround elections with a circus atmosphere of stump speeches  TV debates  ceaseless polls  ads and posters  But none can surpass the United States in the range of offices that come up for election every two years  from the entire House of Representatives to scores of senators  governors  judges  local legislators and prosecutors  or the resolutions on issues like legalizing marijuana  And few spend anywhere near as much  around  4 billion was spent on this election Its not all pretty  what with the prevalence of the attack ads and shameless lies  Nor is the mood of the American electorate understandable to a foreign observer  Why do American voters feel so strong a need to punish President Obama when the economy is in decent shape  unemployment is falling  most troops are home from foreign wars and the political gridlock in Washington is hardly his fault alone The apparent reason is that Americans are deeply dissatisfied with the way they are being governed  The departing Congress is widely reviled for its dysfunction  polarization and lack of achievement  and at times like this  people punish the president and his party  That may not seem fair or reasonable  but offering a legitimate channel for frustration and anger  and endowing the public with a sense that they can do something about it  is a key component of democracy Twenty five years ago  the people of East Berlin did something about their frustrations in a far different way  bursting through the wall that had physically denied them and millions of Eastern Europeans the most elemental freedoms With the approach of Sundays anniversary  however  many commentaries have focused on the dashed hopes and lost illusions of that joyous moment  Russia is again looming as a threat  China has found ways of combining authoritarian rule with economic might  the United States is widely perceived around the world as having misused its monopoly on superpower  the Middle East is locked in sectarian rivalries that spread vicious terror far beyond the region  and democracy appears on the defensive against populist challenges and economic troubles None of that should detract from the sheer joy that was Nov  9  1989  in Berlin  when people who had lived under the threat of repression for thinking the wrong thought or dreaming the wrong dream suddenly found themselves free  I was there that night  and at many of the other celebrations across Eastern Europe and  yes  Russia  that collectively came to be known as the Fall of the Wall Many recognized at the time that this was a plunge into the unknown  and many had fears and doubts about where it would all lead  But at the moment when the formidable forces of repression created by the Soviet Union and its minions retreated before the power of the human spirit  there could be only celebration  As there was  unforgettably  that night in Berlin  and as there should be on this anniversary Over the past 25 years we have learned that building democracy requires more than triumphant moments like that night in Berlin  or the many days and nights of the Arab Spring in Middle Eastern capitals  However exhilarating it may be to topple statues of dictators and sack the offices of the political police  these are symptoms of a failure of the social contract  and not a guarantee that a new one will work better  Democracy is institutions  a culture  a history  a process Meanwhile  in UkraineDemocracy is not what transpired in the sham elections held on Nov  2 in Donetsk and Luhansk  the Ukrainian cities and surrounding areas held by pro Russian separatists  Though many of the people who cast ballots may have honestly believed they were helping end the chaos in which theyve lived for more than half a year now  the elections called by leaders of the self proclaimed peoples republics served only to freeze the conflict  leaving residents in limbo The elections come a week after parliamentary elections in the rest of Ukraine  with a predictable victory for parties favoring a closer union with the West  The United States  the European Union and the United Nations refused to recognize the voting in the rebel territories  and the government in Kiev condemned it as a violation of a cease fire agreement laid out by President Vladimir V  Putin of Russia in September  One result was that Ukraine cut off all state funding to rogue territories Russia welcomed the elections  declaring that the peoples republics now had legitimate representatives to negotiate with Kiev on their future status  Moscow can also claim it is responding to legitimate demands for assistance when it funds and otherwise props up the rebel territories  NATO says hundreds of Russian troops are still inside eastern Ukraine training rebel soldiers For now  the net effect is that Russia has added two more unrecognized states and frozen conflicts to its collection  alongside South Ossetia  Abkhazia and Transnistria  That may suit President Putin just fine  but not his economy  The past week was the worst for the ruble in many years  dropping the Russian currency to all time lows against the dollar and the euro After the ElectionsEven if the midterm elections in the United States were not cause for celebration  given the sour mood of the electorate  the low turnout and the partisan attacks  they did demonstrate that there is a way to effect change other than through barricades or sham ballots The change may not be for the better this time around  It is possible that a Congress now fully in Republican hands will only deepen the ugly duel with the Democratic president that has so damaged Washington in recent years  But there will be new elections in two years It could also be that a lame duck president in need of a legacy  a Congress in need of salvaging its brand and a Republican Party looking two years ahead will find ways to cut some deals  Initial signals were mixed  but already on the day after the election there was talk of various walls that could be breached  like reforming the tax code  promoting trade and eliminating the budget deficit ,20141109,marijuana

Life of a Pot Critic  Clean  With Citrus Notes,Jake Browne  the first pot critic for The Denver Post  is paid to smoke marijuana and then write about the high ,DENVER  Jake Browne was seated in a yellow suede chair  carefully rotating a marijuana bud between his fingers  Im looking for bugs  mildew  things I wouldnt want to ingest  he said  leaning forward to hold the nickel size flower up to the light  He paused  then took a sip of water from a cup with a Miley Cyrus hologram down its side  This looks clean  he concluded Mr  Browne  31  held the bud up to his nose and inhaled  Then he opened his computer  Faint lemony sweetness  he typed  before loading the pot into a small glass pipe I usually will take one  maybe two hits  he said as he fired up the bowl  Im looking for how it burns  the taste  if its flushed well  meaning you dont want to taste the fertilizers or chemicals  He exhaled  waited and then turned to his computer again  Head high  No initial body effect  he wrote This is Mr  Brownes job  or  at least  one of his jobs  The longtime resident of Colorado  where marijuana has been legal since January  is a comedian  a producer and a founder  with his fiance  of a mail order subscription box for hemp products He is also the first pot critic for The Denver Post  Colorados oldest and largest daily newspaper  Which means that  every week  Mr  Browne takes a city bus from his home in Denvers Highland neighborhood  crosses a street called Green Court and lands at one of the citys downtown marijuana dispensaries to choose his product  Yes  he is paid to smoke it  and then write about the high The thing people say to me most often is  Dude  you must have the best job ever   said Mr  Browne  sitting in his living room  Its either that  or  if theyre from out of state  Can you send me pot  The Post has had two pot critics on its roster since it created a spinoff site  The Cannabist  in December   The newspaper is searching for a third  as well as a sex columnist to write about pot and intimacy  While adding the jobs  particularly for a mainstream newspaper  created something of a stir  Ricardo Baca  the newspapers newly appointed cannabis editor  and a longtime staff member  said it simply made journalistic sense  We have a restaurant critic and wine reviewers  he said  We have an award winning craft beer blog  From that logic you do need a pot critic  and maybe a few of them Mr  Brownes path into the role was unlikely  He grew up in Iowa  where  after high school  he tried his hand as a male model  Ashton Kutcher  another former model  was from his hometown  When that didnt work out  he moved to Colorado  I had just read On the Road   he said  and enrolled in a technical college  but dropped out  For the next few years he waited tables and worked as a bartender Pot wasnt legal for recreational use when he first got into the business  helping a friend who had opened a medical dispensary keep the books   They had been organizing files by first name  Mr  Browne said  laughing  He wasnt a big pot smoker  but liked the business side of it  He became the companys marketing director and general manager  started a blog and opened up a pot consulting business on the side He saw the ad for a pot critic on Facebook  where else  he joked  and replied with a visual rsum hed designed himself  complete with a giant photo of a piece of bacon  just for fun  he said  But it wasnt the swine that sold his editor  nor was it simply his writing  He was an authority on weed already  Mr  Baca said  He had valuable experience working inside the industry Mr  Browne also has a biological gift of sorts  He is a supertaster  That is  somebody who possesses more taste buds than the average person  at least according to an online survey he took In total so far  Mr  Browne has written 27 reviews  He critiqued a strain called Jack Flash  it practically jumped through my monitor and into my pipe  303 Kush  almost overwhelming  and wrote about a Willie Nelson themed varietal called Red Headed Stranger No  14  a little less mentally racy but with a strong overall high  And while his taste buds play a role in the critiques  certainly  there is more to it I think people underestimate cannabis  Mr  Browne said  You wouldnt walk into a restaurant and say  Ill have the wine  So why would you assume people would do that for cannabis  In the same way that pinot grigio and pinot noir may sound similar but are completely different  names like Lemon OG and Lemon Skunk are very different strains with very different flavor components and completely different highs A typical day for Mr  Browne likely starts by testing a few products  On this particular day  he spent the morning at three dispensaries  LoDo Wellness  on a street called Wazee  Euflora  also known as the Apple store for weed  though  as Mr  Browne pointed out  it actually looked more like a RadioShack  and finally  a shop called Good Chemistry The key to pot criticism  Mr  Browne said  is knowing your audience  While he tries to keep his language basic enough that a nonsmoker could understand it  I think pot needs smart people to be ambassadors to the masses  he said  he doesnt want to be condescending to those who do  I never want to be that pretentious pot critic  he said The reviews themselves have a certain formula  Mr  Browne begins with a physical description of the product  is it moist  with the THC visible  or a drier  less tightly packed bud  as well as the smell and taste  rubber and pepper dominate the jar like a bunch of green army men relegated to miniature mess hall duty  he wrote recently  of an unfortunately titled strain called Alien Napalm He will find out where the product was harvested  in Napalms case  a veganic grow  and tell the reader where he bought it  because each manufacturer has its own wacky strain names  Sometimes hell describe the sound of the bud firing up  snap  crackle  pop  or what  and how much  he ate after  apple juice and ants on a log  he said  referring to the childrens snack of raisins and peanut butter on top of celery The most important element of being a pot critic  though  is one that traditional food criticism may lack  at least in this much detail  how the product makes you feel  Seated in his living room testing out the Lemon Kush  Mr  Browne kept detailed notes from the moment he ingested  and observed how it moved through his body   When writing about Jack Flash  another strain  he once noted that it always gets me straight between the temples  With the Kush  he observed whether the pot relieved his headache  a little  and tracked  in painstaking detail  how the feeling of the high evolved In his accounting  Lemon Kush was relatively mellow  but a few months back  he had a different experience with a different strain  After the second hit  I was floored  No thoughts  just pure experience  An instant flow state  he wrote of the Red Headed Stranger No  14  Ten minutes later  he observed a sudden shift  Im a human coffee  spewing words like dark roasted drip In the spirit of service journalism  and  he said  what is pot criticism if not a service   each of Mr  Brownes reviews ends with a summary  Alien Napalm  for instance  he concluded is great for sleep  pain or increasing appetite  but never use it for an appetizer  The Red Headed Stranger is good for loosening of limbs and muscles  But if thats the effect youre going for  make sure to stay away from Green Crack   Im no physician  but this is as close as Ive come to marijuana induced A D D  he wrote No  being a pot critic doesnt pay the bills  nor does The Post reimburse him for the pot  But  Mr  Browne said  it beats working in a coffee shop  where  for what its worth  hed probably have to take a drug test I feel lucky to be this person in the middle of a historical moment  and I dont think well see anything really comparable to it  he said  finishing up his day at a taqueria down the street from his house  And  you know  I like pot  I think its a fun topic  Somebody has to cover it  So why cant I be that guy ,20141109,marijuana

risk alienation  and worse  when they diverge from the religious beliefs of those around them ,Atheists are a despised minority  According to a recent Pew survey  voters are warier of an atheist candidate than of a lesbian  an adulterer or an erstwhile marijuana user  At the same time  atheist pride is waxing in the United States  Atheist tracts share prominent space at airport bookstores with memoirs about dogs and inspirational volumes for aspiring C E O s  Atheist campus groups are multiplying  and polls show growing numbers of Americans identifying with the label What kind of young peoples literature can we expect in the early  heady days of a minority rights movement  Second wave feminism spawned some horrid writing  case in point  Jill Johnstons stream of consciousness Lesbian Nation  from 1973  but it primed readers to listen for a greater range of womens voices  in many ways making possible the current flourishing of American fiction  Three new novels feature teenage characters openly skeptical of Gods existence  with mixed results for readers  These books suggest that while the New Atheism  Teenage Edition  opens up some fresh possibilities for the Y A  novel  it may inevitably suffer its own growing pains Misdirected  by Ali Berman  is seemingly born more of anger against religious people than of interest in understanding them  When Bens mother gets a new job  the family moves from Boston to a conservative town in Colorado  Despite being fairly progressive  and irreligious  they enroll him in the far right Christian Heritage Academy  because it had a much better reputation than the public school  a choice that makes sense only to an author needing to chug along her anti Christian plot  Ben becomes a pariah for his atheist views  his only friends down low atheists and Tess  a neighbor and love interest  who is that rarity in town  an open minded  nonjudgmental Christian Tesss parents forbid her to consort with Ben  and the teachers at school are no friendlier  Theres a kind of campy comedy to the dialogue at Bens high school  Youre new here  Ben  his science teacher says  when Ben questions creationism  so youll need some time to adjust  He tells Ben to read up on proper biblical science  Because right now youre saying things that will get you a seat in detention       and in hell  And I dont think any of us want that  now do we Um  no  Ben sure doesnt  But he cant keep his New Englandy mouth shut  and hes run out of school  losing Tess in the process  He ultimately wins some redemption  and Tess  but the tied off ending is one implausibility among many  Most Christian high schools have a robust underground of doubters  and their teachers are surely tactically shrewd enough not to bludgeon a skeptic with threats of hell  at least not in his first week The first time 14 year old Jonathan Stiles meets Jesus Jackson  the spiritual contractor and title character of James Ryan Daleys novel  it is two hours after the body of Jonathans big brother  Ryan  was found  lifeless and broken  at the bottom of a 60 foot ravine behind St  Sorens  their high school  Jesus Jackson is a handsome  athletic visitor from another cosmos  or something  we never really know  he acts as a sort of spiritual familiar  counseling Jonathan as he tries to find meaning in a world without his brother If you take the odd  intermittent Jesus Jackson scenes out of the novel  which you really should  whats left is a rather engaging whodunit  as Jonathan searches for clues to Ryans death  The stock characters in Jesus Jackson are no less stock than those in Misdirected  but they at least have the courage of their teen melodrama convictions  Evil  drug using  pseudo Christian Alistair St  Claire is the best villain a young James Spader never got to play  and Jonathans sidekick  Henry  is a lonely nerd cut from an early draft of a John Hughes script Above all  Jesus Jackson contains some pretty good adolescent theologizing  It turns out that before he died  Ryan had indoctrinated Jonathan into atheism  In flashbacks  they discuss the contradictions in Scripture and the manifold problems in all man made religions  this must be the only young adult novel to make time for both Zoroastrianism and Unitarianism  Their spot on juvenile philosophizing will echo  and bolster  the late night thoughts of many teenage readers And given the fate that befalls Ryan  an eminently good guy  his musings on theodicy achieve an added poignancy  God cannot simultaneously be good  loving and all powerful  Ryan tells a priest  if the world he created dooms millions upon millions of its souls to an eternity of torture  Something has to go  Its for the young reader to decide what Like the narrator of Jesus Jackson  Matthew  the narrator of Ellen Hopkinss Rumble  has a dead brother  a devout mom and a cheating dad  like the narrator of Misdirected  he has a gay sibling  a Christian girlfriend and at one point an erection  boys in Y A  novels have more  and more visible  erections than boys in real life  In Rumble  Hopkinss trademark faux etry  familiar from Crank and her other popular books  at least elevates her description of Matthews erection  A sudden uncomfortable tug   Just south of my belt buckle reminds   me that a locker heavy hallway is so not   the place to think about such things    Glad I wore Jockeys today   By contrast  from Misdirected  Im just glad I already put my napkin on my lap Bullied after coming out as gay  Luke  Matthews brother  hanged himself  Matthew blames most everyone  including himself  and hes in the kind of depressive funk that makes high school counselors perk up  At the beginning of the novel  hes sent for guidance after writing an essay accusing God of genocide   We could in theory go all the way back to Noah  Meanwhile  his girlfriend  Hayden  has been growing closer to the Lord  leading Matthew  whos in the mood to sin  to grow closer to Haydens best friend  Alexa Haydens youth pastor  Judah  turns out to be a callous jerk  straight from evangelical central casting  Luke was weak  he tells Matthew about his dead gay brother  Suicide is the ultimate weakness of the mind        Homosexual behavior is weakness of the flesh  This sinister pastoral style is no more believable than at the high school in Misdirected  but here the cartoonish religion is played against

Million Push to Reduce Jail Sentences,The funding from George Soros s Open Society Foundations aims to slash an incarceration rate in the United States that has tripled since 1980 ,With a  50 million foundation grant  the largest in its history  the American Civil Liberties Union plans to mount an eight year political campaign across the country to make a change of criminal justice policies a key issue in local  state and national elections The goal of the campaign  financed by George Soross Open Society Foundations  is to slash an incarceration rate that has tripled since 1980  There are currently some 2 2 million prisoners in the United States The campaign aims to translate into state and federal policy a growing belief among many scholars  as well as of a coalition of liberal  conservative and libertarian political leaders  that the tough on crime policies of recent decades have become costly and counterproductive In that view  widespread drug arrests and severe mandatory sentences are doing more to damage poor communities  especially African American ones  than to prevent crime  and building ever more prisons that mostly turn out repeat offenders is a bad investment The campaign is likely to face strong opposition from some law enforcement officials  prosecutor groups and conservative experts who argue that tough sentencing policies have played an important role in driving down crime rates  The Republican electoral victories this week could also stiffen resistance to sweeping change The grant is going to the political arm of the A C L U  which has far more leeway to lobby for laws  run ads on television and finance political action committees to promote candidates than the groups larger  traditional branch  which relies more on litigation  As a result  the money is not tax deductible While the A C L U  has often been associated with liberal causes like ending the death penalty and promoting same sex marriage  Anthony D  Romero  the groups executive director  said the organization was building ties with conservative leaders promoting alternatives to incarceration and would not hesitate to aid Republican candidates who support needed steps I think criminal justice reform is one of the few issues where you can break through the partisan gridlock  Mr  Romero said  adding that the group would seek out Republican lobbying firms to help reach legislators In the latest example of converging views  conservatives including Newt Gingrich and B  Wayne Hughes Jr  a Christian philanthropist  joined the Soros led foundation and the A C L U  in support of Proposition 47  a California ballot measure to redefine many lower level felonies  including possession for personal use of hard drugs  as misdemeanors  The change  which passed by a wide margin on Tuesday  is expected to keep tens of thousands of offenders out of prison and save the state hundreds of millions of dollars each year The Koch brothers  major funders of conservative causes and candidates  have joined in  Koch Industries recently gave a grant of significant six figures to the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers to support the defense of indigents  said Mark Holden  senior vice president and general counsel at Koch Industries Whether the human cost or the societal cost  what were doing in the criminal justice system isnt working  Mr  Holden said  Were finding common ground with people with different political affiliations  he said  praising the advocacy work of the A C L U  in this field The A C L U  campaign will be directed by Alison Holcomb  who led the effort in Washington State to legalize marijuana The group plans to use ads to insert issues like drug policy  mandatory sentences and prison re entry into early primary states in the presidential elections  such as Iowa and New Hampshire  and then in key battlegrounds like Pennsylvania and Florida  Mr  Romero said It will also develop a state by state database describing who is in prison for what crimes and then target local politicians and prosecutors who promote what Mr  Romero called overincarceration Mr  Romero said the goal of the campaign was to reduce incarceration by 50 percent in eight years Todd R  Clear  a criminologist and the provost of Rutgers University Newark  said he agreed that the time was right for a major shift in justice policies  Efforts to reduce probation revocations and to lighten sentences  especially for nonviolent crimes  have already brought reductions or headed off growth in prisoner numbers in a number of states  he noted  while the federal government is reducing penalties for some drug crimes  although bipartisan bills that would overhaul federal sentencing did not pass this year But he cautioned that to achieve a decline anywhere near as steep as that proposed by the A C L U  far more politically contentious changes would be necessary Well have to make sentencing reforms for violent crime  too  he said  including major changes in drug laws and the multidecade sentences often imposed on violent or repeat offenders Mr  Soros and the Open Society Foundations have long promoted these kinds of changes in American criminal policies  investing roughly  175 million in them since 2004  plus an additional  62 5 million aimed at legalizing marijuana and reducing drug penalties I think you see a growing consensus that the criminal justice system in America is broken and this is a time to try new approaches  said Christopher Stone  president of the Open Society Foundations and a criminal justice expert  explaining why the group had made the large grant to the A C L U  at this time ,20141107,marijuana

Posing as Rikers Guard Smuggled In Contraband  Inquiry Finds,A report called on the New York City Correction Department to bolster screening at Rikers Island after an undercover investigator carried drugs and alcohol through checkpoints ,Despite repeated promises by the New York City Correction Department to tighten security at Rikers Island  an investigator posing as a guard last month was able to smuggle in heroin  pills  marijuana  vodka and a razor blade  a city inquiry found The investigator carried the contraband  valued at over  22 000  through six security checkpoints used by jail employees  hiding the drugs in his cargo pants and holding a water bottle filled with vodka  the Department of Investigation said in a report released on Thursday The revelations once again raised questions about the citys ability to address the widespread corruption and brutality at Rikers detailed in several critical reports by federal and local authorities as well as the news media  The Investigation Department has been urging the Correction Department for years to improve screening of jail employees but to no avail Weapons and narcotics remain easily available to any inmate with funds to pay for them  the report said The report called on the Correction Department to take steps to bolster screening  such as using drug sniffing dogs at employee entrances  Though the powerful correction officers union has long opposed such searches  the agencys commissioner  Joseph Ponte  told investigators that he would comply Investigators say that while visitors to city jails bring in some contraband  a large proportion of the illegal trafficking is carried out by uniformed guards and civilian employees  The report described the arrests of six officers and a nurse for contraband over the last year and a half Given the extent of smuggling that we know goes on and given what we know about whats coming in from visitors  a lot of stuff has to be coming in from guards and employees because this stuff doesnt magically appear  said Mark Peters  the commissioner for the Investigation Department On Sept  1  the Correction Department imposed what it described at the time as heightened security measures  including searching guards lunch containers  intended to go after smuggling by employees It turns out these steps were not sufficient  Mr  Peters said Last month  the undercover investigator  an employee with the Investigation Department  was able to sneak contraband into all six of the Rikers jails that he tried to enter  The pockets of his cargo pants  according to the report  were bulging with 250 packets of heroin  24 strips of Suboxone  a pain killer  and half a pound of marijuana Any kind of serious search by trained professionals should have caught this every time  Mr  Peters said At one jail  the undercover investigator set off the metal detector twice  When a security officer asked the investigator to empty his pockets  the undercover responded that he already had emptied them  the report said  The officer accepted his answer without further inspection of his pockets Mr  Peters said correction officers and civilian staff members often did not sell the drugs directly to inmates  Rather they served as couriers  shuttling contraband between people on the outside and the inmates for a fee that can range from  500 to  1 000 Mr  Ponte  in a statement  said he agreed with the Investigation Departments assessment that screening needed to be improved  I have zero tolerance for anyone  including staff  bringing contraband into D O C  facilities  he said  As part of D O C s ongoing systemwide reforms  we are working on significant new steps to improve our methods for searching for contraband In addition to the dogs  Mr  Ponte said that special operations officers would be posted at each entrance to inspect employees  replacing rank and file guards  There is also a plan to upgrade screening techniques to conform to federal airport security standards The report said the Correction Department had agreed to significantly enhance its security procedures The Department of Investigation said the drug sniffing dogs and new security teams should be put in place within six months  Mr  Peters said he expected that the dogs would be used for random searches at each of the 10 jails at Rikers several times a week  though he said Mr  Ponte would have the final say about the deployment of the canine units The success of the new security measures could depend in large part on the response from the correction officers union and its president  Norman Seabrook  In an interview last week  Mr  Seabrook said that even agreeing to the modest changes in September  including checking the lunches  caused friction with the rank and file I took some heat for it  he said In an emailed statement on Thursday  Mr  Seabrook did not say whether he supported the use of dogs and other new measures  He said he backed the enhanced procedures adopted in September  adding that they provide a safe working environment for everyone There will always be those in any organization that scam the system  he said  We will do everything to bring about the change needed to protect them  the inmates and nonuniformed staff equally For the report  the investigation agency observed 15 shift changes and reviewed 50 hours of surveillance video from June through October  monitoring the entry of over 2 500 employees Even after the heightened security measures imposed in September  the report said that some officers still refused to have their food X rayed or were allowed to place their lunch containers on top of the X ray machines without having them scanned Security officers also permitted some people to enter even though they set off the metal detectors  the report said Having observed screening procedures for six weeks  the report said  it is clear to D O I  that such compliance will not be achieved absent additional drastic interventions Mr  Peters said he expected that his investigators would continue to monitor the security procedures at Rikers and possibly make more arrests Narcotics trafficking within Rikers is not just bad because weve got prisoners taking narcotics  Mr  Peters said  Its bad because it leads to violence  Its bad because it leads to uncontrollable inmates  Its the root cause of a wider set of problems that also need to be dealt with ,20141107,marijuana

May Have Missed It  but There Was an Election Debate on Criminal Justice Reform ,Voters did not hear much about criminal justice reform during the midterm election  but several ballot propositions passed across the country to reform the system ,It is no secret that the United States prison population surpassesthat of any other nation  that the country has very harsh sentencing laws for minor offenses  and that  as many argue  the inherent racial bias in the system is powerful and detrimental to society Its an issue that  as Inimai Chettiar and Abigail Finkelman of the Brennan Center for Justice put at The Daily Beast seems ripe for genuine bipartisan cooperation  However  they say  the debate wasabsent from the 2014 campaign trail perhaps because it was less controversial  or because candidates feared being seen as soft on crime  This silence creates the risk that a moment of promise will become a missed opportunity for change But even though candidates avoided any national discussion of the pressing issue  some ballot initiatives could yet influence the criminal justice system Voters in California decided to pass Proposition 47  a measure aiming to reclassify as misdemeanors rather than felonies the personal possession of a number of illegal drugs  and the theft of property valued at  950 or less  The measure will also result in resentencing thousands of inmates We hope were setting a precedent for the nation  Lynne Lyman  the state director of the Drug Policy Alliance  told The Los Angeles Times Although it was overshadowed by other propositions on the states ballot  the measure has divided some of the nations highest lawmakers  and along unusual lines The proposition was supported by a five major foundations  The Los Angeles Times reports  including Vote Safe  bankrolled by the billionaire and backer of progressive causes George Soros  Brad Pitt  Jay Z and Cameron Diaz are part of Artists for 47  a group of Hollywood actors and rock stars standing behind the proposition The actress Olivia Wilde writes for the Huffington Post that she supports the measure as a mother  sympathetic to the women who face steeper obstacles than men in rebuilding their lives after leaving prison  Some of the funds saved on reducing the number of prisoners would go toward K 12 education Conversely  from  50 million to  100 million of the savings would be funneled each year into mental health care and drug treatment  Democratic State Senator Darrell Steinbergwrote  along with Rusty Selix  an op ed for The Sacramento Bee focusing on the propositions impact on the ill and addicted  Mr  Steinberg decries Californias approach to mental health programs  including massive cuts  By failing to invest in local treatment and recovery options  it is  sadly  no surprise that people with mental health needs have ended up in our jails  courts and prisons Joining Mr  Steinberg  Ms  Wilde and Mr  Pitt were allies from a wholly different world Senator Rand Paul  Republican ofKentucky  a vocal proponent of criminal justice reform  writes for The Orange County Register with B  Wayne Hughes Jr  a conservative California billionaire  that they were surprised at the number of people asking them why  as Republicans  were they working to change our criminal justice system  Why wouldnt we  Mr  Rand and Mr  Hughes say that the system must be changed  because it drains tax dollars  destabilizes families and  worse  isnt making us any safer Using similar language of the fiscally conservative  Newt Gingrich  the former Republican speaker of the House  also came out supporting the measure andalso writing with Mr  Hughes Reducing wasteful corrections spending and practices is long overdue in California  Mr  Gingrich and Mr  Hughes write  pointing out that while the crime rates are similar  the number of inmates is five times larger than it was 50 years ago  And as Californians know  the states prison system ballooned over the last few decades and became so crowded that federal judges have mandated significant reductions Coming out against the proposition were representatives of Californias law enforcement and voices from both sides of the aisle Writing for Fox News  WilliamWhalen  a research fellow at the Hoover Institution  calls the early release initiative a roll of dice meets ticking time bomb Referring to the existing measures that enable the early release of those convicted of child endangerment or short sentences for spousal abuse  Mr  Whalen writes  Such could be Californias future  revolving door justice that fails at protecting the endangered Californias Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein agreed in anop ed for The Los Angeles Daily News that the proposition would not make the state any safer  She points out that stealing a firearm worth less than  950 would be  for instance  classified as a misdemeanor  She writes that the measure would ultimately lead to the release of thousands of dangerous criminals  and a wholesale reclassification of many dangerous felonies as misdemeanors would put the people of California at continued risk going forward The California Police Chiefs Associationstarted a campaignagainst the initiative In the end  after shattering some ideological divides  Proposition 47 passed  proving the bipartisan nature of calls for reforming the criminal justice system It was not the only proposition to pass that ostensibly veers away from the tough on crime stance  Nicole Flatow at Think Progress writes that by supporting these ballots  voters sent a signal that they were ready to reform the system As part of a larger bipartisan push  voters inNew Jersey supported a bail reformthat would ensure that who was kept behind bars depended on the severity of their crime  and not their income Washington  D C  Oregon and Alaska voted to legalize the recreational use of marijuana  which could lead to fewer people in the countrys overcrowded prisons  Ms  Flatow points out that the messages of support for these measures were entirely different in libertarian Alaska  the message focused on the relative safety of marijuana abuse  while in Washington  the vote depended on a significant population of very liberal gentrifiers mixed with longtime African American residents who are sick and tired of criminal justice policies that arrest African Americans for pot at eight times the rate of whites It seems that despite political apathy and partisan polarization  it is possible for Americans to agree on a big issue even if for different reasons ,20141106,marijuana

in Politics,What might happen in the final months of a Democratic led Congress ,Good Thursday morning from Washington  where President Obama met with reporters and didnt seem like someone whose party had just suffered near historic losses  and Republicans skipped ahead to 2016 by blaming Hillary Rodham Clinton for bringing down Democrats  But first  lets look at what might happen in the final months of a Democratic led Congress Republicans may have thrashed them on Tuesday  but Democrats will still hold power in the Senate until the end of the year  And the maneuvering is well underway for what will or wont get done in the lame duck session that begins next week These final days present Democrats with a chance to take care of a few agenda items that will be difficult  if not impossible  to accomplish under the coming Republican Congress  moving on stalled nominations perhaps  And Republicans will have the opportunity to dispose of a few headaches before they start fresh in the new year Top aides to Senator Harry Reid  still the majority leader for the moment  and Speaker John A  Boehner have been going over their plans for the session Republicans want to find a way to finance the government through next September to take those sticky spending issues off the table for a while  They also hope to extend a series of business tax breaks One issue involves a Pentagon policy bill  If it gets to the floor  it could inspire a flood of amendments on contentious issues like border security  presidential action on immigration and Ebola preparedness And considering Senator Mitch McConnells promise as the prospective new majority leader to allow free flowing amendments next year  it could be a preview of whats to come  Carl HulseIt was like watching someone who has had the weight of the world lifted from his shoulders Maybe it was the fact that President Obama will never be held responsible for another election  Maybe it was because he could stop going to so many fund raisers  Or perhaps he was relieved that he could move on his agenda without the fear of offending voters Whatever the reason  the president was relaxed  calm  cheery  even  as he faced reporters on Wednesday  He said it more than once  I am really optimistic about America  The election results  he said  were disappointing It doesnt make me mopey  he added  It energizes me After a similar drubbing four years ago  a grim Mr  Obama seemed burdened by the sagging economy  by the election losses of many friends in the House who had just helped him pass the health care law  and by his own management failures His tone was then reflective  acknowledging that presidents can lose track of the ways that we connected with folks that got us here in the first place  Losing control of the House was a shellacking that had taught him lessons There was none of that on Wednesday  Instead  he was upbeat and expressed an eagerness to work with Republicans when he could and around them when he must Some critics will say he was not sufficiently contrite Mr  Obama just might not care  Michael D  ShearPresident Obama will posthumously award the Medal of Honor to First Lt  Alonzo H  Cushing of the Army for conspicuous gallantry during the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863 Michelle Obama and Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  will join the president in the evening for In Person at the White House

from pinning the Democrats losses on her  And why not  President Obama  after all  will not be on any ballot in 2016 Voters were very clear  Reince Priebus  chairman of the Republican National Committee  told a news media gathering in Washington  They want nothing to do with the policies of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky  who  like Mrs  Clinton  seems to be preparing for a presidential run in 2016  was also having a little fun at her expense Before all the votes had been counted  he put together a Facebook album titled  HillarysLosers featuring photographs of Mrs  Clinton with  among others  Alison Lundergan Grimes of Kentucky  Representative Bruce Braley of Iowa and Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina  all of whom were defeated on Tuesday Voters sent a message to President Obama and Hillary Clinton  rejecting their policies and many of their candidates  Mr  Paul wrote Not that Mrs  Clinton was among those rejected candidates  Thats on

8217 s Broken Politics,We painlessly inherited democracy  but by allowing political dysfunction to set in  we ve botched it ,Lets face it  The American political system is broken The midterm elections were a stinging repudiation of President Obama  but Republicans should also feel chastened  A poll last year found Congress less popular than cockroaches So congratulations to those members celebrating election victories  But our democratic institutions are in trouble when they cant outpoll cockroaches  Which didnt even campaign Politics is the noblest of professions  President Eisenhower said in 1954  and politics in the past often seemed a bright path toward improving our country  President Clinton represented a generation that regarded politics as a tool to craft a better world  and President Obama himself mobilized young voters with his gauzy message of hope  He presented himself as the politician who could break Washingtons gridlock and get things done  and weve seen how well that worked Im in the middle of a book tour now  visiting universities and hearing students speak about yearning to make a difference  But they are turning not to politics as their lever but to social enterprise  to nonprofits  to advocacy  to business  They see that Wendy Kopp  who founded Teach for America in her dorm room at Princeton University  has had more impact on the education system than any current senator  and many have given up on political paths to change A national exit poll conducted by Edison Research found that a majority of voters disapproved of Republicans and Democrats alike  and only 20 percent trust Washington to do whats right most or all the time President Obama is licking his wounds in the White House  and he doesnt seem to accept that the election is a judgment on his presidency  Im sorry  When Democrats lose in Colorado and struggle in Virginia  when voters say theyre sending a message to the White House  its time for Obama to shake up his staff  reach out beyond his insular circle of longtime aides  and recalibrate Critics are right that he should try harder to schmooze with legislators  although Im skeptical that Republicans are that charmable  After all  some polls have shown more than a third in the Republican Party said he was born abroad and about one fifth suspected that he could be the antichrist Yet its not just Obama who is looking ragged today  The entire political system is  Political scientists Nolan McCarty  Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal have charted the attitudes of the political parties back to 1879  and they found party polarization in recent years to be greater than at any time since their charts began Thats partly because Democrats have become more liberal  but mostly because Republicans have become more conservative  indeed  more conservative than at any time since 1879 Politicians have also figured out what works for their own careers  playing to their base  denouncing the other side  and blocking rivals from getting credit for anything  Since many politicians are more vulnerable in a primary than in a general election  theres not much incentive for compromise After Obama took office  Republicans assiduously tried to block him  even shutting down the federal government  Republican governors prevented their own citizens from getting health insurance through federally financed Medicaid  I see that as obstructionism  but it paid off in these midterms Bravo to Obamas comments Wednesday about trying to cooperate with Republicans on issues including early education  But Im not holding my breath  Incentives today militate against bipartisan cooperation  and thats one reason the current Congress is on track to be the least productive in the post World War II era Maybe we taxpayers could save money by paying members of Congress not by salary but by the piece  so much for each enacted law One bright spot in the midterms was voter action on ballot measures  They did actually break the gridlock  Oregon  Alaska and the District of Columbia legalized marijuana in some situations  Five states supported an increase in the minimum wage  Washington State approved universal background checks for gun purchases  California reduced prison sentences So even if politicians are stalemated  voters managed to get things done  Yet we also get the national government we deserve  and thats an indictment of all of us I find Americas political dysfunction particularly sad because Ive spent much of my journalistic career covering people risking their lives for democracy  and sometimes dying for it  from Taiwan to Ukraine  Congo to South Korea  It was 25 years ago that I saw people massacred near Tiananmen Square for demanding political change  They risked their lives because they dreamed that democracy would improve their lives and give them greater freedom and dignity For those of us in the United States it was easy  We painlessly inherited democracy  yet Im afraid weve botched it ,20141106,marijuana

Year of Unforeseen Hits,John Moffitt abruptly retired from the N F L  a year ago  and the transition to life outside the sports bubble has been rocky ,SEATTLE  John Moffitt spent 20 years to reach the pinnacle of his profession  a day to ditch that job and a year grappling with the consequences of his decision A year ago this week  Moffitt  a little known offensive lineman for the Denver Broncos  made national news when he abruptly retired  giving up about  1 million in pay  a potential trip to the Super Bowl and a high profile lifestyle envied by millions of Americans Battered by injuries  tired of the grinding routines and sapped of the passion that had driven him since he began playing as an 8 year old  Moffitt walked away from the N F L  with no plan other than to explore life beyond football Moffitts leap was praised by the leagues detractors  who applauded his willingness to lift the veil on a brutal sport that puts players in harms way for profit and to push back against societys expectations for professional athletes  To the N F L s many backers  Moffitt was a nave idealist who did not know his own luck and would lament his decision Moffitt  who lives in Seattle  said he had no regrets  Yet his journey into retirement at 27 has been a cautionary tale of how unprepared some professional athletes  even those with money  a four year college degree and a supportive family  are for life outside the sports bubble Leaving the N F L  on your choice is a transition I hadnt even realized  Moffitt said last week  a day before his 28th birthday  I thought if I made the choice  it would be easy  Im dealing with the fallout That fallout started immediately  Moffitts life was abuzz for weeks after he told the Broncos president  John Elway  that he was done playing  Besieged with interview requests  he told reporters that playing in the N F L  made him feel like a commodity and that the risk of further damage was no longer worth the money or adulation Yet after the attention faded  Moffitt struggled to replace the structure that defined his football life  with its predictable rhythms and ready made circle of friends  He produced podcasts  did some public speaking and worked with a writer to shape his thoughts into a book  He went for a screen test and developed a stand up comedy routine about life as a player that he has performed live And he partied  Unshackled from the weekly schedules built around Sunday games  he was free to smoke marijuana  binge drink with college buddies and experiment with harder drugs  His relationship with his girlfriend soured  so he took to the road  staying with his parents in Connecticut and meeting up with friends in Los Angeles  Miami  New York and beyond Just before St  Patricks Day  he hit bottom  After a day of drinking with friends in Chicago  he ended up alone in a basement club  A bouncer spotted him with a sunglasses case that was filled with a gram of cocaine  10 grams of marijuana and four ecstasy pills  A scuffle ensued  and he was arrested and charged with battery and three counts of drug possession  He was released on his own recognizance a half day later The night in jail woke him up  Not only did he face more time in jail  but the story of his arrest was splashed on the Internet  His relationship with his girlfriend dissolved and book publishers withdrew interest in his story It was like I jumped off a cliff  Moffitt said of his arrest and the negative publicity that followed  Those opportunities fell by the wayside  But it also sent me in a different direction Before the drug charges were dismissed and he pleaded guilty to the other charge  he was fined  254  Moffitt enrolled in Passages  a high end rehabilitation clinic in Malibu  Calif  There  he weaned himself off drugs and alcohol and let go of the pressure he felt to meet the expectations that others had for him  though fellow residents at the clinic quizzed him unendingly about his life in the N F L The biggest thing was that I realized so many people were depending on me  and I felt that my only value is my production as a football player  he said  Whether it was expectations or money or the way I live  if I dont meet everyones expectations  Im a loser  It is out of love  but I felt like I was holding up this huge support system that was supposed to be my support system Moffitts roller coaster ride is not uncommon  said Bahati VanPelt  the executive director of the Trust  a group funded by the N F L  and players union that helps players after they retire  Players spend much of their childhood and their adult lives fixated on football and devote little time to developing skills that will help them afterward Three quarters of players drafted in the N F L  are gone within four years  either through injury or because they were cut  and they may feel they have failed or are too proud to ask others for help  Some players live away from those who could provide medical and psychological support  and some may not have saved much money Ever since they were in high school  players are told not to worry about the next play  only this play  said VanPelt  who added that making the transition to life outside the N F L  could take from three months to two years  They were an expert in their field  and suddenly theyre expected to be an expert in other fields Moffitt is still unsure of how he will make a living  though he is interested in the film industry  He has considered driving an Uber cab and doing more standup comedy  In a few months  he said he would leave Seattle and his circle of football friends to start fresh in a new city  He is spending time with Sean Pamphilon  who has made documentaries about football players and witnessed their ups and downs Theres a duality to John that Im sure you understand  Hes incredibly funny  or he really wants to go inside himself and disappear  Pamphilon said  Im excited to see how he can use his brain while not getting it beaten in By some standards  Moffitt  who joked that he had outlived Jimi Hendrix  Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison  three of his musical heroes  who all died at 27  is more fortunate than many players  He is single and has no children  and he worked with a financial adviser to put away money while he played  He moved into a smaller townhouse in Renton  not far from where the Seahawks  who drafted him in 2011  have their practice facility He is also close with his parents  who loved that their son had made it to the N F L  and were taken aback when he walked away from the game  After Moffitt was arrested  his father did not give him any ultimatums but made it clear that it was up to him to change his behavior I said  I love you and will visit you in jail  but I dont want to have to visit you in jail   David Moffitt said  I told him  Youre at a crossroad  there is no in between  Moffitts father said his son was no angel  and he said he recognized that John had partied too much but said  You put it under the rug  Ultimately  he said he was happy that John was at peace with his decision Hes much more relaxed and not jacked up all the time  the elder Moffitt said  He doesnt have any regrets  and I dont either ,20141106,marijuana
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/opinion/from-marijuana-to-gun-control-liberal-initiatives-passed.html,http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png,In Red and Blue States  Good Ideas Prevail ,In many states  voters approved ballot measures that were directly at odds with the positions of many Republican candidates who won ,The Democratic brand did not fare well  to put it mildly  in congressional and governors races on Tuesday  Most were contests of political blame  driven by ideological hatred for President Obama  But when the ballot offered a choice on an actual policy  rather than between candidates with a D or R next to their names  voters made notably liberal decisions in both red and blue states On at least six high profile and often contentious issues  minimum wage  marijuana legalization  criminal justice reform  abortion rights  gun control and environmental protection  voters approved ballot measures  in some cases overwhelmingly  that were directly at odds with the positions of many of the Republican winners MINIMUM WAGE Initiatives to raise the minimum wage appeared on the ballots in four deep red states  Alaska  Arkansas  Nebraska and South Dakota  and passed in all of them  The new hourly minimums range from  8 50 in Arkansas by 2017 to  9 75 in Alaska by 2016  Minimum wage increases were also approved in San Francisco  to  15 an hour by 2018  and Oakland  to  12 25 an hour by 2015  In all  an estimated 609 000 low wage workers will see raises from these approved increases In addition  voters in Illinois and in several cities and counties in Wisconsin approved nonbinding measures calling for minimums of  10 or more  If legislators follow through on the voters will  1 1 million workers in those states would see raises The latest increases bring to 29 the number of states that exceed  or soon will exceed  the paltry federal minimum of  7 25 an hour  which has been in place since 2009  They underscore the broad support for higher minimums and suggest that Republicans who continue to oppose a higher federal minimum could pay a price in the 2016 elections  when lower wage workers and those who support them could turn out in higher numbers MARIJUANA  Oregon and Alaska became the third and fourth states to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes  Colorado and Washington were the first two  while the District of Columbia repealed all criminal and civil penalties for possession and allowed limited  private cultivation of the drug Even where pro legalization measures lost  advocates had reason to feel positive  A proposed constitutional amendment in Florida to legalize medical marijuana received 57 percent of the vote  but it still failed because amendments there require at least 60 percent approval Before Tuesdays election  it was already clear that Americans had turned against prohibition because more than 30 states had liberalized their marijuana laws  Maybe elected officials  who have lagged behind the public on this issue  will finally have the courage to embrace change CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM For the second time in three years  Californians voted to shorten the sentences of people serving time in prison  The state  which created the notorious three strikes law  remains under federal court order to reduce prison overcrowding In 2012  voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 36  which has led to the early release of more than 1 900 three strikers serving life in prison  And there has not been an increase in crime  Proposition 47 on this weeks ballot converts low level drug and property offenses  like shoplifting  writing bad checks or simple drug possession  from felonies to misdemeanors  It is expected to reduce the sentences of as many as 10 000 inmates On Tuesday  the measure  which enjoyed broad bipartisan support  passed with more than 58 percent of the vote  Many politicians are still afraid of looking soft on crime  but Californias experience shows that voters can lead the way ABORTION RIGHTS The overwhelming rejection of personhood measures in Colorado and North Dakota dealt another well deserved blow to the effort by some opponents of reproductive rights to ban all abortions  and some common forms of contraception  by passing laws giving fertilized eggs legal rights and protections that apply to individuals The defeat in Colorado was not unexpected  Voters there handily quashed earlier personhood initiatives in 2008 and 2010  and they were not deceived by this rounds revised wording  But few expected a similar proposal to be rejected by 64 percent of voters in North Dakota  a conservative state that  like Mississippi  which roundly defeated a personhood initiative three years ago  has just one abortion provider remaining Unfortunately  opponents of abortion rights scored a victory in Tennessee  where nearly 53 percent of voters approved a state constitutional amendment that gives the Republican led State Legislature leeway to curtail access to safe and legal abortion care  While nothing will change immediately  there will likely be a rush to enact new abortion restrictions beyond those already in place in the months ahead  But politicians in Tennessee would be wrong to read Tuesdays relatively close vote as a mandate to obliterate a womans fundamental right GUN CONTROL In the aftermath of the school massacre in 2012 in Newtown  Conn  Congress  caving to the National Rifle Association  did nothing to protect the public from gun violence  In Washington State  a campaign started by outraged church and community leaders fared much better  Initiative 594  which will require criminal and mental health checks on gun buyers  drew an impressive 60 percent voter support on Tuesday Just as important  the gun lobbys measure  Initiative 591  which was on the same ballot  would have blocked background checks and was defeated by 55 percent of the vote  Other campaigns are underway at the statehouse level  supported by former New York City mayor Michael Bloombergs well financed gun safety movement and others  Opponents decried Mr  Bloombergs campaign as outside interference but got nowhere this time CONSERVATION Environmentalists who may be singing the blues over the election results can take heart from approval of a record  13 billion in land conservation measures in states and cities across the country  Two were especially significant In Florida  a constitutional amendment will dedicate  9 billion in real estate transfer taxes over the next 20 years to preserving open spaces  including major investments in the threatened Everglades New Jersey voters dedicated  2 15 billion in corporate tax revenue to land conservation  also over the next 20 years  rescuing a popular program that was on the verge of extinction  The message for President Obama is that the public will support executive actions to protect threatened wilderness  even if Congress does not ,20141106,marijuana

Conservatory in the Kitchen    ,The writer discovered a warm  light filled place where he could grow herbs and vegetables year round  It s called his condo ,ST  PAUL  Two years ago  Elizabeth Millard discovered a way to put fresh produce into car food  No  shes not the one who smuggled shredded lettuce into the Doritos Cheesy Gordita Crunch Fiery  a 490 calorie  zero noun snack from Taco Bell  Rather  Ms  Millard  a sustainable farmer outside the Twin Cities  did something even more unlikely  she grew a crop of microgreens on the passenger side floor mat of her 2005 VW Beetle convertible We were shuttling our box of seeds back and forth from our rented greenhouse space to our house  she said the other day  And I tripped and they fell all over the place  Cress  mustards  a little purple mizuna Ms  Millard added  Being frustrated and lazy  I decided I would clean them up some time in my lifetime  Which means never It rained the next day  Ms  Millard  now 46  and Karla Pankow  her partner in life and in their C S A  business  called Bossy Acres  tracked mud into the car  After that  the June sun busted loose and they threw down the top  I think you can see where this is going About five days after the incident  I came out to my car in the morning and there was a beautiful flush carpet of microgreens on the passenger side  Ms  Millard said  It looked like a Chia Pet The accident fed the philosophy behind her new book Indoor Kitchen Gardening  Turn Your Home Into a Year Round Vegetable Garden  Cool Springs Press  This is a how to guide that describes Ms  Millards experiments raising crops  sun loving outdoor plants like herbs  carrots  radishes  potatoes and tomatoes  in her Minneapolis bungalow I  for one  have daydreamed about owning a conservatory  a bright  climate controlled growing space with windows  supplemental lights and a handy watering source  And here was Ms  Millard to tell me that I already possessed such a space  and it was called my condo You dont have to be a plant whisperer to enjoy success in this endeavor  Although  occasionally  you do have to be the bee  In a quest for bug less indoor pollination  Ms  Millard stimulated the tomatos reproductive parts with her electric toothbrush   Talk about forbidden fruit  But what she discovered  and what the book illustrates  is that its possible and even easy to cultivate shoots  greens and the odd root crop with almost no special equipment The VW microgreens did not become the stuff of a piquant salad  I cant imagine the carpet of your car is a food safe environment  Ms  Millard said   What vinaigrette goes with road salt  Instead  it became a proof of concept  The lesson is  Dont worry about it so much  Ms  Millard said of her indoor garden  If the conditions are right  it will happen In many ways  the gardening conditions in the northland are best suited to ornamental berries  red barked shrubs and alcoholism  The professional eschatologists  known elsewhere as meteorologists  were predicting scattered frosts for the night after Ms  Millard paid me a house call  It was early September The parsley and sage in my backyard could hang on until Thanksgiving  But if I didnt bring the basil inside now  I wouldnt see it again until May or June While I was outside  I noticed a volunteer tomato seedling and a stray mint  What would be the harm in digging them up and converting them into house pets   Ms  Millard recommends converting the garage or a three season porch into a kind of halfway house where the plants can get acclimated I asked Ms  Millard about what may still be growing at her house across town  But she had moved out soon after finishing a draft of the book  While she and Ms  Pankow shopped for farmland of their own  they were dwelling in a downscale version of that VW Microgreen  a 25 year old Coachman fifth wheel camper they bought from friends for  2 000  The quarters were homey  a previous owner had gone through the effort of painting the wallpaper Its surprisingly spacious  she said  Its like a New York apartment Except  presumably  in New York it would have cost  2 65 million in an all cash transaction and another  1 million for a parking spot Ms  Millard has good news for the yardless metropolitan  Much of the equipment you need for indoor kitchen gardening is already in the kitchen  Sprouts should grow in a Mason jar with a screen lid for air and drainage  Soak the seeds  Ms  Millard likes the flavor of broccoli  Then  after a day or two  turn the jar upside down and wait Are the white filaments edible food or some type of brassica thrush  Ms  Millard was noncommittal  I will sprout things if people ask me to  she said  But I have not been a huge fan Farther down in the cupboards  pie plates or baking sheets make satisfactory planters to grow microgreens or shoots  At the start  plastic wrap can keep the seeds humid  You may even have the shoot seeds in the bulk bin  say  dried peas  raw sunflower seeds or untreated popcorn Germination isnt a sign of spoilage  its the goal here  Ms  Millard recommends soaking the seeds for a day or two beforehand  changing the water now and again  If you leave them longer than that  theyll give off a really vile smell  she said  like burning moldy feet  At this point  youre not raising food but developing a biological weapons program The easiest indoor gardening projects look a lot like seed starting  You dont need much dirt  an inch and a half for sprouts  and maybe half an inch for microgreens  a regular lettuce mix  harvested early  You can do that on a paper towel  she said  Theyre not going to grow into their fullest expression of what they could be  But then  who among us hasnt thought about their own dirt nap and harbored the same self doubt Ms  Millard had dragged a full bag of vermiculite as big as a pillowcase up the three flights of stairs  This  of course  was a bit of a sight gag  the white filler looks like Styrofoam and weighs no more  The idea was to mix it with a bagged organic compost she likes  called Cowsmo  But any indoor potting mix with a little fertilizer would do You want something that drains really well  Ms  Millard said  Dirt from your garden is too dense  As a no pesticide farmer  she welcomed the chance for a clean start  Theres a book to be written about how to breed common garden bugs in the house  but lets leave that to the newspapers entomology expert Ms  Millard totes a stack of 20 inch black plastic planting flats almost everywhere she goes  the same way a real estate agent seems to bleed a trail of lawn signs  Get the ones with the bottom watering slits and the translucent lids  They are a masterful piece of industrial design  they cost about  1 50 each and they look just like garbage A Pyrex casserole dish makes a smarter display  It may help with the drainage to put a low layer of gravel in the bottom  Ms  Millard said  prepping the planter  A few handfuls of soil mix flew into the trays  She was no more delicate with the pea seeds and the popcorn kernels  scattering a single layer over the surface  Being housebound  they wouldnt need a coat of dirt on top Youll want to sow at the kind of density you would see in front of the stage at Bonnaroo  Once the sprouts come up  Ms  Millard said  you could have someone crowd surf without falling in At this point  Ms  Millard mentioned a piece of look for it in the basement gear  a box fan  A little airflow helps ward off disease and stiffens a plants resolve My summer corn crop in the yard had been a mixed success  By that I mean it was a success for the squirrels that stripped the stalks clean and a total failure for me  who waited 80 days and got nothing Depending on your conditions in here  after about two weeks you should be able to harvest them  Ms  Millard said  Cut them like youre giving them the worst haircut in the world I said  I think Ive given someone that haircut Ms  Millard said  I think Ive had that haircut What about lights  This is the question that every lay agronomist seems to ask  Ms  Millard said  Its as if she has proposed a suspect workaround  school without homework  say  or an affair without text messaging  I mean  sex Ms  Millard dutifully runs through the options in the book  A window with southern exposure will get you somewhere  But the plant will need to be close to the pane  where conditions may be drafty  Incandescent bulbs give off more heat than light  Ms  Millard doesnt spend too much time on specialty lighting systems  HID  LED or plasma  This kind of expertise and budget are the province of the marijuana cultivator  We have a lot to learn from them Ultimately  Ms  Millard recommends cheap shop lights  with full spectrum bulbs  t5 or t8  and reflective hoods  The adjustable fixtures are better still  You can start them a couple of inches above the newly sprouted seeds and raise them as your plants grow Wed moved on to planting herbs and root crops  Untreated potatoes from the farmers market would turn into suitable plants  Just wait for the eyes to form  Ms  Millard suggested putting five or six in a 15 gallon pot  They should get some light during the day  she said  But  potatoes do well with the whole benign neglect situation  Theyre like children that way Rounded carrots and radishes wouldnt outgrow their Procrustean beds  She mentioned French baby carrots  carefully bred in France  and a favorite radish called Parisienne  which had the soul of a carrot  Alas  indoors  they would grow about as fast as the European economy  Carrots take forever  Ms  Millard said  About two months  if youre lucky In the end  she harvested maybe 10 carrots  not the kind of bounty to run through a juicer  When you spend that much time and love  she said  you slice them up and eat them raw like carpaccio She wouldnt blame anyone who concluded that indoor kitchen gardening is impractical  Theres something of the hobbyist to it  she said Before I forget  then  heres a reminder  In New York City  the outdoor planting date for carrots is only 150 days away ,20141106,marijuana

Minimum Wage Passes in 4 States  Florida Defeats Marijuana Measure,Voters approved higher minimum wages in Alaska  Arkansas  Nebraska and South Dakota  A proposal to allow medical marijuana failed in Florida ,onalVoters in four states on Tuesday supported measures to raise their minimum wages  bringing the number of states that have passed such laws to 29 and reflecting widespread dissatisfaction with Congresss failure to increase the federal minimum of  7 25 Residents of Washington  D C  and Oregon voted to allow recreational use of marijuana  following the lead of Colorado and Washington State  But in Florida  a hotly contested measure to expand the use of marijuana for medical treatment  now permitted in 23 states  failed narrowly  Though a majority of voters approved the measure  the margin fell short of the 60 percent it needed to pass Support for low wage workers and marijuana legalization were just two issues among the many that voters considered in 146 state ballot measures in 41 states  covering such topics as genetically modified food  the right to bear arms and the right to bait bears In Massachusetts  voters upheld by a wide margin a 2011 law to allow casino gambling  after heavy spending by gambling interests  and in another lift for workers rights  they required employers to give employees paid sick leave Though it may seem as if voters had an overwhelming number of issues to decide  the numbers of ballot measures are actually trending down  according to the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California  The number of citizen led initiatives and referendums was at its lowest in an even numbered year since 1974  in part because some states have made it more difficult to put measures on the ballot Just as notable  perhaps  is what was not subject to the popular vote  Amendments defining marriage as a heterosexual institution were missing  as were measures requiring voter identification  though several initiatives dealt with early voting and voter registration  States for the most part avoided the hotly disputed topic of immigration  except in Oregon  where voters rejected a measure that would have allowed illegal immigrants to get drivers licenses Some ballot measures are used as a political tool to raise voter interest  Republican critics said some of the measures to increase the minimum wage had been placed on the ballot to bolster turnout for vulnerable Democrats  but support for raising the minimum wage has historically crossed party lines I cant stress how popular of an issue it is among voters regardless of political affiliation  said Tsedeye Gebreselassie  a senior staff lawyer for the National Employment Law Project  And the federal minimum wage has been stuck at  7 25 since 2009 Four states  Alaska  Arkansas  Nebraska and South Dakota  passed measures to increase the minimum wage  Alaskas measure will increase the minimum wage to  9 75 in 2016  the Arkansas measure raises the minimum wage to  8 50 by 2017  Nebraskas will rise to  9 by 2016 and South Dakotas goes to  8 50  By a wide margin  Illinois voters also recommended an increase to the minimum wage  but the vote was nonbinding Both advocates and opponents of marijuana legalization had expected voters to approve the Oregon and Washington  D C  measures The Washington initiative makes it legal for adults to possess and grow limited amounts of marijuana for personal use  while Oregons allows adults age 21 and over to have up to eight ounces of marijuana in their home  and up to four plants  The manufacture and sale of marijuana products would be licensed and regulated by the State Liquor Control Commission  Congress may attempt to block Washingtons vote on marijuana and Representative Andy Harris  a Republican from Maryland  has already promised to do so But Mason Tvert  a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project  which supports legalization  said  The movement toward ending marijuana prohibition will not go backward  its simply a question of how quickly it moves forward Voters in Alaska also moved to legalized marijuana In Florida  where the marijuana issue figured in the governors race  the story was different  There  John Morgan  a prominent trial lawyer and a supporter of the Democratic challenger  Charlie Crist  spent  3 8 million supporting the medical marijuana measure  according to Ballotpedia  an online politics encyclopedia that tracks ballot initiatives  Sheldon Adelson  a casino magnate  spent even more   5 5 million  opposing it  according to committee filings Mr  Crist favored the measure and even said it might bring more younger voters to the polls  potentially bolstering his support  while the Republican incumbent  Rick Scott  and former Gov  Jeb Bush  also a Republican  opposed it  Support for the measure started strong but slipped in recent polls  and Mr  Crist lost to Mr  Scott The vast majority of America has not legalized marijuana  so I dont think its a foregone conclusion that the nation will follow Colorado and Washington State  both of which legalized recreational use of marijuana in 2012  said Kevin Sabet  the head of Smart Approaches to Marijuana  which opposes legalizing the recreational use of the drug  As the negative effects show up  it could start to turn people off Another perennial issue  gambling  has become more urgent as states wrestle with casino closings and bankruptcies  In Massachusetts  a 2011 law allowed for three casinos and one slot machine parlor  none of which have been built  The initiative to repeal the law attracted deep pocketed opposition from the gambling industry  which vastly outspent anti casino groups and argued that gambling would create jobs and that the slot parlor  which was under construction  had already done so No state has repealed a law expanding gambling since the era of the modern casino began in 1931  according to Clyde W  Barrow  a political scientist at the University of Texas Pan American California had perhaps the most expensive ballot measure fight in the country  pitting trial lawyers against doctors over a measure that would have required doctors to take drug and alcohol tests  and would also have raised the cap on pain and suffering awards in medical malpractice cases The measure failed  as doctors and insurance companies spent heavily to defeat it  together  the two deep pocketed sides raised more than  70 million Californias governor  Jerry Brown  who won re election Tuesday  also spent more on television ads supporting two ballot measures than he did on his own campaign  Both measures passed easily  One authorizes  7 1 billion in water infrastructure projects during a historic drought  and the other requires the state to save more in its rainy day fund and to pay down more debt California voters also approved a ballot measure intended to address prison overcrowding by reducing many nonviolent felonies to misdemeanors Some hot button issues like abortion and gun control were scarce on this years ballots  but in Colorado  the group Personhood USA backed an amendment to defined an unborn human as a person in Colorados criminal code and wrongful death act  The group has twice failed to win passage of a broader amendment that would have granted personhood to an unborn human being in all areas of law  and its more limited measure was again rejected by voters on Tuesday In North Dakota  voters rejected a similar amendment that said life begins at conception  But in Tennessee  voters approved an amendment allowing the legislature to regulate abortion  a power that was denied by a State Supreme Court decision in 2000 Also in Washington  voters approved a measure that would expand background checks on

of Voters Signal Dismay With Both Parties,In surveys of those who cast ballots in Tuesday s elections  voters signaled that they were at least as negative about Republican legislators as about President Obama ,Politically divided Americans were in dour agreement about much as they voted in this years midterm elections  broadly distrustful of government  overwhelmingly disapproving of Congress  convinced that the nations economic system favors the wealthy and doubtful that the next generation will inherit a better economic future Republicans went into the contest heavily favored to make significant gains  typically the presidents party is on the defensive in midterm elections  and most of this years battles for Senate seats were in conservative states  But voters surveyed after casting their ballots  both at the polls on Tuesday and by phone for those who voted early  signaled deep dismay with both parties and were at least as negative about Republican congressional leaders as about President Obama Mr  Obama was at the center of the campaign debate  if not on the ballot  as Republicans sought to exploit his unpopularity by tying Democratic candidates to him  especially in the fight for control of the Senate  A majority of voters said they disapproved of how the president was doing his job  and about eight in 10 of those who disapproved supported Republicans As bleak as Democrats prospects were  the party succeeded to some degree in its strategy of focusing on female voters  especially minorities and single women  by attacking Republicans for their legislative actions to limit access to abortion and birth control Democrats won a majority of women  a traditionally supportive group but one that sided with Republicans by a single percentage point in 2010  the previous midterm election year  That setback four years ago was a big factor in enabling Republicans to win control of the House and of many state legislatures and governorships On Tuesday  single women supported Democrats over Republicans by more than 20 points  In Senate battlegrounds like Colorado  Georgia  Iowa and North Carolina  Democratic candidates also won a majority of women  But it was not enough to avert losses  given the overwhelming support male voters provided for the Republicans Yet political independents  a group that six years ago helped propel Mr  Obama to the presidency  once again supported Republicans  though by a smaller margin than in 2010  Democrats also failed again in other ways to rebuild Mr  Obamas broad coalition of 2008  losing among middle aged voters  suburbanites and Catholics  though not as badly as in 2010 Democrats did hold onto groups that form their base  union households  gays  blacks  Hispanics  Asians  younger voters  lower income Americans  political moderates  Northeasterners  city dwellers  Jewish voters and both those without high school educations and those with graduate degrees The surveys of voters showed that Republicans also won their core supporters  whites  men  older voters  Southerners  white Protestants  veterans  higher income people  weekly churchgoers  white evangelical Christians and rural residents  Edison Research conducted the surveys for a consortium of news media organizations As was true in polls throughout the year  the economy was the top issue on most voters minds  Nearly half selected this issue as their top concern  nearly double the number that picked health care  the next most pressing issue  Fewer than one in five voters named foreign policy or immigration as their primary concern Despite a range of good economic news of late  including a declining unemployment rate  many voters are not believers More than three quarters said they were worried about where the economy is headed in the next year  a majority of those supported Republicans  Voters split evenly on whether the economy is getting better  worsening or staying the same  those who see it getting better backed Democrats by a three to one margin while those who foresee conditions getting worse similarly supported Republicans But perhaps the most telling sign of Americans downbeat state of mind was the measure of their confidence  or lack of it  in the American dream  About half the voters said they expect that the next generation will not enjoy a better life than Americans today  That was a significant increase from 2010  The pessimistic voters backed Republicans two to one  while the half of Americans who believe the next generation will enjoy the same or better lives voted by a similar margin for Democrats Over all  more than half of voters expressed negative feelings toward both the Democratic and Republican parties  In a cautionary note for Republicans about reading too much into their victories  one quarter of the voters who supported the partys candidates did so despite harboring bad feelings about the party  Among voters who backed Democrats  a significantly smaller share was negative toward that party Voters stances on a number of issues emphasized the stark differences between Democrats and Republicans  and suggested why it has been years since many Americans claimed they saw no difference between the parties Voters closely split on whether same sex marriage or marijuana should be legal  for example  with those in favor overwhelmingly supporting Democrats and those opposed supporting Republicans by similar margins On several issues  majorities expressed views in sync with Democrats  A slim majority said abortion should remain legal  supporters favored Democrats and opponents Republicans  A larger majority agreed that climate change is a serious problem  and those who did overwhelmingly supported Democrats  while those who disagreed backed Republicans  And most voters favored allowing immigrants here illegally to have a chance to seek legal status  a position at odds with Republican opposition that hardened in the course of the years campaigns Voters remain evenly divided over Mr  Obamas signature Affordable Care Act  which Republicans sought for a third election cycle to make an albatross around Democrats necks  On that issue  too  voters who support the law or say it should have gone farther overwhelmingly went for Democrats while opponents chose Republicans ,20141105,marijuana

the Message on Marijuana Is Still  Just Say No ,While some families may approach it differently  there remain excellent reasons for taking a  Just Say No  stance on marijuana use and teens   without expecting that to end the conversation ,As I wrote last month  marijuana and its use has changed  The laws around it are in flux  As of now  marijuana for medical usage is legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia  two of those states  Colorado and Washington  have legalized recreational use as well  for people 21 and over  The stuff itself  usually green  leafy and intended for smoking  is increasingly available in a form that I have also written about before  It may be a drug  but it can look like candy   So how  I asked  do we talk about the maybe legal for some people in some contexts but not for you drug that can now be munched  smoked or sipped  As Julie Scelfo described in A Familys Truth About Marijuana Depends on the Family  parents are finding different answers to this question  up to and including smoking with teenagers and helping teens 18 and over to secure marijuana legally with medical marijuana cards  A parent who is or has been a user of marijuana may see it differently than a parent who has not  Just as some parents have always preferred to take a more lenient stance on alcohol use  or even the law  than others  some parents will be similarly lenient regarding marijuana But there remain excellent reasons for taking the classic 80s Just Say No approach to marijuana use in teenagers  While the legalization of marijuana for adults or for medical use in some states contributes to a perception that it is safe for all  its effects on developing brains are less clear  Recent research has found a correlation between regular marijuana use at younger ages and impaired neural connectivity  executive function and memory  and poor grades and school performance  although the question of causation is particularly murky in this area  Teens who are already struggling with brain function or school performance may be more likely to embrace marijuana use  Colorados Dont Be a Lab Rat campaign tackles the lack of clarity head on  asking Whos going to risk their brains to find out once and for all what marijuana really does Beyond the possible neural changes  marijuana use can have big consequences in a teens life  Its still illegal in every state for teenagers to use marijuana  Many high school sports and organized activities take a strict no tolerance view of marijuana  and alcohol  Students who even attend a party where the drug is used may find themselves off the team or out of the band   College sports teams  including those at the University of Colorado Boulder  often take a similar approach If your teenager isnt a joiner  he may be a traveler  A marijuana conviction  even a minor one  can mean no visa to countries from Canada to China  Marijuana use  even without a conviction  can end job prospects with the military  police and fire departments  or the Federal Bureau of Investigation  and disqualify a student from government internships  Many jobs and even colleges and graduate schools take past drug use  or evidence of it through  perhaps  social media  seriously  Your teenager  or any proponent of legalization  can argue that those limits are shortsighted and should change  but for now  those are the facts  The choice to use marijuana now can limit later life choices This conversation is also a different one for parents of minority children  Statistically  white teenagers can hope that police and other authorities will look the other way when it comes to marijuana use  black teenagers  in particular  often cannot  Blacks are routinely singled out for marijuana arrests  Minorities are more likely to suffer any possible consequences for its use  and it use can become a pretext for more and harsher police scrutiny of a teen All that said  Childrens Hospital Colorado reminds parents to have conversations  not lectures  Children make choices all the time that wouldnt be our choices for them  and families regroup  and move forward  Listen to your childs perspective  make sure youre having an ongoing conversation around marijuana  ask questions  and above all  make sure your child knows that if he feels unsafe at any moment  he can call  As the laws around marijuana use change  and with them the ways we consider drug use in the larger culture  that conversation with teenagers will change as well  Parents will also find themselves talking about the ways different families approach marijuana use  you might not share a pipe with your son  his best friends father may feel differently  Well face new conversations with each other about whats appropriate  Few of us would ask a fellow parent not to drink a beer in the presence of our children  we may feel differently about that pipe  and differently still about a serving of THC laced chocolate  medical or recreational  Like the conversations were having with our kids  this one will continue  What do you say to your teens about marijuana  about your own history with marijuana  or about their own potential use  Read

Where He 8217 s Supposed to Be ,Until he was 14  Giants defensive end Damontre Moore had lived most of his life in a  rough edged Dallas neighborhood  Then his mother boldly moved the family to a leafy suburb ,EAST RUTHERFORD  N J    Until he was 14  Damontre Moore lived most of his life in a hardscrabble  rough edged Dallas neighborhood  Then his mother boldly moved the family to a leafy suburb 35 miles to the northeast It was completely my moms idea  and I hated it  Moore  a second year Giants defensive end and prospective star  said Friday  I went from a predominantly black area to a community that was predominantly Caucasian  I went from a place where fighting in school was almost an everyday thing to a place where getting in a fight got you suspended and sent to an alternative school I felt so out of place  and I told my mom over and over I didnt want to be out there Moores mother  Detra Johnson  who was 32 at the time  had been determined since Moores birth to get her son out of the neighborhood where she and Moores father had been raised I wanted him to be well rounded  I wanted him to go to school and play sports with everybody  not just black people  Johnson said  The country  the business world and college campuses are a mix of people  and I wanted him to fit in wherever he went For Moore  the adjustment to a new city and school  Rowlett High  was not always easy Lots of different rules and new things to learn  Moore said  Total culture shock His sports career would also have to wait  As a 6 foot 4 freshman  he was a big  talented athlete  but he did not play a varsity football game until he was a junior  and then he was not a starter It has been eight years since Moore and his mother left Dallas Last week at Rowlett High  where Moore is known as Tre  the teachers were circulating a web link to the N F L s Pro Bowl voting because Moore is on the ballot as a special teams player Everybody here loves Tre  Rowletts assistant principal  Shae Creel  said  He was a kid who got people to smile  A good  fun loving kid  and were very proud of him On Friday  Moore sat outside the Giants locker room absorbing what had been a whirlwind week  It began at a news conference on Monday  with the Giants general manager  Jerry Reese  publicly lobbying the coaches to get Moore on the field more often Good things seem to happen when hes out there  Reese said Not surprisingly  in subsequent days Giants coaches indicated that Moore would most likely have a significant role in Monday nights game against Indianapolis But the reflective  if loquacious  Moore was still ruminating about his mothers determined decision making when he was a young teenager She worked as a medical assistant and had a second job taking care of at home patients so I could afford what I needed at the time  Moore said  When I complained about the move  she told me I would thank her later  And after a year or so  I told her that she was right and I appreciated everything she did There were so many new opportunities  The move opened up my eyes to all the places I could go  It wasnt the only thing  but it was a big step It was one of several noteworthy steps for a promising N F L  player who turned 22 less than two months ago Moore never lived with both his parents  They were never together  but they were always on the same page when it came to doing whats best for me  Moore said  I spent weekends with my dad and lived with him for longer periods sometimes  I think my mom wanted to make sure I learned things from him  too  And he opened up my eyes to the arts and music In the Giants locker room  or in the weight room  Moore is often found singing or dancing  he can also be counted on for a prank or two My dad made me join a choir because he knew I wanted to sing in public but wasnt going to do it on my own  Moore said of his father  Damon Moore  He encouraged me to develop my creative side and introduced me to origami  I spent a lot of enjoyable hours doing that  There were many little lessons After games  we didnt have the money to go out to dinner like the other kids  Some of them offered to pay for my dinner  and my dad was the one that taught me to accept their offer once and thats it  He said  Dont take handouts  Work hard so you can pay your own way Eventually Moore earned a starting job at Rowlett  but he was recruited by college teams almost by accident  A Texas A M  coach was watching video of Rowlett wide receiver Marquise Goodwin  who is now with the Buffalo Bills All of a sudden  the coach saw Tre chase down someone from sideline to sideline  Creel  the assistant principal  said  He said  I want to know about that tall kid who can run like that At Texas A M  Moore quickly became a standout  playing with the future N F L  star Von Miller  whose parents  Gloria and Von Sr  became surrogates while he was on the A M  campus We told Damontres mom  Dont worry about him being away from home  youve got another set of eyes down here  Von Miller Sr  said Moore was arrested and accused of marijuana possession the summer before his sophomore season I felt terrible for making such a mistake  Moore said  I felt bad having to tell my coaches  but I was terrified to tell my mom Detra Johnson had been strict in raising her son  forbidding him  for example  to wear tattoos or an earring I promised my mom that I would learn from what I did wrong and become the mature person she wanted me to be  Moore said Johnson said  The thing about Damontre is that he was always the youngest in his group  he graduated from high school at 17  left college at 20  but he was also usually the biggest in his group  and because of that people treated him like he was the oldest  But he was still just a kid There have been no significant or embarrassing off the field episodes since Damontre was a smart  good kid  Von Miller Sr  said  He just needed better judgment  some advice and time to grow After three productive college seasons  and 26 5 sacks  Moore decided to turn professional  He was at first considered a top five pick in the 2013 N F L  draft  but at the combine he ran one of the slowest times for a defensive end in the 40 yard dash  surprising for a player who had shown plenty of speed at Texas A M  In the bench press test he again lagged far behind the top prospects Moore became the poster boy for talented players who squandered their opportunities by not staying in shape for the combine  Alarm bells sounded around the N F L  and Moore dropped precipitously in the draft rankings Again  just maturity  Miller said  He didnt take care of business like he was supposed to do  Another life lesson Moore was at the Millers house on the first days of the draft  as the first and second rounds went by without his name being called I turned off the TV and left the room crying  Moore said  I was so mad I couldnt see The Giants took him in the third round  the 81st overall pick My mom told me that God does everything for a reason  Moore said  I just had to prove myself again Moore got a tattoo over his right rib cage  a blue poker chip with an 81 inside it It means that I went 81st but Im really a blue chip prospect  Moore said  I got it in the most painful place to get a tattoo because I wanted it to be a painful reminder Moores journey as a Giant has not been all smooth sailing  In his rookie year  he flashed his pass rushing capabilities and blocked a punt  As Reese noted  he seemed to create a degree of havoc in the opposing teams backfield  but the Giants coaches said they could not count on Moore to consistently stick to his run stopping assignments He also had a shoulder injury that limited his playing time except on special teams  where he continued to excel Moore has played more this season  but he is still a reserve  That could change this week  With the Giants defensive line depleted by injuries  Moores chance to shine could well be against the pass happy Colts Hes going to be in the playing rotation  Coach Tom Coughlin said  We all want to see what he can do with the opportunity Moore said it had been difficult to remain patient But Ive learned that things arent always what they seem and sometimes you have to wait to see whats good for you  he said  I dont mind  When I get out there and do what I can do  the surprise will be even greater  I like when Im surprised by life Moores mother  who moved her son against his wishes  sees the twists and turns of the last eight years as self fulfilling Hes exactly where hes supposed to be  Detra Johnson said  Its like other parts of life  doing the right thing isnt always easy  But hes with a nurturing organization  and they know what they have Im not worried  Youll see  hell be O K ,20141103,marijuana
