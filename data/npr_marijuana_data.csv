NPR,http://www.npr.org/2014/11/05/361766137/daily-show-colbert-find-little-to-joke-about-on-election-night?ft=3&f=,Jon Stewart may be the only media figure who started his election coverage Tuesday with an apology I did vote today  I was being flip and it kind of took off said Stewart who had told CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour in an interview earlier Tuesday that he wasnt voting because he had just moved and I dont even know where my thing is The comment sparked loads of stories about how the comedian wasnt voting in an election he had been talking about for months I want to apologize Stewart added Because I think I wasnt clear enough that I was kidding and it sent a message that I didnt think voting was important or that I didnt think it was a big issue And I do And I did vote And I was being flip and I shouldnt have done that That was stupid Yes it was that kind of night for liberals Even a leftleaning fake news anchor had to start the night by seeking forgiveness for a screwup Both Stewarts Daily Show and its Comedy Central sibling Stephen Colberts Colbert Report went live Tuesday to talk about the historic wins Republicans piled up in this years midterm elections But the wave of red sweeping over the electoral map seemed to dampen the mood a bit at both shows where leading Republicans like Sens Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham had been the target of barbed jokes for quite a while Look Im trying to find any way to entertain people who are truly on a ledge tonight Stewart joked at one point just before promising to replace the Statue of Libertys torch and tablet with a Bible and an AK47 to signal the GOPs success The evening seemed to highlight the limits of newstinged satire on the political scene as HBO comic Bill Mahers public effort to oust Republican US Rep John Kline  referred to on his show Real Time as the flip a district campaign  also failed Kline whom Maher criticized for being invisible while representing a district outside Minneapolis won his seventh term in office Tuesday despite repeated criticism from the comic who devoted a website to the effort and even visited the state for a panel discussion on the election On Stewarts and Colberts shows the reporting of election results almost seemed an afterthought  though the Daily Show had fun with some election projections picturing McConnell as a cartoon turtle and showing an alligator gobbling up failed Florida gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist the Republican turned Democrat Instead Stewart poked fun at the influence of money  alumnus Rob Riggle played a stack of cash giddily celebrating the dollars role in the most expensive midterm election in history  and interviewed Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus Were you surprised that the Democrats strategy seemed to be curling in a ball and hoping you didnt kick them in the face too hard Stewart asked Priebus setting the tone for the rest of the interview Colbert presented his last live election special before leaving Comedy Central to take over David Lettermans Late Show on CBS next year Many of his jokes centered on the media coverage lampooning social mediaobsessed TV reports and playing multiple instances of Fox News anchors referring to the channels election data center as its brain room Just as you suspected Fox News keeps all their brains in one room Colbert joked And its not the one with the cameras Although his persona on the show is ostensibly a parody of a conservative political commentator Colbert seemed less like his character than ever signaling the kind of attitude viewers might see once he moves to CBS and drops the shows conceit forever Its been a good night for Republicans Colbert said not really sympathizing with or enjoying the victory Some of them are even awake to celebrate it Colbert also welcomed conservative pundit turned Obama supporter Andrew Sullivan who blamed Democrats massive electoral losses on being weakkneed about supporting the president and party policies You have a president who has an excellent economic record  who enacted universal health care which is their goal for 40 years says Sullivan And they ran away from that achievement and refuse to talk about it Colbert responded by asking What can we do to get more Americans to vote Should we have those I voted stickers deepfried There were lots of odd events elsewhere in media coverage Tuesday including a moment when Fox News pundit Brit Hume kept chanting the word Redskins as fellow pundit Juan Williams tried to talk about the controversy surrounding the name of Washingtons NFL team Former Meet the Press host David Gregory joined fellow NBC alumna Katie Couric on Yahoos election coverage  which was held in a Washington DC bar And CNN anchor Anderson Cooper had a novel comeback when a panel responded sluggishly to his question about marijuana legalization just before 1 am Wednesday What are you all stoned or something The only time Colbert got close to being serious Tuesday was when he wrapped up the show noting it was his eighth and final live election show for Comedy Central in 14 years Ill just end by saying it has been a pleasure and privilege to be welcomed into your homes these last nine years he said So to you and yours and I say a fond  whats that I have another month and a half of shows Well this was a little too dramatic Not dramatic enough to change the tone for TVs leading news satire shows which worked hard Tuesday to slap a smiling face on a defeat that most likely disappointed many fans in their audiences Maybe Colbert just got out while the getting was good Copyright 2014 NPR,20141106,marijuana

country live results and our live blog We asked NPRs National Political Correspondent Don Gonyea to help kick off our Election Night party by sharing some of the music thats playing in his ear as he covers the 2014 campaign  My editors gave me an unusual election assignment Come up with a playlist for the 2014 midterm campaign Im a good one to ask since I have a deep love of all kinds of music AND because I spend a lot of time in planes flying from one battleground state to the next Add in the long drives across any given stretch of politically competitive America and youve got a guy who needs a great selection of music to keep him sane So here is my Personal Campaign Playlist for the 2014 Election I should note that youll likely find none of these songs on the official playlists of any campaign anywhere These are not the songs that blare from the loudspeakers at political rallies No classic rock hits U2 no modern country Brooks  Dunn no rock anthems Springsteen Kid Rock Instead Ive burrowed pretty deep into the encyclopedia of eclectic music to find some songs that take me and you on a journey through the states where Ive found myself covering hot political races this year 14 Songs 45 minutes Here we go 1 The Old Man Of The Mountain  Big Bad Voodoo Daddy What better place to start than a song about a giant rock formation in the northern part of the firstinthenation primary state of New Hampshire Theres a pretty good US Senate race this year as well Not to mention all the early stops by potential 2016 presidential candidates This is a new version of a classic Cab Calloway tune How can you not love this 2 County Fair  Phil Alvin Cover politics for NPR and you spend a lot of time at the fairgrounds This song makes me think of lots of places from Iowa to Ohio to Michigan to Kansas Phil Alvin is a founding member of that great American roots band The Blasters This is a solo performance Ive loved for years 3 Wa Da Da  Bix Beiderbecke For this one we go to the other state that kicks off the presidential season Iowa Perhaps the hottest US Senate race is taking place there this year As for the great Bix Beiderbecke hes one of the finest trumpeters in the history of jazz  and he just happens to be the hometown pride and joy of Davenport Iowa 4 Blue Moon Of Kentucky  Brian Setzer The most expensive race in the country this year is the Kentucky Senate race So in this selection we present this take on the legendary Bill Monroes Blue Moon of Kentucky 5 Somewhere In Kentucky Tonight  Tom T Hall Staying in Kentucky for one more Im a sucker for classic country music and this is from one of the genres finest storytellersongwriters 6 Wichita Lineman  The Meters I never thought Id be spending time in Kansas this year A year ago it didnt seem like there would be much in the way of drama in the states politics But suddenly the incumbent governor and US senator both Republicans are fighting to survive I found myself in Wichita as harvest season rolled around And I kept looking at those telephone poles along the highway Hence this Jimmy Webb classic but likely a version you havent heard before  a beautiful ballad by the New Orleans funk band The Meters 7 Arkansas PT2  Bill Frisell Arkansas Home of William Jefferson Clinton Another big US Senate race there this year not to mention a pretty good governors race So I bring you this musical interlude from guitarist Bill Frisell A variation on The Arkansas Traveler 8  On A Night Like This  Buckwheat Zydeco Lets go to Louisiana Another battle for a US Senate seat And a great opportunity for some Zydeco Heres a Bob Dylan song that gets the accordion and washboard arrangement Plus the title just feels right for election night too 9 Snowin On Raton  Emmylou Harris Colorado features some of the most interesting politics in the country these days A battleground US Senate race Closely watched in presidential years And now legalized marijuana Here Emmylou Harris brings her gorgeous voice to a song by the late Townes Van Zandt 10 Georgia On My Mind  Ray Charles Another very interesting US Senate race in the Peach State Hey are you gonna build a list that includes Georgia without including RAY CHARLES 11 Carolina In My Mind  James Taylor North Carolina One of the newest and biggest members of the battleground state club So why not give its native troubadour his due here Its always great to hear James Taylor 12 Just A Little Bit South Of North Carolina  Gene Krupa  His Orchestra with Anita ODay Staying in North Carolina for a moment  sort of Technically this one is about South Carolina But close enough for election year playlist rules Plus its got Gene Krupa on drums A wonderful piece to settle you down after deadline 13 Louisiana Man  Lucinda Williams Lucinda Williams daughter of former US Poet Laureate Miller Williams singing about her home state Music to watch the election returns by Or to eat crawfish etouffee Or both Im in 14 Election Day  Lyle Lovett

because  wait When we started Tribe QTip had a different name So thats not entirely true but at some point when he went from that  Im not gonna say his other MC name cause were  we cant do that and he doesnt like that to be publicly known  but when he became QTip its been Tip forever since high school to now So its like to talk to another Tip  TI Bro You know what And listen man Im gonna tell yall something man and yall  and Im going to say it with pride and shame all at the same time I just now put  I just connected the dots MUHAMMAD OK TI Im just now realizing that  hey man  Im talking about you I mean you came  I mean you came in like you got  you did a very very good covert attack on that one MUHAMMAD You know what though TI I didnt even recognize that this was  MUHAMMAD Thats funny TI Damn OK MUHAMMAD I dont come  I dont really flaunt it TI I got it MUHAMMAD Its not about me really TI But thats on me though I shouldve known MUHAMMAD This is about you though Its just as soon  the first words off the lip was like Tip you know TI Thats whats up Hey respect Respect man Real talk MUHAMMAD Im just realizing for the very first time that Im actually calling someone else Tip TI Right on MUHAMMAD So we dont have to belabor that but were really happy that youre here TI Man its my pleasure man And you know hats off to you man Salute man You know what Im saying MUHAMMAD Oh salute you soldier You  TI You really paved the way for a player MUHAMMAD Hey well thank you KELLEY Cause you came up to New York a lot when you were young TI Yeah man I came up here  I spent summers up here man from the time I was like six to 14 15 MUHAMMAD Whats that like Cause I spent my summers getting sent down south to Virginia North Carolina So it was just you know different seeing grass and trees TI Right Well Im sure we both went back with a little something KELLEY There you go TI You know Im saying I mean me man I just think coming to New York it got  it kinda gave me a different perspective on culture and  you know in Atlanta man it was either you was black or you was white Or other You know what Im saying We didnt have a lot of different cultures We didnt have a lot of different religions We didnt have a lot of  you know what Im saying So to come to a melting pot as a youngster and really see kind of just the differences in what people say about you know how they go to school or how people spend their spare time Like what the culture  how people live their lives in other places Me knowing that it allowed me a certain diversity that contributed to my swag a little later on you know what Im saying And it kinda put me ahead of people Cause they wasnt  people didnt know  really people didnt know about Tribe when I came back to Atlanta Until like you know Bonita Applebum You know what Im saying People didnt really know about BIG I came back and told people about BIG It was the I think the year he was on the Craig Mack remix and he had things that were you know Party And Bullshit and other things that you would have to be in New York to have And I went back to Atlanta with em like Yo this cat coming And of course its like Man psh All I want to hear is Master P You know what Im saying MUHAMMAD Right KELLEY Yeah TI However my epiphany coming making its way into fruition kinda made me an elder statesman and an expert in music MUHAMMAD Thats important though TI You know what Im saying MUHAMMAD We need somebody to understand whats going on TI For sure MUHAMMAD And climbing out there and be able to be the messenger TI But in reverse I tell you something else I came up here with Outkast KELLEY When TI I came up here  nah I didnt come with them  I brought Outkast on a CD up to New York MUHAMMAD OK OK TI When New Yorkers knew nothing of Outkast Back when it was just Players Ball off the LaFace compilation you know what Im saying I came up here and shared that with my player partners that I knew from up here They was like Yo man it aint Jay Z Psh You know what Im saying MUHAMMAD Really TI Ive experienced it on both sides MUHAMMAD The struggle continues TI For sure KELLEY Cause  thats funny Didnt Pharrell once call you the Jay Z of the South TI Yeah he put that pressure on me He did that Pharrell has always been man like a brother partner and just a  an extremely genuine sincere supporter You know what I mean Ever since my very very first album I  KP took me up there and we did not  we knew we couldnt afford Pharrell And I  me being the kind of guy I am I said Hey listen I know you probably came here cause you and KP cool But I know what I got to work with financially and I know what you worth and quite frankly bro I know I cant afford you MUHAMMAD Right TI You know Im saying He was like Man we just gon work man Well deal with that later We let them deal with that I was like Nah nah nah Kinda want to deal with it He just kept telling me Man dont worry man Dont worry Lets just work So we end up working and came up with Panty Pumpin Number One and Im Serious So then Im thinking to myself Which one of these are we gonna keep We cant afford both And Pharrell was a G about it He was like Man we good man MUHAMMAD Just to go back for a moment what was it about the conversation that made you really want to square it away right then and there TI No it wasnt  Im just that kind of guy MUHAMMAD I get that but I think its important you know for people to know that TI Well its like when I walked in here I kinda said OK listen everybody What am I  what are we doing What am I gonna do here I just like to have  understanding is the greatest thing in the world in my eyes man You know confirmation A lot of people leave so much up to chance and so things  leave so much room for later conflict that couldve been avoided had we had confirmation up front handled it from the get go as my grandma used to say MUHAMMAD Very important wise grandmother right there TI But nah man the point is though Pharrell ever since day one and ever since then he has always been an avid supporter And even if it just a phone call to me when Im tripping like Ay yo Remember Remember where you were Remember where you are Respect that You know what Im saying Even stuff like that that you know make me salute him regardless of whats going on in music I know that dude is a genuine sensitive person KELLEY So he has executive produced this album TI Yes he did KELLEY And he produced three tracks on it TI Four KELLEY One of the deluxe edition ones TI No nah Its  we have Paperwork G S Light Em Up and Oh Yeah KELLEY Oh yeah yeah Thats the one Im forgetting OK Yeah TI Im proud of myself for remembering those KELLEY Im impressed TI Being able to rattle em off very eloquently KELLEY So what role did he play in this album Was there any difference in the conversations that you had on this one as opposed to previous  TI Yes KELLEY What was the difference TI Man I think we spoke  like we learned a whole about one anothers approach to music and one anothers application of business when approaching music you know what Im saying Like P is a very very artistic person and he for the most part trusts the people that hes put in place around him to conduct the business However when P has a business idea P has no problem with asserting himself in that manner So me observing as an artist and a person who has to conduct business for himself in music me watching the things he chooses to intercede on and the things he kinda falls back and allows the team to work  you know what Im saying Like that helped me as an artist KELLEY Like the battles he chooses to fight TI Yeah exactly And I think that comes with experience that comes with maturity that comes with you know years of understanding But for him to share that vision with me I think it contributed to my ability to be comfortable enough to go and make a song I may not have made You know what I mean If it was just up to me you know  even though I have executive produced along with the team around me Ive executive produced some hit records and some in the view of many classic material but I havent been pushed to the point where I was challenged to where I was like Man I dont know if I should do this And I feel like working with Pharrell allowed me to do that And he was I guess compromising enough to really find ways as a producer to add elements of what I do in the even most out of comprehensive ideas You know what I mean He even  no matter how left field he went he still added something in there that was from what I do MUHAMMAD What song out of all the songs  cause you guys have done a lot together  what song was the song that you felt that he really really pushed you harder than any other TI Pushed me harder  MUHAMMAD To go outside of maybe  TI You mean that is the most out of my realm MUHAMMAD Yeah yeah TI On this particular project MUHAMMAD On anything that you guys  just the whole body of work that youve done together TI The record we did on the No Mercy album Get Back Up was one Its another one Make Your Face Fall Off that was also on that The record from my last project with CeeLo Let me see MUHAMMAD What about Make Your Face Fall Off TI It just  MUHAMMAD Its a different  its different TI It wasnt  I would not have chosen that record as a record for me to do I mean I get it but it was a lot more  it sounded a lot like the Clipse You know what Im saying I dont mean it sounded like it but it gave you that vibe of  and for me that record the first Clipse record it was a hit record but for me it wasnt  its not my favorite record that Ive heard by them Ive heard records that even though they werent as big of hits they suited my taste a little more But that particular record  I will say hes been right more times than  oh and Blurred Lines Blurred Lines was another one Blurred Lines was a record man Pharrell said Hey look I just need you to do this Just do it You know what Im saying Kind of like Man just do it for me Just do it I was like Man Aight man Cmon Cmon man Lets do it MUHAMMAD Trust and friendship go  I think that helps the situation a little bit huh TI Yeah I will say hes been right more times than I have I will say that KELLEY We spoke to Pusha when he put out My Name Is My Name in the fall And the way he talked about working with Pharrell was  he said that he just got a phone call  I think he was in the middle of SXSW and it was all crazy  and Pharrell called him up He was like Listen I have an idea for a song And it was SNITCH And that was like  that made Pusha get realer than he had been in the past Is there any content pushing happening between you guys TI Yeah  well not pushing It was  I mean he definitely challenges you He finds out what your strengths are and he applies that to your weaknesses You know what Im saying To me he pushes me kinda in a sense  so he was like Yo you are the voice of this part of the generation You are todays Tupac You are todays Ice Cube You represent the person that came from absolutely nothing and made it here Now that you here man do something inspiring MUHAMMAD Is that why you started Oh Yeah by saying P wanted something inspirational but I wanted to say  TI Yeah absolutely Im always on some gangster s man Im always on some gangster s or some cool party s or some laid back chick s P was like Yo  I give you an example man My partner man RIP Doe B  the day that I was in Miami with Pharrell recording Paperwork the song Paperwork December 27 I was telling him about Doe B Cause Doe B was one of the coldest young cats on the up rise And I was telling him Ayo he on fire You need to hear him You need to work with him He was like Cool Get him down here So immediately after  I think we went got something to eat or something  so while we eating I call Doe and Doe  man Doe had told me he had something to do that night but he was gon be able to fly out the next morning So we go and we finish the record I go back to the crib and while Im in Miami doing what people what do in Miami I get a call and they said Man yo Doe just got shot And by the next morning Doe had died So when it comes time to come to the studio Im talking to Pharrell and hes very  he called me enthused and excited about Paperwork cause we knew what it was when we made it And you know hes like Yo do you recognize what we doing You know what we doing right now Man you are crushing it And I was like Yo you remember my homeboy Doe that I was telling you about Yeah yeah hes supposed to  you say hes coming today right Man we going in I was like Listen He dead cuz He say What What do you mean You just talked to him I said Yeah he died He went to the club He got shot He died And so P say Damn And he say  immediately he say Yo we have to record a song about this We got to We have to capture this moment What you doing what I do We have to Its up to us to  and he started talking to me as a like an astute  like a statistician of sorts you know what Im saying Like Yo it is our responsibility  Sort of like like the hero in Armageddon It is up to us to  And I was like Yo for real OK Lets do it then So I went in the studio and we came up with Lighters Up Its in ways like that he kinda took what was my strength which is I guess sharing parts of my life in a way that people can relate to jam to and really be inspired by and he applied it to my weakness which at the time was talking about this very vulnerable part of my life right now So he took my strength applied it to my weakness and thats what we came up with MUHAMMAD I listened to it today It made me cry I actually had to stop listening to the album after that TI Damn Im sorry MUHAMMAD Nah dont If the music doesnt really make you feel then whats the point of doing it TI Yeah MUHAMMAD Theres different intentions in why artists we do what we do but the best I think is when you really can pull an emotion a real emotion out I heard that song and it reminded me of  I mean it was actually not only just that it was so the way you laid it up Cause you know you put the Put It On Doe and then how that began how it ended and how it introduced Light Em Up it was just like a movement And so by time I got to the end of it I had to stop listening to the record and I just walked away and tears were coming out And because similarly when we recorded Scenario everyone was really happy and just like Yo thats  you know feeling really good about it But then  we were in the mode of doing remixes so when we did the Scenario remix there was a guy who was an MC who was around at the time Russell Simmons driver Kenny Lee used to hang around with Tip and just come to sessions check on us He was kind of like an older mentor brother of ours And he had this kid named Hood and he was like Im telling you about Hood Hood Hood So Hood came in dropped a verse He set off Scenario remix and right after that he got outed TI Damn MUHAMMAD So you know  TI Thats a bittersweet celebration MUHAMMAD Yeah So he made it you know a step beyond where your man  but just hearing that story really brought it Im like  what is this We recorded that maybe 91 or something like that Im like wow still 2014 Like this is  hearing your story Im like this is what we still  were still dealing with it And it really was upsetting So to hear you say in Oh Yeah P wanted me to do something inspirational but then youre like I just wanted to be on some F that s I find that your music has always been inspirational And thats an example of it You know when you even say in Oh Yeah Who the people want I feel like you kinda like  tell me when you say Who the people want whyd you say that TI I mean man its a lot to go into For real it was  man its about  and I what we do man we make music that come from the heart that represent the people who we know in the struggle However we must wait on radio to tell us which one of our songs is a hit record We must wait on people to I guess agree with us And when we are the voice of the people we the ones speaking to em so ultimately why dont you let the people decide Who the people want You know what Im saying And that was  that was really my real clear intention And also you just have cats who kind of  man you know they allow themselves to get caught just real caught up in what they have and what they do what theyve done You know what Im saying Like for real if you dont have the respect of people then that means that youre only as good as the things around you the things that you have and the things  cause one day that will be over And then what will you have You know what I mean Who the people want Im a man of the people at the end of the day I feel like I can be put in a glorious position but I want to be here because the people put me here MUHAMMAD I took it sort of like a double entendre like a tongueincheek When you said  when you said Who the people want its like Im giving em that thing that P want and Im giving em that thing that I am TI Right MUHAMMAD You know TI I mean I was talking to P when I said it would deal with the things when I  that I was talking about You know what Im saying That inspired that actual record Like I think he had done left and went to the club  or not to the club He had something he had to go do I believe he went to a Pusha T show if Im not mistaken when we were in Miami recording that record And we had these long  we shouldve recorded these conversations we had We had these long elaborate introspective just  Im talking about like 90minute conversations  KELLEY You trying to be our competition in this podcast game Is that what youre saying TI Nah I mean we wish we wouldve captured it We didnt though We would just sit and debate on what angle like whether its the in your face f you you aint gon try me angle or the Im gon rise above the drama and just continue doing We challenge one another  and we both had valid points I was just like Look P man Listen You come from a different kind of you know  the thing you do is different So you can take that approach and it will be accepted and agreed upon you know Everybody aint able Some of us have to get ours a different way You know what I mean We both right you know But those conversations contributed to the music that you hear MUHAMMAD I want to ask you about a line It wasnt clear to me In Oh Yeah it sounded like you say I would never be here with intellectual rapping What is  what did you say TI Sucka I would never be get hit with intellectual weaponry MUHAMMAD Oh KELLEY What does that mean TI A b I would never be Dont try me like no b Youll get hit with like real sophisticated weapons Youll get hit with sophisticated artillery S you aint seen before That was basically what I was saying MUHAMMAD OK TI It couldve been my Southern accent When I hear what people think I said a lot of times I be like Damn where they get that from MUHAMMAD Nah I mean  TI Im talking like when you see people you know online  you can see when people like your records enough to where they write down the lyrics and post it Im like Man that aint necessarily what I said But cool man Cool Go with it though MUHAMMAD Kinda going backwards  we jumped in a little into the middle of Paperwork The first song Is it titled King Cause I dont think I have a complete listing with all the features and  KELLEY Im not sure theyre the final track names what we have TI Its titled King Yeah it probably is Its titled King and its considered the introduction MUHAMMAD Yeah I feel like it was an introduction and it was like the beginning and the end all in one I was like he couldve  this couldve been the album right here TI A lot of people thought Paperwork shouldve been the first record and King shouldve been the last record but I kinda  MUHAMMAD I think King couldve been the only song on the album TI The only song MUHAMMAD Because it just start off so like Oh s TI That was my angle MUHAMMAD Yeah Just the sound of it musically and just the way you came It was like wow I dont know where its gonna go after this but I feel real good right here It was a complete meal TI Well thank you man I appreciate it My little bro man Mars from 1500 Or Nothin he put the beat together I gave him a record that was  as it was explained to me someone received a demo from a cat who sings in Ireland or Scotland and his name is Garth Gareth something of that nature And he has a song and in this song there was a section in the song that  you know thats him singing So he said Man I heard this record I thought of you Do something with it So I got it to Mars and Mars you know after Mars freaked it he got it back to me I said Oh yeah this is it MUHAMMAD Do you feel that people still come at you Cause you came pretty hard on that song I mean you generally do But it just seemed like this  so many albums in 13 years in the music business strong never delivering anything thats like subpar Im like I dont think TI should ever have to set off a warning shot TI Nah man you know what Im saying I mean  MUHAMMAD What was you thinking about when you made that TI I mean all shots or  everyone who challenges you dont necessarily do it in plain sight You know what Im saying Sometimes you have  you may observe people in a very critical moment with adverse opinions about you when nobody asked them You know what Im saying You may observe from afar people being jealous and really just spitefully negative in your moment of glory when it your time to shine You may take notice of people man really just attempting to covertly disrespect you or challenge your I guess your authority or manhood in whatever way possible And when you see these things  its not meant for you to see but you see em and you know OK you must address these things Its not  I cant just turn a blind eye I aint never been that guy Thats not me You know what I mean I see it I dont like it If its a violation there shall be a demonstration KELLEY And people respond to that cause everybody feels like that TI Sure Just everybody doesnt act on that feeling KELLEY Yeah TI I just choose to act on em KELLEY Mhmhm TI But Im trying to do better Every day I wake up man with a better sense in mind say Hey you know what Im gon let something go today You know what I mean We gon give somebody a pass today I wake up with that mentality Thats how I wake up And then life happens MUHAMMAD Life unfolds in front of you right TI Nah nah I mean its sorta like  it just depends on if you really like catch me at a point in my day where things are going exceptionally well you have a more  you know But as the day happens and you have to carry more of a load every time man Man look I done let too  you know what The buck stops here You are in bad  boy you in trouble buddy I just gave the last pass five minutes ago Now its us Here we are Thats pretty much how it carries out MUHAMMAD Understood KELLEY I feel like that sort of relates to the trajectory of your career and like ways that you have been aggressive or not aggressive or have been presenting a rehabilitated image But where Im most specifically interested in is your work with Andrew Young and the documentary that you guys made Walking With Guns I spoke with somebody named Dr Jocelyn Wilson and she told us that she thought that Andrew Young had a real big impact on you TI Man Ambassador Young is the closest thing  I wont even say the closest Hes my mentor You know what I mean In music I can say DJ Toomp Pharrell KP But I mean as  thats the closest thing to like a father  my father was his age My grandfather still alive My grandfather he taught me all the stuff that I needed to know to become the man of respect with principle and morals Now in order to articulate myself and to really poise myself as a distinguished gentleman until  that was brought to me by Andrew Young My granddaddy fantastic man he taught me everything I needed to know to make it to the point where Andy kind of picked up the baton And I feel like thats the person that I could see myself patterning my evolution after KELLEY Really TI Yeah KELLEY Leadership Political leadership in that way TI I dont know so much as  I dont want to be like mayor I dont want to  I aint trying to run for no office But ultimately even just as a community leader you know what I mean As a social example KELLEY Yeah more like SCLC type TI Yeah but with a  moving in the right direction with an appropriate purpose And I think that given the time where I knock all the dust off my shoulders and I curve out my you know the rough edges the chip that I have on my shoulder when I polish all my granite you know what Im saying I make it to a point where this is you know now this is how I can actually present myself and be perceived KELLEY How do you reconcile those two parts of yourself TI How do I reconcile it KELLEY Past and present TI The past was all necessary in order for me to make it to this point I think that had I made the right decisions before there would have been less adversity less conditioning less pressured examples that contributed to me learning faster You know what Im saying So I learn lessons  I have  the person who falls a lot theyre the best at whatever it is they do If youre a skateboarder you fall more first Then well you end up a better skater because of it So I mean for me man I fell a lot I fell a lot So I should be the first to pop a wheelie KELLEY OK Does Ambassador Young listen to your music Like now Does he  TI Yeah sure Man Mr Young he listens to gospel as well as secular music He doesnt live in a like in a cave You know what I mean KELLEY Yeah yeah yeah TI He tells me what he cares for you know And those of my movies  he tells me I need to stop playing villains in movies You know you should get you one of those good dramas I say Yeah man Ima play you man Ima play you in one Well do your story KELLEY Yeah Thats not a bad idea TI And he tells me things that he appreciates the most you know KELLEY OK I really think that not enough people know that connection TI Man Ambassador Young man hes a magnificent human being I think that of course not a lot of people know exactly of all his attributes and benefits to  MUHAMMAD To helping To where we are today TI In the modern era Yeah Im just proud and grateful and humbled by him taking the time out  you know what Im saying  to take wisdom to shed a light on me You know what I mean KELLEY Mhmhm TI And he did it in like one of my darkest moments back when I caught my case He really kinda  he took time to explain what was happening and why you know Cause of course its easy to resent the situation and its easy to excuse your wrongdoing Its easy But for me to make it to a point that I was at when I was able go speak to kids and accept  hold myself accountable That came from conversations with him I was very bitter You know what Im saying I was very like  I was extremely dark Ambassador Young took the time to kind of explain like Listen This is  you gotta understand You know He gave me experiences and just insight that I could relate to And I rationalized my circumstances at that point and after I rationalized my circumstances I was able to cope a little bit better MUHAMMAD Is it through that experience of  Ill call it ups and downs just for the moment  and being surrounded by someone like that is that sort of like motivation for a song like New National Anthem In that song youre painting  youre showing youre highlighting similarities and differences of what I think America is calling as like acceptable and  things that we get behind we rally behind  and these other aspects of life we dont You know its highly ridiculed highly prosecuted Kids selling drugs highly ridiculed highly prosecuted Politicians breaking laws using their influence not so  TI Not so highly ridiculed not so heavily prosecuted MUHAMMAD Yeah so why do you think that its that way TI Habit KELLEY Yeah TI I mean man I think its habit man I think at some point somebody in power and influence over the state of this nation  at some point they figured out that they could do the right thing and face hardships and pain and have adversity Or they could cut some corners and do it the easy way and have a similar outcome They chose to cut some corners and do it the easy way And that influence trickled down and over time it became habit so people said Man why waste time going through all this adversity to do it the right way when you can get more doing it the easy way You just gotta be willing to cut  Shhh Dont tell nobody Over time here we are Thats what happens to just put it in a nutshell Thats my opinion MUHAMMAD So why make a song Why did you make the song TI I was inspired by the moments you know what I mean It seems like every year sometimes twice a year its just moments that you feel like Man this s is fed up and it aint getting no better Then even more so its just like more blatant displays of I dont give a fu about you I dont care about you Youre here Fine But you run nothing You will not threaten or intimidate us Or there will be  violation demonstration And so I mean s when you see that when you faced with that so much of course youre gonna be motivated to  artistic expression thats how I speak And then I think that it makes  if you cant really really say it out loud you cant rationalize it You know what I mean So saying it out loud is just me coming to terms with something that I know I have to develop an understanding for If Ima change it I got to understand it KELLEY I think I can see your platform already I mean I know youre not trying to go for political office TI No If I do that guess what All this stuff gon be pulled up on me All of these statements and that And so I dont really know man I have a very very limited  my running is limited as far as how  what I can do MUHAMMAD Dont say that I dont believe that KELLEY It should be  it should be gun control TI Yeah Secretary of Defense KELLEY Alright Fine MUHAMMAD I dont believe where you going Only because I think that were at a state in history where everyones challenges and adversities are exposed And its not that were more numb to it Its just were more real TI Right MUHAMMAD Like were at a state where theres not going to be any other president whos gonna say  except if I was elected for president  that never smoked marijuana you know what Im saying Ive never smoked marijuana in 44 years of life But Im just saying were at that stage where whatever it is that we feel may be the thing that not get a person elected or have people be like Oh Im not interested in him The stage that were in historically theres not much you can really do to shock the nation into you know into you not being a viable leader especially if you have in the scales of balance weighed it out with other things Its like Oh yeah I could see  TI I think even at its finest moment it will relate to who can hide these things more and who will have the most available to the public I have the most available to the public So whoever Im running against is gonna say Yeah Check him out here And Im cool with it My answer to that would simply be I am not ashamed of my past but I am very proud of my future KELLEY Sounds like youve been practicing TI Well nah I mean it just comes to me It does KELLEY Well have you ever  so I wanted to ask you about  you have said that sort of the blessing and the curse of the Internet is that like people can just come out before theyre ready And they can be judged before theyre ready or not And so I wanted to ask you about what your grooming media training waiting until youre ready what that process was like TI Its hard to put into words KELLEY OK TI Its a lot Thats a heavy  its just a lot Cause its things creatively in music and then its things in business Cause a lot of artists especially new ones right now they dont expect to work They dont expect to have to do anything to contribute to the success of their project They just want the red carpet  I got signed Now what You know what I mean I think that just knowing that like talent should not be something that takes away the need for you to think you have to work hard you know what Im saying So I mean I just try to make sure the cats can push themselves to be as dope as they possibly can be You know carry themselves like a reputable upstanding human being and work hard KELLEY When you were young and you  what type of  did you have any sort of understanding that decisions that you made then would curtail possibilities in your future TI At the time KELLEY Yeah TI No Nobody young considers consequence Nobody You know what I mean Nobody does Until youve experienced enough of it to where you say Yo My life has gotta get better than this At least now I know Yo man I need to stay away from things that can contribute to the  Its just that the business that Im in its a business that kinda puts me in the elements of you know certain risk factors Therefore I got to poise myself a certain way KELLEY Yeah TI Simple as that You put me in Hollywood and you let me do movies all year and Im not really working on going to clubs and I aint gotta promote no albums and I aint gotta  now my element has changed My environment has changed I can kick back man you know what Im saying This is not the element for aggression and hostility So I can hang my aggression and hostility on the door Pick it up when I need it KELLEY Yeah TI But its just right now my element my environment man that it take from me to really maximize the benefit of my material I got to get out here and touch the people And that process it kind of  it gives me  it puts me in the line of fire when it come to avoiding trouble But I understand I have to find ways to over time phase out of that because I aint really  the consequence overwhelms the benefit at that point KELLEY Right TI But it took me getting older to understand that KELLEY Yeah Like everybody else And to go back to Light Em Up part of what makes that song so heavy is  I mean are you thinking like that couldve been you TI I mean well the only certain thing we have in life that we know when were born is that well die KELLEY Yeah TI Thats it I mean it always couldve been me It couldve been a long time ago When I made Live Your Life it couldve been me KELLEY Yeah TI You know what Im saying It was closer to being me then than with Doe But theres definitely a  theres something in me that  you know how they say womens clock is ticking Like I feel like my clock is ticking The clock for you to get in trouble man is ticking You need to phase out of that fast I recognize that So I have to  now this is the part of my career where I begin to change my environment MUHAMMAD So then is that  did you feel that way going into at least making this album Like the clock is ticking and there has to be something different I ask that because it sounds like  for example I Dont Know I dont think its scripting out a future but it poses a question TI Sure it does MUHAMMAD So is that one of the motivating factors like clock is ticking TI Absolutely I know for a fact  and see when I make records like I Dont Know a lot of time people think that its a script or a detailed elaborate explanation to a future action But really Im doing this  Im going through the trouble of saying it out loud so I can hear the absurdities in it and I can you know I can help myself better Hearing  this me talking like Im talking to myself and at some point saying OK now listen Does that sound rational OK then You know Im saying But at the same time what you get out of it is a jammingass song You know what Im saying MUHAMMAD Absolutely Its therapeutic TI Its therapeutic as well as you get added intangible benefits MUHAMMAD Yeah TI Shock value dont hurt you MUHAMMAD Well in thinking about  cause Cedric even mentioned this  in thinking about Tupac and some of the things that Pac spoke about that seem prophetic just hearing you make that statement about  TI Im not  sheesh Pac was  man Pac was very  he was profound with his scripting of the future I dont think Ill ever reach that level of it I mean I hope not to be so profound MUHAMMAD To that degree TI You know what Im saying Thats one thing I hope not to  but I mean at the end of the day man if thats Gods plan for me Ima carry mine like a man wherever it takes me MUHAMMAD Im not saying it in that regard I see a lot of light in the situation only because youre  TI Right on As you should MUHAMMAD Yeah I do I do TI Thank you MUHAMMAD Youre  for the kids that come from the economicallychallenged cities in New York or Atlanta or Chicago or Los Angeles you are them And they can look at you and hear someone like you And be a guide You know that beacon that just get them out of the situation Or at least bring some clarity To even hear you say You know what Im talking to myself Like people are considered crazy who do that but thats not insanity thats clarity Especially if you  in doing it with an intention of just saying OK lets see what happens after that And I think people need to hear that you know So I dont  I see it as being  you and your art  as being light TI Right on I appreciate that man Thank you And if any of it if any of this stuff can you know help some of those kids in those cities avoid their darkest hour then I mean it was worth it So I appreciate that MUHAMMAD I like the way you round out  like this album is rounded out You got your knowledge  well you got your First of all hold on Im setting it off like this in case any MC or anyone else forgot what it really is I like the way you set it off like that But then theres balance You bring it back to a little  I dont know if its necessarily political even though its called New National Anthem  but theres the political the conversation of what were dealing with This is modern day social studies class right now And then you got your songs for your ladies  and theres some extreme songs for the ladies I have to  KELLEY Why are you looking at me right now I am appreciative of those songs I am not mad at those songs MUHAMMAD I know thats why Im looking at you cause  TI I would like to excuse myself for one moment MUHAMMAD I was just saying that I think the album you rounded it out really well TI Thank you MUHAMMAD And the song for the ladies Yes I was looking at you Frannie because you always pick up  like you seem to really like these type of songs KELLEY My bad TI What song was it What song KELLEY What is the name of the Chris Brown one TI Oh its Private Show KELLEY Private Show TI You should like that song Its made for her to like You should like it KELLEY Thank you TI Youre welcome Nah man my definite intention with that was  and forgive me but Im from Atlanta  so I just kinda feel obligated to make at least one strip club record You know what Im saying And that one  that just made its way to being it MUHAMMAD Job well done TI Thank you And Chris man Chris man He contributes in a way that I  I cant begin to describe the effect that Chris got on the ladies Thats probably why she liked the song KELLEY Thats not why I like the song TI Man you know and Usher as well man The record I did with Usher  Usher whos a personal partner of mine man  we went in and did like four or five different records and you know kinda lended itself to the idea of doing a tour doing a bigger project together which we will explore later whenever the time is right  KELLEY Yes TI But he made a contribution that I cant begin to describe either man Dudes like extremely poised talented you know what Im saying I try to surround myself with cats who have the potential to be or have proved themselves to be superstars I just feel like  and the people who nobody else can deal with you know what Im saying The people who cant nobody else relate to cant nobody else deal with em I like those people Because they too honest for most ears So I appreciate that in a person KELLEY So which category does Young Thug fall into then TI Man he in both of them Hes a superstar and hes probably one of the most difficult people that Ive ever met I mean not for me Because for me he my partner and we dont have no problems never have But I observe the way he  like the way things kind of transpire And hes a very very difficult meticulous talented just extremely creative individual MUHAMMAD Well I hope that the channel between the two of you is open enough for him to receive anything that you tell him TI It does but everything  my growth took time you know what Im saying I cant expect somebody to get everything I got in a day MUHAMMAD Absolutely not TI So just make sure you pick up a little as you go Pick up a little as you go And over time man itll come together But its something that is there that you should not change You know what saying Focus on that right now cause thats whats certain And then the rest of it  as you see the need to make adjustments just be willing to make adjustments And he aint no fool man MUHAMMAD Yeah you can tell that KELLEY No were big fans Weve been trying to get him to come up here We would love to talk to him TI Woowee Good luck KELLEY We would go down to talk to him TI Yeah man I mean  KELLEY I know Good luck is fine TI Nah man nah I wont say that I wont say that Thug man once you meet him if he say he gon do it he gon do it MUHAMMAD Yeah OK Yeah Im looking forward to  I hope we  it happens Like early on I think I shocked Frannie when I was like Yo I want to talk to Young Thug She was like What KELLEY I was like Who stole Alis phone MUHAMMAD This was like  KELLEY It was Stoner It was right when Stoner hit TI Word MUHAMMAD Yeah it was right when Stoner dropped and my boy  I was in LA and he just was playing it nonstop and I was like  I was offended that I didnt even know what this was And watching him man he goes hard And I just like Yo who is this He was like Yo this Young Thug You should know about this At first I thought it was a joke and then I was like Nah this dude passionate right here Like I want to talk to him So you know hopefully  TI Thugga man Thugga thorough He probably one of the most creative cats of the new generation man He has a chance to lead the charge Hes the first person that I heard Ill say that made me not care about the fact that I dont understand what youre saying Usually like new artists Im like What is he  I dont want to hear this I cant understand it You know what Im saying But Thugga I saw skill in what he was  and I knew he was saying something I just didnt understand it But as I was getting to listen to it and I have a better sense of understanding I have a better  you know what I mean KELLEY We all have had to acclimate our ears to him TI Right But hey you know what In my research right remember we didnt understand everything Bone ThugsnHarmony was saying MUHAMMAD True TI We didnt know what they were saying MUHAMMAD True It just felt so good TI We didnt understand everything  who knows every word to a James Brown song MUHAMMAD I dont KELLEY Valid point Well he made up words there so  TI You know what Im saying So I mean I felt like at some point man you gotta give credit where credits due and stop really trying to force things into whatever box you feel is appropriate and  KELLEY All those people have crazy hooks too Thats what it is with him TI Yeah But I think that he got an enormous amount of talent and potential I cant wait to see what he does with it MUHAMMAD Dope Just one more question from me and I know you had a couple more of them KELLEY OK Just one But yeah MUHAMMAD We cant see the wrapup because its really dark out there If youre even giving us the wrapitup I cant see GS You start off by saying Im a rich n like I dont know Thats hilarious Why you set if off so hard like that TI Because I feel people expect me to act a certain way because I have certain things because I am in a certain tax bracket I feel like man look Im a man before Im anything so Im gon stick to what I know and thats being me MUHAMMAD OK Do you think that hiphop has gotten too soft Is that where that song came from TI I mean of course I wont say soft in a sense of  it seems as though just as when NWA Ice Cube Dr Dre Snoop Dogg and Biggie and Pac became the whos who gangster s became fashionable You know what Im saying Everybody whether they were solidified or really like this or not they were emulating this lifestyle And over time every genre every corporation everybody goes through this After things have been the same for over time for so long there comes one person that goes against the charge that goes the absolute opposite of what everyone else is doing and they win Slowly over time that one person begins to encourage others and then now people are going from emulating this to emulating that Not to say the same people but the people who were nerds who were acting like gangsters are now comfortable being nerds And the people who are gangsters now are like nah let me emulate the nerds you know what Im saying And so since everybody want to be sensitive I feel like man listen Man the way for me to be the one person that leads the charge back the other direction is stick with the gangster s So thats why I made G S KELLEY Does the title have anything to do with Outkasts Gangster S TI No Absolutely nothing KELLEY Foiled again TI And I feel like I got the perfect partner on there man Young Jeezy he kinda like is the epitome you know what I mean And he and I we have conversations and intentions to do a project together in the near future Its called Dope Boy Academy MUHAMMAD Is that part of this Paperwork trilogy Sprinkled in Or is it something completely different TI Its not Hell be a part of it but that project is not a part of it It will have its own testament to its material I have three albums  real talk  already after Paperwork Paperwork is the more introspective musical kind of  its the artdeco of the three The second one is the return which also has its own narrative and the theme of that is trap music And the third is more of a like you know life love liability Its a love story Young man who finds himself  hes an active avid gangster but he just finds himself  he has a soft spot for a woman And usually they have people  involved with people he shouldnt be crossing so that gets him in certain situations and inspires a certain type of music MUHAMMAD Are you going for films at this point TI Yeah Thats why its called The Motion Picture because like music is really supposed to be the soundtrack to our lives So our lives is the movie But most people like to see it visually rather than just hear it so I just want to be the one to show it to em in a different way And also I have to look for diversity in  my thespianism aint coming from Broadway You know what Im saying So I have to challenge myself and present my abilities And take my strengths apply em to my weaknesses MUHAMMAD Its just hearing you describe those next two projects it sound like it would be a great film especially the last one Well all of them but especially the last one TI Thank you The plan is to have each one  like this album me and Chris Robinson we working on right now on completing the script getting the budgets in and cast and actually filming the first of the three short stories Paperwork The Marvel movie AntMan is kind of taking up a lot of that time cause we wouldve been done with it and have it presented by the time that the album released but we had you know  its AntMan So when were able to find  we just need about two three weeks knock it down Each of them will have a 35minute story that will make up at the end one complete project KELLEY I hope you can drop em like boom boom boom And not  the label wont make you wait TI Nah the label aint gon make me do nothing now The label aint gon make me do nothing But you saying  you talking about as far as how quick they are to be released KELLEY Mhmhm TI I think the success of one would dictate the release of the other You know what I mean KELLEY Im just saying I think we are getting more impatient these days TI I mean how about this If Paperwork drops and there are three to four singles to be worked off of its going to extend the time KELLEY I know I know TI You know what Im saying KELLEY I know Its just  I feel like  TI The music is going to make  even if you get tired of waiting for something if once you get a taste of it it is all you hope it will be then that will justify the wait KELLEY OK TI Yeah MUHAMMAD I just realized and remembered youre in a new distribution situation TI Yeah Yeah MUHAMMAD With Columbia TI Yep Yep MUHAMMAD Hows it feel to completely fulfill a contract I only say that cause people hold over Tribe Called Quests head all the time You guys got one more album Ever since the documentary its like the director ended the film with that so everyone knows we still owe the label one more record And its just like  TI Now see the thing is though thats only if you guys decide to make music MUHAMMAD Yeah TI You know what Im saying They cant make you submit MUHAMMAD Of course TI You know what I mean So thats if you decide  when I decide to do some music then they will get one MUHAMMAD So youre liking the new situation at Columbia TI Yeah I love it man I love it I feel like they take more risk than most record labels I feel like they kind of  they side with the artists requests more times than other labels Other labels will kind of take the position that the artist is here the label is there Sometimes we can have wants and wishes that intercede but for the most time we are in opposition of one another You know what Im saying MUHAMMAD Yeah Absolutely TI We are in support of one another but privately and behind closed doors when its come time to really have the discussions that carry on to the making we want different things 90 of the time And here I havent seen that for real Ive seen OK You know what youre asking You know its a lot You know its  Yes I do OK This is what you think you need We gon go and do it And after doing it if you prove or if you know the material justifies the risk if the risk turns itself into benefit OK well thats one to your credit And well move forward Thats the way I see working with Columbia versus my experience with a lot of other labels But not to discredit any of my former partners man I have a huge amount of love admiration and respect for him I just understand the different business models MUHAMMAD Yeah different method TI Yeah MUHAMMAD And as being a label owner yourself does that  what youve gone through as an artist  help your situation with Iggy and  TI Sure I mean if you cant understand where someones coming from you have less of an ability to relate If you just are an incredibly understanding person you just find a way to kind of relate to everything thats you know ideal However most of us who have these afflictions  I mean like for real I feel like my way is the best way I just do you know what Im saying And so my ability to really look at anyone elses perspective man is kind of like Man why  you dont think like me Psh sucks for you You know what Im saying I just have that in me But if I know what youre going through cause Ive been through it then I can understand where you coming from a little bit better That gives me the best opportunity to relate to the Young Thugs and the Iggys and the BOBs even the Trae tha Truths Its so many Boosie So many cats that really labels dont know what to do with either because they havent really really figured out how to communicate with them they are fearful to communicate with them or theres just a disconnect somewhere lost in translation something But me I have an ability to because Ive experienced what most artists have experienced I can speak to em from a different perspective Soon as every label realizes that and just come talk to me instead of trying to talk to the artists all the time well be somewhere KELLEY Could you tell us a little bit more about Doe B and how you came to know him and work with him Just describe him for our audience TI Man Doe B personally was a very very quiet like a reserved laidback  confident but quiet You know what I mean Like you could tell he was confident but he didnt talk a lot And I havent seen a young man at 18 19 come into such an overwhelming environment and remain unphased Ive never seen Doe B excited Except when we talk about sports KELLEY OK TI Except when we talk about sports The finals when the Miami Heat came back and beat the Spurs he was extremely you know  or Alabama championship Alabama games You know what Im saying Doe B was extremely excited and an avid sports fan but for the most part hell sit in a room and wouldnt say nothing unless he really had something to say That plus his work ethic him not wanting to go to the club When everybody else like Alright we finna go we goin out to this party we gon ball Ima finish another record So he just kinda had a work ethic that  it was a certain maturity that usually dont come until your second third or fourth album And his skillset lyrically and ability to separate lyricism Cause he  although he had extreme lyrical ability he also made songs that were superduper simple Simplified his communication down to Nah nah nah nah nah you know Be like that sometimes Like You betta know it Like You betta know it is a term that everybody uses but for real like Im a young n getting money betta know it  Bank roll full of numbered hundreds betta know it You know what Im saying Thats very very simple and sophisticated at the same time So that to me showed his skill in a different  and his ability to kind of speak in great detail The way when you heard Jeezy talking  If it take it too long to lock it up bring it back  You was short anyway bring a stack You know what Im saying Those are specific details that come from a circumstance that you recognize if youve ever been in there before And Doe Bs ability to do that  he found a way to do that in a way we aint heard probably since Jeezy The man for real man it was his time It was really  it was truly his time And he was about to blow He already had one hit record with me and Juicy J that was shooting up the charts man On its way to Number 1 KELLEY Let Me Find Out TI Let Me Find Out exactly And he had  and we had just finished the Hustle Gang mixtape We were shooting videos for his next mixtape The Kemosabe record was just  that was going to be the record that that took him where he needed to be And we just  we got our progress cut short You know what I mean But we still have an enormous catalog of stellar stellar material that we will use to keep his legacy alive KELLEY Well I feel like weve taken a lot of your time I appreciate it very very much TI Ah man you know I aint doing nothing but waiting sitting around waiting for the phone to ring But nah I really do appreciate you guys your time attention and you know your contribution Your contribution as well because Im sure youre not in here for nothing MUHAMMAD Thank you man TI Paperwork1021 man Hustle Gang over everything Love Copyright 2014 NPR,20141029,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2014/10/11/354875096/behind-the-motorcycles-in-easy-rider-a-long-obscured-story?ft=3&f=,On Oct 18 the Calabasas Califbased auction house Profiles In History will auction off what it says is the last authentic motorcycle used in the filming of 1969s Easy Rider and what some consider the most famous motorcycle in the worldPeter Fonda who played Wyatt in the Dennis Hopperdirected film rode the socalled Captain America bike named for its distinctive American flag color scheme and known for its sharplyangled long front endThe bike currently for sale was partially destroyed in the films finale the auction house says and then rebuilt by actor Dan Haggerty The three other bikes used in the production were stolen prior to the films releaseAccording to Brian Chanes acquisitions manager for the auction house the bikes estimated value is between 1 million and 12 millionBut despite the bikes fame the history of the creation of the bikes used in Easy Rider has for many years been largely unknown And the man who designed and coordinated the building of the motorcycles Clifford Vaughs says he and the other bike builders have not received proper credit for their workChoppers Quintessentially AmericanThe motorcycles used in Easy Rider were not simply rolled out of a showroom and in front of the camera They were choppers crafted by handChoppers are a type of customized motorcycle usually defined by a stretched out wheelbase and pulled back handlebars and a sissy bar and a wild paint job says Paul dOrleans the author of the upcoming book The Chopper The Real Story Its a quintessentially American folk art formThe Captain America bike is an unmistakable and legendary chopper and has made an enormous impact on the world of motorcyclingThe bikes in Easy Rider dOrleans says did more to popularize choppers around the world than any other film or any other motorcycle I mean suddenly people were building choppers in Czechoslovakia or Russia or China or JapanWhose hands turned the wrenches Who welded the steel Most of the time dOrleans says choppers are associated with their builders because they are an artistic creation And curiously the Easy Rider bikes were never associated with any particular builderIn fact two documentaries about the production of Easy Rider  1995s Born To Be Wild and 1999s Easy Rider Shaking The Cage  never name the men who designed and built the choppersFinding The BuildersIn bits and pieces the story behind the Easy Rider choppers began to emerge publicly and identified two AfricanAmerican bike builders Clifford Soney Vaughs who designed the bikes and Ben Hardy a prominent chopperbuilder in Los Angeles who worked on their constructionThe Discovery Channels History of the Chopper identified Hardy and Vaughs in 2006 an exhibition at the California African American Museum noted Hardys contributions in 2008 and Paul dOrleans wrote about Vaughs on his blog The Vintagent in 2012Ben Hardy died in 1994 But in an interview this week Vaughs now 77 years old explained his role in the creation of the Captain America bikeAt the time Vaughs was a motorcyclist and had built bikes himself He had also worked as a civil rights activist and photographer with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee SNCC and was a member of the newsroom at the Los Angeles radio station KRLAVaughs says he first met Fonda in his role at KRLA In the summer of 1966 Fonda was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana Vaughs says he covered Fondas court appearance for KRLA and in the process got to talking with the young actor about motorcyclesNot long after Vaughs says Fonda and Dennis Hopper came by his apartment in West Hollywood and discussed early plans for a motorcycle movie and building the bikes they would needI said Well I can build whatever we need for the film right here at my place  Vaughs remembersThat film would eventually become Easy RiderConflicting TalesMore than 45 years after the production of Easy Rider its difficult to sort out the exact timeline of the films creation and the various responsibilities of the people involved Several of the key figures involved with the film have died including director Dennis Hopper and credited screenwriter Terry SouthernThe history of the production has also been particularly messyThe whole thing has been like a Rashomon experience producer Bill Hayward who died in 2008 told the filmmakers who made Easy Rider Shaking The Cage The whole movie the whole production  everyones got an entirely different storyClifford Vaughs for his part says he acted as an associate producer early on in the films production By his account he designed the bikes himself and is responsible for the distinctive look of the Captain America bike He says he also worked with Ben Hardy to purchase engines at a Los Angeles Police Department auction and coordinated the building of the bikesPeter Fonda meanwhile has said that he himself played a greater role in the design and construction of the bikesI built the motorcycles that I rode and Dennis rode Fonda told WHYYs Fresh Air in 2007 I bought four of them from Los Angeles Police Department I love the political incorrectness of that  And five black guys from Watts helped me build theseA publicist for Fonda said that he was unavailable for comment for this storyBut in 2009 Dennis Hopper recorded an audio commentary track for the Criterion Collection release of the film in which he says Vaughs built the bikes built the chopperLarry Marcus is a mechanic who lived with Vaughs at the time and worked on the choppers and the early film production Cliff really came up with the design for both motorcycles Marcus said in a phone interviewAccording to the press release announcing the current auction the Captain America bike was designed and built by two AfricanAmerican chopper builders  Cliff Vaughs and Ben Hardy  following design cues provided by Peter Fonda himselfRaw FeelingsVaughs says he and others were fired and replaced early on in the films production following the chaotic shoot at Mardi Gras in New Orleans As a result his name never appears in the credits And while the film went on to become one of the topgrossing films of 1969 and a cultural touchstone the name Clifford Vaughs has remained largely unknownIm a little miffed about this but theres nothing I can do Vaughs says of the story though he makes sure to note that he only spent about a month working on Easy Rider out of a long and illustrious lifeBut he says the absence of black characters in the film is troubling In the 1960s Vaughs belonged to an integrated motorcycle club known as The Chosen Few That multiethnic reality was not reflected on screenWhy is it that we have a film about America and there are no negroes he saysVaughs says the omission of his own name and that of other AfricanAmericans in the retelling of the Easy Rider story is conspicuousThose bikes when we talk about iconic they are definitely iconic he says But yet the participation of blacks  completely suppressed completely suppressed And I say suppressed because no one talks about itTo this day Vaughs has never watched Easy Rider When asked why he responds simply What forA MillionDollar IconBrian Chanes of Profiles In History says its common for the men and women who actually build iconic props to go unrecognized He handles some of the most famous props ever seen on screen like Wolverines claws from XMen or the whip used in the Indiana Jones filmsThe guys that were back there doing the welding the guys that are doing the set building that are really masters of their craft Chanes says they dont get the notoriety unfortunatelyNow nearly five decades after the release of Easy Rider Vaughs says hes unconcerned about whether hes mentioned in connection with the auctionIm really not worried about getting any credit for this because I know what I did Vaughs says People who were close to me were there in the yard when I was building those bikesTom Dreisbach is an associate producer with weekends on All Things Considered Copyright 2014 NPR,20141011,marijuana

Claudia Guitierrez a 20yearold law student Iguala was never like this before These days Mexicos new paramilitary gendarmerie patrols Igualas streets Twentytwo local cops are under arrest four are fugitives and the remainder of the force was relieved of duty Authorities say that on Sept 26 officers shot at three buses of students from a poor rural teaching college who had come into town soliciting donations After the shooting with six people dead the local cops were seen corralling the surviving students into patrol cars Reportedly some of the officers confessed to turning the students over to a local drug gang which later killed them Authorities say they dont have a motive yet but focus has centered on Igualas mayor and his wife who have wellknown connections to traffickers Igualas First Familys Open Secret Sergio Fajardo Carillo owns a local radio station in Iguala He says the mayoral familys connection to drug traffickers was an open secret in the town  and throughout the state Three brothers of Pineda the mayors wife were lieutenants in the ruthless BeltranLeyva organized crime gang according to prosecutors and the familys own statements Two were killed in a shootout with rivals five years ago according to news reports A third Alberto The Eraser Pineda was released from prison last year and is allegedly the head of the Guerreros Unidos gang  an offshoot from the oncepowerful Beltran organization  that is attempting to take over Iguala National Security Commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido says the cartel which has been implicated in the students disappearance specializes in the transport of marijuana and heroin to Chicago In a video released this week the mayors own motherinlaw says he was on the drug gangs payroll receiving 155000 a month to give the crime organization carte blanche over the city Few appeared to complain  Igualas streets were paved and the budget was in the black for the first time in years The mayor as in many towns throughout this troubled region of Mexico was able to enrich himself and family members collude with gangs and use the local police force to maintain control according to prosecutors rivals and even members of his own political party  including one who publicly accused the mayor of murdering her husband Iguala City Councilwoman Sofia Mendoza says it was the mayor who shot her husband Arturo Hernandez a local community organizer last year He and the mayor had been longtime political rivals and argued publicly at a city council meeting the day before Hernandez was killed She says a witness who saw the mayor shoot her husband in the head even gave a statement to state prosecutors but they did nothing This man had so much power there was little I could do I just had to take it says Mendoza I couldnt bear to look at him anymore Abarca the mayor took away Mendozas office She holds meetings with local constituents at a plastic table on the street behind city hall Embarrassment For The President The revelations of local corruption and crime in Guerrero have embarrassed the administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto His attorney general called international journalists to a meeting earlier this week at his office to discuss the case Jesus Murillo Karam defended his decision not to investigate Igualas leaders earlier Look if your cousin commits a crime that doesnt mean I can investigate you even if its your brother Murillo said I need evidence not suspicions Murillo said he knew about the murder accusations against the mayor but homicides he said fall under state jurisdiction not federal officials Mendoza the Iguala city councilwoman says authorities should have done more If they had paid attention to me and what happened to my husband she says this all could have been avoided Authorities are searching for the mayor his wife and Igualas police chief  who are all wanted for questioning  and for the stillmissing students Copyright 2014

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/09/25/351363171/eric-holder-to-step-down-as-attorney-general?ft=3&f=,This post was last updated at 444 pm ET Eric Holder Jr the nations first black US attorney general will resign his post after a tumultuous tenure marked by civil rights advances national security threats reforms to the criminal justice system and 5 12 years of fights with Republicans in Congress President Obama said on Thursday that Holder 63 intends to leave the Justice Department as soon as his successor is confirmed a process that could run through 2014 and even into next year A former US government official says Holder has been increasingly adamant about his desire to leave soon Holder and President Obama discussed his departure several times and finalized things in a long meeting over Labor Day weekend at the White House Holder already is one of the longestserving members of the Obama Cabinet and currently ranks as the fourthlongest tenured AG in history Hundreds of employees waited in lines stacked three rows deep in early February 2009 to witness his return to the Justice Department where he previously worked as a young corruption prosecutor and as deputy attorney general  the second in command  during the Clinton administration But some of that early glow faded in part due to the politicized nature of the job and in part because of Holders own rhetoric such as a 2009 Black History Month speech where he said the country was a nation of cowards when it comes to discussions about racial tension Five years later violence erupted between police and protesters in Ferguson Mo after a white policeman killed an unarmed black 18yearold And this time the White House dispatched Holder to speak his piece in effect jumpstarting that conversation and helping to settle nerves in the frayed community Another huge controversy  over his decision to try the Sept 11 plotters in a New York courthouse in the shadow of the twin towers of the World Trade Center  prompted venomous reaction from lawmakers New York City officials and some victims families Under pressure that threatened his job and his legacy the attorney general reversed his decision and instead sent the cases to military court  where they continue to languish even as Osama bin Ladens soninlaw and other terrorism defendants are serving life sentences in maximumsecurity prisons on American soil Holder most wants to be remembered for his record on civil rights refusing to defend a law that defined marriage as between one man and one woman suing North Carolina and Texas over voting restrictions that disproportionately affect minorities and the elderly launching 20 investigations of abuses by local police departments and using his bully pulpit to lobby Congress to reduce prison sentences for nonviolent drug crimes Many of those sentences disproportionately hurt minority communities And then theres his relationship with Congress From the day Holders nomination was announced Republicans led by Sen Mitch McConnell RKy signaled that he would be a political lightning rod The attorney generals portfolio which spans sensitive law enforcement cases and hotbutton social issues including marijuana and gay marriage didnt help But even longtime aides say Holder didnt do enough to help himself by shrugging off preparations and moot sessions before congressional appearances and speaking off the cuff  and obliquely Things hit a crisis point when the GOPled House voted him in contempt for refusing to hand over documents about a gun trafficking scandal known as Fast and Furious That represented the first time an attorney general had ever been rebuked that way but still Holder held on to his job In the end the decision to leave was Holders alone  two sources told NPR that the White House would have been happy to have him stay a full eight years and to avoid what could be a contentious nomination fight for his successor The attorney general told DOJ staff the news this morning and called civil rights icon Rep John Lewis DGa and Ethel Kennedy the widow of former AG Robert F Kennedy The sources say a leading candidate for the job is Solicitor General Don Verrilli the administrations top representative to the Supreme Court and a lawyer whose judgment and discretion are prized in both DOJ and the White House Friends and former colleagues say Holder has made no decisions about his next professional perch but they say it would be no surprise if he returned to the law firm Covington  Burling where he spent years representing corporate clients The friends say Holder is also considering donating his papers to a university in Washington DC or his native New York where he could establish a civil rights center to work more on law enforcement interactions with communities of color and host public forums on those issues Even though the attorney general has his eyes on the door the two sources say several more policy and enforcement initiatives are underway and could be announced soon For instance Holder sent a memo to US attorneys Wednesday urging them not to use sentencing enhancements known as 851 tools to gain leverage in plea negotiations with defendants  in essence threatening defendants into avoiding trial with huge amounts of prison time The practice has been criticized by US District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn and other jurists Holder is also expected to notify federal prosecutors in coming days that the Justice Department will no longer require defendants who plead guilty to waive their rights to appeal based on ineffective lawyering Many US attorneys now forgo that practice but not all Longawaited racial profiling guidelines for federal agents will be released soon too Those guidelines will make clear that sexual orientation ethnicity and religion are not legitimate bases for law enforcement suspicion but controversial mapping of certain communities  including Muslim Americans  would still be allowed for national security investigations one of the sources said Update at 444 pm ET An Emotional Goodbye  In an emotional ceremony at the White House on Thursday President Obama said that saying goodbye to Holder was bittersweet He described the attorney general as having a deep abiding commitment to equal justice under the law and to taking steps that further guarantee everyones right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness In his own speech Holder fought back tears He said beyond having a strong working relationship with Obama I am proud to call you a friend Holder said Obamas administration has done much to make real the promise of our democracy Stepping down now he said means the end of his public service But it doesnt mean hell stop working

that weed is bad for your brain One TV ad shows a group of teens lighting up inside a dark car as moody music plays in the background The commercial cites a Duke University study that found a link between regular marijuana use and a lower IQ Some dispute the study the PSA admits But what if years from now you learn those scientists were right The kicker comes as the scene fades to black Dont be a lab rat The campaign which launched last month is designed to target kids in the 12 to 15 age group It also includes a website with links to news stories about the negative effects of marijuana including a few on NPRorg To further reinforce the message the agency has installed huge humansized rat cages near libraries and skate parks in Denver and at concert venues like Red Rocks Amphitheater Its like a big art installation says Mike Sukle who runs Sukle the ad agency the state hired to design the campaign Its the coolest thing that weve ever gotten to work on Sukle says But its a huge challenge Ever since recreational marijuana was legalized in Colorado in January public health officials have faced an unprecedented challenge explaining to teens why they shouldnt smoke weed even though its legal for their parents to do so Surveys and focus groups the state conducted prior to launching the campaign suggest that some teens didnt have a clue that smoking marijuana could hurt them Sukle says Because of medical marijuana a lot of kids thought it cured cancer They really started thinking there was no harm to it Campaigns against teen drinking and tobacco use have generally focused on the health risks But while theres no dearth of research that shows tobacco is bad for us the research on marijuanas effects is still in the preliminary stages Since marijuana isnt legal in most states its been hard for researchers to get federal funding for studies as well as access to large amounts of the substance The Colorado campaign depends on small studies that are hardly bulletproof The brains of teen marijuana users show significant abnormalities the website says Thats technically true  researchers from Northwestern University observed differences in the brains of 20 casual pot users as compared to 20 nonusers However the researchers cant say that these differences are caused by marijuana use and there isnt any evidence to show that these differences are associated with any harm Plus the number of people in the study is so small its not reliable A lot of the facts are from studies that are preliminary And we wanted to be honest with the kids about that Sukle says Hence the lab rat theme Maybe marijuana isnt going to be as bad as it looks he says but it could be really damaging The campaign asks teens whether they want to take that risk To be sure there is a growing body of evidence that shows that marijuana isnt good for the developing brain says Dr Herbert Kleber who directs the Division on Substance Abuse at Columbia University The adolescent brain is still maturing he says and teens who use marijuana are more likely to become dependent on it than adults Plus these days marijuana contains more of the psychoactive ingredient THC than the stuff that John Lennon used to smoke back in the 60s Kleber says The trouble is those messages arent quite as specific or compelling as the ones in Colorados campaign Thats part of the challenge in developing a public health campaign says Kathleen Kelly the director of the Center for Marketing and Social Issues at Colorado State University who is not involved in the lab rat campaign What you have to be very careful about is that your message is credible and its believable Kelly says Dont be a lab rat is a far cry from scare campaigns like Refer Madness the 1939 antimarijuana film that has become a camp classic Theyre not positioning the message as this is absolutely fact Colorados approach seems promising Kelly says Colorado is trying to use a strategy thats somewhat similar to what they do with the Truth campaign against cigarettes she says That campaign which is funded by the nonprofit American Legacy Foundation aims to expose Big Tobaccos lies and manipulation and show kids how the industry tries to trick them into smoking The underlying message is dont be made a fool Kelly says Dont let them convince you that this is safe In Colorado Sukles firm and thirdparty evaluators are tracking how teenagers are responding to the message Still while the campaign may discourage some teens from trying marijuana it doesnt teach those who are going to use it anyway how to reduce risk The first message we need to get out there is Dont use marijuana  says Dr Leslie Walker chief of the Adolescent Medicine division at Seattle Childrens Hospital But if you do dont get behind the wheel Researchers and public health officials are still trying to figure out the best ways to talk to teens about the drug Walker says I think we have some more work to do Copyright 2014

that is so filthy its almost as though youve been further humiliated An Easy Place To Be Murdered Born to a Ghanaian father and an AfricanAmerican mother Quartey was raised in Accra before heading to medical school in the US Both urban and rural Ghana serve as the backdrop to his crime stories The first in the DI Dawson series was 2009s Wife of the Gods Murder at Cape Three Points the third Dawson mystery was published last spring Children of the Street Quarteys second Dawson book concentrates on the neighborhoods of Old Accra on the coastal curve of the Atlantic Ocean Ghana was the first of Britains West African colonial conquests to gain independence in 1957 Quartey makes it a point to personally research his murder locations during trips to Ghana from the US where he remains a practicing physician As loud car and truck horns blast through the air Quartey explains his fascination with Accra which he describes as a highenergy rulesmeanttobebroken kind of place in some areas that he  and Dawson  both find entertaining yet exhausting Sensory overload The sounds the smells and the sights  sometimes so much that your brain gets tired says Quartey But it is a perfect location for murders of all kinds because in many ways for example at nighttime the city becomes very quiet and deserted and certainly very dark Thats when the hustle and bustle traders and street vendors  selling everything from mangoes to carpets and cutlery  have disappeared for the day In the dead of night Quartey says in some ways its easy to get murdered in Accra  and you might be ignored for a while The police may not find you for a little while But Dawsons innate sixth sense sometimes leads the detective off track He agonizes when he hauls in the wrong suspect and has to release them Thats when his loving family steps in to calm Dawson down His two sons  an adopted former street boy named Sly and the plucky but ailing Hosiah or Champ  and his wife are supportive Christine is a smart attractive woman who is a teacher and she provides a lot of insight for him Quartey says Although she is not a cop shes a stabilizing force for him since he can sometimes go off the rails Quartey says when Dawson gets depressed its sometimes Christine who gets him out of it Shes a quiet backbone More And More Ghanaian In the end DI Dawson and his sidekick Philip Chikata get their killer in Children of the Street  and go on to new challenges Quartey whos learning Ghanas lingua franca Twi tells NPR that Ghanaian customs values and language will feature more prominently in his next crime novel in which DI Dawson investigates a dead body and the murky world of illegal gold mining With gold it seems almost a crazy craven rush for wealth from that famous glinting yellow metal Quartey says Yes its a totally different world for him Gold of the Fathers is due out next spring Copyright 2014 NPR,20140902,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/08/26/343432131/colorados-pot-brownies-have-a-new-ingredient-warning-labels?ft=3&f=,When Colorado legalized recreational marijuana use earlier this year it also opened the door for food products infused with the psychoactive ingredient THC to anyone over the age of 21 That means bakers and food companies now have to ensure new products arent contaminated with foodborne pathogens And they have to make sure theyre not falling into the hands of children or are too potent to eat While public policy think tanks like the Brookings Institution have praised state regulators and legislators for their handling of legal marijuana so far problems with potency in edible products have made headlines and turned into public relations headaches for the marijuana industry Some eager inexperienced consumers have overindulged on the potinfused food and then shown up in emergency rooms sweating and paranoid Edibles were linked to the death of a Wyoming college student in Denver Theres been anecdotal evidence that some of the new consumers in the legalized market were not very well informed in terms of how to safely take that product said Lewis Koski Colorados marijuana enforcement director But thats not for lack of information on labels State law requires specific information on all marijuana packages In addition Colorado has been rolling out rules for the ediblemarijuana sector in batches for almost a year now Regulators dropped a big set of what they call emergency rules on Aug 1 which spell out serving sizes limited to 100 milligrams of THC per product and new warning labels But adding even more notes to packages of THCinfused chocolate and granola bars isnt likely to increase safety Koski said If you continue to put other warnings on there you have to really question whether or not that becomes effective as a means to really educate a consumer Koski said So for now most of the dosage education has fallen to the pot shops themselves Brendon Greney works behind the counter at Organic Alternatives a recreational and medical marijuana store in Fort Collins Colo Greney is a budtender as in marijuana flower buds Even though labels are packed full of information Greney says most people dont read them He views himself as an educator For instance when a customer asks about orangeflavored THCinfused liquids in little spray bottles  like a breath freshener  Greney walks him through an appropriate dose I dont know what your tolerance is Greney says to the customer It varies by the individual and metabolism But 10 milligrams is what we recommend The shop is filled with other items too  granola bars lollipops and gummy bears Many edibles stick to the sweets with candies and chocolates dominating store shelves But as marijuana acceptance spreads entrepreneurs are testing the limits of consumer tastes A popup food truck has dished out THCinfused pulled pork sandwiches This is fun It should be fun says Greney And I think its safe if consumed and used the right way  Its not some scary back alley thing Organic Alternatives is fielding questions from customers all over the globe Open for recreational sales since the end of June 2014 the store has already had visitors from all seven continents Yes even Antarctica The store says a researcher based at a substation there recently stopped by Its really our job and our responsibility to educate them and let them know this is a lot different than what your friend made in the 60s says Organic Alternatives manager Maka Kala Thats why the staff hands out industrydeveloped edibles education cards with every purchase telling consumers to Start Low and Go Slow Its in the best interest of marijuana food manufacturers to make sure firsttime consumers have a good experience says Monique Nobil director of marketing for Julie and Kate Baked Goods a Denverbased producer of THCinfused granola The company sells its granola packages with the cards included as well You want to do it in a way thats responsible Nobil says So that you know your end product is what you say it is And so your consumer knows exactly what it is The relatively young industry of edible marijuana manufacturing is still learning lessons in professionalism and good business practices Before Jan 1 these food companies operated in a legal gray area in Colorado serving medical marijuana patients not the general public Now they have to think about new concerns like food safety In a Denver conference room that transition from underground market to a more established respected one is on display Its set up like a classroom The students all have one thing in common Theyre making testing and selling edible marijuana Today is not a cannabis cooking class Its about food safety ServSafe trainer Maureen McNamara tells the room ServSafe is a food safety training program used widely in the restaurant and hospitality industry For years McNamara taught kitchen workers how to wash their hands and keep food at the right temperature But just recently she started a side business to pass along the same information to people making food infused with THC calling her enterprise Cannabis Trainers with classes on food safety and proper instore education for budtenders Trainings like McNamaras are mandatory for potinfusedfood preparers Ediblesmakers also have to test their products for potency molds and foodborne pathogens Any violations handed out by the state could put them out of business With the drug still illegal at the federal level Colorado is wading into uncharted regulatory territory This is the direct result of taking a product that used to exist on the underground market and putting it into a legal regulated one said Taylor West deputy director of the National Cannabis Industry Association Now we have the impetus to do things like trainings to be sure that everything is being handled in a professional manner West says You dont have that in an illegal market Creating a legal regulated market though has presented some challenges Regulators worried pot candies would appeal to children so they mandated all foods be sold in childresistant packages Washington state also working to establish rules for a recreationalmarijuana industry has banned marijuanainfused candies but allows baked goods and bottled drinks While Colorado and Washington attempt to create standards for the recreationalmarijuana sector other states are watching closely I would think for any state that is looking to go down that path theyd be crazy not to look at Colorado and look at the successes and look at the places where weve had to tweak things West said Runyon reports for KUNC and Harvest Public Media a reporting collaboration that focuses on

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/08/22/342481106/are-food-boats-the-next-food-trucks-dont-count-on-it?ft=3&f=,Two rings of a bell that is In Cotuit Bay near Cape Cod those rings signal the arrival of the Ice Cream Boat Captain Tim Titcomb maneuvers the 15foot Carolina skiff along the sandy beaches of Sampsons Island where beachgoers await Good Humor Chocolate Eclairs and Popsicles When I first encountered the seasonal fixture of the Ice Cream Boat last summer I thought This is genius Its like a food truck afloat And it turns out the Ice Cream Boat is not alone There are a handful of vessels around the country peddling food from oceans lakes and rivers Boaters and sandbarbathers alike can get their lunch grilled on food boats like Burger Buoy in New York and Burger Barge in Oregon Swimmers can cool down with a frozen treat from Bay Ice Cream in Panama City Fla You can find them in Michigan and Maine as well Food boats I assumed must be about to explode like food trucks After all Americans clearly love the convenience and novelty of buying food from mobile machines But as I learned after investigating the world of food boats they arent like food trucks at all and theyre not likely to catch on like wildfire Heres why Food boats arent copying each other Most of the food boats out there seem to be the only one in their community And while the number of food truck is growing nationwide food boats are a movement so quiet that nearly every food boat owner I spoke with had never heard of any of the others We went into it blind says Ari Fingeroth owner of Nauti Foods Washington DCs first food boat that launched this summer Since weve started a lot of people have told us about other food boats Food boats dont cater to foodies One of the reasons food trucks have multiplied on city streets is that theyve figured out how to specialize and exploit culinary niches from Korean tacos to Maryland crab sandwiches to gourmet popcorn Food boats are more limited by the vessels A pontoon might be able to fit a grill on board but very few boats have the space for a full kitchen Many food boats are just floating snack bars offering cold beverages and prepackaged goods Titcomb says that his local health department regulations are stricter for madetoorder food  a boat would need running water bathrooms and frequent storage space inspections among other things The ice cream is prepackaged so were not handling any of the products directly said Titcomb Its easier to obtain licenses because its more sanitary Food boats face lots of regulations and restrictions Health codes and vendor laws vary greatly by location The Cotuit Bay Ice Cream Boat just needed health and hawkers licenses but not every boat has it so easy Nauti Foods which offers freshprepared spiralcut hot dogs called NautiDogs was treated like a food truck but with extra precautions says Fingeroth They dealt with the local health department the DC River Authority the police and marine patrol who had concerns about the river and the safety of people who approach the boat There were a lot of hoops to jump through says Fingeroth Food boats arent that great of a business Hawking snacks to people near water with little more than a few crumpled up dollar bills in their swimtrunks is hardly a recipe for big profit For Fingeroth and his partner Tammar Berger Nauti Foods is just a fun weekend project started on a lark They have fulltime jobs For Titcomb running the Ice Cream Boat is a summer gig thats been passed down through his family for years He says its not particularly lucrative but its more fun than washing dishes at the local seafood joint Every day someone tells us to raise prices More food boats could clutter the environment Sure food trucks fight over parking  but food boats encroach on more than just traffic lanes Because their customers are primarily there to enjoy the outdoors food boats are particularly careful to avoid overcrowding the environment The culture of boating could easily be destroyed by too many boats says Titcomb Fingeroth who has been boating on the Potomac since 2000 agrees I love being out on the water he said We want to add to that experience not ruin it Fingeroth added that some of that responsibility lies with government organizations like Marine Patrol which will be crucial in controlling any influx of food boats in the future OK So food boats are not that trendy But if its not a trend then what is it Its probably a small manifestation of the going mobile trend says Marian Berelowitz editorial director at JWTIntelligence a trends research and analysis group Like food trucks they speak to the idea of people being more innovative with established business models and being more creative with how to deliver a product to consumers While its another way to meet consumers need for instant gratification Berelowitz doesnt see huge trend potential Its limited in the extent to which it could evolve she says For now the boats satisfy a quirky niche within their community at least until they get their sea legs Copyright 2014 NPR,20140825,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2014/08/19/321326102/one-of-europes-latest-crassroots-movement-cannabis-social-clubs?ft=3&f=,Gabriela walks into a large dimly lit apartment goes to a counter buys a bag of sativa and sits on the sofa with her friends joint in hand like in Amsterdam Except this is not Amsterdam This is Barcelona and the open sale of marijuana is illegal Still places like these are popping up all over the city and in many other European capitals like London Paris and Ljubljana Slovenia part of a sneaky end run around Europes widespread prohibition of pot These cannabis social clubs are seemingly innocent nonprofit associations that only serve members at least in principle Call it a grassroots movement emphasis on the grass Its so convenient says Gabriela a 25yearold secretary You pay a small yearly fee and then just come pick what you want and sit around watching TV playing video games  some fancy clubs even serve drinks and hot food Well have one large pizza hold the prohibition please Club Cannabis is a sexy model in a legal gray area The social clubs operate openly in countries where personal consumption of small amounts of weed is not prosecuted and growing that small amount might not technically break the law either Pair quasilegal personal consumption with the right of association and you have a pretty sneaky way around marijuana prohibition As long as the total amount grown and distributed matches the sum of individual legal limits  presto  its not illegal trafficking say members The authorities sometimes disagree In June a Catalonian club was shut down for drug trafficking and some in the movement are pushing for more regulation so as to distinguish good clubs from bad ones The spread of European clubs tracks the awkward steps toward legalization in the United States In both places the shift began with medical marijuana In the United States many states have sanctioned uses of the drug that are banned under federal law  an absurd situation according to most observers European law begs logic too In many European countries private consumption is decriminalized but growing and selling weed remains illegal In spite of their different processes Europe is heading to the same place as the United States Users are puff puff puffing their way toward easier access and legalization The social clubs are for some a sly way to smoke up with friends but proponents have embraced them as a cause saying theyre a model for grassroots regulation Cannabis social clubs are the best alternative to a strict government monopoly or the largescale legalization which tends to incentivize consumption and benefit only big companies says Joep Oomen founder of Belgiums first CSC Trekt Uw Plant and secretary of the European Coalition for Just and Effective Drug Policies Its a crazy patchwork quilt of regulation across Europe But somehow marijuana usage seems to be spreading almost everywhere In Belgium having less than 3 grams of weed or one female plant is OK So the five cannabis clubs in the country cant offer more than that per person and cant have shared smoking spaces either Members go to an office to pick it up and then head home to smoke Purchasing drugs for personal use isnt criminal in Slovenia though users could face fines Still the country has six clubs and will have 10 soon according to Jaka Bitenc founder of the countrys first cannabis association SkSk The ultimate stoner paradise is Spain where the law allows growing and consuming marijuana for private use without specifying a quantity Pot clubs are thriving The number of clubs in Spain has grown from 40 in 2010 to more than 700 today with over 165000 members People come because they want to know the quality of what they consume and they want to support a more transparent model than the black market says Martin Barriuso from Club Pannagh Of course some clubs skirt the rules In violation of founding principles and codes of conduct many associations allow members to register online In downtown Barcelona its easy to spot people giving out fliers or bringing in tourists for a quick puff Some call Barcelona the Holland of the South In Catalonia alone pot associations sell an estimated 5 million a month 67 million so its no surprise that a club has already been shut down for drug trafficking and four people have been accused of moneylaundering Regional authorities have responded by drafting strict new measures to regulate the sector such as forbidding the use of cash or advertisements Spains Ministry of Health is set to come up with new regulations by 2015 Most associations welcome the news Regulation was a necessity because we have been operating with a lot of legal insecurity and things were getting out of hand says Jaume Xaus the spokesman for the Catalonia Federation of Cannabis Associations Others would rather ban the clubs outright Legislating is giving up says Per Johansson secretary of the board of the World Federation Against Drugs He says arguments in favor of cannabis social clubs are naive at best because regulation will not put an end to the black market Still Johansson seems like a voice in the wilderness as associations gain momentum even in countries where the laws are strict In France any consumption or distribution is illegal and yet there are some 400 underground clubs The UK is also gearing up with 74 associations like the London Cannabis Club which organizes meetings for weed aficionados to discuss growing methods and lobbying strategies and have the occasional smokeout Austrias Hemp Institute just launched a parliamentary initiative to legalize cannabis and major Swiss cities like Geneva Basel and Bern are backing an initiative to regularize the use of marijuana through users associations Theres even talk of a first cannabis cafe opening in Berlin Of course the social club model could go up in smoke if governments legislate against it More likely This bottomup approach could get European countries rivaling Colorado as a smokers heaven Copyright 2014 Ozycom,20140819,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/2014/08/18/340628014/in-south-texas-few-on-the-fence-over-divisive-border-wall-issue?ft=3&f=,When Congress thinks about border security it often sees a big imposing fence The federal government has spent 23 billion to build the fence  649 miles of steel fencing in sections between the US and Mexico designed to help control the illegal movement of people and contraband Its called tactical infrastructure and the Border Patrol says it works But people on the lower Texas border have another name for it a boondoggle If you ask Pamela Taylor about the tall rustcolored fence that tops the river levee near her house outside of Brownsville she wont mince words I cant speak for the Border Patrol For me it seems like a useless piece of crap Take a look They undocumented immigrants are walking over They have boats lined up on the other side of the river to row these people across Taylor says Taylor has lived here beside the sluggish Rio Grande in her unairconditioned brick home surrounded by mesquite trees and bougainvillea for 67 of her 86 years Like so many residents down here in South Texas  which used to be part of Mexico  she treats the border jumpers like human beings even if she opposes them Every day she puts out water bottles and sodas in ice chests by her mailbox We fill that up every night For anybody Border Patrol illegals people working in the fields she says standing by the two Igloo chests They all come and theyre welcome to it Its only been in recent years Taylor says that immigrants began using her property as a favorite crossing spot They paddle across the river walk across the road hide in the cotton plants and wait for the smugglers car to show up Then they pile in drive through a yawning gap in the border fence and away they go Now theyre insisting we need to go in and build more fence she says Dont they see that the fence is not working A Divisive Line In spite of fence detractors like Taylor  and there are a lot of them  the Border Patrol steadfastly defends PF Pedestrian Fence 225 the official name for the Rio Grande Valley border wall Its not actually one continuous wall Its 54 miles of fencing in 18 individual sections The idea was to erect the wall mainly where cities and towns touch the border to force illegal crossers into more rural areas where border agents have a tactical advantage Our objective is to work the area on our terms Ideally you want to push the traffic where its easier for us to work says Robert Duff chief of operational programs in the Rio Grande Valley Sector of the Border Patrol And thats going to be away from the metro areas where the vanishing point is very short to where weve got more of a response time Outside the federal agency the perspective from county and city officials couldnt be more different That has been the biggest waste of money says Ramon Garcia county judge of Hidalgo the most populous county in the region He refers to the reported cost of pedestrian border fencing 65 million per mile and to the recent surge of migrant children from Central America Its a joke Garcia continues When you got all these 58000 unaccompanied minors getting through there I mean you tell me that its worth it and if its working And its not just people that the fence is not stopping Sgt Rolando Garcia is head of police special investigations in the city of San Juan which is right on the river Heres what he had to say when asked if the border wall has slowed down drug smuggling from Mexico In order to get their product across they basically measured the gap between the fence and started building their marijuana bundles within that gap so they could just slide through the fence Garcia says A border wall isnt really gonna help A Fence Does Not Seal The Border The Border Patrol and the US Army Corps of Engineers ran into all sorts of problems when the fence was under construction from 2008 to 2010 Some residents bitterly opposed it The vertical steel barrier slices through city parks college campuses nature preserves farmers fields and residential property Most border land in Texas is private property To build the fence the Border Patrol had to enter into negotiations or begin condemnation proceedings with landowners which cost time and money Some lawsuits are still in court Whats more the Rio Grande flows through a broad floodplain where both countries are not supposed to build fences that would obstruct a flooding river So in places the border fence sits on top of a levee thats a halfmile or more distant from the river And as Pamela Taylor found out its a no mans land on the south side of the fence Fencing is not the end all be all says the Border Patrols Robert Duff I started my career in San Diego and saw them construct the initial fence and then two and three layers of fencing Theyll go over it theyll go under it theyll go through it A fence does not seal the border It helps but its not the solution Just as important Duff says are agents on the ground aircraft boats lights cameras and other tactical equipment  Perhaps expectations were too high Perhaps people thought the wall was supposed to stop illegal traffic They built an 18foot wall and people came with a 19foot ladder and people just crossed right over the top So I think a fence can only be so tall says Chris Cabrera local spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council the agents union As for PF225 its done There were plans to build 16 more miles of wall in the Upper Valley in Starr County but the agency ran out of money Copyright 2014

playing field capable of lifting up the less advantaged and improving their chances for success Play by the rules work hard apply yourself and do well in school and that will open doors for you is how Karl Alexander a Johns Hopkins University sociologist puts it But a study published in June suggests that the things that really make the difference  between prison and college success and failure sometimes even life and death  are money and family Alexander is one of the authors of The Long Shadow which explored this scenario Take two kids of the same age who grew up in the same city  maybe even the same neighborhood What factors will make the difference for each To find the answer the Hopkins researchers undertook a massive study They followed nearly 800 kids in Baltimore  from first grade until their late20s They found that a childs fate is in many ways fixed at birth  determined by family strength and the parents financial status The kids who got a better start  because their parents were married and working  ended up better off Most of the poor kids from singleparent families stayed poor Just 33 children  out of nearly 800  moved from the lowincome to highincome bracket And a similarly small number born into lowincome families had college degrees by the time they turned 28 We traveled to Baltimore to spend time with two of the people whom Alexander and the team tracked for nearly three decades Here are their stories Monica Jaundoo Of Parkville Md Monica Jaundoo didnt have an easy life growing up in Baltimore in the early 80s I remember being so immune to death so immune to shootings killings I just remember wanting them to rush like get the body out the way so we can get back to playing hopscotch or dodgeball she says Things werent just bad outside in her neighborhood Life at home was rough too It was like really hot No air conditioning Barely gas and electric she recalls It was rodents It was just very miserable In addition Jaundoos parents have long struggled with drugs and alcohol And she says her older brothers still do Theyve spent pretty much all their life being incarcerated Jaundoo says of her brothers It was a very long time before either one of them were at home at the same time In many ways Jaundoos story is typical of the children the researchers followed She didnt go away to college She barely got out of Baltimore  just about 10 miles to Parkville Md And so her story raises a question How can a child with the deck stacked against her get out and get ahead In her case it did happen When I had my son I knew right off the bat I wanted things to be different for him she says Though in her own childhood Jaundoo didnt have the advantages of money or the most supportive family as a parent she was determined her son and daughter would have both Shes got a steady job that pays well managing sleep studies she says Shes in a strong relationship and plans to get married And her children  Romeo 17 and 8yearold Makai  are both on the honor roll Makais in a gifted and talented program and Romeos looking at colleges He doesnt know here hes going quite yet but plans to major in environmental protection Jaundoo prides herself on having been candid with her children She says theyre astonished when they hear the stark differences between the way she grew up and their childhood My mom tells me about the stories how she used to live in her childhood and I like this better says 8yearold Makai Because like she gives me support on stuff and I enjoy  how it is If the Hopkins report is any indication Makai and Romeo have a far better shot at future success than their mother did John Houser Of Baltimore Md Growing up the son of a sprinklerfitter you learn a lot of things But mostly the value of hard work John Houser tells us You work You dont complain you dont take days off he says If you are sick enough take a day off but make sure you come back immediately He grew up surrounded by a big tightknit family Grandparents an aunt and an uncle all lived within a couple of blocks He remembers regular trips out to Baltimore County to visit his cousins Houser didnt realize it at the time but he thinks his parents did a pretty good job with him There comes a point where  it was even before I had a kid you realize they did a damn good job and they actually did care more than you ever ever realized and thats a powerful thing when you realize that he says Thats one of those moments where you grab the phone Mom Thanks For what Just thanks Im alive You kept me alive  Houser went off to college at Frostburg State University but he watched friends who grew up on the same blocks turn to drugs A couple of us are dead  We actually just had a buddy die from a heart attack which is terrifying he was 37 38 He pauses remembering a friend who died 20 years ago this summer from drugs Houser says he only smoked marijuana but many of his friends didnt stop there So how did he avoid going down the same road You see what happens You see friends mothers start tricking or you see how they change like in a few months They turn into skeletons They turn into slaves Its horrifying he says Racial Disparities Housers story reflects another facet of the Johns Hopkins study The researchers found that more affluent white men in the study reported the highest frequency of drug abuse and binge drinking yet they still had the most upward mobility The extent of what we refer to as problem behavior is greatest among whites and less so among AfricanAmericans Alexander says Whites of advantaged background had the highest percentages who did all three of those things  that was binge drinking any drug use and heavy drug use These numbers from Alexanders research show the racial disparities in men with similar drug problems and arrest records At age 22 89 percent of white high school dropouts were working compared with 40 percent of black dropouts And by age 28 41 percent of white men born into lowincome families had criminal convictions compared with 49 percent of the black men from similar backgrounds Houser says he understands how some young men turn to crime He knows how the appeal of quick money and nice cars and clothes compares with slinging burgers and fries for a few bucks an hour You just gotta believe that somewhere down the line its gonna pay off he says And for Houser

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2014/07/09/329587949/states-push-for-prison-sentence-reform-and-prosecutors-push-back?ft=3&f=,Some red states like Louisiana and Texas have emerged as leaders in a new movement to divert offenders from prisons and into drug treatment work release and other incarceration alternatives By most counts Louisiana has the highest incarceration rate in the country In recent years sentencing reformers in the capital Baton Rouge have loosened some mandatory minimum sentences and have made parole slightly easier for offenders to get But as reformers in Louisiana push for change theyre also running into stiffening resistance  especially from local prosecutors Its all happening as the number of Americans behind bars has started to decline There are multiple reasons for that including crime rates that have been dropping since the 1990s as well as the impact of the Supreme Courts 2011 requirement that toughoncrime California reduce its prison population And theres another factor a growing bipartisan consensus for sentencing reform Local politicians are getting political cover for those efforts from conservative groups like Right on Crime It is a growing consensus on the right that this is the direction we want to be going says Kevin Kane of the libertarianleaning Pelican Institute for Public Policy in Louisiana Most people will point to Well its saving money and thats all conservatives care about But I think it goes beyond that Kane says libertarians are interested in limiting the governments power to lock people away while the religious right likes the idea of giving people a shot at redemption  especially when it comes to nonviolent drug offenders Still not everyone is embracing these ideas In some places theres been considerable pushback  especially when the idea of eliminating prison time for drug offenders arises Pushback In Louisiana In Lafayette La the sheriffs department has reinvented its approach to drug offenders Marie Collins a counselor by trade runs the departments treatment programs She estimates at least 80 percent of the people in the parish jail got there because of substance abuse The concept of Lets lock them up and throw away the key does nothing for society and does nothing for us because you havent taught them anything she says So theres counseling offered inside this jail The sheriffs staff is also constantly scanning the jails population for nonviolent inmates it can release early into the appropriate programs on the outside One option is the Acadiana Recovery Center right next door a treatment program run by Collins and the sheriffs department  though the staffers play down their connection to law enforcement In fact you can seek treatment there even if youve never been arrested If we can be proactive and provide the treatment before they get to jail itll actually cost us less money Collins says Arguments like that are making headway at the state level But reformers in Baton Rouge are also experiencing pushback By most counts the state has the highest incarceration rate in the country and theres a traditional preference for long sentences The states prison population is also hard for lawmakers to ignore Under guard and dressed in gray jumpsuits marked offender inmates work at the capitol building emptying wastebaskets and serving food in the cafeteria Liz Mangham a lobbyist has represented the conservative sentencing reformers in Baton Rouge While theyve made progress she says they appeared to cross a red line this spring with a bill to step down Louisianas stiff penalties for possession of marijuana Under current law possession is a felony on the second offense A third may get you as much as 20 years in prison Mangham recalls the scene when the bill came up for a crucial hearing The Judiciary Committee room was full The anteroom across the hall which is twice the size was full and the halls were full  of district attorneys and sheriffs coming down to oppose the bill she says The bill died on the spot In Louisiana and other parts of the South district attorneys and sheriffs  who Mangham calls the courthouse crowd  have a lot of political clout at the state level She says its understandable why most sheriffs opposed the bill because they house state prisoners in parish jails and every prisoner represents a payment from the state So when youre making money to warehouse prisoners why on earth would you be in favor of sentencing reform Mangham says But the district attorneys opposition is more complex  and interesting And its emblematic of a growing conflict thats taking place nationally between sentencing reformers and prosecutors The Issue Leverage The vast majority of criminal cases in America are resolved through plea bargains Defendants plead guilty out of fear of getting a worse sentence if they dont Plea bargains jumped above 90 percent in the 1980s and 90s in part because a wave of harsh new sentences for drug offenses strengthened prosecutors hands when bargaining with defendants For a DA to have the ability to dangle over someones head 10 20 years in jail that provides them with tremendous leverage to pretty much get whatever they want says Louisiana State Sen JP Morrell a Democrat from New Orleans and former public defender Morrell was one of the sponsors of the marijuana sentencing reform bill that failed in Baton Rouge He says one of the benefits of that reform would have been a reduction in the power of prosecutors to as Louisiana courthouse slang puts it bitch a defendant A reference to Louisianas habitual offender law it refers to a DA threatening to use past convictions  often for marijuana possession  to multiply the length of a defendants potential sentence But what Morrell sees as a problem prosecutors regard as a necessary tool Thats because many states are now considering similar reductions to mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses and Congress is considering a similar move for federal drug charges Prosecutors insist they use the threat of harsh sentences responsibly but say its a tool they cant do without Last fall at a hearing in the US Senate Judiciary Committee the thenexecutive director of the National District Attorneys Association Scott Burns warned against rolling back drug sentences Why now With crime at record lows why are we looking at sweeping changes Burns said He endorsed smart on crime reforms such as drug courts but he cautioned against depriving prosecutors of one of our most effective sticks John de Rosier the district attorney of Calcasieu Parish La says we have people all the time that we know have been involved in robberies rapes and murders We havent been able to prove our cases but were in court with them for secondoffense possession of marijuana What do you think were going to do Thats commonly referred to as prosecutorial discretion and its an argument that alarms sentencing reformers like Morrell That level of discretion ought to be terrifying to people Morrell says If you cannot convict someone of a murder of a robbery whatever the fact that you have a disproportionate backup charge to convict them anyway kind of defeats the purpose of due process The pushback against sentencing reform also comes from a fear that liberalizing drug laws too much could cost lives Even as Morrell was trying to reduce sentences for marijuana this spring the Louisiana Legislature was contemplating increasing real sentences for heroin possession Like other parts of the country Louisiana has been experiencing a surge in heroin deaths People are being found dead with the needle still in their arm says Rep Joseph Lopinto a Republican from Metairie La He sponsored the bill that would require prison time even for a first offense In a perfect world I would like everybody thats on heroin right now to go get treated Lopinto says But most of the time when that come to Jesus moment happens its because of law enforcement Even Collins the Lafayette Sheriffs Department counselor admits prison has its uses I do see putting them in jail and expecting them to get better because we said so is ridiculous she says However if you put them in a treatment program and utilize prison as a motivational tool it is very effective The Scales Of Justice Still if a prosecutor is going to threaten drug users with jail time that threat has to be credible  someone has to be the example And in Louisiana those examples can seem extreme Nobody knows this better than Lisa Ladd whose 27yearold son Corey is now serving a 20year sentence for his conviction for thirdoffense marijuana possession He was arrested with a halfounce Ladd seems dumbfounded by whats happened to Corey He broke the law he does deserve some sort of punishment she says But 20 years The scales of justice are just so way off balance They really are Now shes raising her imprisoned sons infant daughter As she talks about it she breaks down I just lost a son she says and after a moment it becomes clear that shes not talking about Corey Another son who was 23 died of a drug overdose Ladd just got the paperwork from the coroner It looks like it was a mix of heroin and pills Ladds younger son did not have the same kind of legal troubles Corey did Instead of jail he went for treatment in Florida But it didnt take and now hes the one whos dead Would he still be alive if hed had that come to Jesus moment with law enforcement as Lopinto puts it Its that kind of question thats dogging the states as they try to figure out the best way to deal with their stillcrowded prisons Copyright 2014

emailFirst of all congratulations What impact will this prize have on your life and writing Thank you very much I dont think this wonderful prize will have any impact on my writing No prize does youre still by yourself facing the blank screen trying to make sense of language the characters and the story Those anxieties and uncertainties dont go away On the other hand life may change for a writer like myself these prizes mean I get to write future books worrying less about keeping an income while I write Lastly theres the tremendous honor of making a part of that list of winners And thats something to be grateful forHow do you begin to write a novel What was this novels genesis Novels evolve very slowly for me before I get down to write them First there is a sort of fascination with different materials I find and collect over many years stories people tell me documents I find in unexpected places  and I slowly begin seeing strange relationships between them Then I see a character that interests me and I discover that those documents and this character are part of the same web The Sound of Things Falling began with my exploration of this pilot who had smuggled marijuana into the US in the early 70s But 10 years before I started writing his story Id found the transcription of the black box recording of an American Airlines plane that crashed in the Colombian mountains in 1995 Later I found the letters of an American Peace Corps volunteer who writes home telling his family about that strange place Colombia Before that a friend had told me about her grandmother who was present at an aerial exhibition in the 1930s which ended in disaster And in 2009 I found in a Colombian magazine a photo of a dead hippo Things started coming together or rather writing the novel was the art of putting together things that didnt necessarily belong togetherThough drug wars are an explosive and dynamic topic inner dramas are the real core of this novel Was this a conscious choice Well this is a Colombian novel and it explores a period of Colombian recent history but it tries to explore universal feelings and emotions  as all literature does I guess Im not interested in topics I write first about characters and their predicaments and slowly I realize that Im actually writing about such and such topic With this novel I discovered at some point that part of my motivation to write came from the fact that we had grown up used to the public side of the drug wars but there was nowhere to go to explore the inner dramas you talk about the moral emotions psychological side of that public violence So it was then  halfway through the novel  that the choice became consciousYou left Colombia for many years and then returned Why did you leave and why did you come back I left because I wanted to become a novelist and I thought leaving was the way to do it I also left because my relationship with my country my attachments to it had deteriorated over a decade of extreme violence I came back because of family reasons and because the place had changed so much it now seemed strange to me and I need this feeling of strangeness to feel comfortableAnd in other book newsFor The Millions Alix Ohlin writes about the Swedish author Tove Jansson and her hippopotamine sometimes melancholy character Moomin Childhood as I knew it was rife with secrecy and weirdness with actions that made sense to you but not anybody else Its no wonder that I fell in love with Moomin  The universe of Moomin is sometimes magical with a hobgoblin hat that can change Moomin into an ugly version of himself but it is also cozy a paracosm where danger is slight and the next meal of pancakes is never far away Yet despite the hominess the key feature of the Moomin books is a thrumming note of

20s to late 40s  are standing in a circle participating in a callandresponse exerciseCall You done broke them chains Response From my body and my brain Call But you was deaf dumb and blind Response Til I took back my mindIt goes on the resonant voices repeating strengths and goals in unison Welcome to the start of the responsiblefatherhood class a group that meets every Monday and Wednesday at the Center for Urban Families in West BaltimoreThis isnt your typical classroom setting The tables are arranged to face one another The teachers like Edward Pitchford are called fatherhood specialists They dont lecture at the front but sit with their students and engage them in discussions based on the days curriculum communicating calmly and effectively with the mother of their children and nurturing their kids not just paying child support Today theyre talking about staying strong and positive during a job searchOne of the participants who came through the program he had an opportunity to get a job Pitchford tells the class Making 25 an hour and they told him he had to cut his locks and if he cut his locks this job is secure for himShouts of You better cut them locks and Thats a lot of money cut your hair fill the air But Pitchford says the participant refused to cut his dreadlocks and didnt get the job A young man on one side of the class with locks past his shoulders nods his head in approval another shakes his recently shaved dome and says he cut his hair for a job making a lot less at Burger King to provide for his kids and hed do it againSome of the guys have been coming to this group for a long time It serves as a support network a safe place to share successes and talk through stumblesThis is my sanctuary says 40yearold LaKeeth Blackmon a place where I can be myself and meet good people and not get caught up with whats going on in the streets Blackmon has six kids  with three different women Hes been in and out of prison and has an upcoming court date because he was caught dealing marijuana a little over a year agoLook at my life I dont even know if Im going back to prison but Im here being positive says Blackmon who is dressed in slacks and a tie for todays meeting His father was a drug dealer who was murdered 20 years ago and Blackmon says he wants to be a better father so his kids dont get caught up in the cycleKenneth Edwards is newer to class The tall stalky bespectacled 30yearold is a father of four three boys and one girl Hes living with his girlfriend and daughter now His three boys each have different mothers and he wants to be more involved in their lives Thats why hes here he says  to figure out how to do that in the right wayHe calls his father a holiday dad He comes around you know on birthdays holidays Edwards was raised by a single mom in the oncenotorious Lexington Terrace housing projects This crazy environment with all these drug dealers and people using drugs just chaos There was absolutely no role models I would say besides the television Edwards says that before coming to the class he got the bulk of his fatherhood guidance from shows like Full House and Family MattersHow do you develop behavior when you dont see it asks Joseph Jones creator of the Baltimore Responsible Fatherhood Project and president of the Center for Urban Families in West Baltimore How do you become a man if youve never seen somebody be a man if the people in your life have abdicated their responsibilities and left you as a little personJones grew up in Baltimore without a dad for the most part and fathered his first son young He was a drug dealer and addict at the time and says an inpatient rehab program saved his life He went to college and spent almost a decade working at the Baltimore City Health Department There Jones was charged with getting substanceabusing pregnant women to their doctors appointments and was often confronted by angry boyfriendsTheyd say Who the hell are you with my girl And I said OK let me stop what Im doing give him attention and help him understand that Im not a threat to him or his girl Jones says And once I got their confidence they said We need help man Jones says he developed this program nearly two decades ago to help those men whom he says social programs have ignored in favor of assisting mothers and children He says he knows two meetings a week isnt a panacea to the problems facing black fathers in Baltimores inner city but its a positive starting pointThe fatherhood class ends similarly to how it began But this time the men are in a circle made tighter by crossing their arms and grabbing their neighbors hands The call and response at the start is replaced with a powerful unified recitation of the Serenity PrayerGod grant me the serenity  to accept the things I cannot change  courage to change the things I can and wisdom to know the differenceAnd then someone spontaneously shouts Happy Fathers Day brothers Copyright 2014 NPR,20140618,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2014/06/04/318801651/burning-down-the-house-makes-the-case-against-juvenile-incarceration?ft=3&f=,The American rate of juvenile incarceration is seven times that of Great Britain and 18 times that of France It costs on average 88000 a year to keep a youth locked up  far more than the US spends on a childs educationBut the biggest problem with juvenile incarceration author Nell Bernstein tells Fresh Airs Dave Davies is that instead of helping troubled kids get their lives back on track detention usually makes their problems worse and sets them in the direction of more crime and selfdestructive behaviorThe greatest predictor of adult incarceration and adult criminality wasnt gang involvement wasnt family issues wasnt delinquency itself Bernstein says The greatest predictor that a kid would grow up to be a criminal was being incarcerated in a juvenile facilityBernsteins new book Burning Down the House The End of Juvenile Prison takes an indepth look at juvenile incarceration The journalist has spent years covering the juvenile justice system and has interviewed hundreds of young people in detention facilitiesAlmost from the moment a young person walks in those gates its made very clear to him that hes a prisoner she says I know that when I go into these places and cross the razor wire and hand over my drivers license I often feel like Ive stamped my passport at the border of a new country Its that differentWhile many states have tried to reform their juvenile detention facilities Bernstein says that locking young people away is the wrong way to deal with most youth offenders Their experiences behind those walls help shape who they areIts their identity and eventually its their lot in life she says which goes a long way to explaining why juvenile detention predicts adult incarcerationInterview HighlightsOn the kinds of offenses juveniles commit We tend to think of any kind of prison as full of murderers and rapists Thats not the case About 40 percent of those that we keep in largescale state facilities  which are intended for the worst of the worst as opposed to county juvenile halls  about 40 percent of them are there for not just lowlevel offenses but very lowlevel offenses truancy shoplifting loitering disturbing the peace So especially the younger kids enter with these very lowlevel offenses Only about a quarter are there for violent crime index offenses which include rape and murder but also robbery and aggravated assaultOn fear and punishment A lot of them talked about being numb to fear but some of that felt like leftover bravado to me because the stories they told of what actually happened to them were so terrifying that I cant believe that there wasnt fearOne young man described arriving at a new facility just as a fight broke out in the dormitory to which he had been assigned And although he hadnt been involved his whole dorm was stripped to their boxers handcuffed chained together taken to the gymnasium and forced to kneel there for what turned out to be two weeks Is fear the right word for what you feel during an experience like that I dont know because again he described his humanity draining out of him as he listened to the guards banter and tell jokes and just pass the time as if these were something other than suffering human beings on the floor in front of them I have to say whenever I could I checked these stories against official transcripts  and there are a lot of them because these places get sued very frequently  and in almost every case what I heard was either verified or what I read was even worse than what the young people had told meOn the therapeutic treatment in juvenile facilities There is a movement towards treatment inside juvenile facilities and I sat in on some of these groups these therapeutic modalities  and what the kids would tell me was Im supposed to open my heart in group and put my deepest traumas on the table but the guy leading the group has the key to my cell So right there you have a conundrumA few kids told me that although they were told that group was a safe place if they didnt tell their story or if they told it in a way that didnt match their file they would get a writeup for not taking responsibility for their actions or not participating in the program  and that could in fact delay their release dateI went in with a positive idea about treatmentoriented facilities but I came out thinking that its just paradoxical You cant have a therapeutic interaction with a guy who has the key to your cellOn sexual abuse in juvenile facilities We have a federal law PREA the Prison Rape Elimination Act which includes adults and juveniles and has taken 10 years to get even to the implementation phase But to me the idea that we need a special law telling adults not to rape the kids that they are in charge of is just stunning to meTwelve percent of kids at least are being abused inside these facilities and  theres a general culture of impunity I think I can count on probably one hand the number of instances in which a guard was actually prosecuted for raping somebody in his care What that tells the kids is I steal a pack of cigarettes and Im gone He does this to me and the worst thats going to happen to him is a transfer or maybe a fine So what the kids learn from that is its not just what they do that makes them delinquents its who they areOn race and juvenile facilities A black kid today is almost five times more likely to be locked up as a white kid who committed the exact same crime Eighty to 90 percent of all American teenagers in confidential interviews will acknowledge that they have committed an offense or offenses that under the law they could be locked up for Most of those kids nothing happens There are not police cruisers in my neighborhood If my son who is white happened to be standing on the corner hes not going to be stopped and frisked And if he happened to have bag of marijuana in his pocket nobody is going to find it Those kinds of differential treatment  permeate the system from arrest all the way through reentry into the communityOn an alternative to juvenile incarceration Missouri is a very hopeful example They got rid of all of their large facilities and replaced them with very small familylike houses where the staff were trained to connect to the childrenBut what most impressed me were a trio of programs that are known as the evidencebased programs because theyve been extensively studied  What all three of them do is keep a child in the community connect that child with a case worker who is available to him around the clock for a limited period of time I think the key about these programs is that they work with the child and his family because kids come back to their families and if family problems contributed to delinquency if you just ignore the family again youre setting kids up for failureThose programs have success rates much much higher than the negative 100 percent success rate that incarceration does Theyre used across the country thats whats so confounding And the jurisdictions that use them brag about them but they use them for only a few kids Theyre boutique alternatives when all the evidence is that they should be the norm And incarceration  if used at all  should be the exception Copyright 2014

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2014/05/25/315292234/i-wanna-make-art-sturgill-simpsons-twisting-path-to-nashville?ft=3&f=,Theres an old joke that if you play a country song in reverse your dog runs home your wife comes back to you and your pickup truck starts running again  the point being modern country music is usually filled with distinctly bluecollar downtoearth woes On the new album Metamodern Sounds in Country Music Sturgill Simpson uses some familiar country sounds to get at themes that are a bit more transcendental Theres a gateway in our mind that leads somewhere out there beyond this plane  Where reptile aliens made of light cut you open and pull out all your pain goes a line from the opening track NPRs Rachel Martin spoke with Simpson to find out what inspired such heady lyrics and whether he considers himself part of the country tradition at all Hear the radio version at the audio link and read more of their conversation below So your music  a lot of people have said this  has this kind of classic outlaw country sound to it But when you hone in on the lyrics there are some unusual themes Just in the song Turtles All the Way Down weve got references to Jesus and Buddha drugs and turtles theres a lot going on Can you unpack it for me Yeah Ive done a few interviews so far and Im learning the less I talk about it the more opportunity I leave for people to form their own interpretation But a lot of the journalists have gotten hung up on one or two things that werent really the main objective for me writing it Then lets do two things Answer my question thats annoying to you and then tell me what the bigger takeaway is that you think is more significant OK I will attempt to do my best here I think it really stems from a few things One Im very happily married and have a child on the way Im just not occupying a head space anymore of where I spent a lot of time in my early life  you know where most country songs come from So the thought of sitting down and having to barrel out another album of heartbroken drinking songs wasnt something that I found tremendously inspiring I have some hobbyist interests that Ive always found fascinating based on a very naive approach and I decided to incorporate some of those things into the disguise of a traditional modern country record What do you mean a naive approach You know I dont pretend to be an astrophysicist or anything even though I do read about certain things like metaphysics and cosmology that Ive always just been really interested in I dont pretend to be able to sit down and pontificate on any of these subjects Its just from an esoteric stance Really I wanted to make a social consciousness album about love Whoa And without saying one way or the other that I do believe or dont believe in this or that or that Ive found answers here or there really the records just about love And even though there are some pretty blatant references to certain naturally occurring entheogenic compounds on the planet I wasnt really saying Hey everybody Go out and eat 10 grams of mushrooms and youll understand life So there are these kind of obscure references but you say its an album about love Point me to a track or a lyric that you think illustrates that Well in Turtles for instance theres a line Marijuana LSD psilocybin DMT they all changed the way I see  But loves the only thing that ever saved my life I think theres a lot of negativity in the world that stems directly from belief And I think the main purpose or at least from my observation and what Ive learned about myself  I used to be a pretty negative angry selfdestructive human being and once you get to the root of why those things are taking place it helps you to understand a little bit more about things you see on the news every night I guess all I was trying to say with the record is just we should just be nice to each other Without putting you on the couch and doing some psychoanalysis is that true about love though and where you were Oh yeah absolutely Anytime I ever have met someone that was very angry or full of negativity nine times out of ten if you really take a good look at that persons life theres probably not a whole lot of love going on there And for me meeting someone that was able to meet me at my absolute worst and rock bottom and look beyond all those things and still find someone worth believing in and investing their time in I would say absolutely theres something to be taken from that I read somewhere that your wife also played a big role in your career and kind of giving you a push when you needed one Is that true Yeah Ive never been a very ambitious person Really Ive always played music But you know in eastern Kentucky everybody plays music Its never something you ever think for a second growing up Oh I can do this for a living Its what you do after work I did make a stab I moved to Nashville the first time in 2005 for about nine months but I was still very much in a highly focused traditional mindset I really came more than anything to find the old timers that were still around that I could play bluegrass with and try to learn as properly how that should be done as I could I didnt find a lot of similarminded folks in town popcountry was really at saturation at that point and what is now described as the hip Nashville scene wasnt really there yet You know any of those bars in East Nashville that are hotspots that you can walk into on a Friday or Saturday night  back then thered be six people in there So you left Yeah I spent about nine months holed up in my apartment at the bottom of a bottle and hanging out at the Station Inn on Sunday nights and then I just kinda figured Yeah OK I probably do need to get a job So I headed out west for about three or four years working on the railroad Doing what on the railroad I started out in Salt Lake at this big giant intermodal train yard It was like a switching facility Its kinda like the main central artery for all the trains coming from the East and West Coasts So they would pull into this yard and I was what they would call a conductor We would switch the trains out and break em apart consolidate the freight that was headed to similar destinations and build other trains Wow And operating locomotives And it was a great job I really did enjoy it We were outside It sounds really physical and hard Well it was very physical and elementexposed But you know Salt Lake is probably one of the better kept secrets of the United States Its absolutely beautiful and the valley sits between two gorgeous mountain ranges And it really was a great thing for me because I kind of threw myself into the job and found a very clear state and sobriety for the first time And quiet How old were you at the time I moved out there at 28 So then what happened When did you meet your wife My grandfather got really ill and I had to take a leave of absence from my job I came home to Kentucky to help my family out and found myself once again stuck in Lexington Ky kind of going through the motions You were really close with your grandfather too Extremely close yes And theres not a lot of money and my mother was divorced and couldnt afford living hospice or anything like that So I came back and moved in with them down in eastern Kentucky for about a while And he recovered but I was gone long enough to kind of selfterminate my position at the railroad And so I found myself stuck back in this place that for whatever reason I could just never flower very well in But I did meet my wife and realized OK this is someone I care very much about and I want to make a living and take care of each other I ended up getting back on at the railroad through some strings pulled so she and I headed out to Utah And this is where things went really wrong I screwed up really good and proper and took a management position And I was no longer out on the yard Now Im in an office conference calls getting screamed at by people Ill never meet And after about a year and a half of that I was probably just at the most depressed state Ive ever been in in my life I think I put on like 35 pounds And as a result I started pulling the guitar out of the closet for the first time in about three years and really really writing a lot And thankfully she said You know you dont exactly suck at this and youre gonna wake up and be 40 and know that you never tried to do what you really love And it had a pretty resounding effect We sold just about everything we owned except for this old Ford Bronco and she and I and the dog drove to Nashville That was about four years ago She also had a big influence on this new record as well cause I dont leave the house a lot so I bounce a lot of my nervous energy off of her I had been reading a lot of pretty heady stuff and getting kind of obsessive about it When we found out we were having a baby I kind of went into what I will call my last great existentialist dilemma Which was focused around what Reading a lot of Emerson and a few books  most of the books that influenced the record I can name on one hand cause I kind of found them all at the same time Can you give me one or two The Phenomenon of Man by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and an essay that Emerson wrote called Nature which kind of breaks down the symbiotic relationship between science and religion and spirituality And then another book by Dr Rick Strassman called The Spirit Molecule which touches on a lot of these same subjects but through a fiveyear governmentfunded research study on dimethyltryptamine Reading the book he makes it very clear that he wasnt prepared for some of the things they dealt with and encountered Anyone interested in cosmology and physics especially certain breakthroughs in modern physics and the comparisons that some of these subjects were having  it just absolutely blew my mind And you thought Yeah thats the perfect stuff for a country song No actually I cant take credit My wife said Youre probably gonna drive yourself crazy but youre definitely driving me crazy so maybe you should get this out of your system and write some songs about it And I thought Thats a great idea Lets talk about another track off the album called It Aint All Flowers Thats a great song Thank you very much And then it gets happens at the end The whole song is played backwards kind of like something you might hear at the end of a Beatles record This is interesting for all kinds of reasons It kind of becomes a funk song Just by the nature of playing it back that way all of a sudden theres this different kind of rhythm that the song is infused with Right But whats that about What you made you think Yeah lets just play this backwards Well I get labeled a country artist Are you not I dont want to say its frustrating because  well just because of where Im from I was exposed to so much of that inflection as a young child that whenever I sit down to write or sing thats the only thing that comes out But it honestly when I sit down to listen to music countrys usually the last thing I go towards because Ive just absorbed so much of it So yeah theres a lot of soul and funk and blues and everything that Ive kind of obsessed about at certain stages of my life I think theres still so much room especially in country to kind of break down some sonic doors and incorporate a lot of those things The most important thing is for me is I dont ever want to get stuck in some selfimposed novelty box or just trying to make records like Conway and George did because well theyve already done it And Im pretty sure Ill never be able to do what they did as well as they did so Im just trying to be me You get a lot of Waylon Jennings too So much so that it makes me wonder if anybody actually listens  cause I dont hear it I really dont And I love Waylon And Ill Ill say this Shooter Jennings told me that I sound like his father so Ill take it from him But to me Ive listened to so many other people and Waylons one that discovered later and really probably listened to the least of any of the legendary singers His attitude maybe is what people are comparing Or maybe people really just want to hear somebody sound like Waylon Jennings so it could all just be psychosomatic I dont know Im not really big on process questions but I am interested in what made you think for song in particular that that device of playing it backwards worked Did you plan that from the beginning No these were all happy mistakes and fine examples of making positive out of negatives That song was the last one written and it really just kind of stands to represent my own introspective journey Ive taken over the last few years I think when youre dealing with any issues about trying to become a better human being you have to look at a lot of things about yourself that maybe you dont want to or arent able to And I thought we needed a figurative hellish trip there at the end Im also influenced by a lot of modern music  electronica which will turn off a lot of country fans Im sure But I wanted to incorporate some of those elements since it is 2014 and Dave Cobb producer and engineer had the idea Instead of bringing in synthesizers why dont we just attempt to try to recreate some of the sounds using analog equipment Which sounded amazingly fun and challenging so we were all for it And thats what you got It sounds like when you decided that you wanted to go for this music thing full bore you knew pretty clearly what you didnt want to be That more so than I know what I want to do I mean High Top Mountain was a very traditional hardcountry record so I definitely didnt want to follow it up with another one just like it But there are so many influences and Im trying to fit them all in concept albums  which is all I really have any interest in making If youre gonna make a record I wanna make records that people want to listen to all the way through Thats hard to do these days Yeah it is hard to do Im putting them out myself so I figure anybody thats gonna buy it from me hopefully will listen But yeah to be clich and incredibly trite about it I wanna make art something that I can wake up in 30 years and look back on and still feel proud of So talk about this as being a chapter in your life this kind of cosmic existentialism that was happening for you and your wife said Go write some music so you can get it out of your system Did that work Id say 80 percent of the influence came from earlier chapters in my life which Ive chosen to just completely leave behind now and certain experiences that maybe mirror or coincide with what Ive been reading While we were recording although Ive never felt happier about an album there was a big part of me that wondered maybe if this would be the end of my career But you cant worry about those things Clearly youre interested in finding your own path and doing things your own way but I also read that you performed at the Grand Ole Opry  which is old school Thats so old school Thats like real traditional country your roots I imagine Stuff you shared with your grandfather He was actually there the first time I performed on the Opry which probably meant more to me than the act of performing on the Opry He and my grandmother both were born in the most extreme conditions of poverty in a coal camp in eastern Kentucky back in the Depression eastern Kentucky For them the highlight of life was the entire coal camp gathering around one radio on Saturday nights and listening to the Opry Theres nothing else I could ever do or accomplish in their eyes that would be considered making it you know So the fact that not only were they alive to know about it but they were there in the audience was pretty surreal But to answer your question earlier a commercial path isnt something Im at all interested in pursuing Is your grandfather still around He is yeah Hes trucking along Ill be hes very proud of you Thanks so much for talking with us Sturgill Thank you very much My honor Copyright 2014 NPR,20140618,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/theprotojournalist/2014/05/06/309727058/the-lost-village-in-new-york-city?ft=3&f=,Smack in the center of New York City  in the confines of Central Park  there are ghostly vestiges of a 19th century neighborhood that once was vibrant and thriving but now is largely forgotten Seneca Village It is considered by historians to be one of Manhattans earliest communities of AfricanAmerican property owners This much is known Between 1825 and the mid1850s it was alive Seneca Village was home to a variety of Americans Most were of African descent but there were also Irish and German and maybe some Native Americans as well The 1855 state census noted that 264 people lived there The area had a school three churches and some cemeteries A couple of years later everyone in the village was told to leave and the neighborhood buildings were razed to clear the way for Central Park In recent times historians have begun exploring the villages past But for all the presentday recordsprobing and sitesexcavating there are still many unknowns surrounding Seneca Village One of the greatest mysteries Researchers have not been able to find a single living descendant of anyone who was a resident of Seneca Village The Village Today You can stroll around the area that was once Seneca Village by entering Central Park through Mariners Gate at 85th Street and Central Park West The grounds are flanked by playgrounds and at this time of year dotted with tulip beds The village lay between 82nd and 87th streets just east of Central Park West To trace a path that runs up to Central Parks expansive Great Lawn is to tread among the pines where the frame house and barn of village resident George G Root once stood  in his time a stones throw from two more houses known to belong to Epiphany Davis Andrew Williams a free black shoe shiner purchased three lots of land near there on Sept 27 1825 The area has been examined closely by researchers Anthropology professors Diana Wall of The City College of New York and Nan Rothschild of Columbia University and adjunct instructor Cynthia Copeland of New York University are founding members of the Seneca Village Project which spearheads the study of the village in an educational context and its commemoration The projects website offers an interactive map and photos from the site Cynthia explains how a number of events in the 1990s colluded to bring the history of Seneca Village to light In 1991 a 17th and 18th century site of thousands of African burials was uncovered in Lower Manhattan Now the African Burial Ground National Monument the discovery at the time spurred people to think about early African presence in New York Citys history She also credits Roy Rosenzweig and Elizabeth Blackmar authors of a 1992 publication The Park and the People A History of Central Park for including Seneca Village in their section on prepark history The authors used material they found in the New York Historical Society repository where Cynthia was a curator In 1997 the historical society mounted an exhibition Before Central Park The Life and Death of Seneca Village which was called a piercingly emotional show by The New York Times In 2004 the historians began digging to see what they could find They continued excavations when funding and time allowed One focal point was the home of William Godfrey Wilson  a church sexton in the village  complete with vestigial signs of domestic life pots and pans a tea kettle and particularly poignant in the imagining of the past a childs shoe Looking For Descendants Meanwhile as the historians were hunting for inanimate representations of the lost village the Seneca Village Project also began looking for living breathing people who might have genealogical ties to those longago villagers At the 1997 New York Historical Society exhibit the names of Seneca Village residents were listed and visitors were asked if they or anyone they knew were related to those original denizens The anthropologists made a similar query at a series of lectures about Seneca Village given around New York City in the early 2000s They continue to make appeals whenever possible So far not a single soul has come forward with true knowledge of any inhabitants Part of the problem says Nan Rothschild is not knowing where residents moved after the village was erased Diana Wall wonders if the contentious clearing of the area has shrouded its history in sadness and left a hole in family narratives Could it be she asks that because people were evicted from Seneca Village it was an unhappy part of their past that they chose to forget Both researchers express a wish to dedicate more time to locating the residents but with courses to teach and other projects thats difficult The excavation itself has served as a classroom for over 100 students Nan estimates and locating living descendants of the village would be meaningful to all of them It would be nice to package it all up and tie it in a bow But thats not history  history is messy says Cynthia She remains hopeful about finding descendants of the villagers I believe they are out there  PSA

says you paid for his swim lessons and kept him in the best private school in south Florida  at least for a little whileDokoupils father started selling marijuana during the Nixon era and expanded his operation until he became a partner in what his son describes as the biggest East Coast dope ring of the Reagan years smuggling marijuana into the USBut Dokoupil didnt know this until many years later because his parents didnt tell him His mother continued to keep the secret after his father disappeared from their lives when Dokoupil was 10 When he did find out he wanted to know the whole story He combed through court documents and newspaper files and interviewed Drug Enforcement Administration agents who investigated the case as well as more than a dozen smugglers and dealers including his own father He shares what he found in a new book called The Last Pirate A Father His Son and the Golden Age of MarijuanaDokoupil is a senior writer for NBC News He has reported on the recent changes in marijuana laws and the new entrepreneurs who are growing and selling marijuana He tells Fresh Airs Terry Gross about his fathers addiction to smuggling and how he ended up retiringInterview HighlightsOn how he learned about his fathers secret drug operation I was pushing 30 by the time I found out I had heard rumors that my family was involved in the business but I thought it was typical hippie stuff As far as I knew my father sold real estate in Vermont and had an antique business  My mother told me that That was the narrative Thats what I told other peoples parents thats what I told friends And then I decided to do a background check on my father I called the National Archives which is the keeper of 1 percent of all the paperwork that the federal government produces for all time  the most important things the things they think historians will care about in the future I said Do you happen to have a criminal record for this individual thinking Id get nothing Then I get an email with a faxed document inside it a couple weeks later I click it open and its my fathers indictment 1986 for a single job in that year He was busted for importing and distributing 35000 pounds of marijuana which is 17 tons  It was enough to roll a joint for every collegeage person in America at that time  That was a single operationOn the value of dealers during Richard Nixons war on drugsIt creates the opportunity to be a hero Use among his friends and among college kids is going through the roof The government is trying to take it away the kids want it he can provide itTimothy Leary in 1969 in an article that was reprinted over and over again called the drug dealer the marijuana dealer one of the three most significant figures of the era  as big as rock stars as big as underground artists And then ultimately he concluded bigger than bothOn his fathers addiction to the thrill of smuggling In the late 1970s 90 percent of the marijuana was coming into Florida It was primarily Colombian some of it was Jamaican My fathers weed would be delivered to an old fishing shack in the Florida Keys  Its only one road that connects that necklace of islands and everyone knew that that was the road on which marijuana was smuggled into the country So to smuggle on that road took an incredible amount of tolerance for riskSo my father despite being a partner in the operation volunteered for 25000 a shot to drive Winnebagos of weed out of the Keys and into America just for the sheer thrill of it He had no financial reason to do it He had no operational reason to do it  But by then he was addicted to the sensation of it to the riskOn how his father left his familyMy father retires He has at that point 500000 buried in a hillside in New Mexico hes got a couple of coolers of money on Long Island He has a safe deposit box with cash in it plus he has the proceeds from his final job Hes essentially set for life All he has to do is nothing and it proves to be the only thing he cant doHe goes to St Thomas in the US Virgin Islands where they rent a long sailboat built for 49 people and party with just 12 on it me and two other kids  smugglers kids  my mother one of his partners girlfriends an old partner They have catered meals and tour the island and its a retirement party Its a celebration My father felt uncomfortable in those situations He felt like he needed more He needed to be different So I have a memory of him leaving We docked the boat there are days still to come in the celebration and he walks away Memory is like surveillance footage Everything gets picked up but you dont really review it unless theres an incident So at the time it didnt occur to me that this was the last time I was going to see him in any kind of healthy condition But in retrospect thats the last time I saw him wholeOn how his fathers downfall influenced his own sense of identity Reporting this book and learning what I have about my father was confirming of my own sense of self So as someone raised primarily by my mother I never recognized myself in her Shes wonderful Shes natively wise and accepting in these interesting ways but she didnt have the same energy I had she didnt really look like me our interests didnt always align and I clearly came from some other stockMy father was not the stock that I wanted to accept for a long time because my only impressions of him were negative But once I saw what his career was like and how it aligned with the times and the excitement and how good he was at it I said Oh OK That is a nervous system I recognize in factI dont want to underplay the degree to which it was crushing to go through high school and college without clarity on where you came from and with a sense that your father was an empty vessel  The message that society pushes is like father like son  I felt that there was an inevitability that I would end up like him  I had to come to the realization that my fathers destiny was one that he selected  Therefore if he can make his life I can make mine Copyright 2014 NPR,20140331,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2014/03/31/297121539/its-mother-time-a-show-with-one-last-chance-to-get-it-right?ft=3&f=,Kids after nine long years How I Met Your Mother is finally coming to an end That the show has been on this long is still strange to me I remember when it was consistently almost cancelled in the first few years and I passed around the early seasons on DVD remember those trying to get my friends as hooked as I was But here we are nine years in and a whole mess of fans are eagerly awaiting the shows conclusion Theres a lot I could say about the series as it enters its hourlong finale tonight HIMYM has meant a lot to me over the years I literally no Ted I dont mean figuratively grew up with the show  its big moments mirrored my own its jokes eased into my everyday speech its characters became old friends The best episodes are always on Netflix waiting to cheer me up after a bad day But How I Met Your Mother hasnt always been good to me Its no secret that the show took a creative downturn after the fourth season and although there were moments in seasons six and seven that were promising it was never really able to capture the same spirit of the early years Certainly this final season has been a frustrating experience It might have been easier to jump ship and fondly remember the early successes but as Ive written before I just cant do that I need to see that moment promised in the shows title and by Future Teds first words nine years ago I need to see him meet the Mother Its arguable that the actual meeting of Ted and the future Mrs Mosby isnt really all that important in the grand scheme of the series A frequent theme of the show has been the idea that the ride can often be the best part of the journey and that the little moments in life are worth cherishing And to be honest the ride is what made HIMYM what it is Every slap and intervention and failed relationship is an integral piece of the greater story But an equally integral part of the show has always been the promised destination It has allowed a hint of optimism to permeate even the shows darkest moments Marshall and Lily break up but theyre going to get back together Robin is infertile but shes fine in the long run Marshalls father dies but life goes on Teds relationships fail one after the other but the One is waiting for him on a train platform in Farhampton So now that were here now that were going to see what happens on that train platform How I Met Your Mother has one last chance to be the show I fell in love with all those years ago but also one last chance to disappoint me And after spending a whole season with the Mother who is just as charming and lovely as we always hoped she would be the character herself has become more important than the circumstances on the train platform No matter how she and Ted go about saying hello to one another whats more pressing is that they get to have the happily ever after the show has been promising In other words How I Met Your Mother can either have a live and healthy Mother in 2030 or it can betray the very thing that made it great The theory that the Mother is dead in 2030 has been floating around the internet for a while but it got a whole lot more juice a few weeks ago In an episode ominously titled Vesuvius there was a strong hint that the future Mother is dying in a flashforward to 2024 and is perhaps dead by the time future Ted starts telling the story in 2030 Its not just a fan theory anymore its a dangling question that must be answered in the finale If the Mother is dead in the future  if thats the reason Ted has decided to spin this exceedingly long yarn for his kids  it would work within the context of the show You could argue that the series is about the fact that life goes on no matter what and that you make the best with what you have Ted must learn to live his life without the Mother That is what happens sometimes in life Our real lives will inevitably deal us heavy blows and there is no guarantee that anything will work out for the best But How I Met Your Mother has never been about real life Not even a little bit In real life you cant make it rain goats dont beat people up everybody doesnt have a perfect doppelganger and no one designs skyscrapers that look like dinosaurs In the midst of all the real life we all have to deal with everyday its nice for a show like HIMYM to create a world where everything works out in the end Thats the kind of show where one of the characters was once a Canadian teen pop star and where eating a sandwich is the accepted euphemism for smoking marijuana That is the show that has been airing for the past nine years Killing the Mother would change that in an instant So How I Met Your Mother I make this plea to you please dont do this Dont kill your title character after letting us fall in love with her Dont give us death and cold reality when all we want is slap bets and Sparkles Dont do this to me and the other fans that have been watching for nine years Give Ted his happily ever after Give us a happily ever after too Copyright 2014 NPR,20140331,marijuana

that for much of the road trip we were being watched Border Patrol agents customs officers cameras sensors radar and aircraft track movement in the Borderland None of that has stopped the struggle to control the border or the debate over how best to do it The Border Patrol  part of US Customs and Border Protection  allowed us a look inside the communications center at its headquarters in Laredo Texas The room had no windows just a giant wall of screens The Border Patrol has mounted cameras high on steel poles overlooking the Rio Grande which in this sector is the border Agents in cubicles watched the monitors A whiteboard on the wall was covered with emergency numbers to call the Drug Enforcement Administration air evacuation and also a phone number labeled Unmanned Drone No were not going to publish the number The man in charge of this South Texas sector tries to marry new technology with old technology Cmdr Robert Harris keeps a saddle in his office We still do have horses Harris told us and I would argue that we have some of the best trackers in the country The trackers are trained to follow footprints in the vast stretches of wilderness along the border Tracking is laborintensive of course but the Border Patrol nearly doubled its manpower in recent years to more than 21000 agents We dont have 100percent visibility on the border said Harris but I have a much higher degree of confidence that if somebody chooses to enter our area of responsibility we have a higherthanaverage chance of arresting that individual But the Border Patrol is under intense pressure Were Not In A Situation To Lose Fights In a series of incidents including one in Harris sector Border Patrol agents shot and killed unarmed Mexicans In some cases the Mexicans were said to be throwing rocks This month the Border Patrol reminded agents to avoid unnecessary risk to themselves or others but it resisted calls for bigger change saying agents have been pelted with rocks hundreds of times per year Asked about the rules under which the agents in his sector operate Harris answered frankly Were not in a situation to lose fights If our agents are assaulted I want them to prevail The Border Patrol is also criticized for not doing enough as we heard when we continued our road trip Outside Eagle Pass Texas we arrived at the home of a rancher whose properly lines the border Dob Cunningham took us for a Jeep ride on the property About a year ago Cunningham said they came over here to my shop and took all the tools and a welder just like that By they he meant thieves crossing the border Cunningham is 79 Decades ago he was a Border Patrol agent and later ran the US port of entry at Eagle Pass These days hes developed a lovehate relationship with the Border Patrol To show us why he drove us toward a bluff overlooking the Rio Grande Residents On Patrol If I holler Bail out  jump out he told us as we neared the edge of a bluff overlooking the river Sometimes these brakes dont work We stopped in time at the foot of a giant steel pole It held two of those Border Patrol cameras aimed up and down the river Cunningham said the wire to one camera was cut He says his property is periodically flooded with thieves marijuana smugglers or migrants When he can Cunningham rounds them up and turns them in Its not in us to steal a penny or turn a blind eye he said Cunninghams friend Larry Johnson recalled a day they found three people on the road they suspected of crossing illegally and picked them up Cunninghams wife Kay remembers another incident right here on the ranch which she calls the night of the big shootout Dob Cunningham spotted something just at dusk and took his gun to have a look Moments later Kay Cunningham heard several gunshots It turned out to be a confused incident involving hunters and suspected border crossers Nobody was hurt Uncertain Allegiances  Cunningham said he cooperates with the Border Patrol and even admires many agents but he has come to doubt the agency as it has grown in size They just hired too many riffraff crooks thugs he said His opinion of the Border Patrol reflects a larger doubt An American flag flies outside his home and hes not sure it will fly here in the future He said the American Southwest could end up being a place of divided loyalties He mentioned the way that Russia was able to seize Crimea from Ukraine on the pretext that the Crimea was populated with ethnic Russians who spoke the Russian language In the same way Cunningham suggested The culture and patriotism will be stronger being Mexican than being American You have border patrolmen right now that dont know their allegiance to the United States The Border Patrol has said its agents are in fact highly trained as well as reliable trustworthy and loyal to the United States For all Cunninghams provocative claims its hard to form a simple view of the Texas rancher Cunningham concedes 98 percent of the border crossers who come through his property are just poor people who want a job He and his wife have sometimes fed them in their home Not only that he can point across the Rio Grande to the homes of Mexican friends Very close friends he said Ive waded the river right up from that house He had dinner with a man on the far side Is that strictly legal I asked if you just wade across the river Oh no he said If the Mexican army caught me Id still be over there It would be an unauthorized border crossing Cunningham a selfdescribed border rat has absorbed the complexity of the Borderland Copyright 2014 NPR,20140322,marijuana

is constantly exploring new ways to launder its gargantuan profits The State Department reports that Mexican trafficking organizations earn between 19 and 29 billion every year from selling marijuana cocaine heroin and methamphetamines on the streets of American cities And Sinaloa is reportedly the richest most powerful of them all according to the Drug Enforcement Administration The capture last month of the Mexican druglord Joaquin Chapo Guzman has cast a spotlight on the smuggling empire he builtOne key to the Sinaloa Cartels success has been to use the global banking system to launder all this cashIts very important for them to get that money into the banking system and do so with as little scrutiny as possible says Jim Hayes special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations for the New York office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE He was lead agent in the 2012 case that revealed how Sinaloa money men used HSBC one of the worlds largest banks as their private vaultICE says in 2007 and 2008 the Sinaloa Cartel and a Colombian cartel wiretransferred 881 million in illegal drug proceeds into US accountsHuge Daily DepositsAccording to a subsequent investigation by the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations cartel operatives would sometimes deposit hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash in a single day using boxes designed to fit the exact dimensions of the tellers window at HSBC branches in MexicoThe bank ignored basic antimoney laundering controls as the investigation found In 2007 and 2008 the banks personnel in Mexico wired 7 billion dollars to corresponding US dollar accounts in New York These were more dollars than even larger Mexican banks wired to US accounts ICE says some of it was drug proceedsYet no red flags were raised because of what a bank official later described as a lack of a compliance culture in the Mexico affiliate according to the Senate reportMoreover the dollar transfers earned HSBC hefty fees The Senate investigation quoted an HSBC email lamenting how the bank would lose 26 billion in revenue from US dollar accounts that it was forced to close because of the Mexico fiascoWhen I was told that there could be in the billions of dollars being moved through these accounts it was very difficult to believe says senior ICE agent Jim Hayes A lot of people have asked Was this complicit We dont believe that they HSBC personnel knew for certain that the money being moved was drug money but they should have knownA Simple PlanIn Culiacn the prosperous capital of Sinaloa where people live cheek by jowl with the cartel even they were shocked that narcodollars could be laundered so brazenlyYou see the building the office the cars the papers the men in suits Everything looks legal Thats what frightens us says Javier Valdez an author and journalist in Culiacan who writes about narcotraffickingThe DEA loves to sell the idea that these guys are super sophisticated criminal masterminds says Alejandro Hope a security analyst in Mexico City and a former federal intelligence agent Its so simple Its so unsophisticated That is what to me is the most disturbing part of this These guys are not even trying that hardThe consequences for ignoring the torrent of dirty money flowing into its Mexico bank vaults were severe for HSBCThe Department of Justice levied penalties and forfeitures of 19 billion on the bank Of course with 26 trillion in assets for HSBC this represented a man with a hundred dollars in his pocket paying a fine of seven cents HSBC was also faulted for hiding prohibited transactions with nations like Iran and CubaThe bank emailed a statement to NPRHSBC has made progress in remediating antimoney laundering sanctions compliance deficiencies But we recognize that protecting against financial crime is an ongoing journey and we have much more to do Since 2011 we have implemented reforms and new controls enhanced our monitoring systems and strengthened and expanded our global financial crime and compliance organization For example the number of fulltime employees in financial crime and regulatory compliance is up 54 percent between 2012 and 2013ICE agent Jim Hayes says fallout from the HSBC case continuesWe think this forfeiture is significant enough to make other banks to look and make sure theyre in compliance he saysBanks Still VulnerableIn the wake of HSBC other banks boosted their antimoney laundering budgets increased knowyourcustomer rules and in some cases dumped highrisk clientsWhich might make you think well now theyve got money laundering under controlDespite all of the efforts banks are still vulnerable to money laundering and its kind of an ageold thing says Kieran Beer editor of the news website of the Association of Certified AntiMoney Laundering SpecialistsThe drug trade is overwhelming in terms of how that money finds pathslike water  to come into the global financial system Beer continuesHSBC wasnt the first or last bank moneylaundering scandalIn 2010 prosecutors detailed how Wachovia Bank had been used by Mexican currency exchange houses to launder at least 110 million in drug profitsIn 2012 The Wall Street Journal reported on an FBI affidavit that laid out how the Zetas Cartel used Bank of America to launder cash through a racehorse operation in TexasAnd last month Western Union agreed to do more

money goes south All the drug profits made on the streets of US cities like Chicago and Atlanta and Dallas are funneled down to ports of entry on the USMexico border where theyre smuggled back into Mexico In 2012 one federal agency alone Immigration and Customs Enforcement seized 411 million in cash hidden in vehicles mostly heading south Once the bundles of US banknotes are delivered to the cartel the money flows in many directions Growers warehousers smugglers assassins and corrupt police and politicians must be paid Mostly the dollars have to be laundered Dirty money has to somehow be injected into the legal economy The prosperous city of Culiacn on Mexicos northern Pacific coast is a good place to see how US drug dollars are spent in Mexico This is home to the Sinaloa Cartel the most powerful and richest drug cartel in the world Its leader Joaquin El Chapo Guzman was arrested last month after 13 years on the run but few analysts in Mexico believe his capture will cripple the mafia he created Dollars Into Pesos The US State Department reported in 2013 that Mexican drug mafias send to Mexico between 19 billion and 29 billion a year from proceeds of marijuana cocaine heroin and methamphetamines sold in the United States Traditionally one of the easiest ways to convert drug dollars to pesos has been casas de cambio or currency exchange houses As part of a crackdown on money laundering federal agents shut down 21 casas de cambio in Culiacn in 2008 but on a visit last month they were all back in business Young women in tight dresses stand in the street hustling driveby customers Were only permitted to change up to 5000 now one money changer who didnt give her name says through an open car window Miguel Angel Vega a journalist for the local newspaper Riodoce is skeptical of her claim If you know them they can go to your house he says driving away and you tell them I have like 50000 Lets do the exchange here in my house And theyll do it because the more they change the more they make Money laundering is a study in trickledown economics in a city like Culiacn Traffickers put a lot of cash into circulation They build palatial homes they buy dresses and jewelry for their wives and girlfriends and they really like flashy vehicles One avenue in Culiacn is lined with luxury car dealerships The new Jaguar agency sells a red convertible XKRS for 213000 and the receptionist says theyll take cash Business Connections Narcos also invest in legitimate businesses as another way to convert dollars to pesos They become partners in shopping centers residential developments hotels restaurants farms and almost any other type of moneymaking enterprise Former Sinaloa Gov Juan Millan once stated that 62 percent of the Sinaloan economy is permeated with drug money In Culiacn the underground economy and the normal economy are the same thing Its everywhere says a 19yearold university student who gives her name as Marisa On the positive side she says You can see a lot of nightclubs and the nightclubs are excellent really On the dark side she continues Myself two times I was in a shooting Once I was with my mom in a car Its normal  Oh another shooting Its bad to say but its true The Office of Foreign Assets Control or OFAC part of the US Treasury Department has identified 35 businesses in Culiacn as being part of financial networks connected to Sinaloa kingpins There are certainly many more than this but Mexico maintains no public database of suspected cartel companies The OFAC charts indicate that moneylaundering networks are usually familybased A trafficker uses his wealth to set up his wife or kids or inlaws in business For instance OFAC states that one of two wives of kingpin Juan Jose Esparragoza who goes by El Azul or Blue is in a group that owns seven gas stations in Culiacn In a visit to the station owned by Buenos Aires Servicios on Guillermo Batiz Paredes Boulevard a heavyset man in a Pemex uniform walked up and identified himself as Fabian Guzman the manager The owner is not here and Ive only been here a few months he said nervously I saw this drugmoney allegation in the newspaper but I dont know anything about it I dont know who the owner is Managers at a shopping center and a childrens daycare facility  also on OFAC charts  expressed similar bewilderment when approached by a reporter Government Response Public officials in Sinaloa have an entirely different explanation of their economic mainstay The thing about laundering money I cant deny that it doesnt exist says state legislator Gmer Monrrez but I can tell you that in el Valle de Culiacn we have four out of the 10 biggest companies that produce and export vegetables to the United States Its true Sinaloa is known as the granary of Mexico and the state symbol is the tomato But then you have to wonder How many tomato farmers drive 200000 Jag convertibles Agriculture is very important but its not as big as they say says local author and journalist Javier Valdez who has written five books about narcotrafficking What drives the economy is organized crime Without the narcos there would be more unemployment fewer companies less income and not as much money in circulation Last summer the Mexican Finance Ministry began enforcing stringent new antimoneylaundering rules Theyre supposed to limit such things as bulk cash purchases and currency exchanges at casas de cambio A ministry lawyer in Mexico City said in an interview that moneylaundering complaints have jumped 140 percent since the new law went into effect The Mexican federal attorney generals office did not respond to an email asking how many of those complaints resulted in criminal cases Does the Mexican government have any interest in disrupting the narcotized economy in Culiacn or anywhere else Its very difficult to close down these financial networks because of insufficient evidence that will stand in a court of law and probably because there is some officials at many levels who might be complicit with those networks said Alejandro Hope a security analyst and former federal intelligence agent in Mexico City Cause Of Death The trail of US drug dollars at work in Mexico ends appropriately at the graveyard Cartel lieutenants tend to die young in this business When they do their families spend lavishly to construct mausoleums that look like small condos In the Jardines del Humayo cemetery you find row upon row of fabulous funerary temples with marble steps glass walls air conditioning and even bathrooms for the family members who come to mop polish and remember their lost loved ones A mason who gives his name as Carlos is overseeing a crew building a new tomb He is asked about the young men who are memorialized in this city of the dead They died of natural causes he says with a chuckle In Culiacn that means by bullets Copyright 2014 NPR,20140320,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/03/13/289000532/why-for-profit-prisons-house-more-inmates-of-color?ft=3&f=,A new study by a UCBerkeley graduate student has surprised a number of experts in the criminology field Its main finding Private prisons are packed with young people of color The concept of racial disparities behind bars is not exactly a new one Study after report after working group has found a version of the same conclusion The Sentencing Project estimates 1 in 3 black men will spend time behind bars during their lifetime compared with 1 in 6 Latino men and 1 in 17 white men Arrest rates for marijuana possession are four times as high for black Americans as for white Black men spend an average of 20 percent longer behind bars in federal prisons than their white peers for the same crimes These reports and thousands of others have the cumulative effect of portraying a criminal justice system that disproportionately incarcerates black Americans and people of color in general AfricanAmerican studies PhD student Christopher Petrellas finding in The Color of Corporate Corrections however tackles a different beast Beyond the historical overrepresentation of people of color in county jails and federal and state prisons Petrella found people of color are further overrepresented in private prisons contracted by departments of correction in Arizona California and Texas This would mean that the racial disparities in private prisons housing state inmates are even greater than in publicly run prisons His paper sets out to explain why  a question that starts with race but that takes him down a surprising path Age Race And Money First a bit of background Private prisons house 128195 inmates on behalf of the federal government and state governments or at least they did as of 2010 Theres a continual debate among legislators and administrators as to which is more costeffective running a governmentoperated prison with its government workers and unions or hiring a private company like GEO or Corrections Corp of America to house your prisoners for you States like California Arizona and Texas use a combination of both In the nine states Petrella examined private facilities housed higher percentages of people of color than public facilities did Looking back at the contracts the private companies signed with the states Petrella figured out the reason behind the racial disparity private prisons deliberately exclude people with high medical care costs from their contracts Younger healthier inmates he found  whove come into the system since the war on drugs went into effect  are disproportionately people of color Older inmates who generally come with a slew of health problems skew more white Steve Owens senior director of public affairs for Corrections Corp of America one of the largest private prison companies in the nation calls the study deeply flawed In an email Owens says CCAs government partners determine which inmates are sent to our facilities our company has no role in their selection Furthermore he says the contracts we have with our government partners are mutually agreed upon and as the customer our government partners have significant leverage regarding provisions Its up to the contracting agency he says to decide how it wants to distribute inmates and manage health care costs Owens does not however dispute Petrellas numbers Gloria BrowneMarshall an associate professor of constitutional law at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former civil rights attorney says its a very interesting study What I take away from it is how prisoners are looked at as commodities she says Its all about how the private prisons can make the most money Petrella says he used data compiled by state correctional departments which are divided by censusdesignated categories and included AfricanAmericans AsianAmericans and Pacific Islanders nonwhite Hispanics and Latinos and essentially anyone except those defined by the census as white I know these categories are fungible but this is the data we have to work with Petrella says BrowneMarshall points out that Petrellas findings dont necessarily point to a racial motivation on behalf of private prison companies and Petrella agrees Profit is the clear motivation he says The racial component is more incidental However he says the study shows that policies that omit race continue to have negative impacts He says theres a larger dialogue to be had about what contemporary racial discrimination actually looks like Barry Krisberg senior fellow at the Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute at the University of California Berkeley says the findings surprised him I had assumed private prisons were taking a lot of lowrisk inmates he says that if you went to a private prison youd find a lot of old Anglo prisoners Thats not the case Prison Conditions This raises questions about prison conditions for different kinds of prisoners The rate of violence is higher at private prisons and recidivism is either worse or the same than in public prisons says Alex Friedmann the managing editor of Prison Legal News and the associate director of the Human Rights Defense Center a group that opposes private prisons Friedmann says part of the trouble is attributable to lowerpaid lessertrained staff used in private prisons But some of it he adds may be due to this higherrisk younger population in private prisons So BrowneMarshall asks what are private prisons doing for their agespecific populations Public prisons are devoting a lot of resources to the agespecific needs of their prisoners she says such as building medical facilities bringing in highly paid medical staff and providing expensive mental health care services What about the specific needs of the private prison population Younger higherrisk private prisoners need different kinds of services  especially since theyre likely to get out of prison back into society And historically younger prisoners are more likely to reoffend which BrowneMarshall suggests addressing with education drug counseling anger management and other social services The trouble While courts have intervened to require prisons to have good medical and mental health care as constitutional necessities  things that benefit older and sicker prisoners  programs that mainly benefit younger prisoners arent usually required Another reason why theyre cheaper to house How do we get corporations to do what the incarcerated person needs when the governments not dictating it BrowneMarshall asks That she says is the next question for study Owens says CCA offers safe secure housing and quality rehabilitation and reentry programming at a cost savings to taxpayers Our programming includes education vocational faithbased and substance abuse treatment opportunities Each year he says CCA inmates acquire more than 3000 GEDs A Footnote In compiling his data Petrelle deliberately excludes private prisons with federal contracts from the study He does so because a large portion of federal prisoners in private facilities are there as immigration detainees not sentenced criminals Were he to include federally contracted prisons the disparities would surely be greater Federally contracted facilities also come with their own baggage and civil rights questions Federal prisoners in public facilities as well as state prisoners in private and public facilities have the right to bring lawsuits based on alleged civil rights violations This means state inmates in California could sue the state prison system for providing inadequate health care Arizona inmates in a private facility could do the same against the private corporation that owns their prison and against the state of Arizona However federal prisoners in private prisons cannot bring such lawsuits according to a recent US Supreme Court ruling A prisoner of this status could sue for actual damages but could not bring a civil rights suit against a private prison  the kind of suit that usually forces major changes in how prisons operate in the public sphere Weve gotten to the point where courts intervene in public prisons but only under extraordinary circumstances Krisberg says For federal prisoners in private facilities theres even less legal recourse he says Copyright 2014 NPR,20140318,marijuana

will be able to walk into a store and buy marijuana this summer But this legalization of recreational marijuana is taking place without much information on the possible health effects We should have been doing a lot more research to find out just how useful it is how it affects the brain et cetera et cetera according to Dr Herbert Kleber a Columbia University psychiatrist and drug abuse researcher But he says its been hard to study the effects of Cannabis sativa the plant that produces marijuana A large part of the reason marijuana research has lagged is that its been very hard to get federal approval for such projects as well as access to federally sanctioned supplies of the drug Kleber hopes that the push to legalize the drug will stimulate longdelayed research Meanwhile he thinks its a bad idea I dont think we know what were getting into Hes not the only person who would like to see more science on marijuana and health But not all think the drug poses big health risks or at least not big enough risks to keep it illegal Most cannabis users are moderate users says Mark Kleiman a professor of public policy at the University of California Los Angeles who studies drug policy They use a joint a week or less Jacquelene Cohen the 29yearold director of publicity for a Seattle publisher is a typical user  indulging once or twice a month she says Its just like a small pleasure she says like pouring a nice bourbon for a friend or passing a pipe with marijuana in it Its just something nice to do when youre sitting around conversationally While Kleiman doesnt see enough health risks from marijuana to override the push toward legalization he does worry about users who get hooked on the stuff He says if the price of marijuana falls too much it could result in more dependence especially among adolescents and lowincome users The main risk of cannabis he says is becoming habituated to cannabis and spending your whole life stoned About 11 percent of marijuana users fit the definition of dependence  that is their habit interferes with their life and theyve been unable to cut back Thats lower than the dependence number for heroin and other opioids 23 percent cocaine 17 percent cigarettes or alcohol 15 percent or nicotine 32 percent Heavy users arent hard to find I have friends that Ive never seen not stoned Cohen says It doesnt seem that its that harmful My friends that smoke a lot of marijuana are productive and creative and sociable and they form strong relationships and they make good life choices The National Institute on Drug Abuse says that while marijuana dependence is similar to that for other drugs the longterm clinical outcomes may be less severe Surveys show that 16 million Americans use marijuana at least once a month and 2 million of those meet the criteria for dependence Kleiman says thats not alarmingly high Its not a very high risk he says but its a high risk if its you or your child or your parent or your sibling So people who say Oh cannabis isnt abusable cannabis isnt addictive it seems to me just arent looking at the data The addiction potential is higher among those who start using marijuana at younger ages And the higher potency of marijuana these days may increase the risk of dependency although data are lacking on that point Psychological treatment to wean marijuana users from dependency works about 70 percent of the time according to Kleber the Columbia University researcher Theres promising research indicating treatment can be improved with medication  in particular a combination of synthetic THC the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana plus a longacting drug for high blood pressure only available in Europe When it comes to other adverse health effects the evidence is unclear Marijuana smoke contains many of the same toxic chemicals as cigarette smoke But even heavy marijuana smokers dont seem to have more lung cancer or emphysema Oddly enough Kleiman says the epidemiology has not come in to support the microbiology The obvious speculation is that theres something else in cannabis thats actually a tumorsuppressing agent and people are looking hard at that now Many worry that marijuana might increase the risk of schizophrenia Authorities say theres enough evidence to warn against marijuana use for anybody whos had a psychotic episode or a family history of schizophrenia Still as millions of people have used marijuana in recent years the incidence of schizophrenia has remained static at around 1 percent of the population And then theres driving under the influence Kleiman says one study allowed heavy marijuana users to smoke as much as they wanted before testing them on a driving simulator Even when the subjects were as stoned as they want to be he says they were about as impaired as people who just meet the drunkendriving threshold Thats not entirely reassuring But it suggests that marijuana might not be as dangerous as alcohol when it comes to driving But heres an important point Kleiman says theres some evidence that marijuana users may be drivingimpaired for hours after they think their high has worn off Thats where a real public health campaign could make a difference Kleiman says saying if you smoke cannabis do not drive for something like six hours after  wed have to do the research Thats a lot longer than the subjective high lasts But its probably what you need to get people actually safe Kleiman adds one more key point Cannabis is much more dangerous when it accompanies even a little bit of alcohol So he thinks the bloodalcohol limit for drivers with any level of cannabis in their blood should be zero Of the states considering legalization most are considering legalizing recreational marijuana 17 states or decriminalizing possession of small amounts 12 states and the District of Columbia Twenty states plus Washington DC allow marijuana sale for medical use although in some places the medical pretext is slim Copyright

But since Jan 1 when marijuana in Colorado officially moved from underground to behind the counter the center has also been selling legal recreational pot A majority of Americans now say they support full legalization and the trend is spreading to other states Meanwhile the public health community is warning of a potential safety problem more people driving while stoned But health officials and law enforcement dont yet have the data or the tools to address the concern Public Perception Inside Lodo Wellness Center shoppers dont seem particularly worried about getting behind the wheel with pot in their systems You could smoke about an ounce and still have your motor skills says 39yearold Dante Cox When it comes to one shot of alcohol all that goes out of the window Like Cox several others say its OK to smoke before driving and definitely safer than drinking and driving For advocates of traffic safety their words are concerning I think this is the next big issue in highway safety says Jonathan Adkins executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association He tells NPRs Arun Rath that theres a prevalent feeling in American culture that marijuana is no big deal Well it is a big deal if you use it and then get behind the wheel he says We need to have the same cultural intolerance for marijuana use behind the wheel as we do with alcohol Alcoholrelated crashes still kill around 10000 people a year and research clearly shows how drinking alcohol affects driving The impact of marijuana is much less clear The National Institute on Drug Abuse has done extensive research on marijuanas effect on driving ability The results senior investigator Marilyn Huestis says should give smokers pause We have so many processes in our brain that help us to do a complex behavior of driving and under the effects of marijuana we just dont perform as well she says Assessing Crash Risk After using marijuana Huestis says people generally have more trouble staying in lanes they struggle to do multiple tasks at once and theres a real problem maintaining concentration on long monotonous drives But does that translate into more accidents Studies of the crash risk associated with marijuana have produced mixed results says Anne McCartt senior vice president for research at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Not only do we not have consensus on the risk associated with the presence of marijuana  we dont have information on the crash risk for different amounts of marijuana McCartt says We dont even have good information on how many drivers involved in fatal crashes test positive for marijuana So theres a lot we dont know McCartt says the evidence so far suggests that alcohol has a stronger effect than marijuana on crash risk and that there is simply a larger body of research on the strong association between bloodalcohol concentrations and crash risk Weve used that science for example to enact in all 50 states laws that make it illegal to drive with blood alcohol contents of 008 percent or higher she says We dont have comparable information on marijuana As marijuana use becomes more accepted in the US McCartt says the public safety issue is concerning As a researcher she says its frustrating not to have the science needed to craft effective enforceable laws for drugs including marijuana Testing For Marijuana Even with laws establishing a specific limit police might not have a way to enforce them For alcohol police around the country carry handheld breathalyzers But coming up with a similar test for marijuana is not quite as easy For one the alcohol content of say a Budweiser is on the label But its much more difficult to know the potency of a wide variety of marijuana products Another complication is marijuanas main psychoactive ingredient THC It can linger in the body long after the initial high THC is a molecule that really loves human fat and when you ingest it it sticks in the fat and then it slowly seeps out over the course of a week or a month if you are a heavy user says Timothy Fong an addiction psychiatrist at the University of California Los Angeles The most reliable test for THC is the blood test A few states like Washington and Colorado have even established a kind of legal limit of marijuana in the blood 5 nanograms of THC per milliliter But performing that test often requires that police drive a suspect to a hospital And Fong says its tough to interpret exactly what those tests mean for driving ability Most of the marijuana testing has been done in human laboratories and there you get a wide variety of reactions he says So if you take 100 people and have the same blood level of marijuana youll have 100 different reactions California the first state to legalize medical marijuana recently conducted a roadside study at night finding around 7 percent of drivers had marijuana in their systems Los Angeles is now at the forefront of law enforcements response The city has a federal grant to try out a new roadside drug test oral swabs City Attorney Mike Feuer calls the technology the wave of the future This is a technique under which in the field at the time of the traffic stop an officer can test the saliva of the driver and get an immediate result as to whether there are drugs present in his or her system Feuer says Feuer says the admissibility in court of the swabbing hasnt been tested in California but is likely to be tested in the coming months or next year Legislation regarding the swabs could be down the road as well he says The goal of all of this Feuer says is to assure that there is an effective means of determining whether a driver is impaired not just for prosecution but also to prevent people from driving under the influence in the first place The more commonly known it is that we have a quick and effective technique for determining that the more I hope people are deterred from getting behind the wheel with drugs or alcohol in their system he says Judgment Vs Numbers Advocates in favor of marijuana legalization say they agree that people should know their limits and should not drive while impaired But theyre concerned that police officers will substitute this new technology  and an arbitrary legal limit  for their own judgment I think that people want to have a clearcut blackandwhite solution says Mason Tvert the communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project a prolegalization group They want a specific number that we can use to just say that this person is impaired or not Unfortunately its a little more of a gray area than that Tvert says simply having a number attached to impairment could result in people who are perfectly sober being arrested and charged He suggests that the law enforcement officials judgment should also come into play A bigger concern for Tvert is not the number of pot smokers getting behind the wheel but excessive and overzealous reporting on the subject He does agree however that driving under the influence of marijuana is something that needs to be addressed and discouraged We allow adults to use alcohol responsibly and we punish adults if they use it irresponsibly and that includes driving while drunk he says We should be doing the same thing with marijuana Its in that area that Tvert and Feuer share some common ground Im optimistic that as the debate around legalization of marijuana continues in this country there will be no debate  around the notion that we should be educating the public about the fact that driving while impaired could lead another family to suffer a loss from which they can never recover Feuer says That legalization debate is continuing this year Its likely that marijuana initiatives will be on the ballot in Alaska and Oregon As the momentum increases for marijuana legalization police and lawmakers say they have to respond even with so much still unknown Copyright 2014 NPR,20140224,marijuana

amounts of rat bait to protect their plants  and these chemicals are killing several species of wild animals including rare ones biologists say Heres what happens The growers plant their marijuana in remote locations hoping to elude detection They irrigate their plants  with water from streams  which lures animals looking for water Rodents chew the flourishing plants to get moisture which kills the plants Researchers believe thats the prime reason growers use the poisons The problem is we have wild rodents out here that are going to eat the rat poisons and then they become little time bombs says Mark Higley wildlife biologist in the area for the Hoopa Valley Tribe They dont die for seven to 10 days maybe two weeks And they stagger around and then become easy prey for Northern spotted owls fishers foxes bobcats Predators that eat the poisoned rodents often become weakened or die In studies of fishers a rare relative of the weasel nearly all the tracked animals that died in recent years  from the southern Sierra to the northern tip of the state  had rat poison in samples of their tissue And on the Hoopa reservation alone postmortem exams have shown that rat bait caused nearly a third of the deaths of male fishers in recent years To know that such a high percentage of the fisher population across the entire range in California was exposed to these rat poisons  and knowing that its not just fishers but all the other carnivores that have got to be exposed  it just seems absolutely criminal says Higley One winter day Higley some of his fellow researchers and I scramble

law enforcement team swooped in by helicopter and found 8000 marijuana plants here all between 3 feet and 6 feet tall as well as lots of leftover rat poison and empty poison containers  trash left by the growers Most of the plants were hauled away but some of the poison got left behind Higley says this has become a common scene in the tribes forests and throughout Northern California Sometimes the growers poisons seem intended not for rodents but for bigger animals In another bust last summer for example in a national forest near the reservation sheriffs deputies found a dead fisher Above it hot dogs laced with a toxic insecticide hung on large fish hooks The fisher had chunks of hot dog in its esophagus and stomach it died of acute poisoning says Higley who accompanied law enforcement on that bust He and other biologists have a good sense of how these poisons are affecting fishers because theyve been studying the catsize animals closely  the federal government has been considering putting fishers on the endangered species list So biologists have been documenting their numbers and keeping track of how each animal dies Researchers track each fisher with a radio collar when an animal stops moving they race into the forest to find its body before a predator does In fact it was a dead fisher that first clued scientists into the widespread use of poisons by illegal pot growers Blood had pooled in the animals abdomen a telltale sign of poisoning with anticoagulant rat bait At first the researchers were puzzled fishers tend to live in remote areas far from human homes But once they learned of the poison used by illegal pot farmers the scientists looked back through their collection of tissue samples from fishers that had died in previous years Nearly all those samples they discovered contained traces of various rat poisons It was just devastating Higley recalls Since then Higley has documented 19 illegal pot farms in the forests on the Hoopa reservation He says the use of these dangerous chemicals on the reservation is particularly galling because the Hoopa Valley tribe banned all toxic chemicals decades ago to protect natural resources Aaron Pole a wildlife technician and a tribal member says hes come across illegal marijuana farms when tracking fishers and Northern spotted owls in the backwoods of the reservation Im enraged Pole says Why dont these people go somewhere else and grow Pole has also helped clean sites after busts Hes seen how growers encircle their marijuana plants with rat poison and use large amounts of insecticide and fertilizer On the day of our visit a big pile of trash remains from a cleanup a couple months earlier It includes empty fertilizer bags and lots of irrigation hose the growers used to bring water from a stream The area is so remote that a helicopter will be needed to come pick up the remaining mess  but funds for cleanups are hard to come by Only seven of the 19 known marijuana farms on the reservation have been cleaned up so far according to Higley Its pretty selfish says Pole They come in They reap the benefit of you know some quick cash And all the environmental damage is happening here and we have to deal with it The fishers are a special concern to the tribe whose members use fisher skins as arrow quivers in a traditional healing dance But the tribe also worries about poisons getting into fish and game  and into the rivers where children play Wildlife ecologist Mourad Gabriel of the nonprofit Integral Ecology Research Center has been tracking the problem all over the northern half of California In his lab in a logging town near the coast he opens a locked freezer and pulls out the corpse of a furry animal So you can see here its still a little frosty he says but this is a beautiful beautiful male fisher The animal was found dead near Yosemite National Park several hundred miles from the Hoopa reservation Gabriel tells me hell take it to the University of California Davis for an examination to determine the cause of death But these days whenever a dead fisher turns up Gabriel suspects rat poison Like Higley Gabriel accompanies law enforcement officers during busts of illegal pot farms  sometimes hes lowered from a helicopter to the remote setting Afterward the scientists hike back into these spots and haul out whatever rat poisons they can find Gabriel sets up motionsensing cameras to see which animals visit these sites and are potentially exposed to the poisons The wildlife his photos have caught includes fishers mountain lions gray fox deer and bears rummaging through trash piles  bottles of insecticide fertilizer and other dangers Soon after my visit Gabriel got back results from the autopsy of that frozen fisher It did die from consuming rat poison or a poisoned rat or other small animal And earlier this month Gabriel suffered a very personal blow  his pet dog was poisoned with the same kind of rat bait and died Gabriel thinks the poisoning was malicious The local sheriff is investigating Copyright 2014 NPR,20140214,marijuana

USMexico border in just the past six years and one of the more intriguing cases involves 17 Mexican men who claim they were kidnapped and forced to carry out the work for months before Mexican authorities found them Theres always been some mystery surrounding tunnels Diggers were thought to be wellpaid cartel loyalists or as urban legend goes laborers killed soon after the tunnels completion to ensure its secrecy I met one of those 17 men who say they were kidnapped and forced to dig a tunnel last year He says he was enslaved 35 feet below the border for months and lived to tell his side of the story  from a Tijuana prison Inside Prison  He was at Tijuanas infamous La Mesa one of the most overcrowded prisons in Mexico Built for 2600 prisoners it now houses more than 7000 He and 16 other men have been there for a year after being caught digging the underground tunnel I waited for him in a small room next to the wardens office Earlier the warden warned me not to ask too many probing questions This is a delicate case he said It touches a lot of powerful people in the city The tunnels burrowing under Tijuana are thought to be built by Mexicos most powerful drug organization the Sinaloa cartel The group led by Joaquin El Chapo Guzman is one of the few with the expertise and money  on average about 2 million  needed to build one of the underground wonders After about 10 minutes the guards escorted in a short man dressed in the prisons standard gray sweatpants and Tshirt His hair was closely cropped His accent was thick like most rural farmers from Mexicos northern states He asked me if hes in any danger if he tells me his story I told him I really didnt know only he could weigh that risk But I promised not to use his name He started telling me his story It began back in the winter of 2012 just four miles from this prison in Tijuanas Mesa de Otay neighborhood High on a bluff hugging the international border and the huge commercial crossing into San Diego Mesa de Otay bustles with activity Eighteenwheelers barrel down the wide streets packed with everything from TVs to small medical devices assembled in Tijuanas foreignowned factories Warehouses line the dusty boulevards  some have signs others dont even have a street number on their door fronts The warehouse where the tunnel digger was found is about a quarter of a mile from the border He says he was brought to it in November 2012 The warehouse is abandoned now and it still has crimescene tape and a padlock on the front door With all the truck traffic here you could imagine how loud noises coming from inside the building or deep underground would be masked The tunnel digger said he was tricked into going there He was working day jobs in a border town until he had a fight with his wife He picked up and left and decided to head north to San Diego for a while to cool off and make some money He had made the illegal trip many times before He rented a room in a rough neighborhood in Tijuana known as a reliable place to find a smuggler I was drinking a soda at this little store in front of the room I was renting and this guy who I had talked with a few times before drives by the tunnel digger said in Spanish The other man said he had found a smuggler He said he could show the tunnel digger the safe house so he would know where to go The tunnel digger climbed in the vehicle But he said the man  identified in court documents only as Carlillos  took him to a warehouse not a home Someone rolled up the huge metal door and we drove in A pickup truck pulled in behind us and then I heard the door come down he said He said six men with ski masks and rifles jumped out of the truck They threw me to the ground and started beating me up threatening me I wanted to run but there was nowhere to go he said They told me what I was going to do and if I didnt they would kill me San Diego Warehouses The Exit Door Just over the border fence in San Diego sit hundreds of warehouses Federal officials have found the exit doors for Tijuanas tunnels tucked into back offices and even in bathrooms Joe Garcia is a federal agent on San Diegos Tunnel Task Force His group has discovered some of the biggest underground passageways in the region including last years socalled supertunnel which stretched 600 yards Eightandahalf tons of marijuana and more than 300 pounds of cocaine were stuffed inside Garcia says the tunnels are sophisticated and quite a feat to dig without heavy machinery which is too noisy and too big for the narrow passageways Its good oldfashioned hard manual labor he said These guys are filling buckets or sandbags of earth and are moving them either completely out or putting them somewhere else in the tunnel It is hard hard work 12Hour Shifts  The tunnel digger said they worked in 12hour shifts from 6 to 6 He said he worked the night shift with six others There was this red laser beam we had to follow right down the middle he said If we went crooked or off a bit the men with the ski masks would come down and beat us We had to dig 3 meters every day If we didnt they told us we were lazy and beat us The digger said he never saw anyones face except Carlillos and that of the man who brought them food Some days the man with the food didnt come After two months they had dug about 200 yards and it was getting harder to breathe in the tunnel The men in the ski masks brought in tubing and pumped in oxygen It was nearly February At that rate the tunnel would reach a San Diego warehouse in plenty of time before Baja Californias marijuana harvest was ready to pick Jose Mario Vega Hernandez of Mexicos defense department said an anonymous tip led authorities to the tunnel on Feb 4 2013 The tunnel digger said he was so happy to see them The men rushed to thank the soldiers and said they were being held against their will He said the soldiers told them to be quiet and forced them to the ground They were arrested and taken to prison The Evidence  The 17 men were given one public defender In their declarations obtained by NPR their stories are the same The man known as Carlillos promised them either work or help to get across the border illegally In the year theyve been in jail several of the men Ive spoken to say theyve rarely seen their attorney who refused to speak with NPR His supervisor declined to be recorded but said it is a complicated case and that the lawyer is giving the best defense possible She added though that his caseload numbers in the hundreds Like the warden of the prison Jose Mario Vega Hernandez of Mexicos defense department said he has heard others accused of drug crimes claim kidnapping He said the men have a lot of evidence against them  10 kilos of marijuana were found at the warehouse  and face up to 35 years in prison The tunnel digger said he never saw marijuana in the warehouse except on the day the army arrived His family members who live hundreds of miles away said they feel helpless They have little money and cant visit or hire a private attorney But they said they are glad hes alive The tunnel digger said in all those months underground he was convinced the men in the ski masks were going to kill him once the passageway was complete In a business as risky as this witnesses are a liability Now he says he thinks about how he might be in this prison for the rest of his life Hes glad to be alive but says its not fair and its just not right Copyright 2014 NPR,20140206,marijuana

marijuana Advocates there are gathering signatures to put a medical marijuana referendum on the fall ballot But Floridas Legislature may act sooner to allow residents access to a particular type of marijuana Advocates say the strain called Charlottes Web offers hope to children with severe seizure disorders Paige Figi is a Colorado mom whose young daughter Charlotte suffers from Dravet syndrome Its a debilitating genetic disease that left the little girl unable to walk talk or eat Figi says an oil extracted from a particular strain of marijuana has helped save her daughters life Charlotte is doing great says Figi who was in Tallahassee Fla to testify at a legislative hearing Shes two years in to treatment I would have brought her here but she cant leave Colorado Thats because the marijuana extract her daughter depends on cant legally be transported across state lines Its from a variety of marijuana with very little tetrahydrocannabinol or THC the primary component that produces the high Instead the strain has very high amounts of another compound  cannabidiol or CBD A few years ago Figi told legislators her daughter was having 300 seizures a week After trying every drug and therapy she and her husband could think of they started Charlotte on a marijuana extract that contained high amounts of CBD She takes just a few milligrams of the oil each day in her food The results have been dramatic Figi says Shes 99 percent  almost 100 percent  seizurefree she adds She has about one or two seizures a month now down from 1200 But the marijuana extract isnt a cure Charlotte and others with Dravet have a genetic disease theyll have forever Figi says her daughter will never drive a car marry or live independently But Charlotte used to have to rely on a feeding tube Figi says and now can eat and drink on her own She has friends and a vastly improved quality of life For families like hers Figi says Charlottes Web and similar strains of marijuana represent a lifeline Its brandnew and its very very exciting for these parents who have nothing left Figi says The Figis story has become wellknown among parents of children with Dravet syndrome and other seizure disorders Theres now a waiting list for Charlottes Web and the grower in Colorado is working to ramp up production In the meantime families from Florida and other states have been moving to Colorado to get their kids started on the therapy Families like Cory Brownings who bought a house in Breckenridge Colo Browning is a lawyer in north Florida whose daughter has Dravet syndrome and has suffered from as many as 200 seizures a day Browning testified at the hearing that hes looking to Colorado because medical marijuana is illegal in Florida I dont want to break the law Browning said I have a law license to protect If I have to our only option may be to send my wife and daughter to Colorado Twenty states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical purposes and Maryland has a limited medical marijuana research program Leaders in the Florida Legislature have consistently blocked efforts to bring a bill to the floor But for Charlottes Web and similar strains even some staunch opponents of medical marijuana now are willing to make an exception Rep Charles Van Zant a Baptist minister from central Florida has long opposed anything that he believes expands substance abuse But after hearing pleas from Figi and other parents he said he was moved I dont think this is substance abuse Zant says I think this is using the substance wisely as God intended Im for it While parents and advocates are embracing this specialized form of marijuana as a new therapy for children with seizure disorders many medical experts are more circumspect There are many more unknowns than knowns says Dr Orrin Devinsky a neurologist and head of New York Universitys Comprehensive Epilepsy Center And I think the focus of the community  lay and scientific and governmental  should be on getting good information That should be the real focus of what we need right now Devinsky is overseeing clinical trials beginning soon that will test the safety and efficacy of a CBD compound developed by a British drug company To get FDA approval for the drug Devinsky says researchers must conduct randomized controlled trials  a process likely to take at least a couple of years In the meantime some families in Florida and elsewhere say their children cant wait for results from research For these families Devinsky thinks Charlottes Web and similar marijuana strains may make sense If I had a child who had failed 15 medications and drug treatments and there was nothing else to do and they were having many seizures a day that were terribly disabling Devinsky says I think it would be a very reasonable thing to do to try a highCBD cannabis product But the enthusiasm for the new therapy now spreading among parents of children with Dravet syndrome and similar disorders may make it harder to conduct clinical trials Devinsky says The challenge may be finding families who havent already begun trying the Charlottes Web extract Copyright 2014 NPR,20140116,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2014/01/08/260797831/how-long-is-too-long-congress-revisits-mandatory-sentences?ft=3&f=,Mandatory minimum prison sentences for drug dealers were once viewed as powerful levers in the nations war against drugs a way to target traffickers and punish kingpins and masterminds But Congress which approved the requirements in 1986 when crackfueled crime gripped Americas big cities is now grappling with a presentday lowercrime reality Have the mandatory sentences put the wrong sort of offenders in prison for too long and at too high a cost for the nation to bear  both literally and figuratively Those questions are expected to be addressed in a comprehensive Senate bill being hammered out in negotiations driven by a seemingly unlikely alliance How unlikely Among those driving the conversation are Tea Party Republicans like Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah and liberal Democrats including Majority Whip Richard Durbin of Illinois and Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy of Vermont Under discussion are proposals that would cut minimum sentences by half give judges more sentencing discretion and retroactively apply new crack cocaine sentencing standards to prisoners convicted under previous requirements Also being considered are inprison programs that could help nonviolent inmates earn earlier release President Obama dipped his toe into the debate recently when he commuted the sentences of eight federal inmates convicted of crack cocaine crimes The convicts would have received far shorter prison terms under the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act standards designed to reduce the disparity between sentencing rules for crack and powder cocaine Theres a lot more momentum today than in the 20 years Ive been doing this says Julie Stewart president and founder of Families Against Mandatory Minimums or FAMM Overincarceration used to be a fringe issue but it has become more of a mainstream concern says Stewart who started FAMM after her brother received a prison sentence for growing pot plants Pushback From Prosecutors But while advocates such as Stewart libertarian thinkers at the CATO Institute and a growing number of conservatives like columnist George Will are pushing for change some drug prosecutors have urged caution The real power and efficacy of federal minimum mandatory sentences is our ability to hold them over certain peoples heads in solving kingpin drug cases or major murders says Scott Burns head of the National District Attorneys Association Burns was among the witnesses who testified about mandatory minimums last fall before the Senate Judiciary Committee The sentencing rules have been an important tool in driving down serious crime Burns says which over the past three decades has plummeted He sees Congress motivation as purely financial Theyre doing this because they are simply refusing to fund more federal prisons period says Burns a former deputy director of National Drug Control Policy during the George W Bush administration There have also however been assertions that federal prosecutors have used harsh sentences as a cudgel to elicit guilty pleas A Human Rights Watch study released in December found that the Justice Department in federal drug cases regularly coerces guilty pleas by threatening long sentences The report came a few months after US Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Justice Department would not pursue mandatory minimum sentences in cases involving lowlevel nonviolent drug defendants We must ensure that our most severe mandatory minimum penalties are reserved for serious highlevel or violent drug traffickers he wrote in an August memo which he followed with a set of guidelines for federal prosecutors A Panoply Of Proposals A bill sponsored by Durbin and Lee would cut by half the 5 10 and 20year minimums now required for first and second drugsale offenses Separate legislation offered by Paul and Leahy would give judges the ability to impose sentences short of the minimum guidelines Additionally Sens Sheldon Whitehouse DRI and Rob Portman ROhio have proposed allowing inmates to shorten their sentences by participating in reentry programs And Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn a Texas Republican has introduced his own bill that among its provisions would allow lowrisk prisoners to serve up to half of their remaining sentences in home confinement or a halfway house Also under discussion is the federal version of the statebased three strikes law which since 1994 has required enhanced sentencing for defendants with two or more previous felony convictions in state or federal courts Life in prison has been mandatory if the defendant is convicted of a serious violent felony and has at least one prior serious felony conviction which can be a drug conviction Leahy at a Judiciary Committee meeting Thursday said he was encouraged by progress made to reach a bipartisan and comprehensive compromise on sentencing reform that includes important yet incremental changes to mandatory minimum sentencing legislation The Financial And Constitutional Angle The financial element of the mandatory sentencing debate is an important consideration Cornyn has touted his reform proposal as an effort to increase public safety and reduce prison costs In introducing his legislation Whitehouse noted that 30 percent of the Justice Departments budget is now dedicated to federal prisons the cost he said has doubled since 2000 As a result he said funding for other important federal law enforcement priorities  from stopping cyberthreats to providing services for victims of crime  has suffered But legal scholars like Erik Luna a Washington and Lee University law professor who has written and testified extensively about mandatory minimum sentencing also assert that the sentencing rules shift power from judges to prosecutors  an infringement on separation of powers doctrine Its an argument George Will recently invoked The policy of mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses has empowered the government to effectively nullify the Constitutional right to a trial Stewart of FAMM says she gives Rand Paul a ton of credit for getting this conversation going He cares deeply about it The question we have to ask is why is prison always the answer she says We have to unlearn the bad habit weve developed of incarceration first Burns the prosecutor says he and members of the National District Attorneys Association are willing to talk about improving the sentencing system but they want more specifics from Capitol Hill We can always do better he says but if you start letting people out who got there for a reason most of them multiple offenders who have been convicted or have pled guilty that would be a problem Why arrest and convict knowing hes going to be back on the street But when a reluctant judge is forced by minimum sentencing rules to impose a 55year sentence on a 24yearold man after his third smalltime marijuana sale conviction Stewart says pointing to the muchpublicized case of Weldon Angelos doing better isnt just an option Its mandatory Copyright 2014

Chris Mack plunges into on most days Once homeless himself Mack is an outreach worker for the JWCH Institutes Center for Community Health a free clinic in the heart of Skid Row Mack is part of a concerted push to enroll the nations homeless in Medicaid As of January the health insurance program thats jointly funded by federal and state governments is being opened for the first time to all poor adults not just those with disabilities or dependent children The outreach is important homeless experts say In addition to safe permanent housing regular medical care is a critical intervention for getting lost lives back on track A person who is not feeling very well cant behave or perform very well Mack says so I think health care is primary The Medicaid expansion was a central provision in the Affordable Care Act the federal health care law But after the Supreme Court declared the expansion optional for states rather than mandatory 26 states and the District of Columbia have chosen to do so Even without all the states participating some 9 million people are expected to enroll in Medicaid across the country and 12 million homeless people could be newly eligible for coverage Homeless advocates have cheered the expansion Men and women living on the streets and in shelters will be able to see a doctor regularly keep prescriptions filled to treat their asthma diabetes and schizophrenia and get referrals to private specialists for lingering ailments Ugly Reality Macks journey through Skid Row is an arduous even perilous undertaking Some 54000 people live on the streets in Los Angeles and as elsewhere in the nation up to 80 percent are mentally ill or addicted to drugs or alcohol That makes enrolling them in a complicated public insurance program all the more difficult Sometimes on certain streets people are following their habit smoking or drinking or shooting up says Mack Thats part of the ugly reality Mack greets a woman perched on an upsidedown plastic bucket with a Burberry scarf covering her head Her eyes are clouded with drink or drugs and her cheeks are smeared with ash She tells Mack that her name is Martha Castro that shes slept on the streets for four years and that she has been to the doctor just once for a lung infection Do you realize that you can have health insurance Mack asks her No I dont want to apply for nothing else right now Castro replies in a slur of words and confusion She is adamant that at 64 years old shes healthy enough And anyway she says she doesnt have any identification or money So then how we gonna have insurance for the clinic Castro asks I tell her the insurance  Medicaid  is free to her and she doesnt need an ID card But that doesnt matter to Castro who is high or drunk and perhaps touched by

homeless are a reminder of lifes cruel turns For George Farag an Egyptian immigrant and former security guard that cruel turn came when he fell asleep one night on the job I work in security before I sleep on the job Kick me out says Farag standing in the lobby of the John Wesley Community Clinic As if to prove the veracity of his story he shows me the emblem embroidered on his shirt Its his old companys logo After me lost the job I lost everything Farag says I sleep on the city two years One of those nights sleeping on the streets he says someone ran over him A hitandrun that crushed his right leg Hes come to the JWCH clinic before for the occasional prescription but on this day hes signing up for Medicaid Through an opening at the glass enrollment window a clinic worker hands Farag a copy of his new insurance forms and he stuffs them into a worn plastic bag God bless you Farag says through the window Once he is enrolled the clinic will coordinate his medical needs and perhaps do something about the makeshift brace on his leg Dr Dennis Bleakley has been treating Skid Row patients at the clinic for more than a decade Before he says uninsured homeless adults like Farag had little access to specialists Fractured bones bulging hernias diseased hearts  all of these things went untended Now at least you have a reasonable length of time with a patient and access to specialists Bleakley says Its going to open up a whole new world for us But even with new services available to them the homeless will remain some of the toughest most confounding patients Disorder and addiction easily sabotage the bestlaid plans and those who work with the homeless acknowledge that few make it out That sobering reality doesnt stop Mack the outreach worker who heads back out on the street to find people who might qualify for Medicaid Hes like a rescue diver plunging into a roiling ocean to bring those whove fallen overboard back to safety  again and again Copyright 2014

readers here on the blog and Twitter about the most bizarre silly or frequently posed questions they get about their racial backgrounds Some of the responses were so bizarre that they were hilarious

a dangerous narcotic that causes delirium and death in the 1900s And where does the word marijuana come from anyway One common story goes that its recasting was racial motivated by distrust of Mexican

a Nov 2 incident in which Renisha McBride 19 was shot in the face after knocking on Theodore Wafers door at night in Dearborn Heights a suburb west of DetroitMcBrides family has said they believe she was seeking help after being in a car wreck hours earlier Weve updated this post with the latest information we haveUpdate at 640 pm ET Comments And Questions From DetroitThe case has raised racial tensions in Detroit where a nearly twoweek delay in charging Wafer had brought protests It has also echoed some of the elements of the Trayvon Martin case in which an unarmed black teenager was shot and killed by a white manProsecutors say that the charges against Wafer have nothing to do with race But as Sarah Cwiek reports for All Things Considered the racial difference here already hangs over the caseIn Detroit people wonder about a racial motivation for the shooting Cwiek saysAnd its like was he just afraid because of the color of her skin or was he honestly afraid Detroit resident Gerita Bailey tells CwiekThis afternoon McBrides parents spoke to the mediaRejecting Wafers reported claims that the shooting was an accident Monica McBride said You took a life And you took a beautiful life that was starting to blossom into a beautiful womanCalling Wafer this monster that killed my daughter Walter Ray Simmons said he hopes the accused is sent to prison for the rest of his lifeAt todays arraignment one of Wafers attorneys Mack Carpenter said that his client will be completely exonerated after all the facts of the case emergeBecause of the time he said her condition and all the circumstancesUpdate at 255 pm ET Wafer Is Arraigned Some Details EmergeA bond of 250000 was set for Theodore Wafer on Friday afternoon when he was arraigned in court A preliminary examination is set for Dec 18Wafers attorney Mack Carpenter revealed more information about his client according to The Detroit Free Press telling the judge that Wafer has a security clearance as part of his job at Detroit Metro Airport where hes been employed for 10 yearsWafer also attended Northern Michigan University in Marquette for a year and cares for his 81yearold mother the newspaper reports citing CarpenterOur original post continuesWafer has reportedly told police that he feared a breakin when he heard sounds on his porch Officials said Friday that the fatal shot was fired through the houses open front door passing through a locked screen door before striking McBrideWayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy announced the charges against Wafer on Friday He also faces charges of manslaughter and possession of a firearm during a felony Worthy said she believes Wafer owns the weapon legallyEarlier Friday officials released a toxicology report showing McBride was found to have high levels of alcohol in her system along with trace amounts of marijuana No toxicology test was performed on Wafer Worthy saidThe case has attracted national attention with civil rights leaders calling for an investigation into what they say could be a case of racial profiling McBride was black Wafer is white prosecutors said FridayWhen asked today whether race is an issue in the case Worthy said No its not relevant at all not to our charging decisionWafer a 54yearold homeowner has reportedly admitted to shooting McBride in the early hours of Nov 2 with a 12gauge shotgun after hearing what he thought were the sounds of someone trying to break into his house Today Worthy said the home showed no signs of an attempt to force entry and that according to the evidence Wafer opened the front door himselfWorthy said the evidence suggests McBride knocked on a locked screen door and that the shot that killed her was fired through the screen door She also said that it doesnt appear Wafer and McBride knew each otherAn arraignment for Wafer has been scheduled for Friday afternoon Prosecutors expect him to turn himself in before that appearanceThe McBride familys attorney Gerald Thurswell says they dont think the killing was accidentalWe believe that Renisha McBrides death was no accident and that the shooter should have dialed 911 both for his own safety and the safety of Renisha Thurswell said in a statement issued earlier this week rather than shooting her in the face on his front porchIn announcing the charges Worthy also described the statute on selfdefense in Michigan lawThere is no duty to retreat when youre in your own house But someone who claims selfdefense must have an honest and reasonable belief of imminent death or other significant harm she said adding that the person would need to use force to prevent that imminent harmWhile some of the details of what happened that night havent been made public The Detroit Free Press has assembled what may be a rough chronologyAccording to police McBrides vehicle struck a parked vehicle in Detroit more than two hours before she was shot Police said that just before 1 am Nov 2 a witness called 911 to say a woman was speeding down the street in the area of Bramell and Majestic hit a parked vehicle got out of her car and leftShe later returned to the scene according to a second 911 call but was gone when police arrived That caller told police the woman appeared to be intoxicatedCiting sources the newspaper says McBride was driving a car that was registered in her fathers name Copyright 2014

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2013/07/09/200471775/results-the-albums-everyone-can-love?ft=3&f=,A while back a long while back Bob Boilen and I were sitting around the office chatting like we do about music and life and got to wondering Is it possible to come up with a top ten list of albums that everyone can agree onTo answer that question because we had to know we spent much of the 2012 summer posting weekly polls with lists of album titles for people to vote on Each poll had 20 albums to consider Voters could say yes they loved the record no they didnt love the record or that they havent really heard it We had to include the last option because even though most of the albums we put up for vote were pretty popular landmark recordings we figured thered still be a lot of people who hadnt heard them and we didnt want to force them to commit one way or the other to a record they hadnt spent a lot of time with And while restricting the options to love or dont love might seem too limiting we really wanted to avoid middleoftheroad responses We didnt want to know if you only liked or kind of liked or even liked an album a lot We wanted passion It wasnt a terribly scientific or sophisticated approach and the voting tool we used was really elementary But we are simple music nerds not numbercrunchers so we figured itd do the trickLast fall after several months of voting on hundreds of albums we looked over the results and had our answer No You cant really make a top ten list of records everyone can 100 percent agree on Our tastes are way too fragmented and diverse And the kind of love we have for one record is often different from the love we have for another making it impossible to compare the two fairlyBut even if we didnt get 100 percent agreement on these we did come up with some interesting lists worth sharing Here are the overall top ten mostloved albums in our poll we threw out the votes of those who hadnt heard the recordsHeres that list with the percentages includedTop 10 MostLoved Ignoring Those Who Havent Heard1 The Beatles Revolver 92 percent love2 The Beatles Abbey Road 91 percent3 Otis Redding Otis Blue 90 percent4 Miles Davis Kind Of Blue 89 percent5 Johnny Cash Live At Folsom Prison 89 percent6 The Beatles Rubber Soul 89 percent7 Bob Dylan Highway 61 Revisited 88 percent8 Marvin Gaye Whats Going On 88 percent9 Sam Cooke Portrait Of A Legend 88 percent10 The Beatles The White Album 87 percentNote that the highestrated album Revolver only managed to get 92 percent approval in our poll These are otherwise all brilliant albums with incredibly broad appeal Im even fine with seeing more than one Beatles record on there But  most of these albums came out in the 1960s Were the 60s really that much better than all the other decades Or do our tastes tend to favor records that have been around long enough to be declared classics More on this laterPerhaps the most glaring issue with the top ten mostloved list is that its allmale Where was the love for Joni Mitchells Blue or Carol Kings Tapestry or the many other amazing lifechanging profoundly treasured albums by women Also while jazz and soul and country are somewhat represented among the most popular genres hiphop isnt represented on this list at all even though we included a number of important hiphop albums in our pollAgain heres the list with percentagesTop 10 MostLoved Albums By Women Ignoring Those Who Havent Heard1 Etta James At Last 86 percent love2 Billie Holiday The Ultimate Collection 83 percent3 Aretha Franklin I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You 80 percent4 The Supremes Where Did Our Love Go 79 percent5 Neko Case Fox Confessor Brings The Flood 76 percent6 Joni Mitchell Blue 73 percent7 Carole King Tapestry 72 percent8 Dusty Springfield Dusty In Memphis 71 percent9 Joni Mitchell Court And Spark 69 percent10 Janis Joplin Pearl 68 percentEtta James just missed out making the top ten mostloved list by one percentage point But most of these numbers are shockingly low I mean its been a while since I was in school but isnt a 68 percent basically a D A D for Pearl SeriouslyThere were also some curious surprises along the way that challenged a lot of our assumptions Take for example an insanely popular multiplatinumselling album like Whitney Houstons Bodyguard Soundtrack It was by far one of the leastloved albums we included in our survey A third of our audience hadnt even heard itHeres the list with percentagesTop 10 LeastLoved Ignoring Those Who Havent Heard1 MC Hammer Please Hammer Dont Hurt Em 12 percent love2 Whitney Houston The Bodyguard Soundtrack 15 percent3 Lil Wayne Tha Carter III 18 percent4 Usher Confessions 18 percent5 Whitney Houston Whitney 23 percent6 Bon Jovi Slippery When Wet 23 percent7 Beyonce Dangerously In Love 25 percent8 Jewel Pieces Of You 26 percent9 Janet Jackson Rhythm Nation 1814 27 percent10 TLC Crazysexycool 28 percentThe list of leastloved albums raised some eyebrows here perhaps more so than any of the other lists we managed to wring out of our poll Maybe its no surprise to see Please Hammer Dont Hurt Em or Jewels Pieces Of You on there But there are a number of undeniable wellestablished classics on this list including Lil Waynes Tha Carter III Janet Jacksons Rhythm Nation 1814 I was particularly shocked by that one and TLCs Crazysexycool The leastloved records among those who took our poll are mostly RB hiphop and rap which probably says more about our personal tastes than the music itselfAnd then there are the leastheard albums Bands such as The Knife and Deerhunter are pretty big deals in our world But in our poll more than 70 percent had never even heard The Knifes Silent Shout and nearly 70 percent hadnt heard Deerhunters Microcastle placing both of them among the leastheard albumsAnd the list again with percentagesTop 10 LeastHeard Albums1 Shuggie Otis Inspiration Information 82 percent havent heard2 Solomon Burke Dont Give Up On Me 82 percent3 The Knife Silent Shout 73 percent4 XTC Drums And Wires 73 percent5 Charles Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus 71 percent6 Isaac Hayes Hot Buttered Soul 70 percent7 Glenn Gould Goldberg Variations 70 percent8 Robyn Body Talk 69 percent9 Fugazi The Argument 69 percent10 Deerhunter Microcastle 69 percentIts kind of shocking so few people have heard some of these albums Seriously If you havent already do yourself a favor and listen to every one of them on that listOne last result While our pool of albums was by no means exhaustive we think it did a pretty good job of representing the best each decade

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2013/11/12/242999770/reinventing-the-dwindling-middle-class-may-take-a-revolution?ft=3&f=,My parents moved away from Lincoln Ill two decades ago when I was in college I hardly ever get back there But my mom still works in Lincoln and it was to Lincoln I headed to meet her this fall after returning to the US from the Middle East I got off the train from Chicago and immediately saw that the old depot building  where we used to go for fancy dinners before prom  was shuttered A little monument commemorating the day Abraham Lincoln named the town in 1853 was faded and peeling There was a man asleep on a bench at the train stop He looked like hed been there for days Driving around with my mom I could not help but be struck by the question What happened to Lincoln I know this is a pretty common thought when people go back to their hometowns But really what happened I decided to find out for myself to spend a week reporting in Lincoln It turns out that whats happening in Lincoln is happening in so many towns and communities across the country As we recover from the Great Recession jobs are coming back But they are not middlewage jobs  they are either highwage jobs or lowwage jobs The middle class is in serious decline And that has all kinds of repercussions Fewer Jobs More Crime I started with Troy Brown who went to grade school with my brother and is now a probation officer He summed it up pretty well The drug use has skyrocketed The unemployment rate has skyrocketed And just the general attitude  just no hope he said I dont know really when it changed but it seemed to be overnight Brown has seen that change up close While the crime rate in Lincoln is steady its drugrelated offenses that are going up And the drug of choice these days Heroin So much heroin Brown says theres an overdose every week And thats in a town of just 14000 people A handful of people have even died State authorities say in towns like Lincoln people get addicted to prescription drugs then turn to heroin when they can no longer afford the pills They say the supply of heroin from Mexico has increased and thats why its cheap and available Brown says sadly heroin is keeping him in business Lincoln has really plummeted to the point where I would love for our office to have cuts because theres no more crime he said But were so swamped its just the exact opposite I mean I hate to say it but I have total job security here Ken Greenslate is the chief of police in Lincoln He says the town is not all bad He shows me the new part of town Its just off Interstate 55 which connects Lincoln to Chicago just a few hours north Hotels fast food restaurants an assisted living facility and a warehouse for storing documents have all opened in recent years Schools asked the voters to pass a referendum imposing a sales tax for school capital programs and the voters passed the referendum And Lincoln recently got a grant to refurbish its downtown But like in so many towns across the Midwest the population is shrinking and getting older Factories have been closing since the 80s and 90s One of the best government jobs in town the staterun home for people with mental disabilities was closed in 2002 Thousands of people lost their jobs Then came the Great Recession Since then the few factories that have managed to hang on in Lincoln have tended to hire temporary workers at lower wages with no benefits  There is one new plant in town a warehouse and distribution center for food products But the jobs there are mainly stacking boxes or driving trucks And the starting wages are 16 to 18 an hour  what economists say is barely a living wage A Disappearing Middle Class This is the new reality that economists say is hitting so many communities across the US Jobs are being created But in Illinois and its neighboring states the most jobs coming back are lowwage jobs In Lincoln where unemployment is 84 percent  a point higher than the national average  the few middle class jobs left are in health care teaching and prisons Police Chief Greenslate says that means some people turn to crime When people dont have work then they have time on their hands and when they have time on their hands theres more opportunity for them to find things they shouldnt be doing he says Before our tour is over Greenslate gets a call Police have stopped two suspects with 15 pounds of marijuana they think came from Mexico An informant tells police that more suspects are holed up in a migrantworker motel down the street Greenslate barrels his SUV up to the motel and corners the two suspects Do not move he yells grabbing his handcuffs and stepping out of the vehicle Let me see your hands Hands Hands I watch as one suspect tries to get away but then relents The other looks like hes about to cry Turns out the latter was carrying a duffel bag with another five pounds of pot The intended buyer for these drugs police later tell me was a 14yearold boy  from Lincoln The next day I meet Joe Plummer one of my high school classmates at the Steak n Shake out by the interstate Joe and his wife Josie have three teenage girls between them They say they worry about the drugs and the crime in Lincoln I ask them how they try to keep their kids safe We teach em how to shoot Josie said I have 35 guns in my house Every one of my daughters and my wife know how to handle a weapon as well as anybody could handle one Joe said Joe takes me to the firing range where he teaches his girls to shoot rifles like an AR15 and an AK47 that he keeps locked in a safe at home  and a handgun he keeps in his bedside table Treat It Like A Revolution Richard Longworth a fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs wrote a book about the struggling Midwest called Caught in the Middle Americas Heartland in the Age of Globalism He says Americas declining middle class means small towns are starting to have a lot more in common with crimeprone neighborhoods in big cities He also says towns like Lincoln need to realize this is not just about the recession This is about a long slow decline The earth isnt going to open up and swallow them he said Theyll survive but theyll be backwaters getting ever more what you saw shrinking in population population older young families not moving in high school grads like yourself moving away to seek their fortune somewhere else Longworth says for communities to survive in this new reality theyll have to reinvent themselves  try to keep the factory alive attract people who are willing to work the lowerwage jobs Otherwise what happens to towns like Lincoln will be just another episode in what he says is a major societal upheaval I grew up in a middleclass America where we pretty much knew life was an escalator he said You got on the bottom step and if you behaved yourself paid your dues went to work worked hard  youd end up at the top of the escalator And I think that escalators broken now Its a tougher scramble How to cover that upheaval I ask Youve covered revolutions before he said Treat it like just another damn revolution Sounds like a plan Copyright 2014 NPR,20131113,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2013/11/06/243466218/there-may-be-a-green-light-for-pot-but-not-for-driving-high?ft=3&f=,Western states have led the way in the legalization of marijuana first with medical marijuana and then with the legalization of recreational pot in Colorado and Washington last November Its been quite an adjustment for the police Washington State Patrol is adapting to the new reality in a variety of ways from untraining dogs that sniff out pot to figuring out how to police high drivers A Smell Once Forbidden Im driving through Seattle on Interstate 5 It runs from Canada clear down to Mexico and cops sometimes call it the Pot Highway because of all the marijuana theyve intercepted along this route But things are a little different now To test how different Im carrying Its less than 1 ounce  a legal amount under state law Really its just a bud But its sitting right here in my cup holder in plain sight and it feels weird having it there Especially because Im on my way to meet some state troopers with drugsniffing dogs This is what we would classify as monthly maintenance training says Steve Gardner who trains the dogs to detect cocaine crack meth and heroin but not marijuana  not anymore State lawyers decided things would be simpler this way since a dogs nose cant tell the difference between legal and illegal quantities of pot Still the dogs dont unlearn the scent Its a perishable skill Gardner explains Over time it becomes less sharp for them but once youve trained them to detect it youre not going to get them away from it But the new generation of dogs  the ones trained since last year  know nothing about pot Piper is one of those Shes getting her reward from her handler for detecting a drug  not pot  thats hidden on a parked truck Not once during her search did she take any notice of me or the bud of marijuana in my coat pocket Dave Rodriguez laments the end of potsniffing dogs That was an important tool using drug dogs to help you establish probable cause says Rodriguez a federal official based in Seattle He works for the presidents drug czar and focuses on highintensity drug trafficking in the Northwest He says that big drug busts may be harder to come by now because local cops are rethinking what to do when they encounter marijuana Everybodys very cautious because they dont want to get sued They dont want to set bad case law he says Its clear Rodriguez doesnt like the states legalization law but he echoes the wait and see policy recently laid out by the Justice Department The real test of that comes next year when growers start producing marijuana under state license The feds say that pot had better not show up in the rest of the country State officials promise to make sure it doesnt High On The Highway The Other Big Policing Issue Its around midnight on Friday and Ray Seaburg a trooper with the Washington State Patrol is roaming the streets near one of Seattles nightlife areas Hes part of a dedicated DUI unit and lately hes on the lookout for drivers who might be trying pot for the first time Youre talking about a stick of dynamite there essentially because essentially that person doesnt know how theyre gonna react to the marijuana theyve smoked because theyve never done it before because it was illegal before says Seaburg The upside for Seaburg is that because pot is legal now drivers are a bit more chatty about it He says people are open about telling him that they smoked even if it was shortly before driving What they may not realize is that theyre giving Seaburg a reason to ask more questions he says for example How long ago did you smoke Did you smoke Do you have any in your possession How often do you smoke Depending on the answers Seaburg might do a field sobriety test and if that doesnt go well he says then at that point we would have to go for a blood draw The ballot initiative that legalized pot also established a DUI limit for THC the active chemical in pot And to check THC you need blood Its a laborious process It takes time to do a warrant says Seaburg It takes time to get a hold of a judge to approve that warrant And then it takes time to go to the hospital to have that blood draw done by a professional Nevertheless police statewide are ordering more blood tests than ever And more of the tests are coming back positive NPR has obtained preliminary numbers for 2013 from the state toxicology lab According to the preliminary statistics roughly 27 percent of the blood tests for suspected impaired driving showed detectable THC Before this year that number was around 20 percent Thats a 7point jump in the months since legalization Is Pot The New Alcohol Do we have a marijuana impairment problem on our highways asks Steve Sarich a medical marijuana seller and activist He answers his own question with an emphatic no Sarich opposed legalization last year because it established the bloodlevel limit at 5 nanograms per milliliter He says the whole point was to prosecute habitual pot users like him  people with high tolerances who he says are OK to drive You cannot show me a study that says 5 nanograms is the level of impairment for everybody out there says Sarich It just doesnt exist Sarich sees the bloodlevel limit as a conspiracy against heavy pot users especially those who say they need it as medicine Conspiracy theories aside it does appear that its riskier now  legally speaking  to drive in Washington state after consuming marijuana Defense attorney Jesse Corkern says hes seeing a tide of what hes dubbed green DUIs Yeah were getting many many more calls from people that have been charged or theyve been arrested over the weekend Corkern says Corkern credits the THC bloodlevel limit for the increase because it draws a bright line for juries like the blood alcohol limit And in fact that was what sponsors of legalization promised to make pot more like alcohol Corkern sees the analogy but he says most people arent there yet You go to the store you pick up a sixpack you throw it in with your groceries and dont think anything of it right Corkern asks We dont have that same approach to cannabis yet as a populace  Its going to take a while for people to get to that comfort zone with cannabis And that includes the police Corkern says its undoubtedly legal to for example carry marijuana in your cars cup holder But is it a good idea He would advise a little more discretion Copyright 2014 NPR,20131106,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2013/11/06/243465993/7-election-lessons-we-should-have-seen-coming?ft=3&f=,In the end they pretty much all won The people who were expected to prevail Tuesday night wound up in the winners circle In New Jersey and New York of course and in Virginia too in the end The ballot measures also went according to script Yes there was enough suspense in the Virginia marquee race to remind everyone of how fragile the practice of political prognosticating really is But on further reflection the premier lessons of the night look like big billboards we all should have seen from miles down the road Among the timehonored wisdoms we saw demonstrated anew 1 Expectations rule impressions  This holds especially true when expectations are confounded When anything happens that we the media didnt expect our dominant story line gets flipped on its head The shock or even the apparent shock of the unexpected induces hours of derangement Sometimes days of derangement On this occasion the dominant story was the surprising strength of Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli in Virginias gubernatorial race Always controversial Cuccinelli was counted out in recent weeks because his Tea Party affiliation was seen as anathema among Northern Virginians in the Washington DC metro area The October government shutdown cemented this narrative and seemed to pave the way for Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe Yet the Republican led in the count Tuesday night from the earliest returns until more than 90 percent of the precincts were in In the end the margin was only half what the narrowest polls had predicted And that provided the only genuine suspense of the night the only reason for most people to pay attention to the live programming 2 Go big or go home New Jersey Gov Chris Christie got reelected with the trophy margin he wanted so badly Three voters out of five took him up on his offer to hug the entire Garden State Although rumors circulated about a woman named Barbara Buono having been the Democratic nominee in the race these rumors could not be confirmed Lacking big dollars and big names from the party firmament pitching in she scarcely broke the surface of media consciousness She also neglected to provide such basics as a candidate statement for every countys sample ballot Nonetheless Christie and his remarkably effervescent campaign style barely made it to 60 percent That was a gaudy enough number though and Christie gave a wellcovered acceptance speech late Tuesday that sounded at least as much like a presidential candidacy announcement 3 Money talks McAuliffe outspent Cuccinelli by 15 million this fall demonstrating the power of uncommon wealth in the commonwealth Christie so swamped his Democratic opponent financially that her efforts scarcely qualified as fundraising And in Alabama veteran state legislator Bradley Byrne had the backing of the Chamber of Commerce among others as he heavily outspent Tea Party upstart Dean Young in a special congressional election runoff in the Gulf Coast district anchored by the city of Mobile Around the country various ballot measures easing restrictions on marijuana or allowing casino gambling rose and fell largely on the fundraising muscle of their sponsors On the counterpoint side the election of Bill de Blasio as mayor of New York made this the first mayoral election in a dozen years that was not overshadowed by Mike Bloombergs checkbook In a sense de Blasios antiBloomberg landslide was the exception that demonstrated the rule 4 Issues matter The fortunes of the candidates in Virginia rose and fell with the news The race had been close at one time but it became McAuliffes to lose when the shutdown of the federal government angered thousands of affected federal workers and thousands more who depend on the feds economically But the lead McAuliffe opened up in October dwindled rapidly in the last 10 days as the national and local media focus shifted abruptly to Obamacare the nagging dysfunction of its digital infrastructure and the shortfall of its promises Cuccinelli had been among the laws earliest and loudest challengers in court and in the media He exploited the recent troubles effectively in the closing hours of the campaign and seemed to reenergize his states conservative coalition 5 Republicans usually come home No matter how divisive some of Cuccinellis more ideological positions may have been and no matter how much GOP regulars may have feared the prospect of him in office Republicans voted for him Exit polls showed more than 90 percent party unity despite the presence of a Libertarian option who actually did better among moderates and liberals There will be many in the Tea Party wing who blame this loss not on their man but on the failure of establishment conservatives to embrace him and keep him financially competitive with McAuliffe But in the end the Republican collapse some had foreseen did not happen Cuccinellis loss was not about weakness in his base but rather his inability to reach much beyond it 6 City folk vote differently from country folk  The map of Virginia on Election Night was almost entirely red as scores of counties went Republican But when you looked at the actual vote totals from those counties you often saw numbers in the hundreds or low singledigit thousands McAuliffe was able to swamp the vast swaths of rural Virginia with big wins in the Washington DC suburbs Richmond and Hampton Roads on the Atlantic Coast In that Alabama contest for a seat in Congress the Tea Party insurgent carried every county save one  the one that is home to Mobile It was the only county in the district with a claim to being urban and here the establishment choice won handily 7 Polls can be misleading and that includes exit polls  The latters chief value is in dissecting the vote on the morning after While the voting polls are still open those early exits can create misimpressions in close races Back in 2004 the initial waves of exit polling showed Democratic Sen John Kerry winning that days presidential election over incumbent George W Bush Even the Bush White House was briefly convinced Later data and revisions told a different story This year the early exits pointed to a McAuliffe win more or less in line with the polls built on a huge lead for the

political action to be found on statewide ballots Tuesday A total of 31 ballot measures concerning issues ranging from education to gambling to marijuana will go before voters in six states  Colorado Maine New Jersey New York Texas and Washington Thats down slightly from the average of about 42 measures in nine states in oddnumbered years according to Ballotpedia Some of the ballot measures are more interesting than others  and may have broader national implications Here are five to keep an eye on Colorado School Financing Amendment 66 would raise income taxes by 950 million per year to provide the necessary funding for the implementation of a new public school financing system The main campaign supporting the tax hike recently received a combined 2 million in contributions from New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his wife Melinda Groups supporting the measure have raised more than 104 million while organizations in opposition have together raised less than 40000 US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan Colorado Democratic Gov John Hickenlooper and some of the states top teachers unions also back the initiative Duncan said that if voters pass Amendment 66 Colorado will become the educational model for every state to follow Republicans and other tax opponents argue the measure will hurt families and small businesses and that a funding boost wont guarantee a more effective education system Colorado Marijuana Tax One year after Colorado voters approved the legalization of recreational marijuana use they must now decide if they want to tax it Proposition AA would impose a 15 percent excise tax on marijuana sales to help fund the construction of new schools and an additional 10 percent sales tax which will pay for regulation and enforcement If the measure passes the states fiscal analysts project it could bring in 70 million annually The proposition has the support of Hickenlooper the states Republican attorney general and many members of the legalmarijuana industry But some marijuana advocates are against the measure arguing that pot should be taxed at a lower rate similar to alcohol Washington state also legalized the recreational use of marijuana last year and included language placing a 25 percent excise tax on all pot sales in its ballot measure Washington Genetically Modified Food Labeling If voters approve Initiative 522 Washington would become the first state in the country to require manufacturers to clearly label food made with genetically modified organisms or GMOs Some major food and beverage companies have fought hard against the ballot initiative The No on 522 campaign has raised 22 million the most money ever in favor of or in opposition to a ballot measure in the state Half of that has come from the Grocery Manufacturers Association an industry trade group whose members include CocaCola PepsiCo and Nestle Supporters of the initiative have raised about 84 million Most prominent Republicans in the state have joined with the packaged foods industry in opposition to the initiative while Democrats generally favor it A similar measure appeared on the ballot in California last year but voters narrowly shot it down New Jersey Minimum Wage Increase New Jersey voters appear poised to adopt a constitutional amendment that raises the minimum wage by 1 to 825 per hour and increases it annually based on the rate of inflation Currently just four other states have adopted a constitutional provision regarding the minimum wage while 10 states have policies in place that raise it automatically The federal minimum wage is 725 per hour but President Obama called for an increase to 9 earlier this year Republican Gov Chris Christie who vetoed a bill to raise the minimum wage in January opposes the measure as do a coalition of business groups Meanwhile Christies opponent in Tuesdays gubernatorial election Barbara Buono newly minted Democratic Sen Cory Booker and labor unions have thrown their support behind it New York Gambling Six ballot measures will be up for a vote in New York on Tuesday including a constitutional amendment the Legislature approved that would allow for the construction of up to seven new casinos in the state The only gambling currently permitted in New York takes place at casinos owned by the Oneida Indian Nation and racinos which are combinations of horse race tracks and casinos Democratic Gov Andrew Cuomo is a top supporter of the measure which has also won the backing of business and labor groups The gambling industry has spent tens of millions of dollars over the past several years lobbying the state to expand the number of casinos there Advocates argue the plan will spur economic growth provide more school funding and allow local governments to lower property taxes But some opponents are skeptical of its economic potential while others worry about the social problems casinos could bring Copyright 2014

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2013/11/02/242594489/with-rise-of-painkiller-abuse-a-closer-look-at-heroin?ft=3&f=,Abuse of prescription painkillers is a growing deadly epidemic according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention On Oct 24 the Food and Drug Administration recommended putting new restrictions on hydrocodone sold as Vicodin and other brand names Dr Andrew Kolodny believes the restrictions are necessary and will prevent new people from developing addiction But he says there are millions who already have the disease and need access to effective treatment If they dont have access to legal sources for painkillers many of them will turn to the black market he tells NPRs Arun Rath And if they cant find blackmarket pills theyll buy heroin on the black market So while the abuse of painkillers has become a focus for concern the corresponding rise in heroin use is also prompting calls for action The Connection Between Heroin And Painkillers The number of people reporting heroin use in the previous year increased between 2007 and 2012 from 373000 to 669000 Meanwhile federal data from 2011 finds that nearly 80 percent of people who had used heroin in the past year had also previously abused prescription painkillers classified as opioids Opioids  derived from opium  include morphine oxycodone hydrocodone as well as heroin says Kolodny who is the chief medical officer for the national drug treatment network Phoenix House and president of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing Opioids share a similar molecule he says and when they attach to the brains opiate receptor they all cause a very similar effect They give both a positive reinforcement  the effect when you take the drug  but also very strong negative reinforcer which is that youll feel very sick when you dont have the drug he says Those two factors together make opioids extremely addictive Legislating A Call For Help Several years ago John Nygren says his teenage daughter started having trouble She would not come home in the evenings at times She was not going to school There were incremental steps along the way where we saw there were problems he says Nygren is a fourthgeneration Wisconsinite from the small town of Marinette He now represents the town in the State Assembly His daughter Cassie Nygren became addicted to the prescription painkiller OxyContin Eventually she was drawn to heroin  and overdosed on it in 2009 Her mother found her on the bathroom floor struggling to breathe John Nygren says A needle was still in her arm Cassie Nygren hadnt been alone in that bathroom but those who were with her left when she overdosed Nygren says that was probably because they were afraid of the authorities getting involved The paramedics arrived in time to save her life but she has continued to battle addiction Shes been in and out of treatment and is currently serving time in county jail Now John Nygren is using his position to change things in Wisconsin He has introduced legislation to give people legal protection when calling 911 about an overdose Its part of a package of bills to cope with the opioid crisis in his state The Rise Of Painkillers According to the CDC the amount of prescription painkillers sold to pharmacies hospitals and doctors offices across the US quadrupled between 1999 and 2010 With the increase in prescribing what weve seen is that its led to parallel increases in rates of addiction and increases in rates of drug overdose deaths Kolodny says And its gotten so bad that the CDC is now telling us there are more people in the United States dying each year from drug overdoses than car crashes The United States is completely alone in this trend Kolodny says The United States has about 4 percent of the worlds population and were consuming more than 80 percent of the worlds oxycodone supply Were also consuming more than 99 percent of the worlds hydrocodone he says In many cases the prescriptions are entirely legitimate says Dr Elinore McCanceKatz who specializes in addiction psychiatry and is first chief medical officer at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Opioid medications are effective pain relievers and used by the majority of people for that purpose Individuals do not become addicted to these medications when used as clinically prescribed she says But there are people who have vulnerability to addiction McCanceKatz says that opioid addiction is a chronic illness but fortunately very treatable As people get treatment  and that treatment includes medication and psychosocial treatments  they do recover she says Numbing The Pain In Glendale Calif 18yearold Preny Ebrahimi is on the other end of treatment In her familys apartment with her mother looking on she says she struggled in school with attention deficit disorder Around the time she was 13 or 14 Ebrahimi says she fell in with the wrong crowd First there was marijuana Then there were the prescription painkillers which were easy to find Then there was methamphetamine and one day she tried smoking heroin After that day I just fell in love with the feeling and the numbing pain and I just kept doing it and doing it and doing it she says And it just ate away at my life She says she was using every day every hour for about 18 months Eventually Ebrahimi bottomed out She had stopped using heroin on her own but that brought on withdrawal She stole her fathers car to meet a dealer and nearly ran over her father driving away When she got home her family confronted her Everybody was just trying to talk to me and I was going crazy because I didnt want to talk I just wanted to go be alone and do it she says They were like We dont know what else to do You need to stop  The pain became too much Ebrahimi says  for her family and for herself The high itself that numbing pain it was just not worth it anymore to put my family and myself through And I just wanted to stop she says Ebrahimis parents had her placed in juvenile detention and a judge mandated residential drug treatment at Phoenix House She stayed there for five months It has been a long road  one that has clearly taken a toll on her family But Ebrahimi has been clean and sober for almost three years She has a job now and plans to start college in the spring These years sober have been the best years of my life Ive gained so much trust back she says Its a feeling like no other honestly going through all that and being here right now a place youd never thought youd be Copyright 2014 NPR,20131104,marijuana

trying to explain what went so terribly wrong with his administrations health care signup website and Republicans had a field day Today its Republicans who will be having just such a day Three major national polls show unequivocally that Republicans are taking the brunt of the publics anger after this months government shut down and default crisis Democrats didnt fare well either but the early landscape for the 2014 midterm elections looks particularly bleak for the rivenfromwithin Republicans Lets go to the numbers A new Washington PostABC Poll reveals that the recent budget confrontations have not only dealt a major blow to the GOPs image write Dan Balz and Scott Clement but also exposed significant divisions between Tea Party supporters and other Republicans More than 80 percent of Americans surveyed said they disapproved of the partial government shutdown that began Oct 1 and ended last week Balz and Clement write The survey highlights just how badly the GOP hardliners and the leaders who went along with them misjudged the public mood In the aftermath eight in 10 Americans say they disapprove of the shutdown Two in three Republicans or independents who lean Republican share a negative view of the impasse And even a majority of those who support the tea party movement disapprove Sixtythree percent of Americans surveyed said they had an unfavorable view of Republicans The poll found fallout to go around with Americans expressing deep dissatisfaction with Congress including congressional Democrats seen unfavorably by 49 percent of those surveyed President Obama appeared the only politician relatively unscathed by the crisis with his approval rating at about 50 percent the survey found At USA TODAY Susan Page writes that the new USA TODAYPrinceton Research Poll showing that only 4 percent of Americans believe Congress would be worse off if every member were replaced holds a special warning for Republicans Says Page Those findings are similar to the publics views in previous years when voter dismay cost one side or the other control of the House In 1994 when Democrats lost their majority 40 said Congress would be better off if most members were replaced In 2006 when Republicans lost control 42 held that view She notes that theres still a year before voters go to the poll  plenty of time for changes in the political winds But the USA TODAY poll also finds that Republicans have lost more ground and by a 21 margin are shouldering more blame than Democrats for Capitol Hill dysfunctionEven Republicans Page says presumably inclined to blame the other side are divided about whether responsibility belongs to the Democrats or to both parties equally Thats not true among Democrats Eight in 10 say the GOP is largely to blame A postshutdown CNNORC International survey found that 75 percent of Americans say that most Republicans in Congress dont deserve to be reelected The survey found that Democrats have an eightpoint approval edge over Republicans in an early indicator in the battle for control of Congress noting as did USA TODAY that theres plenty of time for these numbers to change before the 2014 midterm congressional elections A majority of those questioned CNN reported blamed congressional Republicans for the government shutdown and said the President was the bigger winner in the deal to end the crisis Lets take a turn from polls and shutdown politics for now to a crisis that has captured the attention of the nation including Congress and the White House sexual assaults in the military The new edition of Washington Monthly contains two mustread stories that will no doubt generate conversation and controversy as Congress continues to debate how best to improve the safety of women and others in the military and to better investigate and prosecute cases of alleged sexual assault Writers Laura Kasinof and Stephanie Mencimer take indepth looks at whether women are more affected by the trauma of combat and at the veracity of one womans highlypublicized account of rape by a military contractor  an account that helped galvanize action around military sexual assault Kasinof noting that the Defense Department in January lifted its ban on women service in combat roles writes While its clear that war is hell for everyone men and women alike its unclear how the unique female experience in the barracks on the battlefield and back at home may affect them differently Female veterans are already more likely than male veterans to be homeless divorced or raising children as single parents Female vets under fifty are more than twice as likely as their male counterparts to kill themselves And a growing body of research suggests that female vets may also be more susceptible than men to psychological disorders including PTSD And she anticipates the controversial nature of questioning trauma and gender differences but says the discussion is necessary Those facts and new researchindeed the very discussion of gender differences in the armed forcesare often incendiary but they should not be taken as an argument against equality in the armed forces Instead they should be the catalyst for a worthwhile discussion After all we owe it to our veterans to study how some women experience war and homecoming differently and to determine what can be done to better support female soldierswomen who are now poised for the first time in history to be deployed in large numbers in combat positions overseas Mencimer in The War of Rape What happened to Jamie Leigh Jones in Iraq delves deeply into the case of Jones whose terrifying story of being raped by men working in Iraq for a subsidiary of Halliburton was covered heavily by the media Mencimer goes into Jones complicated medical and personal history reviews reports of physical evidence collected after her claim and pores over court documents that detail how the case fell apart The writer says that after a jury dismissed Jones case she was troubled that reporters and news organizations that highlighted the story for years did not follow up She writes The story has continued to nag at me even two years after the trial and a decade after the start of the Iraq War Now that the trial is over and the evidence the jurors used to come to their decision is publicly available there havent been many mea culpas from the reporters who helped put Jones in the limelight Brian Ross who scored the first onair interview with Jones back in 2007 and whose expos prompted Congress to act referred my requests for an interview to a flack for ABC News who called to ask what I was writing about and then never answered a single question Rachel Maddow who essentially used Joness story to accuse thirty Republican senators of being rape apologists never responded to repeated requests for comment Only the Houston Chronicle which failed to cover more than a day or two of the sensational trial in its own backyard went back a few months later to revisit the verdict with a serious story Mencimer also interviews Jones who says her claim fell apart because her lawyers couldnt compete with those at KBR a subsidiary of Halliburton for whom her alleged attackers worked It was a DavidandGoliath thing To be honest with you I had attorneys that were small potatoes and they had these lawyers that were sharks I was eaten alive in there Jones told Mencimer If you go against KBR they could make anybody look crazy They wanted to give that impression to people and to the jury that Im just a liar And thats not true Copyright 2014

still like the feel of paper in the morningSHUTDOWN ENDS shouted The Washington PostREPUBLICANS BACK DOWN ENDING BUDGET CRISIS The New York Times intonedAnd online yes some of us also like the morning glow of our devices the postshutdowndebt crisis postmortems were piling up like so many pages of regulations in the Affordable Care ActBut first the details quicklyCongress with alacrity late Wednesday passed a debt and spending bill that Obama signed shortly after midnight today Heres a breakdown of the 285144 House voteFederal workers about 450000 of them were expected to be back at their jobs today joining the 13 million who worked during the 16day shutdownAnd the US government is funded through Jan 15 its borrowing capacity raised through Feb 7 A good Washington Post QA helps sort out the deals detailsNow to the falloutFirst a right hook from conservative radio talker Rush Limbaugh Hes in the small but vociferous camp critical of Republican leaders for not continuing the doomed shutdowndefault brinksmanship Heres what he had to sayAnd what theyve ended up doing is creating one of the greatest political disasters Ive ever seen in my lifetime simply because they failed to show up Limbaugh said Then when they finally did make a play of showing up they didnt have the guts to stick with itTheres more of that out there from the Tea Party wing of the GOP including Republican Sen Ted Cruz of Texas who led the insurgents failed effort to link Obamacare defunding to the budget deal He turned on his own party colleagues in the Senate telling conservative radio host Mark Levin that Senate Republicans blew it when they didnt stand united alongside House RepublicansBut the preponderance of commentary from Republicans and conservative Republicans is far differentKevin Williamson writing for the conservative National Review says he sees one overarching lesson from the manufactured crisis Want to win the big government arguments Nothing beats a majority Win gains in the Senate take the White House and then governHeres Williamson For all the counterfactuals  If only my guy had been the nominee If only a Republican would make this speech If only my pet constitutional amendment with zero chance of passing would be submitted nonetheless If only my magicbullet tax plan would be adopted etc  the lesson of the shutdown showdown is that there really is no substitute for winning Job No 1 is ensuring that the Democrats control no larger a share of Senate seats than they do of state legislatures That and the long dreary business of responsible governanceAt the American Spectator Ross Kaminskys piece carries this headline For serious Republicans yesterdays agreement couldnt have turned out worse He calls on GOP Rep Paul Ryan of Wisconsin to take the lead in coming budget negotiations and urges Republicans to let Obamacare continue its inevitable collapseObamacare will tell its own sad story he says letting it do so is the best way for American voters to hear the story in a way they will believeAnd Kaminsky who respectfully called out conservative groups like Heritage Action for pushing the doomed nocompromise strategy urges Cruz to play along with Senate Republicans  good luck on that  and says House Republicans must try to regain some standing some moral authority a public sense of being something more than a bunch of undisciplined radicalsAnd finally New York Times columnist Ross Douthat held nothing  or little  back in his latenight blog post A Teachable Moment Douthat coauthor of Grand New Party How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream decried what he characterized as the mentality that drove the shutdown a toxic combination of tactical irrationality and the elevation of that irrationality into a True Conservative TM litmus test and its persistence And he warned party populists about the peril of pulling this kind of stunt againHeres Douthat So for undeluded conservatives of all persuasions lessons must be learned If the partys populists want to shape and redefine and ultimately remake the party they cant pull this kind of stunt again If the partys leadership wants to actually lead whether within the GOP or in the country at large they cant let this kind of stunt be pulled again Thats the only way in which this pointlessseeming exercise could turn out to have some sort of point If its long remembered by its proponents and their enablers alike as the utter folly that it wasWell give the last word to the ever entertaining like him or not Barney Frank the former longtime Massachusetts congressmanHouse Republicans he muses must be smoking something One of the causes that Ive been pushing is to legalize the smoking of marijuana by adults

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/09/15/222197599/deadly-amoeba-found-for-first-time-in-municipal-water-supply?ft=3&f=,A 4yearold child who died of a rare brain infection in early August has led Louisiana health officials to discover that the cause is lurking in the water pipes of St Bernard Parish southeast of New Orleans Its a type of singlecelled amoeba called Naegleria fowleri about a tenth the width of a human hair Some call it a braineating amoeba although it does its damage by causing a devastating immune reaction rather than by actually devouring brain tissue Officials are pumping more chlorine into the municipal water supply to kill the bugs and advising the parishs 40000 residents how to avoid infection They say the risk is tiny As well discuss shortly its not easy to get infected and drinking the water poses no risk But still finding such a dangerous microbe in the drinking water is troubling and noteworthy This is the first time that it has been found in the drinking water in the United States Louisiana state epidemiologist Raoult Ratard tells Shots But it wont be the last he says  because health officials are now trying to pin down the cause of previously unexplained encephalitis cases About 40 percent of cases of this dangerous brain inflammation have no known cause Five years ago we would never have known that this recent case was caused by the amoeba Ratard says Another new element The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now tests water supplies when a case of amoebic encephalitis is discovered to see where the bug came from For instance in 2011 two Louisiana residents  one a 20yearold man from St Bernard Parish  died of amoebic encephalitis after using tap water to rinse their nasal passages using a popular device called a neti pot Health officials assumed that contaminated tap water was the source of the infection but it was never proved This summer the amoeba infected the brains of two other US children  a 12yearold Florida boy who died and a 12yearold Arkansas girl who survived She may be one of only three known to survive the infection in the United States These alarming deaths are likely to remain rare  but not quite as rare as health officials used to think Were going to see more cases Ratard says Instead of three to five cases of amoebic encephalitis per year across the nation maybe well go to 10 a year he says I dont expect well have a hundred The episode vividly illustrates how humans live in a sea of potentially lethal microbes that amazingly seldom kill In this case its because Naegleria fowleri is only dangerous when it gains entry into the brain It does that when water containing the amoeba gets inhaled very deeply into the area where the roof of the nasal passages meets the floor of the brain To get infected the amoeba has to get to the ceiling of your nose  way way up there Ratard says At the top of the nose you have a little paperthin plate made of bone with a bunch of holes a little bit like a mosquito net The holes are for the olfactory nerve So the amoeba is crawling up the nerve and gets into the brain Drinking amoebacontaminated water poses no risk presumably because the singlecelled organisms cant survive in stomach acid Normal bathing or showering isnt a risk because even if tap water is contaminated it doesnt penetrate into the deepest nasal passages Brain infections from the amoeba usually pop up in late summer when warm water favors its reproduction and many people are diving into ponds to escape the heat Since uncounted numbers of people swim in waters that undoubtedly contain amoebae Ratard says its a wonder there arent more infections Public swimming pools pose no risk because chlorine kills the microbes The child who died last month in St Bernard Parish while visiting from Mississippi had been playing a long time on a SlipnSlide connected to a household water faucet It took about two weeks for the CDC to determine that the child had a Naegleria fowleri infection Then state officials started investigating how We collected the hose and got some samples from the outside faucet water heater and toilet tank water Ratard says After testing verified amoeba contamination Louisiana officials put out a press release about the case Further testing of tap water in four nearby areas revealed the presence of Naegleria fowleri as officials announced on Thursday Understandably the announcement has sparked considerable local anxiety even though health officials have stressed that the risk is low  and can be avoided entirely by commonsense precautions In the old days you would look at your faucet and it wouldnt scare you Ratard says But these days for some people it looks menacing To avoid risk officials are advising people not to put their heads under water while bathing in tap water  and to supervise young children who might Flushing the water from household pipes before filling a childs wading pool decreases the risk although some people might want to add some bleach to the water as an added precaution Local officials have shut off the water at school drinking fountains although its hard to imagine how schoolchildren could inject that water deep into their noses In a couple of weeks officials will retest the St Bernard Parish drinking water to ensure that added chlorine has eliminated the threat  for this season at least Copyright 2014 NPR,20130916,marijuana

dozen people are scheduled to enter a federal courtroom to face charges related to the sale of Ecstasy and other drugs including heroin across Northern California and the country On its face the case appears like any other federal drug sting It was built over four years and began when a man named Michael Lott pulled a silver MercedesBenz into the parking lot of the Hiddenbrooke Golf Club in Vallejo a struggling city about 30 miles from San Francisco and allegedly tried to sell heroin to an undercover agent At the time of his arrest Lott was the selfproclaimed CEO of Thizz Entertainment the rap label started by Andre Hicks the late rapper and mogul widely known as Mac Dre The label once promised to put the Bay Area hiphop scene on the map bringing with it a tightknit group of rappers from the Crest a workingclass neighborhood in Vallejo notorious for drugs and gang violence Hicks crew helped popularize the Bay Area brand of partycentric hiphop music called hyphy launching rappers to major record stores and MTV But Hicks was killed his violent death left unsolved And now a decade of law enforcement scrutiny has cemented the fate of the independent label and the Bay Area rappers who once aspired to mainstream success For police the record labels dramatic decline was predicted by listening to the music Over two decades Hicks and his rapping associates virtually taunted law enforcement Amid the rising popularity of gangster rap prosecutors increasingly mined its lyrics for evidence in criminal matters In 1990 prosecutors tried three members of 2 Live Crew on obscenity charges after a lurid performance at a Florida nightclub Prosecutors used Snoop Doggs Murder Was the Case during the rappers 1996 murder trial The rappers were acquitted in both cases In 1992 some of Hicks songs released through his own Romper Room Records label implicated him in a series of robberies associated with the Crests Romper Room Gang Although Hicks friends claimed the rapper was never an active participant in the crimes he and two others were arrested and sent to federal prison Hicks served five years  Upon his release Hicks quit rapping about robbery and moved on to partying He dubbed his new entertainment company Thizz a slang word for Ecstasy The new inyourface branding caught on quickly and gave police a reason to keep following Hicks career It was only a matter of time they surmised before theyd catch the Thizz crew with the real thing They were all rap artists first  they had some pretty big names on that label said Sacramento County sheriffs Detective Brad Rose who helped crack the case But those drugs are highly profitable Federal authorities would highlight the Thizz Entertainment connections when they announced their big takedown in April 2012 But in the end hundreds of pages of court records reveal that most of the people arrested in the operation had no connection to the label A few were Thizz rappers and friends from the Crest Michael Lott was not in fact CEO of the company Hicks mother said And as a businessman and a drug dealer he was pretty much a failure Vallejos Musical Roots During the heyday of funk in the 1970s international stars like Con Funk Shun and Sly Stone had connections to Vallejo and its Crest neighborhood We always have been a neighborhood where we get down with each other We come from a city that has nothing said Jamal Rocker a Vallejoborn rapper known as Mac Mall and a contemporary of Hicks Like when you hear the word cuddie it means cousin and friend Even cutthroat thats a term of endearment Both Macs  Mac Dre and Mac Mall  are named in honor of one of the areas first musical successes Michael The Mac Robinson a rapper with a pimp persona who was shot and killed in Vallejo in 1991 According to Rocker Robinson provided the mold for many kids from the Crest  it all started with Michael Robinson  and fondly remembers once getting a ride in Robinsons white Cadillac where there was so much bass I could barely breathe  It was within that small world in the mid90s that a group of around a dozen kids who grew up together became known as the Romper Room crew first for general neighborhood mischief and then later as a criminal enterprise  The core group consisted of Jamal Diggs JDiggs Simon Curtis Nelson Kilo Curt Andre Cawthorne Dre from the Bay Troy Reddick Coolio DaUndaDogg and Hicks Hicks lean and outgoing had been known as a rising star from a young age making waves with a cassette tape featuring a standout single Too Hard for the Fin Radio in 1989 as a student at Hogan High School His flow was fast and confident and he built upon the bouncy bass that had its roots in the funk era   But by that time some of Hicks friends and collaborators had begun robbing banks Vallejo police began focusing on the Crest with newfound intensity and as they struggled to solve the crimes Hicks rapped about it In one song Hicks described a harrowing credit union robbery In another song which he dedicated to Vallejo police Detective Dave McGraw Hicks taunted the department Punk police what a onetrack mind man you cant even find whos been robbin you blind   In 1992 Hicks already had several arrests under his belt for assault and weapons possession when the department and federal authorities decided to follow him a wired confidential informant and two fellow rappers Diggs and Nelson to Fresno where Hicks recently had performed with Ice Cube For two days more than 35 officers and FBI agents trailed the friends as they picked up girls shopped for sneakers and purchased deodorant at WalMart On the first day surveillance agents said the group cased a downtown Bank of America by driving in circles around the block The friends parked an extra car nearby Agents suspected they would use it later for their getaway After a late night of playing dice with several women in their motel rooms Hicks stayed behind as Diggs and Nelson returned to the bank according to the surveillance notes But authorities had not been careful A television news crew monitoring police radio traffic had heard officers as they prepared to disrupt the heist As surveillance agents watched Diggs and Nelson park the car and take out masks a news van arrived Spooked by the cameras the two sped back to the motel for Hicks and headed home Police pulled them over two hours later on a deserted stretch of road somewhere near Los Banos Prosecutors charged Diggs and Nelson with attempted robbery and Hicks with conspiracy They dubbed Hicks the ringleader and played some of his songs in the courtroom to bolster their case They were bragging about it on a rap CD Lt JoAnn West said at a Vallejo Police Department news conference at the time Its kind of brazen for them to brag about it as though they were untouchable Agents claimed the trio was responsible for 13 robberies alleging that proceeds from the crimes netted 15 million In a pattern that would continue after Hicks death police sought to tie his success as a rapper to criminal enterprise While it never was proven police went on the record with statements alleging that the heists paid for Hicks studio time Friends and fellow musicians disputed allegations that Hicks had anything to do with the heists Still he refused to implicate anyone else and did the time  and was celebrated for it As Hicks grew in popularity he brought his friends  lesspopular performers like Michael Miami the Most Lott  along for the ride Long after his death in 2004 they remained loyal devotees Parking Lot Meetings In August 2009 Brian Nehring an undercover agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration called Lott to set up a buy Surveillance agents in nearby cars watched as Lott arrived in a silver MercedesBenz and greeted Nehring He handed him a plasticwrapped Kilo Curt CD and Mac Dre DVD from his Thizz label  on the house Lott a muscular man with goldplated teeth didnt know much about Nehring Their relationship consisted of intermittent drug sales in and around gas stations and parking lots near the Crest where Lott had grown up After their first meeting  a confidential informant for the DEA introduced them  Nehring appeared to conduct his business with Lott alone Hed call him with requests and pay in cash  6400 for seven ounces of cocaine base 4400 for 600 Ecstasy pills  Nehring on the other hand knew a lot about Lott In addition to the shared intelligence from Vallejo police who had long known Lott as a member of Hicks crew Lott continually bragged to Nehring about his connections to Thizz  During a meeting in January 2009 Lott had told Nehring that he neednt be wary of him he was well known worldwide as Miami the Most the famous rapper and music executive He told him about his appearances on Jamie Foxxs radio show and in a BET documentary about the Romper Room crew He claimed to have been best friends with Hicks Thizz Entertainments founder according to the agents notes   In fact Lott bragged on this particular August day the silver Mercedes he had driven to meet Nehring once belonged to Hicks  Lott handed Nehring 189 grams of heroin and Nehring paid him 5200 Over a nearly twoyear period he would pay Lott 100000 more Lott told friends and acquaintances that he owed his success to Hicks and Thizz he was busy in the music studio and he entertained visitors at his upscale Hiddenbrooke home But Lott was not the man Nehring described in his notes In subsequent months the selfproclaimed mogul would be evicted from his house after he failed to pay nearly a years worth of rent Hed find himself without a car Hed bury his friend and Ecstasy supplier Marico Whitemon who was shot dead outside a liquor store at the entrance to the Crest A man accused of killing Whitemon a smalltime marijuana dealer would walk away unscathed And friends and former associates said the status Lott claimed to have  as a successful music executive  fell away Birth Of A Record Label  After the Romper Room arrests in 1992 the prison time could have crushed Hicks upandcoming career but he capitalized on the attention Longtime Bay Area hiphop producer Khayree recorded new raps from Hicks over the phone from inside prison releasing another album on cassette while Hicks remained behind bars In addition to the 599 recording the duo also sold 10 Tshirts and 12 caps  They try to keep me down keep me in a ditch but the only thing they doin is makin me rich Hicks rapped Eventually Hicks decided to give himself some distance from the Romper Room Gang In 1999 Hicks Nelson and a San Rafaelbased distributor called City Hall Records formed a new record label Thizz Entertainment Hicks gained a diverse following selling thousands of CDs in places like France South Africa even rural parts of the United States One of his largest contributions to the new reigning hiphop vernacular and crossover scene was the same word he gave to his record label thizz Already emerging as a more popular street drug Hicks popularized the word and the experience transforming the tone of the local hiphop scene from hard and gangster to more wild fun and carefree He really was on Ecstasy pills and thizzing said Reddick also known as Coolio DaUndaDogg an original member of the Romper Room crew who produced and rapped with Hicks Hiphop journalist Davey D said it was less a paean to the experience of taking Ecstasy than part of Hicks character The rapper was famous for his thizz face  a variant on funk face or gas face It has that double meaning that the music is so nasty you gotta squint your face Davey D said A Sudden Blow  In November 2004 hyphys rise and the accompanying rise in all things Thizz was dealt a shocking setback  Hicks had just left his concert in Kansas City Mo when a car pulled up alongside his van  driven by Major Norton a Thizz rapper known as Dubee who is also a codefendant in the current drug ring case  and opened fire Police who never solved the crime found Hicks bullettorn body alongside the vehicle  For a brief period Hicks death reinvigorated the hyphy movement and he became its largerthanlife symbol Tattoos decals shirts and more bearing his likeness proliferated Diggs wore a gigantic Mac Dre chain around his neck Lott began driving a black Hummer with Hicks face on the side His birthday July 5 became known as Dre Day an annual holiday that drew hundreds to the Crest When MTV showed up to film a special about hyphy in 2007 the stars gave respect to Hicks calling him the grandfather of hyphy  Hicks label Thizz Entertainment immediately pivoted upon his passing The labels leaders accelerated plans to spin off the distribution arm Thizz Nation Hicks mother Wanda Salvatto took control of Thizz Entertainment as a way of controlling his large musical catalog  overnight Thizz Entertainment transformed from an active record label to the estate of Mac Dre Under new leadership Thizz Nation expanded Imprints such as Thizz Latin launched and Nelson also known as Kilo Curt recruited many from the Crest to record under the Thizz umbrella  Mac Dre kept the Bay Area rap scene alive for years after his death said Walter Zelnick vice president of distribution for City Hall Records which had invested in Thizz Entertainment But Nelson signed too many people to his label Some of them did well most didnt Ecstasy Finds New Market As hyphy caught on local authorities began to notice a steady uptick in the drugs streetlevel sales It used to be real popular with the rave clubs and then it became more widespread on the streets said Capt Ken Weaver of the Vallejo Police Department It became the drug choice of the rappers They started singing about it in their lyrics In Vallejo detectives already believed some Thizz rappers had made the transition from rapping about Ecstasy to selling it They kept their eyes on the Crest and the rappers latest releases  Their big break came in 2008 when Steve Davison a Thizz rapper known as PSD was caught at the Sacramento airport with 6000 Ecstasy pills hidden in his pants Nehring the undercover agent was called to the scene  At the time Vallejo detectives already were following Lott and other Thizz associates Authorities said Davisons arrest confirmed their suspicions They began working with the DEA and other agencies on an undercover operation that extended as far as Wisconsin Using a confidential informant Nehring got an introduction to Lott as a potential customer in August 2008 Soon he and Lott began meeting and talking regularly on the phone to schedule drug transactions with agents monitoring the rapper and his associates many who still lived in the Crest and other Vallejo neighborhoods Over the next two years Lott unknowingly led the DEA into the heart of the local drug operation in which he played the role of disorganized middleman During their second meeting Lott went inside his friends apartment complex and returned with 400 Ecstasy pills which he sold to Nehring for 1600 in cash The pills turned out to be a mixture of caffeine and dextromethorphan a cough suppressant according to court records Later Lott called Nehring and told him that if he was dissatisfied with the quality of the pills he would provide a full refund because he wished to keep my future business Nehring wrote in his report But Nehring did not ask for a refund and continued placing orders soon over the phone Surveillance agents recorded Lott as he often scrambled to deliver calling various connections until he found someone who could meet Nehrings needs After Nehring placed an order for 4000 tablets agents intercepted Lott making a series of harried phone calls hoping to find a supplier on short notice He found Nicholas White Boy Nick Ramirez an alleged Ecstasy dealer from the neighboring Vallejo suburb American Canyon according to authorities Ramirez made frequent trips to Vallejo Houston Las Vegas and Atlanta and had his girlfriend ship giftwrapped packages containing marijuana and Ecstasy to addresses in Oklahoma and New York according to court records Ramirez had no hiphop credentials Nor did Ung Duong charged with supplying Ramirez and ultimately Lott with the Ecstasy Lott sold to the undercover agent Ramirezs alleged associate Frank Alioto a descendant of a former San Francisco mayor was producing hiphop records at the time of his arrest But Aliotos former label Wash House Records had no connection to Thizz Entertainment Yet upon announcing the arrests authorities highlighted Lotts selfproclaimed status as Thizz Entertainments chief executive Listed among the 25 defendants preparing to go trial Lott is No 1 Separating The Music After the arrests Hicks mother and business partners immediately sought to distance the label from Lott  It was quite upsetting I was pretty shocked said Zelnick the City Hall Records vice president When I saw Miami on the list and they said he was CEO of Thizz I just couldnt believe it Hes a character he makes a lot of claims but hes definitely not CEO  Although Lott ran his own Thizz imprint rap music fans said they hadnt seen new music from the rapper in years Law enforcement officials according to Thizz spokesman and producer Jay King have their facts wrong This isnt rocket science It just takes somebody doing a little bit of police work and a little bit of investigation to recognize these are kids that are just calling themselves Thizz Entertainment because everyone wants to be associated with Mac Dre he said You see a bunch of guys who dress up as Elvis Presley But are they Elvis Thizz has only one artist and his name is Andre Hicks Anybody else using the name Thizz is just using it arbitrarily without merit and without authorization or permission While Lott bragged about his connections to fame and fortune in the small city of Vallejo others knew the Thizz Entertainment craze and Lotts stake in it was largely over  Vallejo is not a huge city so everybody knows everybody said Earlissa Ellis whose boyfriend codefendant Eric Robinson is charged with supplying heroin to Lott The two grew up together in the Crest Thizz wasnt doing a whole lot of entertainment from what I was seeing  Lott had claimed to own his own house but court records show a series of evictions from various homes throughout Vallejo Among Solano County landlords Lott was considered a scam artist a serial renter who would pay one months rent and squat in the house until a judge ordered him out He and his wife had trashed the Hiddenbrooke home on a serene street overlooking the Vallejo hills before they were forced to move on in the summer of 2011 leaving thousands of dollars worth of damage and angry neighbors  Garbage maggots it was gross Disgusting said Nicole Cheverier property manager at Vallejo Realty Management from which Lott rented one of his homes in 2008 I was scared to deliver the eviction notice so I had two officers come with me According to Ellis the family moved into a downtown motel Lott and his family did not respond to a request for comment  By the time federal authorities went public in April 2012 Lott had disappeared He was found seven months later in Las Vegas Its unfortunate him getting into the narcotics business said Nelson who is still producing Thizz Nation albums We work so hard We friends But to come to 2012 and be labeled a drug label its a bad taste in my mouth We maybe should have monitored a little bit As the court case inches through the system the Crests musical future remains uncertain According to Zelnick Thizz Nation and Thizz Entertainments output has slowed to a trickle Even their upcoming works like a documentary on Thizz are about memorializing the past rather than moving toward the future Were still looking for the next Mac Dre Zelnick said Copyright 2014 NPR,20130910,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2013/08/25/214133469/a-guide-to-the-nations-most-vulnerable-governors?ft=3&f=,If youre looking for the most interesting gubernatorial races to watch in the coming year the nations biggest states are a good place to start Democrats Jerry Brown and Andrew Cuomo look like safe bets for reelection in California and New York respectively And despite the pending retirement of Rick Perry Republicans are confident of maintaining their hold on the governors mansion in Texas But Florida Pennsylvania and Illinois all feature embattled incumbents whose reelection campaigns will easily cost tens of millions of dollars Michigan GOP Gov Rick Snyder could also face a real contest In all 36 states will be voting for governor in 2014 All but a handful will feature incumbents favored for reelection Two states are holding gubernatorial contests this year New Jersey Republican Chris Christie is considered close to a lock for a second term while the open race in Virginia between Republican Ken Cuccinelli and Democrat Terry McAuliffe remains a tossup With no discernible wave as yet looking likely to break in favor of one party or the other next year the overall partisan breakdown  currently favoring the GOP by 30 to 20  is not likely to change terribly much Each contest matters however Within each state the governor is the main political actor and can largely set the agenda as he or she sees fit Heres a look at a few of the races that will bear watching Connecticut Democrat Dan Malloy Winning percentage in 2010 50 Obamas percentage in 2012 58 Like presidents governors get too much credit when the economy is good and too much blame when its bad But when your state ranks 50th among states in economic growth two years running you know youre going to be in trouble Malloy compounded the economic unhappiness in Connecticut by signing into law the largest tax increase in state history during his first year in office The result has been approval ratings south of 50 percent throughout his tenure in office Voters say he does have strong leadership qualities no doubt due to his handling of Superstorm Sandy and Newtown says Douglas Schwartz director of the Quinnipiac University Poll But when it comes to breadandbutter issues like the economy and taxes people are not happy with the way Malloy has handled those things Malloy may face a rematch with Tom Foley a businessman and former ambassador whom he defeated by less than a percentage point in 2010 Foleys possible rivals for the GOP nomination state Sen John McKinney and Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton Foleys running mate last time around are expected to seek public financing and thus wont be able to match Foleys campaign treasury But the eventual GOP nominee may matter less than Malloy himself The good news about being the incumbent is youve got 99 percent name recognition says Matthew Hennessy a Democratic consultant in Hartford The bad news is if youre at 99 percent name recognition and you still cant get a positive rating about the job youve done that allows your opponent to make the election about you Florida Republican Rick Scott Winning percentage in 2010 49 percent Obamas percentage in 2012 50 percent Like some other Republican governors Scott has moderated his image a bit since the start of his term One example He agreed to accept federal dollars for the Medicaid expansion planned under the Affordable Care Act although he couldnt get that idea past the legislature Scott has also benefited from a boost in jobs on his watch  more than 300000 in total bringing the states unemployment rate down below the national average His mantra from day one has been jobs jobs jobs says former GOP state legislator Pete Dunbar Unemployment has dropped and hes delivered on those promises On the other hand Democrats point out that Scott failed to push through the Medicaid expansion and turned down billions more by refusing a federal highspeed rail project They gleefully point out the large number of his staff and appointees who have been forced to step down including the lieutenant governor Scott remains vulnerable in a purple state  one where Democratic turnout certain to drop off from 2012 could be boosted some by a likely medical marijuana initiative as well as anger on the left over the states voting restrictions and stand your ground law Democrats havent settled on a candidate Alex Sink defeated by Scott four years ago by a percentage point might run again So might Charlie Crist He preceded Scott as the Republican governor of Florida ran for Senate in 2010 as an independent and has since become a Democrat Needless to say activists in both parties are wary of him But he has the name recognition and fundraising ability to potentially match the wealthy Scott who has long since begun aggressively courting donations Crists famously tanned visage is already plastered all over the state on billboards nominally to advertise the law firm he now works for Illinois Democrat Pat Quinn Winning percentage in 2010 47 Obamas percentage in 2012 57 Quinn barely won last time around Hes only gotten more unpopular since Still Republicans arent ready to write off his chances in a blue state Hes made a whole career out of being underestimated by the opposition says Dennis Culloton a GOP media strategist What he might lack in polish or financing hell make up in hustle Illinois has the worst budget problems of any state including the nations most underfunded pension plan Quinn is openly disliked by nearly every other top Democrat in the state and faces a primary challenge from William Daley a former White House chief of staff On the face of it it looks like hes toast says Christopher Mooney director of the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois It looks like theres no way this guy can get reelected But the Republican cause last time was hurt by a bitter primary fight That could happen again with multiple candidates looking to overcome venture capitalist Bruce Rauners financial advantage Quinn has already gotten lucky in not having to face state Attorney General Lisa Madigan She would have been a tougher primary opponent than Daley whose name carries baggage outside of Chicago where both his father and brother were longtime mayors And Quinn might yet get a pension deal Quinn took away legislators pay through a lineitem veto until they agree to an overhaul which may not be likely but could happen If it does Quinn will get credit for forcing the issue through a move that has played well as part of his overall populist Im for the little guy persona It was a political stroke of genius even though in the long run it will hurt him among legislators Mooney says If now they get this deal done then all of a sudden Quinn can say I put the hammer down Then hes got something done Maine Republican Paul LePage Winning percentage in 2010 38 Obamas percentage in 2012 56 On Tuesday LePage denied reports that he told a group of GOP lawmakers and donors that President Obama hates white people The episode was in keeping with a long series of outrageous statements from the governor a habit that has alienated both Republicans and Democrats You just cant have the leader of the state embarrassing people and hes certainly crossed that threshold says Ben Grant who chairs the Maine Democratic Party Obama has won Maine easily in each of the last two elections and the Democrats took back control of both legislative chambers last fall Still LePage has a plausible reelection scenario available to him He barely won last time thanks to a split vote Eliot Cutler the independent who nearly beat LePage last time is running again Rep Mike Michaud the likely Democratic nominee is going to argue that any vote for Cutler is going to be a vote for LePage LePage maintains a bedrock base of support and will almost certainly win a percentage similar to his 2010 total which triggered bumper stickers around Maine saying 61 percent  an allusion to the percentage of the state that voted for someone other than him depending on how you round the totals Hes been able to accomplish much of what he wanted notably in terms of cutting spending despite now having to share power with Democrats That means the big question in the race is whether Michaud can reach out to independent voters  of which Maine has plenty  and convince them that supporting Cutler a second time is tantamount to handing LePage four more years in power says Mark Brewer a University of Maine political scientist I would argue that LePages reelection chances were in trouble from the minute he took the oath of office because of how he won that election Brewer says Pennsylvania Republican Tom Corbett Winning percentage in 2010 54 Obamas percentage in 2012 52 Pennsylvania has long been the perfect swing state when it comes to gubernatorial elections Since 1954 power has changed hands between the parties every eight years Its still the GOPs turn but it looks increasingly like Corbett might break the streak His approval ratings remain stuck in the low 30s  neardeath numbers  and every national prognosticator seems to think hes the most likely incumbent to lose next year Corbett who inherited a 42 billion deficit and refused to raise taxes was forced to make deep cuts to some of the most popular programs in the state including aid to both K12 schools and higher education A longtime former prosecutor hes struggled to make the switch to a smooth politician able to put the best gloss on what hes doing says Terry Madonna a pollster at Franklin  Marshall College He recommended steep cuts but he never offered a sufficient rationale to voters about what he was doing and why he was doing it Madonna says Corbett hasnt been able to convince a Republican legislature to go along with his main priorities including a transportation package privatization of the states liquor stores and a pension overhaul Theres talk that hell be challenged in next years primary although so far its just talk Democrats have a crowded field of their own including state Treasurer Rob McCord and Rep Allyson Schwartz Whoever emerges will be favored to end Corbetts tenure and with it one of the longest unbroken streaks in American politics Copyright 2014 NPR,20130825,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2013/08/20/213790881/the-dream-9-pushes-the-envelope-and-their-allies-buttons?ft=3&f=,The national conversation around immigration has shifted dramatically over the past decade Thats in large part because of activists who have pushed to change the narrative around the undocumented If you asked your typical soccer mom what she thought of an unauthorized immigrant she says Well I think of Mexicans running across the border on Fox News  said Tamar Jacoby who runs ImmigrationWorks USA a think tank that advocates for changes to immigration law Back in the midaughts people pushing for an overhaul of immigration laws held largescale rallies that Jacoby said probably turned off lots of Republican voters Jacoby is herself a Republican Thats why I want them to fix it  not because were going to get credit for fixing it but because we want to be able to talk to Latino voters about other stuff she says Now Jacoby says many people think of undocumented young people much more sympathetically as hardworking highschoolvaledictorian types who cant get financial aid for college because of their lack of official status Not coincidentally she said the push to overhaul immigration laws that was moribund just a decade ago has the kind of momentum that suggests some kind of reform might well happen You can hear this shift even in the criticism of immigration reform Consider Iowa Rep Steve Kings attempt to block what he considers amnesty by nudging the characterization of unauthorized young people back in the other older direction For every one whos a valedictorian theres another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds and theyve got calves the size of cantaloupes because theyre hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert A lot of that shift is due to the dreamers the young people who have campaigned and organized around the DREAM Act The proposed legislation would create a pathway for citizenship for potentially millions of young people who were brought to the US as small children theyre culturally American but dont have the benefits that come with legal status or citizenship like the ability to work or apply for financial aid for college The dreamers have enjoyed broad public support President Obama even obliquely referenced them in his second presidential acceptance speech But Jacoby says that support for the dreamers might change if people start to think of DREAMers as activists  that is as agitators as opposed to ideal youth All of which brings us to the Dream 9 Theyre a group of Mexican nationals raised in the US who selfdeported to Mexico Once on the Mexican side they attempted to reenter the US by seeking political asylum They were taken into custody by authorities and once detained staged a hunger strike to draw attention to their cause They say goals were twofold to draw attention to the limbo that young people like them are stuck in and to bring fresh scrutiny to the Obama administrations steady stream of deportations The nine were eventually granted release from detention and will await a decision from a judge on their asylum petitions a process that could take years But their actions have stirred criticism from allies and political opponents alike A growing number of critics say their approach is counterproductive to their goals if not outright dangerous What we ought to be talking  about is the politics in the House and the Republican Party David Leopold an immigration attorney and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association told PRI Leopold said he supports the Dream 9 if not their approach But instead our focus is on this action so it pulls away attention from the big issue which is fixing the system so 11 million can get out of the shadows Leopold pointed to the practical risks of following in the Dream 9s footsteps Once youve left the US its very hard to get back in if you dont have the proper documentation Any other people attempting to mimic the nine arent likely to be as lucky because asylum claims are a long shot As Muzaffar Chishti of the Migration Policy Institute told me last week only 29 percent of asylum claims are granted each year but the number of petitions granted to people from Mexico is even smaller  just 2 percent The odds against asylum petitioners succeeding are kind of high Chishti said But the Dream 9 are now kind of celebrities They were clearly given extra consideration in their credible fear determination Even Luis Gutierrez a congressman from Illinois who has been an outspoken supporter of efforts to overhaul immigration laws said he disagreed with the 9s tactics I do not agree with the actions taken by the Dream 9 because current immigration law is not on their side he told the Daily Beast One of Gutierrezs aides said that the Dream 9s most vocal backers are hardliners who are opposed to compromising on any immigration legislation Gutierrez is an unlikely critic He was arrested in 2010 and 2011 for protesting the Obama administrations policies toward unauthorized immigrants and he enjoys significant street cred on immigration So if Gutierrez wasnt totally on board might the Dream 9 have overstepped Or you could ask another question altogether Arent activists kind of supposed to upset the apple cart I asked Kelly Cogswell an organizer with the Lesbian Avengers which performed directaction events that used to rankle less radical LGBTQ organizations As soon as you start to make any positive progress you get people from the center saying Tone it down were making progress  she says Its hard to keep pushing when you have your allies attacking you But she adds political movements are messy and disorganized with lots of different voices and players I dont think it hurts the compromisers to have more people out there who are more radical Cogswell says I think it gives them more room to maneuver In other words the compromisers get to compromise from further ahead when the conversations start further from the baseline status quo After a while its not about going too far but about going along in the right direction she says adding that any broad political effort needs lots of people trying different approaches With some historical distance we tend to think of the civil rights movement as a unified front and not as a host of different groups with different tactics who often bristled at and beefed with each other That was an idea echoed by Jacoby who compared the push for immigration changes to a concert orchestra The Dream 9 she says is kind of like the guy coming in with the triangle  a small but essential part of the larger effort My view is that we need a little bit of everything  in limits If the whole debate had the tenor of the Dream 9 Id be worried Copyright 2014 NPR,20130820,marijuana

Well my name is Tanya Hillph from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe I lost nine grandchildren through the Department of Social ServicesDELORES HIPINTS My name is Delores Hipintsph I am from Cheyenne River Sioux tribe Ive got two grandchildren in the systemLIZ GUGLI Im Liz Liz Gugliph I have nine grandchildren two of which were taken by DSSWESTILA CUPIWIN My name is Westila Cupiwinph I come from the Mnikhowozu band I had a grandchild and I havent seen him  well he was like 4 years old Hes 16 nowSULLIVAN These families want their grandsons and granddaughters nieces nephews their children And federal law says they should have them Poverty crime and alcoholism are real problems in South Dakotas poorest areas Still federal law says that except in the rarest cases Indian kids must be placed with relatives tribal members or at the very least other Native Americans But in South Dakota thats not happeningAn NPR investigation has found that every year the state is removing roughly 700 Indian children some in questionable circumstances At the same time they have largely failed to place them with family or their tribes In South Dakota nine out of 10 Native kids in foster care are in nonNative homes or group care according to state recordsState officials say theyre doing everything they can to keep Native families together But theres another powerful force at work too money Well talk in a minute about how the federal government sends the state thousands of dollars for every child it takes Four of those children were Janice Howes grandkidsHi Are you JaniceJANICE HOWE Im JaniceSULLIVAN Im Laura Its nice to see youHowe lives on one of the many dirt roads of the Crow Creek Indian Reservation where the dust blows on the window frames of simple houses People here are poor in the way few Americans are poor Theres electricity when you can pay the bill Howe turns a chair to cover a hole in the unpainted wallHOWE Im the eldest of nine kids and I got my bachelors degree in nursingSULLIVAN Her sister lives across the street her parents across the road her daughter two doors down with her two granddaughters and two twin grandbabies A tightknit family At least they were until one afternoon two years ago when Janice Howes phone rangHOWE She said you dont know me but  she said  I work for the Department of Social Services And Im calling you in reference to your daughter Erin Yellow Robe And I said whats going on And she says your daughter is going to be arrested for drugs And I said drugsSULLIVAN Howe wondered could there be something she missed Shed never seen any sign of drugs Then the social worker changed Howes lifeHOWE And she said we need to come and take the kidsSULLIVAN Early the next morning a car pulled up out front Howes daughter wouldnt let go of the babies She kept saying she hadnt done anything wrong Howe could barely watchHOWE I seen them pull up and I seen them go in And then I seen them bringing them outSULLIVAN Outside the babies were calmHOWE They were sitting in them cars and they were just looking at me like  most babies they dont cry if theyre raised in a secure environment So I went out there and I took their diaper bags and stuff out there And I was just crying and they leftSULLIVAN But as Janice Howe watched the car pull around the bend something occurred to her The social worker took the two babies but she said Howe could keep her two granddaughters 5yearold Rashauna and 6yearold AntoinetteHOWE I thought that was weird I just thought why cant I just keep them allSULLIVAN The babies were driven to a white foster family a hundred miles away At home Janice Howe and her daughter sat on the steps and cried as they waited for the police to come to take her daughter to jail The hours went byHOWE And no one ever cameSULLIVAN A week went by a month nothing The summer turned into fallHOWE No one ever cameSULLIVAN Howes daughter Erin Yellow Robe has never been arrested for drugs or anything else Social service officials say they cant talk about individual cases But one source who has reviewed the departments file said the social worker believed Yellow Robe was abusing her prescription pills But the file also says the case was based on a rumor from a woman who it turns out didnt like the Howe familyAnd yet not only did they take the two babies two months later Janice Howe waited at the school bus stop But the girls werent on it A social worker had taken them from schoolHOWE I felt like oh my God Its happening again They didnt even call and tell me Nothing NothingSullivan introduces other characters to add anecdotal support for the allegation of largescale state abuse This is a key onePETER LENGKEEK It enrages me Cousins are disappearing and family members are disappearing Were very tightknit families here This breaks my heartSULLIVAN Peter Lengkeek is a Crow Creek tribal council member This tribe has lost more than 33 children in years an astounding number for a reservation with only 1400 people Every one was placed in a white foster homeLENGKEEK If the state had their way wed still be playing cowboys and Indians I couldnt imagine what they tell these kids about where they come from and who they are Its kidnappingthats how we see itState officials finally get their chance to respondVIRGENA WIESELER We come from a stance of safety Thats our overarching goal with all childrenSULLIVAN Virgena Wieseler runs a division of the Department of Social Services an hour away in Pierre She says the department believes in the Indian Child Welfare Act and does its best to place as many Native American children with relatives or tribal members as it can findWIESELER If they can be returned to their parent or returned to a relative and they can be safe then thats our goalSULLIVAN Officials say theyre dealing with abject poverty and substance abuse and they have to do whats best for the kids Rysdon is the departments secretary And she says whats best often means driving onto a reservation and taking a childKIM MALSAMRYSDON Of course we think its legal or we wouldnt be doing itSULLIVAN MalsamRysdon says state law supports that But federal law says tribes are sovereign and two South Dakota judges two lawyers and a dozen tribal advocates told NPR a state official cant drive off with an Indian child from Crow Creek any more than a Crow Creek official could drive off with a child from Rapid CityThe allegation of a cultural bias at work is made most clearly in this excerptSULLIVAN Without question some children in South Dakota need to be removed from their families But according to state figures less than 12 percent of the children in foster care in South Dakota have been actually physically or sexually abused Thats less than the national average And yet South Dakota is removing children at almost three times the rate of other states according to the National Coalition for Child Protection ReformTo understand how thats possible how the state can remove Janice Howes four grandchildren and more than 700 other Native kids every year you have to understand one word neglect The state says parents have neglected their children and neglect is subjectiveBOB WALTERS The standards are set too high for our peopleSULLIVAN Bob Walters is a council member for the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe He says what social workers call neglect is often poverty and sometimes Native traditionWALTERS Were family people If theres 30 people in my home thats fine I was raised with my mom and dad and 12 kids Im very thankful I grew up that waySULLIVAN He says social workers are often young and many have never set foot on a reservation He says they dont understand that food is often shared among families State officials acknowledge that only 11 of their 183 caseworkers are Native American But officials say they do yearly training to expose workers to Native practicesSometimes though its not just cultural differences Jolene Abourezk worked for the department for seven years She says taking kids was expectedJOLENE ABOUREZK Its just the norm here that it happens so often people dont question it  like good you are doing a good job for taking more kids in Its just the way its been and it continues to be that wayJanice Howe the grandmother in the opening anecdote surfaces throughout the story serving as a thread that ties it together Part One then closes with an affecting scene of her with her reunited grandchildren bringing the narrative arc to an endSOUNDBITE OF CHILDREN SINGINGSULLIVAN Janice Howe now runs a support group in a church for families that have lost children to foster care On this night 48 people showed up to talk and exchange stories In front Antoinette and Rashauna played Usually when NPR producer Amy Walters and I would visit they would hide They later explained that like their mother they are scared of white people and do not want to talk to them But on this day they drew closer Rashauna took the final step and pointed out a pair of radio headphonesRASHAUNA YELLOW ROBE Can I try them onSULLIVAN They held the microphone up to each otherANTOINETTE YELLOW ROBE Whats your nameRASHAUNA YELLOW ROBE RashaunaANTOINETTE YELLOW ROBE UhuhRASHAUNA YELLOW ROBE I mean unintelligibleSULLIVAN Janice Howe leaned in and quietly asked them what was it like in foster care Rashauna looked up at herRASHAUNA YELLOW ROBE I thought we were going to stay there foreverSULLIVAN And then suddenly Antoinette blurts out a story about how Rashauna wet her pants and the foster parents made her wear the underwear on her headANTOINETTE YELLOW ROBE Whenever Rashauna wet her pants they put underwear on their head  the ones that she peed in on their headSULLIVAN Janice Howe looked away so they wouldnt see her eyes fill with tears Rashauna climbed into her lap As the singing started they slowly swayed knowing that even now Social Services can come back Even now at any time they can take the childrenLaura Sullivan NPR NewsIt doesnt get much more powerful than that I was both moved by the personal stories and enraged by the states actions the first time I listened to the story Having been largely raised in the Jim Crow South I have experienced hypocrisy and racism first handBut thenWell to use a storytelling technique lets set aside the anecdotal story of Howe for a moment and look at the bigger allegation of largescale forced removal of Indian children That is what gives the series importance from a policy perspective not just as a human interest storyCondensing from the above here is the storys caseBlock opens by framing the removals as a disturbing pattern in which the state is taking Indian children at 35 times the rate of white children Sullivan says that this amounts to roughly 700 Native American children a year some in questionable circumstances The some is a rare note of restraint in a series that otherwise unmistakably alleges that the abuse is widespread and is motivated at least in part to obtain federal funds There are thousands of them says Sullivan as she presents a series of grandmothers with grandchildren who were taken away South Dakotas removal rate is almost three times that of other states Sullivan says Families arent being notified as social workers are merely driving on to reservations and taking children  kidnapping a tribal leader calls it The Howe case and other anecdotes indicate that the states purported reasons for removing the children arent true Only 12 percent of the states foster children were removed from their families after having been physically or sexually abused  lower than the national average Thus while foster care is indeed sometimes justified Sullivan notes she says that deciding what constitutes neglect is subjective to which a tribal leader says that the state often mistakes poverty for neglect A former state social worker then drops the hammer She says that its just the norm for social workers to take Indian children from their familiesAn attempted expose comes through clearly Both Block and Sullivan refer to NPRs investigation and Sullivan says what it has found What I hear  and what advocates prizegivers and listeners who have written me hear  is a clear allegation that the state is willfully taking Indian children from their families on a large and unjustified scale This picture is colored in for 23 minutes on All Things Considered an extraordinary block of valuable terrain on NPRs signature afternoon showWhich leads to its own question How true really is the allegation Lets look at the evidenceFirst there is this factual error The comparison among states is both wrong and wrongly presented Sullivan cited as a source the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform This is a small group that advocates for keeping families intact and is critical of foster care in general We should have been told this about the group so that we can better judge its information but we werent Still the groups statistics taken from the federal government appear to be reliableI first heard Sullivans statement  South Dakota is removing children at almost three times the rate of other states  to mean that it was three times the rate of all other states making it a lone outlier It isnt South Dakota was fourth or third highest in removal rates among states depending on whether the ranking is for all children under 18 or impoverished children under 18 according to the advocacy group One can find a few other states in the groups rankings for which South Dakota has a rate three times higher but then we should have been told which onesSullivans comparison with other states meanwhile repeats a critical flaw that I will discuss in greater depth in Chapter 4 The advocacy groups rankings are for all foster children not just Indians Sullivan however never alerts us to this shift in what is being measured She did not explicitly say that the rankings were for all children She also did not indicate what the ranking for just South Dakota Indians might beAdditionally any comparison among states demands context By all accounts foster care is strongly correlated to poverty US Census Bureau data shows that Native Americans nationally have the highest poverty rate among races and Hispanics South Dakotas population is third among states in its percentage of Native Americans Ergo South Dakotas high ranking in removals is consistent with its high percentage of impoverished Native Americans This suggests that socioeconomic factors are at play as well as structural and racial obstacles  and not just government action in foster careLets remember this as we look at the central piece of evidence related to the removal allegation This is the extreme disproportion between the rates that Indian and white children are taken from the families As Block said Indian children make up just 15 percent of the population but account for more than half the children in foster care We probably all know that she means 15 percent of the child population in the state and so can forgive that oversight Block doesnt say that she is comparing Indians with whites but given that the nonNative population in South Dakota is overwhelmingly white that is effectively what she means The Census Bureau estimates that in 2011 whites made up 87 percent of the state population and Native Americans made up 9 percent leaving just 4 percent for all others I myself will thus use white and nonNative interchangeably when making demographic comparisons in South DakotaKim MalsamRysdon secretary of the state Department of Social Services DSS confirmed the 35toone disproportion cited by Block More specifically she told me that while Native Americans in 2010 represented 16 percent of the states population under 18 years old they made up 57 percent of the children forcibly removed under court order from their families This disproportionality is well known in the state and among experts and advocates but it is presented in the NPR investigation as if it were a new finding Beginning with Blocks framing of the series it also is presented as prima facie evidence of cultural bias and abuseThe statistic however turns out to be a poor indicator of eitherIn Chapter 5 I will show how the number of children that the courts take from their families and put in Native American homes is roughly equal to the amount they put in white foster homes This placement in Indian homes most of them of relatives is not mentioned in the series though it softens if not belies the image represented by the 35toone number and the reporters tone of a brutish state that cares little for Indian familiesBut an even more telling insight into just what the 35toone number means comes from looking at a comparative reference group These are Indian children who are not under court custody but have moved in with relatives anyway This is a much much larger group of children The only ones for whom we have measurable statistics are the ones living with kin who receive welfare aid under the federalstate Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program or TANF It is probably safe to say that like the children in state custody these children come from economically poor families that have broken down for whatever reason This group by itself is nearly eight times the size of the number of children under court custody As Chart 21 shows there was a monthly average of more than 3600 such children in FY10 and FY11 a large sample size that gives some statistical validity to observing themAnd what running the numbers on this reference group shows is that their demographic disproportion is even greater than that of the Indian children taken by the courts The Native reference group amounted to 72 percent of all the states children of all races who moved out of their families under the voluntary arrangements with TANF kin in FY10 This is nearly five times the population weight of the states Native Americans under the age of 18 This fivetoone disproportionality in other words is even more jawdropping than the 35toone ratio for children moved out by court order There may be hidden explanations we dont know for the difference but an obvious key variable is whether the courts and social workers control the outcome or not When they do the removal rate is lower not higher than what many extended Indian families are doing on their own This suggests that extended Indian families have set their own high removal rate which the state is following21 Native And NonNative Children in Kinship Families Receiving TANF Support Under And Not Under State and Tribal Court Custody FY10 and FY11Source South Dakota Department of Social ServicesState officials insist that they prefer to let extended families take over most of which happens without the state ever knowing MalsamRysdon said that social workers usually step in only when they are told of emergencies and even then they still prefer to defer to an extended family if it can offer safety and care for a kinship child I cannot confirm what state officials say but certainly the statistics partly back them up If judges and social workers are to be judged fairly all this should have been reported but wasntThe disproportionally high breakdowns meanwhile also suggest that something terribly wrong is going on inside many Indian families in South Dakota But whatThe series in a major failure says little about this larger context Possible cultural historical or social answers get tossed out along with the question of whether parental neglect might be a justification for the high removal numbersHere is pretty much the full treatment of neglect onair repeated from aboveSULLIVAN Without question some children in South Dakota need to be removed from their families But according to state figures less than 12 percent of the children in foster care in South Dakota have been actually physically or sexually abused Thats less than the national average And yet South Dakota is removing children at almost three times the rate of other states according to the National Coalition for Child Protection ReformTo understand how thats possible how the state can remove Janice Howes four grandchildren and more than 700 other Native kids every year you have to understand one word neglect The state says parents have neglected their children and neglect is subjectiveBOB WALTERS The standards are set too high for our peopleSULLIVAN Bob Walters is a council member for the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe He says what social workers call neglect is often poverty and sometimes Native traditionWALTERS Were family people If theres 30 people in my home thats fine I was raised with my mom and dad and 12 kids Im very thankful I grew up that waySULLIVAN He says social workers are often young and many have never set foot on a reservation He says they dont understand that food is often shared among families State officials acknowledge that only 11 of their 183 caseworkers are Native American But officials say they do yearly training to expose workers to Native practicesYou will note that the state never gets a chance to explain what it means by neglect The state in fact has a long list of conditions that go far beyond physical or sexual abuse Among them for example are an illegal drug environment sustained emotional harm and leaving a child home alone without proper care  conditions that I suspect most of us would consider legitimate grounds for determining abuse and neglectHere is the full list as supplied to me by the governors officeAn abused andor neglected child SDCL 268A2 is defined as a child1 Whose parent guardian or custodian has abandoned the child or has subjected the child to mistreatment or abuse2 Who lacks proper parental care through the actions or omissions of the childs parents guardian or custodian3 Whose environment is injurious to the childs welfare4 Whose parent guardian or custodian fails or refuses to provide proper or necessary subsistence supervision education medical care or any other care necessary for the childs health guidance or well being5 Who is homeless without proper care or not domiciled with the childs parent guardian or custodian through no fault of the childs parent guardian or custodian6 Who is threatened with substantial harm7 Who has sustained emotional harm or mental injury as indicated by an injury to the childs intellectual or psychological capacity evidenced by an observable and substantial impairment in the childs ability to function within the childs normal range of performance and behavior with due regard to the childs culture8 Who is subject to sexual abuse sexual molestation or sexual exploitation by the childs parent guardian custodian or any other person responsible for the childs care9 Who was subject to prenatal exposure to abusive use of alcohol marijuana or any controlled drug or substance not lawfully prescribed by a practitioner as authorized by chapters 2242 and 3420B or10 Whose parent guardian or custodian knowingly exposes the child to an environment that is being used for the manufacture use or distribution of methamphetamines or any other unlawfully manufactured controlled drug or substanceThe state objects to Sullivans onair description of neglect as a subjective term Here I side with Sullivan Judging what constitutes an environment that is injurious to the childs welfare for example is subjective This is why we have judges who deal with each case one by one More important to me than the semantics is whether the courts or social workers are systematically unreasonable in applying the standards This was not investigated by the series however Some DSS critics say that tribal social workers are less inclined than state ones to find neglect and recommend removal If true that would be an important story to exploreThe issue of when to keep families intact or split them for the benefit of the child bedevils all communities not just Indian ones National trends have swung back and forth over what is best dividing people of good will Failure to examine any of this and ignoring the many sides and perceptions of neglect represents incomplete and unfair reporting This everyday story in The Washington Post for example has nothing to do with Indians but shows how states across the country are constantly slicing and reslicing how to define neglectHow much real neglect however defined might there be in the Indian foster care cases I dont know MalsamRysdon in her interviews with me repeatedly said the same that tribal leader Walters did poverty by itself does not constitute neglectOf Bob Walters example of 30 people crammed into a presumably small home MalsamRysdon told me Twenty kids sleeping in a small living room or in a small environment is not in and of itself a safety concern But if they dont eat for three days or if no responsible adult is around then safety concerns go up We stand by our process to assess that I suspect that most Native Americans would find this position reasonable and would themselves raise questions about the conditions for children in a home with 30 people in it Whether social service workers are as reasonable in their judgments and execution I cant say But neither did the series explore this question as it should haveWhat MalsamRysdon does say is the obvious There is a correlation between poverty and neglect She correctly insists that correlation is not causation But sadly some of the reservations in South Dakota are among some of the poorest places in the nation and are afflicted with some of the worst social illsThis can best be seen at Pine Ridge an iconic reservation among Native Americans It was here at Wounded Knee in 1890 that between 150 and 300 Lakota Sioux men women and children were massacred by US cavalrymen In 1973 a group of some 200 Oglala Lakota and members of the American Indian Movement seized what by then had become the tiny reservation town of Wounded Knee and held out for 71 days against federal and state law enforcement officers Two people died The protests were against both the United States government and the local tribal leadership Two years later two FBI agents were shot and killed at Wounded Knee The Indian Child Welfare Act drafted by thenSouth Dakota Senator James Abourezk grew in part out of the sympathetic national reaction to a history of suffering and exploitation highlighted by the protest at Wounded KneeThe reservation remains in the news but more now for just the suffering Articles and books recite a statistical slate of misery A highlyreviewed book last year Days of Destruction Days of Revolt by Chris Hedges and Joe Sacco focused on four of the worst places for poverty in the nation and Pine Ridge was one of them NPRs Neal Conan interviewed Hedges last August about the book on Talk of the Nation Shannon County which is made up of Pine Ridge Reservation had the lowest per capita income of any county in the country in the 2010 Census The Rosebud Cheyenne River and Crow Creek reservations were close behind Unemployment on them is variously estimated at between 70 percent and 89 percentAs Nicholas Kristof wrote last year in The New York TimesHalf the population over 40 on Pine Ridge has diabetes and tuberculosis runs at eight times the national rate As many as twothirds of adults may be alcoholics onequarter of children are born with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and the life expectancy is somewhere around the high 40s shorter than the average for subSaharan Africa Less than 10 percent of children graduate from high schoolMatthew Power wrote earlier in HarpersThe youth suicide rate is ten times the national average One in three women is a victim of rape Life expectancy is roughly equivalent to Somalias Plagues of alcohol drugs domestic and gang violence Pine Ridge is as profoundly damaged a place as exists in AmericaNPRs own reports over the last year and a half have included segments about the federal governments reinvestigation of 45 deaths on the reservation a lawsuit filed against big brewers by the Oglala Sioux Tribe for contributing to the alcohol problem and an audio slideshow in partnership with National Geographic featuring images of poverty on Pine Ridge by photographer Aaron HueyI have never been to Pine Ridge or South Dakota I cannot confirm the accuracy of these accounts But their statistics of family dysfunction and social misery are so overwhelming that clearly child neglect has to figure somewhere in there Certainly an investigative series reporting on foster care removals by the state cannot sidestep the social ills with just a few throwaway lines and the dismissal of neglect as a reason Pine Ridge may be even more interesting because it has its own tribal social workersThe series falls into a wellmeaning but old trap that academics and policy makers from our two major national political parties have been leaving behind This is the trap of focusing so much on blaming the state or racism or structural reasons for problems shared by some group to the point that it infantilizes the group members as if they were not adults and had no responsibility of their own Many AfricanAmerican leaders and scholars today for example rue their denial in earlier decades of the disintegration of the black familyNone of this is to say that racism or structural obstacles dont exist or are not significant factors They are and they need to be reported But the singleminded framing of the series on cultural abuse by social workers and judges is limited and nave It is not in keeping with NPRs normally sophisticated analysis and exacting standards for an intelligent audienceThe storys brief mentions of neglect amounted to little more than throwaway lines For example Sullivan said Without question some children in South Dakota need to be removed from their families I disagree that this is enough Delving in much greater detail into the social context is not another story but should be an integral part of this story if it is to be complete accurate and fair As it was those lines of minimal context were followed onair with a but or a still as the first one did Still federal law says that except in the rarest cases Indian kids must be placed with relativesMeanwhile South Dakota listeners caught a weakness in the Yellow Robe narrative Janice Howes story is heart wrenching but several doctors lawyers and others from the state wrote to advise caution They noted that the story should be confirmed with the court case files and that those files and court proceedings were closed to the public under the states righttoprivacy laws Some states in recent years have opened child removal cases to the public The strong impression given by the anecdote is that state social workers took the child willfully with little good reason and no court hearing or order There is no proof of that howeverSullivan meanwhile does say in the story that she has an unnamed source who saw the DSS file The source said that the reports of drug abuse by the mother were based on rumors from a family enemy I have no reason to doubt Sullivans reporting on this but there was a surer route to confirm the truth the investigative team should have asked the parents to sign off on releasing the official file This would have given the anecdote authorityThis leads to a second fundamental weakness in the family account The person making the accusations about how the children were taken about the lack of prior notification and about the lack of information on their whereabouts is the grandmother not the mother Yet it was the mother not the grandmother who dealt directly with the state as the children were taken and afterwards Likewise the states responsibility was to inform the mother not the grandmother We dont know what communication there was between the state and the mother because we never hear from the mother directly or indirectlyIndeed no mothers are interviewed in the entire series All the family anecdotes involve interviews with grandmothers This is not without value given the extended nature of Native American families and the preference under the law for moving foster children into the homes of relatives But when it comes to allegations concerning removals it is parents not grandparents who are the firsthand source Janice Howes account may very well be true but without the official documentation and without corroboration from the mother it is in the end hearsayThere is additionally no response in the story from the state to her account Sullivan onair says social service officials say they cant talk about individual cases Tony Venhuizen of the governors office however insisted to me that all court processes were followed in the Yellow Robe case This much at least should have been reported To be able to respond with more detail Venhuizen said the state needed that signed release of confidential state records by the family He added We welcome Ms Howe the grandmother and the other individuals who spoke to Ms Sullivan to waive the confidentiality of their records Sullivan has not respondedIt is the Howe anecdote that also contributes to the unproven allegation that state social workers in Sullivans words are merely driving on to the reservation and taking a child The obvious insinuation is that they are doing so regularly at will and without a court hearing or order This insinuation caused MalsamRysdon to bristle in her interviews with me There are strict procedures that we have to follow and we dont take any child without a court order she told me Which is why she said she does tell Sullivan onair Of course we think its legal or we wouldnt be doing itWithout proof that state social workers do take Indian children at will Sullivans tone and backhanded statement  presented as a denial  is tendentious and unfair at best Sullivans ensuing onair statement adds to the damage It is gratuitously irrelevant when she says that two South Dakota judges two lawyers and a dozen tribal advocates told NPR a state official cant drive off with an Indian child from Crow Creek any more than a Crow Creek official could drive off with a child from Rapid City To my knowledge no one in the state claims that it can do soMalsamRysdon summarized state policy in two bulletpoints in an email as follows adding her own italics and underliningsChild Protection Services cannot remove children from a home without a court order In an emergency situation only law enforcement can remove the children In no case can CPS remove children without involvement from the courts or law enforcementIn cases where the protected child is Native American and living on a reservation it is tribal law enforcement and tribal courts that are involvedMore on this last point is in Chapter 5 on placement Alert readers might have noted the curious detail that it was an Indian tribal judge  not a state judge  that had the jurisdiction in the Yellow Robe caseFinally the story offers what at first glance might appear to be insider testimony about state abuse It isnt at least not really This is how it transpiresSULLIVAN Sometimes though its not just cultural differences Jolene Abourezk worked for the department for seven years She says taking kids was expectedJOLENE ABOUREZK Its just the norm here that it happens so often people dont question it  like good you are doing a good job for taking more kids in Its just the way its been and it continues to be that waySULLIVAN Now she works for her tribe the Oglala Sioux and reviews every case to help get the kids backWe as listeners reasonably assume that Abourezk recently worked for the state and that the norm she described was current We are assuming wrongly Abourezk left her state job in 2001 10 years before the series aired according to a press release from the governors office That is too long ago for her quotes to be of much use as the major source of inside information about state practices That the series noted that she worked seven years for the state  giving her authority  without noting how dated were her views was a stacking of the deckIn sum from Sullivans reporting I have no reason to doubt that transgressions by state social workers in removing Indian children from their families do happen But there is nothing in the reporting to support the allegation and the whole raison dtre of the series that those transgressions are widespread or systematic The series moreover was unfair in cherrypicking facts to make the worst case possible It failed to provide the crucial socioeconomic programmatic and statistical context that totally changes the complexion of the story and challenges its conclusions about a culturallybiased motive driving courtordered removalsGiven the sparse facts on state abuse a more intellectually honest and complete story would have indeed been exploratory and less accusatory It would have raised questions and tried to come to grips with how often transgressions take place It also would have dealt head on with the many complex social cultural legal and national family policy reasons that contribute to why so many Indian children are taken from their families as well as why so many move in with relatives under voluntary arrangements with and without state support That richer more nuanced story would have better served the suffering being endured by many Native American families todayMeanwhile there is a second motive that the series alleges is driving stateordered removals This one is even more provocative It is money the subject of the Chapter 3Download a

sheriffs office Wed just wait for the town drunk to show up once in a while In recent years the busy immigration inspection station has put a severe financial strain on the county and in the process revealed the tough monetary consequences of Americas massive expansion of border security and the governments strategy for curbing the nations supply of drugs and illegal immigration Despite its remoteness the Border Patrols Big Bend sector where Sierra Blanca sits has seen smalltime drug busts skyrocket in recent years An influx of agents tripled the local sectors manpower making the agency by far the biggest law enforcement presence around In 2011 agents in the Big Bend sector caught 2102 people with drugs the secondhighest number of any sector nationwide and up more than 300 percent from 2009 according to an analysis of government data by The Center for Investigative Reporting The Big Bend sector managed this with the fewest agents assigned to the southern US border The Sierra Blanca station essentially has become an immigration checkpoint in name only as the bulkedup Border Patrol has ensnared mostly Americans there  thousands of them Yet the US Justice Department generally declines to prosecute these lowlevel cases and has largely walked away from paying local authorities to pick up the slack Hudspeth County population 3337 is dependent on the federal dollars it receives to jail and prosecute the steady stream of busted motorists The travelers and their contraband are turned over to the sheriff in Sierra Blanca who has assigned two deputies to make daily runs to the checkpoint to pick them up But to county officials its a losing proposition They estimate that for every dollar that comes to the county from handling federal border crimes and seized assets it costs about 2 to detain prosecute and process offenders Local officials say they dont want their county which has 98 miles that front the Mexican border to be known as a place where crimes go unpunished But their relationship with the federal government has become too expensive As a result the sheriff here recently decided to kick the habit of prosecuting federal drug cases that have drained Hudspeths paltry fortunes Were arresting people for the federal government at my local taxpayers cost and that aint right for them to burden this cost says Sheriff Arvin West who oversees about a dozen fulltime deputies Theyre not going to pay Were not going to play Hudspeth County isnt alone In South Texas Brooks County a few years ago stopped taking cases from the Falfurrias checkpoint Neighboring Kleberg County commissioners recently voted to end their agreement to handle cases from the nearby Sarita checkpoint in Kenedy County Kleberg County Judge Juan M Escobar a former Border Patrol agent who once oversaw the Sarita checkpoint said the county has lost about 21 million to handle federal cases in the last five years The difficult decision came down to money for Kleberg where county employees havent received a raise in three years Is it fair for us to continue to pay for this issue that the federal government is neglecting he asks But that still doesnt sit right with local law enforcement says John Hubert the district attorney for Kenedy and Kleberg counties Were going to give up 300 miles of Texas to anyone who wants to transport less than 200 pounds of marijuana into the United States he says Officials from the Department of Homeland Security declined interview requests from The Center for Investigative Reporting In a written statement Justice Department spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle said that officials have had to make difficult funding decisions because of tight federal budgets He said local authorities have discretion to spend other federal grant money to support such prosecutions Through increased coordinated investigations information and technology sharing and training we are assisting our law enforcement partners including the Department of Homeland Security and Mexican counterparts to eliminate the threat posed by drug cartels and other organized crime efforts along the Southwest border Hornbuckle wrote At the Sierra Blanca checkpoint which stands roughly 15 miles from Mexico and has been in operation since the early 1970s drugdetecting dogs regularly sniff the 15000 to 20000 trucks cars and motorcycles that pass through on a typical weekday Along with a national hiring surge that began in 2006 the Border Patrol has nearly doubled the number of canines at its network of 33 permanent checkpoints that stretch from Southern California to Southern Texas Line agents dont care if theyre busting people for small amounts of marijuana or 1000pound smuggling loads says Lee Smith local president of the National Border Patrol Council a union that represents border agents If its out there we want to catch it he says Struggling With Funding Like other border counties Hudspeth County for years has ridden the highs and lows of Justice dollars paid to take its undesired cases Since 2002 the Justice Department has reimbursed the four states bordering Mexico roughly 300 million to handle cases that originate from federal law enforcement through a program called the Southwest Border Prosecution Initiative The program started after frustrated district attorneys led by Hudspeths top prosecutor Jaime Esparza complained to Congress that the Justice Department pushed more cases on them than they could afford More than a decade later prosecutors are fed up with the department which diluted the program and then slashed reimbursement payments says Esparza whose district includes neighboring El Paso and Culberson counties The four border states will receive less than 5 million in 2013 as reimbursement for handling the federal cases  down from 31 million in 2010 And the department didnt request such funding from Congress for 2014 They cant expect local counties along the southern border to carry their water for them Esparza says Theyre going to have to fight this fight on their own In May Hudspeth County and other border counties learned the Justice Department would reimburse local authorities only for prosecution of cases but not the detention costs That was a deal breaker for county officials  the biggest chunk of Hudspeth Countys budget goes to the jail Its devastating for us says county auditor Yolanda Esparza who is not related to prosecutor Jaime Esparza It might end up being too hard for Hudspeth County to walk away however With more square miles  about 4500  than residents the county doesnt generate enough tax dollars to keep all of its government buildings lit or even pay some employees without the fines and court fees the checkpoint brings Treasa Brown the deputy county clerk has advice for travelers Leave your drugs at home Buy more when you get there But if you cant do without come on through Were broke she said We need your money and when you come to court bring lots of it and Ill take every penny you have Charles Vital Jr 35 of Hayward Calif learned that when he traveled with his girlfriend toward Louisiana before Thanksgiving 2011 Vital reviewed and rated their experience of getting busted on Yelp a website usually known for customer reviews of restaurants and other businesses Our California plates got us pulled over at the border It also could have been the fact that the drug dog started whimpering when he got next to our car wrote Vital who gave the checkpoint two stars A cottage industry of defense attorneys has built up around the checkpoint one of two in Hudspeth County to handle the spike in outofstate offenders Most are charged with a misdemeanor and sent on their way to avoid overwhelming the county with a backlog of cases But fines and fees from those cases still arent enough to cover the countys costs Rarely has the federal government fully reimbursed its court or detention expenses When the county complained that the funds werent enough or timely officials say the Justice Departments inspector general responded with an audit The watchdog office which declined a request for comment found in a 2010 report that the county wasnt totally faultfree Hudspeth County received too much money  about 480000  because of improper claims for reimbursement between 2002 and the first half of 2008 out of nearly 62 million it received over those years County officials say the Office of Justice Programs changed its reimbursement guidelines which werent clear in the first place The county reached a settlement in which the amount owed was reduced some money was credited and the county paid back a small figure West the sheriff says the time has come for the country to make up its mind on marijuana policy For 40something years we have lost our butts on this he says referring to the war on drugs Quit playing these damn political games  either legalize marijuana or do something about it Agustin Armendariz Michael Corey and Tia

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2013/07/14/201981025/the-mysterious-history-of-marijuana?ft=3&f=,Weve decided to take a weekly look at a word or phrase thats caught our attention whether for its history usage etymology or just because it has an interesting story This week we look into how we came to call cannabis marijuana and the role Mexico played in that shiftMarijuana has been intertwined with race and ethnicity in America since well before the word marijuana was coined The drug my colleague Gene Demby recently wrote has a disturbing case of multiple personality disorder Its a goto pop culture punch line Its the foundation of a growing recreational and medicinal industry Yet according to the ACLU its also the reason for more than half of the drug arrests in the US A deeply disproportionate number of marijuana arrests the vast majority of which are for possession befall AfricanAmericans despite similar rates of usage among whites and blacks the ACLU saysThroughout the 19th century news reports and medical journal articles almost always use the plants formal name cannabis Numerous accounts say that marijuana came into popular usage in the US in the early 20th century because anticannabis factions wanted to underscore the drugs Mexicanness It was meant to play off of antiimmigrant sentimentsA common version of the story of the criminalization of pot goes like this Cannabis was outlawed because various powerful interests some of which have economic motives to suppress hemp production were able to craft it into a bogeyman in the popular imagination by spreading tales of homicidal mania touched off by consumption of the dreaded Mexican locoweed Fear of brown people combined with fear of nightmare drugs used by brown people to produce a wave of public action against the marijuana menace That combo led to restrictions in state after state ultimately resulting in federal prohibitionBut this version of the story starts to prompt more questions than answers when you take a close look at the history of the drug in the US What role did race actually play in the perception of the drug Are historical accounts of pot usage  including references to Mexican locoweed  even talking about the same drug we know as marijuana today How did the plant and its offshoots get so many darn names reefer pot weed hashish dope ganja bud and on and on and on anyway And while were on the subject how did it come to be called marijuanaLets start with the race question Eric Schlosser recounts some of the racially charged history of marijuana in his 1994 Atlantic article Reefer Madness some of the source material for the bestselling bookThe political upheaval in Mexico that culminated in the Revolution of 1910 led to a wave of Mexican immigration to states throughout the American Southwest The prejudices and fears that greeted these peasant immigrants also extended to their traditional means of intoxication smoking marijuana Police officers in Texas claimed that marijuana incited violent crimes aroused a lust for blood and gave its users superhuman strength Rumors spread that Mexicans were distributing this killer weed to unsuspecting American schoolchildren Sailors and West Indian immigrants brought the practice of smoking marijuana to port cities along the Gulf of Mexico In New Orleans newspaper articles associated the drug with AfricanAmericans jazz musicians prostitutes and underworld whites The Marijuana Menace as sketched by antidrug campaigners was personified by inferior races and social deviantsIn 1937 US Narcotics Commissioner Henry Anslinger testified before Congress in the hearings that would result in the introduction of federal restrictions on marijuana According to druglibraryorg Anslingers testimony included a letter from Floyd Baskette the city editor of the Alamosa Colo Daily Courier which said in part I wish I could show you what a small marihuana cigaret can do to one of our degenerate Spanishspeaking residents Thats why our problem is so great the greatest percentage of our population is composed of Spanishspeaking persons most of who sic such an enthusiastic sic are low mentally because of social and racial conditionsFolks werent just worrying about Mexicans and jazz musicians either Within the last year we in California have been getting a large influx of Hindoos and they have in turn started quite a demand for cannabis indica wrote Henry J Finger a powerful member of Californias State Board of Pharmacy in a 1911 letter page 18 They are a very undesirable lot and the habit is growing in California very fast the fear is now that it is not being confined to the Hindoos alone but that they are initiating our whites into this habitIt seems clear that much anticannabis animus had a racial dimension Heres the thing though The pot was outlawed because MEXICANS argument is complicated by the fact that Mexico was also cracking down on the drug around the same time as Isaac Campos documents in his book Home Grown Marijuana and the Origins of Mexicos War on Drugs Mexicos prohibition of pot actually came in 1920 a full 17 years before the US federal government pot crackdown started with the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 And while there may have been a class dimension to the movement against marijuana in Mexico Campos suggests people were banning the drug because they were seriously freaked out about what it could doThe Turn Of The 20th CenturyIf youve ever watched a stoner movie this account of marijuanas effects will likely seem very familiarThe resin of the cannabis Indica is in general use as an intoxicating agent from the furthermost confines of India to Algiers If this resin be swallowed almost invariably the inebriation is of the most cheerful kind causing the person to sing and dance to eat food with great relish and to seek aphrodisiac enjoyment The intoxication lasts about three hours when sleep supervenes it is not followed by nausea or sickness nor by any symptoms except slight giddiness worth recording Source The Indian Hemp The Western Journal of Medicine and Surgery May 1843Add some Capn Crunch and bam youve basically just described the plot of HalfBakedMost of the pre1900 press references to cannabis relate either to its medical usage or its role as an industrial textile But then in the early 1900s you start to see accounts in major newspapers like this Los Angeles Times story from 1905 Delirium or death terrible effects produced by certain plants and weeds grown in MexicoNot long ago a man who had smoken a marihuana cigarette attacked and killed a policeman and badly wounded three others six policemen were needed to disarm him and march him to the police station where he had to be put into a straight jacket Such occurrences are frequentPeople who smoke marihuana finally lose their mind and never recover it but their brains dry up and they die most of times suddenlySuddenly the drug has a whole new identity Heres a representative New York Times headline from 1925 Mexican Crazed by Marihuana Runs Amuck With Butcher KnifeThis disparity between cannabis mentions pre1900 and marihuana references post1900 is wildly jarring Its almost as though the papers are describing two different drugs In Spanish the drugs name is spelled marihuana or mariguana marijuana is an AnglicizationBut according to Campos book these accounts in the American press echoed stories that had been appearing in Mexican newspapers well before Campos cites story after story  most pre1900  containing similar details a soldier driven mad by mariguana and attacking his fellow soldiers El Monitor Republicano 1878 a potcrazed soldier murdering two colleagues and injuring two others La Voz de Mxico 1888 a prisoner stabbing two fellow inmates to death after smoking up El Pais 1899Campos makes a very compelling case that the potinduced mania narrative wasnt imposed on Mexico after the fact by xenophobes in AmericaMuch of Campos book is devoted to puzzling through the question of how the effects of marijuana as documented in these press accounts in Mexico and America could differ so dramatically from our contemporary understanding of the drug Could class prejudice have caused the elites running Mexicos newspapers to hype up accounts of drugfueled violence among the lower classes Consider that all of the accounts listed above involved prisoners or soldiers who would have been thought of as lower class at the timeCampos ultimately concludes that while class attitudes were certainly on display in the Mexican press just as racist and xenophobic attitudes were on display in the American press they werent behind the perception of marijuana as dangerous In fact his read of the evidence suggests that it was lowerclass Mexicans who were most fearful of the drugs effectsAs mystifying as it might be amid modern perceptions of marijuana as a relatively benign narcotic Campos argues that a variety of conditions could have caused users in that late 19thcentury context to behave very differently from the way we might expect stoners to behave today He writesWhen I began this research I expected the scientifically measurable effects of cannabis to be a straightforward control for understanding the past My assumption went something like this If we know the effects that a drug has in the present then we will know what effects the drug had in the past producing a perfect control for distinguishing between myth and reality in the historical archive This it turns out was wrongRichard DeGrandpre has called this widespread misunderstanding the cult of pharmacology and has identified it as a key component in the genesis and longevity of misguided drug policies in the United States The cult of pharmacology suggests that there is a direct and consistent relationship between the pharmacology of a substance and the effects that it has on all human beings But as decades of research and observation have demonstrated the effects of psychoactive drugs are actually dictated by a complex tangle of pharmacology psychology and culture  or drug set and setting  that has yet to be completely deciphered by researchersOne factor however appears difficult to disentangle even in Campos meticulously detailed account We have a fairly lowresolution understanding of what marijuana use looked like in Mexico and the US at the turn of the century  how much people consumed how they ingested it what substances it might have been combined with Someone smoking a joint packed half with tobacco and half with cannabis indica the version of the drug that typically produces a sedentary mellow high would have had a very different experience than someone whos drinking the Mexican liquor pulque and eating something laced with cannabis sativa the version of the drug likelier to produce anxietyWhich brings us back to the problem of namesThe Many Faces Of MarijuanaRemember when I mentioned that the pre1900 cannabis news stories and the post1900 marihuana news stories almost seemed to be describing two different plants Well in some cases they actually wereOne account published in The Washington Post draws a distinction between Mexican marihuano or locoweed and Indian hasheesh aka cannabis indica The article actually erroneously conflates a poisonous weed that really is called locoweed its clinical name is astralagus not cannabis with marijuana More about that on page 21 of this paperCannabis is an extraordinarily global plant and has a variety of identities all around the world This is one of the reasons the drug has so many names  ganja comes from Sanskrit it appears as bhang in The Thousand and One Nights its hashish in The Count of Monte Cristo But these different names reflect a wide range of cannabis products and derivatives According to Campos for example Sinbads hashish may have actually been halfopium Such variety in labeling obviously makes it difficult to determine how cannabis manifests in different historical accountsIn fact the plant has such a robust global history that we dont even know for sure how the Mexican Spanish word marihuana was coined Plausible competing theories trace the words roots to any of three continents And therein lies an interesting little lesson about history and global interconnectednessWe know that the Spanish brought cannabis to Mexico to cultivate it for hemp but its unlikely the Spanish indulged in any significant fashion in the plants psychoactive properties One theory holds that Chinese immigrants to western Mexico lent the plant its name a theoretical combination of syllables that could plausibly have referred to the plant in Chinese ma ren hua might have just become Spanishized into marijuana Or perhaps it came from a colloquial Spanish way of saying Chinese oregano  mejorana chino Or maybe Angolan slaves brought to Brazil by the Portuguese carried with them the Bantu word for cannabis makaa Maybe the term simply originated in South America itself as a portmanteau of the Spanish girls names Maria and JuanaThe mystery of marijuanas name is appropriate for this incredibly manyfaceted plant Its worth reflecting when you see coverage of the humble weed how much global geopolitical historical weight is packed into even its name All that history is still reverberating in the lives of the men and women affected by the drug every day When you think about it a degree of multiple personality disorder makes sense for a drug that might as easily have been named by Angolan slaves as by Chinese immigrant laborers Copyright 2014 NPR,20130722,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2013/07/16/195193595/a-dark-family-secret-hidden-for-years-in-alaskas-wilderness?ft=3&f=,In early 2002 a pair of battered old trucks drove through deep snow into a tiny Alaska ghost town carrying a large family that looked to be from another centuryThe patriarch with his long unruly beard introduced himself to one of the towns few residents as Papa Pilgrim though his real name was Robert Hale Long before he explained a shaft of celestial light had brought him a bigbang religious awakening and now God had whispered to him telling him to move with his wife and family to Alaska All 15 Pilgrim children had been delivered and schooled at home They had names like Hosanna Jerusalem Psalms and Job they didnt use calendar months they addressed their father as Lord and theyd never seen a TV or experienced the temptations of the worldFrom the outside they seemed just very handsome kids very capable former Anchorage Daily News reporter Tom Kizzia tells NPRs Melissa Block They could ride a horse stand on the backs of horses and fix a truck that had broken down They knew how to live in the wilderness and they were always offering to help others They had this kind of great facadeKizzias new book Pilgrims Wilderness tells the gripping story of the Pilgrim familys deep dark secrets and the battle that followed their move into the Alaska wildsInterview HighlightsOn the abandoned copper mining town the family moved to deep in the WrangellSt Elias National Park The town was McCarthy and it was an old boomtown from a century ago It had a kind of a homesteader scavenger culture that was just living off the land out there Not only living off the meat and the fish and berries but also off the spools of steel cable that had been left in the tram stations and the mullioned windows of the old mills And by the 70s it was turning into a kind of a bush community of marijuana growers and mountain climbers and gold miners and homesteaders And right at that time the national park was established by Congress all around it  a park the size of Switzerland with just this little isolated town in its middleOn the battle that broke out after Papa Pilgrim bulldozed a road to his newly purchased 420acre family homestead inside the park and the national attention it drewFrom the Park Service point of view this guy had just driven a bulldozer 13 miles through a national park From the property rights side he was using an old rightofway that had once actually been a road and he was you know making a case for the rural lifestyle And the property rights people started flying supplies up there to try to help the family and defy the Park Service And the Park Service was sending in teams of biologists to assess the damage and were talking about sending in a SWAT team to protect them from this armed even though pacifist Pilgrim familyAnd it was just escalating to the point where everyone was talking about Is this going to turn into the next Ruby Ridge which was the fatal showdown between federal agents and sort of a rightwing enclave in the Rocky Mountains And when people start talking about Ruby Ridge a reporter gets involved I guess that was how I got started out thereOn the abuse the family suffered at the hands of Papa PilgrimOne of the worst things that he did when the boys were violating his rules he would take them out one at a time and bend them over the whipping barrel as he called it They would have to hold on with their hands and with their shirts off be whipped And the mother would have to hold their hands and if they started to scream she would shove a cloth into their mouth She was badly beaten and abused all the time and one time dragged out of the cabin and he came back his fist clenched full of her hair and nailed a wad of hair to the wall of the cabin to warn everyone that this is what happens if you resist what the Lord wants to have happen in this house As the eldest daughter Elishaba came of age she resisted but he wanted to take her away on special trips in the back of his pickup truck and then sleep with her And she did resist for a while but he told her that he would spare her brothers on the whipping barrel if she would relent and that was the Lord showing mercy He said the Bible gave every father one special daughterBecause she was the oldest she could read a little bit and she was once caught trying to read the Bible and look for something about the special daughter and he beat her for trying to read the BibleOn why it took so long for the abuse to be exposedIt was partly the politics of it that the people on the outside were afraid to intervene and be accused of doing it for political purposes the fight over land and the parks and conservation From within the kids really didnt have a vocabulary to understand what was going on and what was wrong about it And it was really only after they were taken in by another big Christian family the Buckinghams when things got so desperate that they needed a place to stay in the winter  that they suddenly said They live very differently I mean theyre Christian and they read the Bible but they talk with their parents about what is the Bible really saying here And it was a revelation to the kids And when their eyes finally were opened they were finally able to see what was right and wrong and stand up to Papa Pilgrim for the first timeOn what happened to the rest of the family after Papa Pilgrims arrestTheyve done amazingly well considering where they came from The older kids are married and Joseph the oldest son is a successful contractor However there is a fight about how best to raise the youngest children whether they should be in the mothers custody The children individually there are lots of psychological hangups and

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2013/07/09/200122017/a-music-festival-grows-in-the-rainforest?ft=3&f=,The international summer festival circuit is full of contenders celebrating cultures and subcultures while hustling for global vacation dollars For musicians festivals mean exposure a paycheck and a rolling party of peers For communities theyre a revenue engine and selfpromotion platform For musichungry fans theyre vacation anchors or vacations unto themselves The menu has exploded in recent years from veteran postWoodstock pop feasts like Glastonbury and Roskilde to more specialized events like Sonar highbrow EDM and KillTown Death Fest metal duh to more ethnicallyminded gatherings like Finlands Kaustinen Folk Festival which look to advance regional culture The Rainforest World Music Festival staged spectacularly between a beach and a rainforest mountain peak in the state of Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo is an object lesson in the latter The 16th annual event which concluded its threeday run on the last day of June showed how a region can use a festival to grow its local music scene and tourism industry while also raising consciousness  along with in this case some uncomfortable questions  about its environmental stewardship A nominally Muslim country defined by a mix of Chinese Indian and native cultures and the warmth of its people Malaysia has always had a bit of an image problem At one time it was local tribal headhunting practices more recently its been political unrest in Sabah and a checkered environmental scorecard In part perhaps to help counter this a group of international concert promoters and journalists were brought in for a world music business conference and expo in nearby Kuching prior to the festival Full disclosure I was among the journalists invited to speak The upshot of the conference was that the countrys traditional music scene is rich creatively but still in its infancy professionally The festival itself bore this out many of its most stirring moments came from local musicians relegated to brief opening slots and afternoon workshop performances There were the hypnotic hammered bamboo zithers called gongs built and played by Arthur Gorman and Madeeh a group from a junglebased Bidayuh tribal longhouse community about 65 kilometers from Kuching There were soulful performances on the sape the ornate lute that is the icon of Malaysian traditional music by Matthew Ngau and Maya Green and a remarkable bit of Kayan noseflute playing by the 71yearold Juk Wan Emang When asked by a waggish Brit journalist why he doesnt just play the flute with his mouth the master musician replied through a translator because anyone can do that Only someone special can play with their nose Making music originally designed for healing ceremonies religious rituals andor dance performances most of these players hadnt developed enough repertoire to fill a full festival set Those who had faced other challenges Rhythm in Bronze based in peninsular Malaysia in the capital of Kuala Lumpur perform modern work written for Malaysian gamelan which is distinct from the Indonesian variety in tuning instruments and playing style Because the group travels with 13 performers and 800 kilograms of unique gongs metallophones bonang and kenang pots and gendang drums international touring costs are prohibitive it took them years just to make it across the South China Sea to the Rainforest Festival A few fans of traditional Indonesian gamelan were skeptical of the groups populist take on the classical form But their performance was a festival highlight meditative and exuberant by turns with subtle choreography charming group dynamics and intoxicating tonalities Heard through a huge sound system the music was magnificent Other festival highlights came via international acts none of them especially big stars Lafayette Las Pine Leaf Boys played Cajun music spiked with Memphis soul Dizu Plaatjies and the Ibuyambo Ensemble played the sort of South African tribal pop that inspired Paul Simons Graceland and at one point delivered a heartfelt tribute to the ailing Nelson Mandela Spiritual Seasons from Ukraine inexplicably triggered an outbreak of rumbastyle linedancing in the crowd The level of audience participation was remarkable by US standards outside of EDM festivals So was the relative sobriety Though you could find thuoc the local rice liquor if you looked hard among the food stalls festival management nixed it in the main food courts due to past attendee overindulgence Wine and beer the latter from omnipresent stalls courtesy of festival sponsor Heineken were plentiful but while more than a few tipsy fans wove their way towards the gate at the end of each night there was none of the public drunkenness thats common at American festivals And given Malaysias notorious drug laws including a mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking there were zero signs of marijuana or anything else And yes in case you were wondering it was very hot  but humidity notwithstanding no worse than what fans at Bonnaroo and Coachella contend with For me the weekends most exhilarating performance was by Palsandae a South Korean ensemble rooted in a tradition of traveling music and dance troupes Dating back to the 60s and updating far older styles of farm and street music these nearly allfemale pungmul ensembles would roll into a town set up a tent and present their circuslike shows Palsandaes version involves acrobatic chaesang sogo dancing hats with ribboned whirlygigs and deliciously cacophonous music made with doubleheaded janggo drums clattering handheld kkwaenggwari gongs and the braying piri a small bamboo oboe Kim WoonTae the groups shamanic male leader who grew up traveling with a pungmul troupe has a jazz background as well and it shows their performances have elements of sitespecific improvisation and at times the wild very loud music isnt far removed from the ecstatic freeplaying of Sun Ras Arkestra or the Art Ensemble of Chicago Theres an educational component to the festival too The setting is the Sarawak Cultural Village a sprawling assortment of tribal communal longhouses that are still common throughout the jungle interior albeit with modern conveniences like electrical generators appliances computers and power tools This is where artists held afternoon workshops which gave context to the music and which occasionally became dance parties themselves One thing missing strangely was any real discussion about rainforest deforestation Sure you can argue politics are a buzzkill at a music festival But promoting the splendor of the threatened rainforest and the tribal cultures it sustains is a political act by default and one hoped for more than platitudes about man being the caretaker of Mother Earth I had trouble even finding a recycling bin and in numerous press conferences government officials mostly skirted questions about the logging industry Meanwhile smoke haze attributed to illegal landclearing rainforest fires in Indonesia in which Malaysian companies are suspected of being complicit made for choking air quality and flight cancellations prior to the festival And just days after it ended journalist Clare Rewcastle Brown founder of Radio Free Sarawak and a sharp critic of the regions logging practices was denied entry into the country Travelling in this dazzling region you quickly realize the stakes I spent a long night excavating freshlylaid sea turtle eggs on the beach of TalangTalang island for the protective hatchery at Sarawak Forestrys turtle conservation program I visited Bako National Park accessible only by boat and spent hours watching proboscis monkeys eating and playing in the rainforest canopy amidst myriad other wildlife Its thrilling that Malaysia has a worldclass music festival to highlight the beauty of the rainforest and its culture Hopefully the nations environmental policies preserve them Copyright 2014 NPR,20130709,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2013/06/21/193925787/oliver-sacks-exploring-how-hallucinations-happen?ft=3&f=,This interview was originally broadcast on Nov 6 2012In Oliver Sacks book The Minds Eye the neurologist included an interesting footnote in a chapter about losing vision in one eye because of cancer that said In the 60s during a period of experimenting with large doses of amphetamines I experienced a different sort of vivid mental imageryHe expands on this footnote in his book Hallucinations where he writes about various types of hallucinations  visions triggered by grief brain injury migraines medications and neurological disordersOne chapter of the book  thats out in paperback July 2  deals with altered states and Sacks personal experimentation with hallucinogenic and mindaltering drugs in the 60s He says the first time he tried marijuana it induced fascinating perceptual distortion He was looking at his hand and it appeared to be retreating from him yet getting larger and largerI was fascinated that one could have such perceptual changes and also that they went with a certain feeling of significance an almost numinous feeling Im strongly atheist by disposition but nonetheless when this happened I couldnt help thinking That must be what the hand of God is like Sacks tells Fresh Airs Terry Gross that he has always been fascinated with hallucinations  from reading about Pips hallucination of Miss Havisham in Charles Dickens Great Expectations to witnessing hallucinations of every sort as a medical student and doctor He had a personal interest in the phenomenon he explains because his brother was a schizophrenic  and would talk with his hallucinationsSacks has also had his share of noninduced hallucinations One day while mountain climbing he experienced an auditory hallucination after an injury that tore most of his thigh muscle and dislocated his knee His first impulse was to go to sleep  but then he heard a voice that he didnt recognize yet trusted No that would be death  he recalls it saying  Go on Youve got to keep going Find a pace you can keep up and keep it up And this was a very clear commanding voice It was a life voice and it was not to be disobeyed Neurologically Sacks speculates that this type of auditory hallucination is something that announces itself in extremity and is the ultimate safeguard some power or propensity which has been built into the structure of the mind the emotions and is not heard by most people in their livesSacks notes that the medicalization of hallucinations really only occurred in the 19th century  and that subsequent to that there was much more anxiety secrecy and shame about hallucinationsI think hallucinations need to be discussed he says There are all sorts of hallucinations and then many sorts which are OK like the ones I think which most of us have in bed at night before we fall asleep when we can see all sorts of patterns or faces and scenesWith the ability to visualize the brain through cuttingedge medical technologies Sacks believes the scientists sense of the brains complexity has been increased its now possible to see exactly whats going on in the brain while people are hallucinatingInterview HighlightsOn a memorable hallucination while taking LSDI had been reading about the color indigo how it had been introduced into the spectrum by Isaac Newton rather late and it seemed no two people quite agreed as to what indigo was and I thought I would like to have an experience of indigo And I built up a sort of pharmacological launchpad with amphetamines and LSD and a little cannabis on top of that and when I was really stoned I said I want to see indigo now And as if thrown by a paintbrush a huge pearshaped blob of the purest indigo appeared on the wallAgain it had this luminous numinous quality I leaped toward it in a sort of ecstasy I thought This is the color of heaven  I thought maybe this is not a color which actually exists on the Earth or maybe it used to exist or no longer exists All this went through my mind in 4 or 5 seconds and then the blob disappeared giving me a strong sense of loss and heartbrokenness and I was haunted a little bit when I came down wondering whether indigo did exist in the real worldI would turn over little stones I once went to a museum to look at azurite a copper mineral which is maybe the nearest to indigo but that was disappointing I did in fact have that experience again but when I had it the second time it was not with a drug it was with music  and I think music can take one to the heights in a way comparable with drugsOn hallucinations that accompany bereavementWith any hallucinations if you can do functional brain imagery while theyre going on you will find that the parts of the brain usually involved in seeing or hearing  in perception  have become super active by themselves And this is an autonomous activity this does not happen with imagination But hallucination in a way simulates perception and the perceptual parts of the brain become active  Theres obviously a very very strong passionate feeling of love and loss with bereavement hallucinations and I think intense emotion of any sort can produce a hallucinationOn the hallucinations accompanying his migrainesI usually get the zigzag but I may also see lattice patterns like tessellations sometimes these lattice patterns seem to cover peoples faces or a piece of paper Im writing on I mostly get complex geometrical patterns Ive never actually seen  images with a migraine although on at least on two occasions Ive had a smell  in particular a smell of hot buttered toast  with a strong sense that I was about 3 years old being put in a high chair and about to be given hot buttered toast A sort of olfactory hallucination often goes along with recollection in that sort of wayThe first time I got that I was in hospital and I went searching for the toast The second time I was driving on the Bronx River Parkway where there was obviously no toast to be hadHow visual migraines may have inspired ancient patterned art There are all sorts of complex geometrical patterns very symmetrical some of them looking like the finest doily  Patterns like this tend to appear in migraine but they may also appear with fever They also appear with various drugs They may also be seen as one is falling asleep and one cant help comparing them with various forms of ornamental art and cave art and wondering whether individuals or cultures have been inspired by some of these patterns which are built into the nervous system Copyright 2014 NPR,20130621,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2013/06/11/190775585/the-many-different-faces-of-marijuana-in-america?ft=3&f=,On Tuesday Vermont moved to decriminalize the possession of marijuana for quantities up to an ounce replacing potential prison time for arrests with fines Peter Shumlin the states governor made a telling distinction between weed and harder drugs when he announced the move This legislation allows our courts and law enforcement to focus their limited resources more effectively to fight highly addictive opiates such as heroin and prescription drugs that are tearing apart families and communities he said The idea that weed isnt that big a deal and that governments need to readjust their priorities is pretty common Theres little vocal antipot government outcry no temperance movement analog for cannabis Recent polls have found that a majority of Americans think marijuana should be legalized Even our mainstream faces of stoner culture are generally silly harmless and amiable Jeff Spicoli Cheech  Chong Harold  Kumar and whatever Snoop is calling himself these days except when theyre revered and saintly read Bob Marley On TV there was Weeds a dramedy about an uppermiddleclass widow who starts selling marijuana to make ends meet Change the drug to something else like heroin or meth drugs with more sinister reputations and it becomes something much darker Youd pretty much have to go all the way back to Reefer Madness to find a widely seen film that portrayed pot as dangerous or threatening And the whole reason we all know about that movie is because the concerns at its center are often mocked as kitschy and histrionic Mona Lynch a professor at the University of California Irvine who studies the criminal justice system says that stereotypes of marijuana usage in popular culture dont come across as very threatening Theres not a lot of uproar around marijuana as a crushing problem she says But this image of weed use as benign recreation or banal nuisance doesnt square with another great fact of American life  the War on Drugs And more and more that War on Drugs means marijuana Ezekiel Edwards the director of the American Civil Liberties Unions Criminal Law Reform Project says that in 2001 years ago marijuana possession arrests made up 34 percent of all drug arrests And now Half of all drug arrests are now marijuanarelated he says  and 9 in 10 of those are for possession The focus of the continuing law enforcement battle on marijuana lands disproportionately on people of color The ACLU crunched some Justice Department numbers on drug arrests and released a muchdiscussed report  last week on their findings The upshot AfricanAmericans are four times as likely to be arrested for possessing marijuana than whites even though blacks and whites consume weed at about the same rate For blacks  and black men in particular  marijuana is a gateway drug into the criminal justice system The thing that was shocking about the report was the pervasiveness that this disparity in arrests is happening everywhere Lynch tells me Its happening in small towns big towns urban and rural Both Edwards and Lynch say that part of the reason marijuana is getting more attention from law enforcement agencies is that police departments are being subsidized with lots of federal dollars to stop drugs but the crack epidemic has since waned Institutions dont like to shrink Lynch says Its actually a reverse kind of pattern  drug arrests are going up even as crime drops At the same time that marijuanas become a more central focus of the War on Drugs there are plenty of business types who are already making their plans for selling marijuana after uh all the smoke clears Theyre trying to give pot an altogether new face as a widely available commercial product backed by big business No one knows what that market might even look like quite yet but it could be incredibly lucrative Might you be able to cop some weed at your supermarket behind the counter with cigarettes Would your favorite coffee shop start selling some extra special lattes What about an overthecounter headache medicine packaged in a box with a little green leaf in the corner Seriously  it might not be that farfetched Diego Pellicer a company that hopes to open marijuana stores in Washington and Colorado is looking for investors Vicente Fox the former president of Mexico was a guest speaker at a Don Pellicer event last week and has said that he would grow marijuana if werent against the law Once its legitimate and legal sure I could do it he told reporters Im a farmer Producers of all types can participate Fox its worth noting used to run CocaCola in Mexico and its sales jumped by 50 percent during his tenure There are already vending machine companies working on cannabisdispensing kiosks for retail stores for the people who dont want the hassle of humoring those talky connoisseur types The way we see it when you walk into a shop you dont need the expert or aficionado to help with selection says the head of one such vending company The people who are using this in the recreational space  they know what they want and they dont want to hear the whole spiel every time And there are all the industrial nonpsychoactive applications Hemp fiber which is especially strong is already used in all sorts of textiles One researcher told writer Doug Fine that a decade after weed became legal a domestic hemp industry would sprout up in the United States to the tune of 50 billion a year  which would outpace the estimates of what smokable reefer would bring in When Americas 100 million cannabis aficionados 17 million regular partakers are freed from dealers some are going to pick up a sixpack of joints at the corner store before heading to a barbecue and others are going to seek out organically grown heirloom strains for their vegetable dip Fine wrote So now we have to reconcile the many different faces of

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2013/05/12/183349985/can-a-white-guy-represent-for-his-people?ft=3&f=,Last week we wrote about the way members of minority groups are frequently linked in the popular imagination with prominent fellow members of their group We asked Channing Kennedy frequent contributor to Colorlinescom for a commentary on this phenomenon from the perspective of someone without any immediately obvious minority affiliations Heres what he told usLast week Gene Demby listed four ways that people of color come to represent their entire minority group willingly or not He mentions that this is a dynamic that white people dont have to deal with  the burden of representing ones people positively or negatively  and I agree much as I agree that the world is round Actually thats a better metaphor than I intended because the reality is more complicated than the truth while I understand intellectually that the earth is round I walk on the same flat surface as everyone elseSome background and this is a bit Race 101 so bear with me a groups representatives come into being in direct reference to the stereotypes about that group We are surprised that Jeremy Lin is so good at basketball and reassured that Charles Ramseys unobjective heroism is fueled by McDonalds These stereotypes in turn are there to caricature and disenfranchise the groups they apply to and theyre tellingly absent from groups that actually hold power As Dave Chappelle observed nobody knows what white people eatAnd while there are dehumanizing disenfranchising stereotypes that apply to whites theyre always along an accompanying axis of identity Obamawatermelon jokes exist because hes black but ClintonBig Mac jokes exist because hes poor white trash White jokes are inherently toothless when factors like class are removed implicit bias affects Forrest Whitaker in ways it will never affect Jared Fogle no matter how many mayo packets the latter stuffs in his pockets at a deli You didnt hear it from meIn other words white people dont have representatives because white people dont have dehumanizing stereotypes for their representatives to embody or debunk and whiteness is simply too ingrained in positions of power for these stereotypes to manifest any real economic or political consequences And while blackness Latinoness Asianness etc are often defined by actions and abilities  what they do  white society kicks out its undesirables by pointing to their other identities  what they are As Hari Kondabolu points out in his live act James Holmes was described in the press as mentally ill while SeungHui Cho is Asian without elaboration Literal Caucasians the Tsarnaev brothers were declared solely Muslim as soon as it was discovered that they could beOne reason that whiteness is uniquely downgradable is that white people are so massively overrepresented  in media politics management positions marijuana possession etc  that internal diversity or at least the appearance of internal diversity is inevitable And its in this diversity that things get interestingWe live in a society in which ones identity is often defined by ones most disenfranchised demographic stat Sometimes this is for clear and admirable political ends as with the many celebrities whove come out as queer to serve as beacons for bullied queer teens Sometimes its to more troubling and involuntary ends like the poverty stereotypes of Honey Boo Boo And sometimes its craven powerlessness performance Im looking at you Mens Rights Activists and Nice Guys Of OKCupidLike the unextinctable hipster racists that Lester Bangs wrote about way back in 1979 some of us do obscene things to affirm ourselves as powerless and we cant face the cognitive dissonance that comes with owning up to our own role in injustice Collegeparty blackface and warbonnets are dismissed as just a joke antiAsian Youtube rants by white kids are claimed to have been made only for a select audience and then uh uploaded to Youtube Daniel Toshs endless jokes about raping women and committing violence against trans folks enjoy a national audience through his TV show and criticism of them is invariably framed as oppressing free speech This theory of global power in which mean social justice bloggers rule all with an iron fist was clearly come up with in a hurryBut largely its only within whiteness neutrality that these stereotypes stand isolated without being trumped by race in the public perception of the individual And thus we have a queer rights movement whose foremost representatives are white a feminist movement whose foremost representatives are white and Brad Paisley requesting emotional reparations for Southerners with zero acknowledgement of the Black communities whove lived in the South since before they had a say in the matter This both erases and foregrounds whiteness atomizing it Barack Obama and John McCain both allied themselves with Christian Pastor Rick Warren not White Person Rick Warren but it would have been impossible for them to conduct the same calculus with a rural black or Asian or Latino Christian pastor no matter what size the congregationIn my 32 years as a white person Ive selfidentified at various points as a Midwesterner a feminist a nerd a poor person a redneck a queer ally an atheist a punk a Unitarian a college dropout a person with ongoing mental health issues and any number of other nouns optin or otherwise which I experience on a uniquely empty palette as a straight white cisgender male Some of them have had actual social and economic ramifications on my life and some of them have just been me trying to feel special But all of them are boxes inside a box too large to see the walls of when a straight cisgender white male with mental health issues gets in the news for something horrible I know the box is large enough for me to step away from him And when my perspective on that box is shifted without my permission like when a friend asks me why white people are so weird I compulsively stick out my arms and legs and refuse to fit inThis isnt a positive trait in my opinion As W Kamau Bell says our society would be better off with real white pride an acknowledgement that white history is just as valid or invalid a category as black historyVery recently I was at a good friends 30th birthday party with a bunch of white people with shaggy hair and silly clothes  identical to myself in other words When the dance playlist hit up Ol Dirty Bastards Got Your Money one of the attendees yelled REST IN PEACE ODB and everyone flooded to the dance floor to embarrass themselves It felt weirdly gross to me and I immediately remembered how much I loved this album ten years ago and how a white friend and I recorded a full album of covers with me singrapping with all the racial epithets left in Shame and hot blood flooded my face and as I scanned the room for Instagrammers to step behind I searched for an appropriate box to put these people inHipsters I thought to myselfThis story originally said that the comedian Hari Kondabolu told a joke about Jared Loughner The person referenced in the joke was James Holmes  Copyright 2014 NPR,20130514,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2013/04/12/177037315/while-congress-slumbers-laws-pass-elsewhere?ft=3&f=,Maybe Barack Obama would be happier as a governor Its early days in his second term but the presidents agenda doesnt appear to have a whole lot of momentum His budget last week was greeted with more criticism than applause from Democrats and Republicans alike Theres been a flurry of activity on Capitol Hill lately regarding immigration and gun control but chances for Obamas proposals to make it into law remain uncertain Thats what life is like when youre working with a divided Congress and few bills can even make it to your desk But many of the ideas Obama favors have already passed into law out in the states Hes made a habit lately of traveling to states that have enacted strict gun control legislation Connecticut has shown the way he said in Hartford last week And now is the time for Congress to do the same Its a comment the president could make on issue after issue Obamas hope of giving tuition help to college students who were brought to this country illegally as children has already been fulfilled in more than a dozen states The presidents call during his State of the Union address to increase the minimum wage to 9 prompted yawns in Congress but helped persuade legislators in New York to approve such a boost in March Maine workers may soon get the same raise If Obama has reason to smile when he scans the horizon of state activity conservatives are even happier A proposal by Louisiana Republican Gov Bobby Jindal to eliminate state income taxes recently blew up on the launching pad but a number of states have slashed personal and corporate income taxes Red states have also placed new limits this year on abortions and on labor unions Its a time of nearly unequaled legislative activity at the state level even as partisan polarization means Washington cant get its act in gear Congress is notoriously slow and now its gotten to where nothing happens practically says Marcie McNelis chairwoman of MultiState Associates a lobbying firm There are certainly businesses and industries and causes that say I cant get it done at a national level so Im going to take it out to the state level  Look To The States The inability of Democrats and Republicans to see eye to eye in Washington has led lots of people to look to the states as friendlier and more productive venues Thats true not only for opponents of abortion but proponents of gay marriage legalized marijuana and environmental policies meant to combat climate change A lot of these issues are more prominent at the state level than the federal level because you know nothing can happen on them at the federal level says Bill Pound executive director of the National Conference of State Legislatures Theres a lot of pentup demand in states to address policy concerns McNelis says because they spent several years dealing almost exclusively with budget issues following the financial crisis of 2008 Now not only are states ready to make changes on taxes education and health but often theres an easier path toward passage than is currently conceivable in Washington Thats because partisan differences are playing out much differently elsewhere in the country Congress might be hopelessly divided between a Democratic Senate and Republican House but in the vast majority of states one party or the other now controls everything  often with legislative supermajorities As a result Democrats are getting their way in blue states such as Connecticut and California while the Republican agenda is unstoppable in Texas and Tennessee Youre not deadlocked necessarily unlike the House and Senate which seldom seem to agree in Washington Pound says States Set The Template Washington remains the venue of choice for many interest groups Business groups in particular have long looked for a single federal law to preempt states when they start creating differing sets of regulations As states pursue their separate paths however theres no federal authority to play referee When it comes to individual rights courts may step in  as the Supreme Court may do this term if they decide that gays have a right to marry nationwide In general this Supreme Court has been respectful of states rights  notably in finding that states dont have to participate in the expansion of Medicaid under Obamas Affordable Care Act On Monday the court refused to hear a case challenging a New York State law that limits the publics ability to carry handguns in public The US has always been historically a highly decentralized country says Edward Rubin a professor of law and political science at Vanderbilt University For the first 100 years most of the basic forms of government were being done in the states The only federal agent anyone would have seen is a postal agent until the 1870s States have long taken the lead as policy innovators acting as laboratories of democracy in one muchquoted phrase from 1932 attributed to Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis The first comprehensive workers compensation law was enacted 102 years ago in Wisconsin and was quickly copied by more than 40 other states Wisconsins experiments with requiring welfare recipients to work became the model for the last major federal legislation on welfare back in 1996 And although Mitt Romney was loath to admit it during last years presidential campaign the health law he shepherded through as governor of Massachusetts requiring individuals to buy insurance provided the template for Obamas own signature legislation Federalism And Its Hypocrites Of course not everyone applauds the laws that states pass  particularly at a time when various states are moving mainly in either liberal or conservative directions Jon Stewart called them the meth laboratories of democracy in a Daily Show segment the other day mocking social policies in the states People are happy about states taking the lead only when their party is out of power in Washington says Boise State University political scientist Gary Moncrief When it comes to federalism were all hypocrites he says These things run in cycles Congress steps in to impose a single standard when there is a clear national consensus on an issue says Rubin coauthor of Federalism Political Identity and Tragic Compromise But on most issues today there isnt anything like consensus Thats why Congress cant act leaving plenty of room for states to experiment There is not likely to be as strong a role for Congress in picking sides between divergent state policies because it gets back to the paralysis of the national government says Tim Conlan a federalism expert at George Mason University Copyright 2014 NPR,20130415,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2013/03/29/175698193/a-state-apart-and-politically-a-world-away?ft=3&f=,Theres a reason President Obama chose Colorado to hold a rally this Wednesday in favor of gun control Among the states this year Democraticcontrolled Colorado has passed the toughest new restrictions on gun rights requiring universal background checks and banning magazines that hold more than 15 rounds of ammunition But if certain liberal wishes have come true in Colorado  recall that it was one of two states last fall that voted to legalize marijuana  things look very different next door in Kansas A raft of conservative legislation has been moving in Kansas this year including a measure that allows people to carry concealed weapons into public buildings The Republicandominated government also has put new restrictions on abortion and made it harder for teachers to donate to union political activities I live probably about 12 miles from Kansas says Greg Brophy a Republican state senator from eastern Colorado I like Colorado better but I have to admit their Kansas politics has more appeal to me right now thats for sure A New Phenomenon This sort of dynamic is playing out across the country On a wide variety of issues  gay marriage tax policy implementing Obamacare the death penalty  states are moving in polar opposite directions from one another This is very much a new phenomenon drawing really clear lines between the states says Ray Scheppach former executive director of the National Governors Association Those divisions mean people are living in political cultures that are starting to look entirely different from one another Thats likely to polarize the nations politics even further Most of the policy innovation has come from the states but weve never had a country thats so ideologically segmented as it is right now says Susan MacManus a University of South Florida political scientist How It Happened By now the notion that most states are either Democratic blue or Republican red is a fairly shopworn idea But its increasingly true Even as presidential voting has remained reasonably close on a national level the states are split far apart Last year Obama won nationally by 4 percentage points but the winning margin of victory for either candidate was under 5 percent in only four states Florida North Carolina Ohio and Virginia Victory was totally lopsided in half the states with margins of more than 15 percent States are just as divided internally In last years elections blue states got bluer while red states grew redder The parties now share legislative control in only three states  Iowa Kentucky and New Hampshire  which is the lowest number since 1944 One party controls both the legislature and the governorship in all but a dozen states  with vetoproof supermajority control in half the chambers nationwide The result has been that legislation in most states now strongly comports with the wishes of one party or the other In previous years new policies might have originated in either Democratic or Republican states but they tended to spread eventually pretty much everywhere regardless of partisan leanings says Scheppach who now teaches at the University of Virginia Now though states are following almost entirely separate and distinct tracks Its a new phenomenon and I dont think its a particularly good one he says It makes all politicians much more ideological which means not negotiating our differences A Patchwork On Abortion With the Supreme Court considering gay marriage theres been a lot of speculation about whether justices would make policies uniform or let state laws differ There have been comparisons to the 1973 abortion decision in Roe v Wade which appeared to set a national standard but has in fact triggered a wide variance among states as conservatives find new ways to limit abortion rights Thats been especially true recently with Republicans in states such as North Dakota and Arkansas passing strict limitations on abortions last month For a woman who lives in New York her constitutional rights around reproductive choices are just stronger than a woman who lives in Mississippi says Julie Rikelman director of litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights A number of states have passed abortion restrictions over the past couple of years while a few are looking into ways of expanding access to abortion Washington state is considering a measure to require health insurers to pay for abortions for instance while California may increase the number of health professionals allowed to perform surgical abortions Its better for the states to undergo this sort of tumultuous sorting out of abortion policy than having the courts impose a single standard by fiat says Dan McConchie vice president for government affairs at Americans United for Life The Supreme Court by taking this out of the public sphere with Roe actually created this trench warfare he says Your only alternative is to let the democratic process work even if that results in a patchwork Its Not Just Social Issues Several red states are looking into abolishing income taxes altogether while income taxes have been raised or might yet go up in places such as Maryland Massachusetts and Minnesota Environmental policy also looks a lot different depending on where you live States have roughly split themselves in half over the past decade when it comes to the question of addressing climate change or not Now neighboring states such as Pennsylvania and New York are taking totally different approaches when it comes to allowing fracking for natural gas It is a tale of two nations says Barry Rabe an expert on environmental policy at the University of Michigan We see states going in dramatically different directions Its happening on almost every issue Ten years ago you couldnt tell the difference between Republican and Democratic governors on some issues says Scheppach the former governors association official Theyre becoming more extensions of their respective parties so Im afraid that gulf is going to get larger Copyright 2014 NPR,20130401,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2013/02/14/171822608/the-drug-laws-that-changed-how-we-punish?ft=3&f=,The United States puts more people behind bars than any other country five times as many per capita compared with Britain or Spain It wasnt always like this Half a century ago relatively few people were locked up and those inmates generally served short sentences But 40 years ago New York passed strict sentencing guidelines known as the Rockefeller drug laws  after their champion Gov Nelson Rockefeller  that put even lowlevel criminals behind bars for decades Those toughoncrime policies became the new normal across the country But a new debate is under way over the effectiveness of tough sentencing laws Life Sentence No Parole In a little town in northern New York called Ray Brook an old hospital and a complex for athletes who competed in the Winter Olympics in nearby Lake Placid now house inmates One is a state prison the other a federal correctional facility Theyre part of a massive infrastructure that sprang up in America over the past 40 years a prison network that now houses more than 2 million people The thing that sparked the prison boom was a new set of ideas about how communities and neighborhoods could be made safer Rewind to the 1970s New York City was battling a heroin epidemic there were junkies on street corners The homicide rate was four times as high as it is today Rockefeller New Yorks Republican governor had backed drug rehabilitation job training and housing He saw drugs as a social problem not a criminal one But the political mood was hardening President Richard Nixon declared a national war on drugs and movies like The French Connection and Panic in Needle Park helped spread the sense that Americas cities were unraveling Late in 1972 one of Rockefellers closest aides Joseph Persico was in a meeting with the governor He says Rockefeller suddenly did a dramatic aboutface Finally he turned and said For drug pushing life sentence no parole no probation says Persico That was the moment when one of the seeds of the modern prison system was planted Persico says Rockefeller decided that more progressive approaches to drug addiction had simply failed The governor had heard about this new zerotolerance approach to crime while studying Japans war on drugs And we all looked a little bit shocked and one of the staff said Sounds a little bit severe And he said Thats because you dont understand the problem And then we realized he was very serious Persico says Rockefeller launched his campaign to toughen New Yorks laws at a press conference in January 1973  almost exactly 40 years ago He called for something unheard of mandatory prison sentences of 15 years to life for drug dealers and addicts  even those caught with small amounts of marijuana cocaine or heroin I have one goal and one objective and that is to stop the pushing of drugs and to protect the innocent victim Rockefeller said Getting Tough Catches On From the start Rockefellers policy drew sharp criticism from drug treatment experts and some politicians who called the sentences draconian But no one really understood what the laws would mean or how many millions of people they would touch Albert Rosenblatt was a prosecutor at the time and wrote the first book detailing how district attorneys would implement the new rules I dont remember thinking or believing nor did my colleague DAs at the time that this was going to somehow revolutionize and change everything Rosenblatt says The Rockefeller drug laws sailed through New Yorks Legislature And pretty quickly this idea of getting tough even on petty criminals went viral spreading across the US Other states started adopting mandatory minimum and threestrikes laws  and so did the federal government But Rosenblatt says prosecutors in New York realized that the laws were doing unexpected and troubling things White people were using a lot of drugs in the 1970s and committing a lot of crimes yet the people being arrested and sent to prison under the Rockefeller laws came almost entirely from poor black and Hispanic neighborhoods We were aware of it I mean its hard not to be aware of it when you see a courtroom and when you see a cadre of defendants  many of whom or most of whom were people of color Rosenblatt says Due in part to Rockefellerstyle laws the nations prison population exploded from 330000 in 1973 to a peak of 23 million That meant building hundreds of new state and federal prisons By 2010 more than 490000 people were working as prison guards The House That Rockefeller Built Journalist and historian Scott Christianson has written for decades about drug crime and Americas prison system He says were just coming to terms with the impact of these policies  on poor neighborhoods on race relations and on taxpayers I think that this state and our society really has to do some hard thinking and to reflect on the impact of this longterm war on drugs  what it has meant for our society and what it has cost Christianson says Cost is one thing driving this reexamination Studies put the price tag of Americas vast prison system at between 63 billion and 75 billion a year New Yorks sentencing rules were partially reformed in 2009 contributing to the closure of nine state prisons so far Politicians in other cashstrapped states like California have also moved to slash the number of people behind bars But most of the country still lives in the house that Rockefeller built Half a million Americans are serving long sentences for nonviolent drug offenses Those inmates make up 48 percent of the inmate population in federal prisons Persico the aide who helped push through Rockefellers drug laws says new scrutiny for the policy is overdue I concluded very early that this was a failure Its filling up the prisons firsttime offenders Persico says This was obviously unjust  and not just unjust it was unwise it was ineffective This debate is far from over Supporters of mandatory minimums say the policy has helped reduce crime in some cities including New York and they point to modest declines in the use of some drugs particularly cocaine Persico says Rockefeller himself never expressed any second thoughts or reservations about the policy that carries his name This story is produced by NPR in cooperation with North

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2012/12/26/168068305/when-it-comes-to-politics-states-are-barely-united?ft=3&f=,States in this country are becoming like an unhappy couple Theyve always had their differences but their arguments have gotten so chronic that theyre hardly talking to each other Whether the topic is abortion tax policy marijuana or guns Democratic blue states such as California and Illinois are bound to take a different tack than Republican red states such as Georgia and Kansas Were very likely to have legal gay marriage in most of the blue states and some of the purple states before the next presidential election says Whit Ayres a Republican consultant Youll never have gay marriage in Mississippi and Alabama unless a court happens to impose it Ayres argues that states taking not just different but opposite approaches to the most contentious issues of the day is a healthy expression of different attitudes and an indicator of the genius of our federal system Not all political observers are so sanguine Having states moving rapidly apart from one another naturally makes finding consensus in the country far more difficult People in California becoming convinced that those in Tennessee are crazy  and vice versa  has fed polarization not only within states but in Washington where everyone is supposed to get together and work things out Weve seen polarization among political elites for quite some time says Elizabeth TheissMorse who chairs the political science department at the University of Nebraska Its gotten wider at the national level and were seeing it more and more at the state level Deeper Shades Last month states voted mostly according to their usual patterns  only more so At the presidential level Barack Obama carried the exact set of states he won four years ago excepting Indiana and North Carolina which reverted to their usual habit of voting Republican While Obamas margin of victory was less than it was in 2008 the number of states that were decided narrowly by fewer than 5 percentage points actually went down That means more states are voting heavily for one candidate or another The Economist concludes States may have gotten bluer or redder at the presidential level but that was nothing compared with the deep partisan divides in voting for state offices Only three state legislatures  Iowa New Hampshire and Kentucky  are now divided meaning both parties control one chamber each Thats the lowest number since 1928 although the picture has gotten a bit more complicated since the election with bipartisan powersharing arrangements in places such as New York and Washington state In most states not only does one party have control it dominates Fully half the legislative chambers in the country are now held by supermajorities That makes compromise unnecessary  especially since the same party will hold the governorship as well as the legislature in all but a dozen states Rather than a wave moving in one partys favor crosscurrents have moved the states apart This hardly ever happens where the blue states get bluer and the red states redder instead of the whole country going in one direction says Thad Kousser a political scientist at the University of California San Diego Pulling Apart Its the opposite of a collision course With such contrasting political cultures states are bound to move further and further away from one another when it comes to setting policy This was evident almost immediately following the recent school shootings in Newtown Conn Even before the National Rifle Association issued its call to arm school personnel legislators in red states such as Tennessee and Missouri had proposed legislation to require just that In Democratic states such as California however there was talk of tightening restrictions on assaultstyle weapons and ammunition with gun buyback programs hastily arranged at the local level Its magnified in the moment but I expect red states will vote to expand gun rights and the blue states will seek to enact gun control legislation says Scott Melzer an expert on gun politics at Albion College in Michigan Its the same on issue after issue whether its governmentfunded health care climate change or teaching evolution That necessarily moves people further from the notion of compromise says Bill Bishop editor of The Daily Yonder which covers rural issues There are fewer of those crosscutting issues where youre enemies one day and friends the next he says It will further reinforce the movement of people to get in their tribes Still Sorting Bishop wrote about the increasing tendency of Americans to live among people who think politically like themselves in his book The Big Sort In 1976 he says just over a quarter of all Americans lived in what he called landslide counties which either of the presidential candidates carried by margins of at least 20 percent Now more than half reside in landslide counties There are plenty of Republicans living in every blue state of course and the same is true about Democrats living in states dominated by the GOP But increasingly states are voting entirely one way or the other If you look at the map of state control it looks an awful lot like the presidential map with only a few exceptions  notably GOP control of a few Obamasupporting states such as Virginia Florida and parts of the Upper Midwest Open Airing Of Difference Ayres the Republican consultant says thats just fine Alabamas political culture is a lot different from Oregons so its perfectly reasonable for public policy in those states to represent differing attitudes With Washington so mired in argument it might not be entirely a bad thing for states to address marijuana regulation and health care differently says Lara Brown a political scientist at Villanova University Maybe the most productive way out of this current polarization is to stop making it an either or and start making it a both kind of reality she says All our peoples diversity of beliefs may end up better expressed and realized Thats putting things in a positive light But constant disagreement about how to tackle issues may instead make it harder to forge agreement on a national level suggests TheissMorse the Nebraska professor Voters in different states seem increasingly convinced that people who live elsewhere and think differently are not just wrong but unreasonable What we increasingly see in politics and government is that its a zerosum game  that one side wins and the other side loses TheissMorse says Its this view that if the other side gets anything then weve lost Copyright 2014 NPR,20121227,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/12/06/166658788/crime-ridden-camden-to-dump-city-police-force?ft=3&f=,As the New Jersey city of Camden blasts through its alltimehigh homicide record  exceeding 60 murders so far this year  city officials have an unusual solution to rising crime laying off the entire police department Year after year Camden ranks as one of the most dangerous cities in America based on several categories murders rapes assaults and robberies But the city says its too poor to hire more police officers So its dissolving its municipal police force and letting the county set up a bigger cheaper force to replace it Camden officials say its the only affordable way to bring down crime but critics call the strategy a deliberate move to bust the police union A Union Contract Thats Too Generous City Says The only business thats lucrative in this 9squaremile city is selling drugs and the police say they cant keep up with the crime A consultant to the police department says during most night shifts  the busiest shift  only 12 officers are patrolling the entire city Camden City Police Chief Scott Thomson says he often doesnt have enough officers to respond to all the 911 calls We dont have property crime detectives anymore I have shooting investigations that are backlogging like burglary cases Thomson says The status quo means that the people in our city are being shot and murdered at Third World country rates Thomson will be leading the new 400member countywide force when it gets up and running during the first quarter of 2013 Hes a man whos already used to living lean Thomson calls food a privilege and snacks only on packages of peeled apple slices to get through workdays lasting 16 hours or longer Last January because of budget cuts the city laid off almost half of his police force Thomson says he lost his entire homicide unit and narcotics unit in one fell swoop Drug dealers printed Tshirts that read January 18 2011 Its Our Time  Now Camden has only 230 active cops to police this city of 77000 And Thomson says even that is overstating his actual resources Of the 230 on a daily basis our average is a 30 percent absentee rate Its a combination of calling in sick and using leave time Thomson explained That puts us at 1930s staffing levels Still Camden spends about 75 percent of its budget on its police and fire departments But if a car accident doesnt result in injuries the police wont show up Attempted murder cases are withering without detectives to investigate The city wants to hire more officers but officials say the police union contract includes so many expensive benefits they cant afford any more cops What happens when the city can no longer pay What happens when you price yourself potentially out of the market says Joe Cordero a former New York City police officer whos helping Camden design the bigger countywide police force thats going to replace the city force Cordero says in his 30 years in law enforcement hes never seen a police contract laden with so many riches Camden officers now get 4 percent more pay if they work a day shift and a 10 percent bump at night Additional seniority payments can increase an officers pay by 3 to 11 percent after five years of service These and other fringe benefits nearly double a cops base salary here according to city officials Cordero says lots of other cities have expensive police contracts too Even if those contracts arent as generous as Camdens he says those cities will wind up outsourcing their police as well Its the way of policing of the future Its where policing is going Cordero says This serves as the only viable vehicle for getting enough police officers on the streets of Camden so their citizens have a fighting chance There are very few choices here A City Ravaged By The Drug Trade Camden today is a ghost of the thriving industrial center it used to be in the 1930s and 40s More than 40 percent of residents now live below the poverty line Factory jobs at Campbells Soup and RCA left decades ago On one afternoon drive with Thomson signs of Camdens 175 openair drug markets quickly cropped up Within half an hour Thomson floored the gas pedal and hurtled to something in the distance that caught his eye A man in a white jacket was fleeing and a woman started racing to her car When Thomson arrived the keys were already in the ignition Within seconds the woman in the car admitted she was trying to buy heroin Thomson pointed to her arms There are track marks all over your arms he said Yeah Im in a methadone clinic though she mumbled staring at the ground Constant demand for drugs flows into the city Police estimate that thousands of individuals show up from outside Camden on any given day with cash in hand Terrell Smith whos lived in Camden for 25 years says that kind of business is hard to pass up Whatever people coming from out of town want guys are supplying This is the highway right here  crack weed dope pills whatever Whatever they want to buy jokers gonna sell it to them People say they turn to crime because they cant make money doing anything else Whenever theres a drug arrest new dealers quickly fill the void They dont even try to hide most of the time because the threat of getting arrested is so low Mostly around here they yelling it out  what they got and how good it is says Scott who didnt want to use his last name but disclosed that hes a heroin addict and a former drug dealer Even to the people thats not even using they just broadcasting it out They just give themselves away Drugs have fueled ghastly crimes in Camden This August a mother high on PCP decapitated her 2yearold son Days after that a man also on PCP sexually assaulted a 12yearold girl and then killed her 6yearold brother by slitting his throat To get away from the crime many residents just spend their days holed up in their homes often behind iron bars that extend from firstfloor rooftops all the way to the ground People here call these encased front porches bird cages On the streets the litter isnt soda cans or candy wrappers Instead you see colorful plastic bags that any resident can easily decode for you  heroin marijuana cocaine needle wrappers Undoing Years Of Collective Bargaining Critics Say This nearly broke city will get 130 additional police officers with the same money its spending now  about 65 million  by dumping the most expensive fringe benefits Mayor Dana Redd says the county will try to hire back as many current Camden cops as it can But if it hires more than half of them the old contract has to remain in place  and no one can afford that contract anymore For far too long she says the city signed police contracts it couldnt afford because saying no to the police union never felt like an option In Camden the sacred cows that never got touched were police and fire Redd says So I think it became a sense of entitlement Everyone else gets laid off but not us  John Williamson president of Camdens police union has negotiated three police contracts with the city and says each time the terms were agreed upon fairly and with the citys financial health in mind You have to take into consideration that all of the other administrations understood the fact that we are working in some of the poorest and most dangerous conditions in the country says Williamson I would say that they more or less wanted to compensate us for putting our lives on the line in one of the most dangerous cities in America Williamson agrees some of the perks in the contract are generous and says hes willing to sit down with the city to come up with a plan to avoid mass layoffs But hes skeptical He says the government is exaggerating about large numbers of officers skipping work Its a clear attempt to make the current officers look like theyre either inefficient or lazy or goldbrickers Williamson says Some law enforcement experts agree the city is being heavyhanded Eugene ODonnell of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice is both a former prosecutor and former New York City cop He says the Camden plan is a disguised attempt to trample a police union and undo years of collective bargaining This is a threat to every police officer in the United States because ultimately if it can happen in Camden it can happen elsewhere says ODonnell Police officers struggled long and hard to get into the middle class and this is a draconian measure that threatens the existence of the policing profession as a middleclass job Residents Trapped In Their Bird Cages In the end though the arrows flying back and forth between the city and its police officers dont mean much to the residents trapped in their bird cages Many such as Tanya Maldonado have already lost whats most important to them Almost five months ago Maldonados boyfriend was shot in broad daylight just a couple of blocks from their daughters school He sold drugs and Maldonado thinks he got in a dispute over drug territory Shes sitting next to a makeshift memorial she made for him on the front porch of the house after having just replaced the flowers with fresh ones today I always have to be involved doing something Buying flowers or driving by here or lighting a candle or something says Maldonado Something that shows these guys out here that somebody still loves him and hes always thought of and hes never going to be forgotten Ever These memorials to shooting victims are the landscape of Camden  clumps of candles stuffed animals liquor bottles Theyre displayed on front steps at the side of houses on empty lots A threehour walk revealed a dozen more memorials like Maldonados  but no police car patrolling the streets Copyright 2014 NPR,20121206,marijuana

Kenyas Swahili Coast where the warm Indian Ocean greets the continents powderwhite beaches some families now encourage underage girls to sell their bodies to male tourists to earn money The arrangement is what a girl calls mzungu wangu  my white foreigner in Swahili On the coast brokers for sex tourism are called beach boys because thats where you find them At a local tavern a woman in a tight Tshirt chats with a beach boy nicknamed Rasta to see if he has any clients for her Rasta laughs easily and tucks his dreadlocks under his marijuanaleaf hat He has agreed to discuss his trade Most of the tourists  like the teenagers the young ladies he says One Italian man always requests young girls he says and offers to pay more for them But Rasta says he has two daughters himself and he will not procure underage prostitutes for tourists He sends them to other beach boys who will Within the Giriama ethnic group on Kenyas coast pushing young girls into early marriage or sexual activity is often passed off as merely the tradition of an underdeveloped uneducated people Challenges To Curbing Exploitation A project spearheaded by the charity Catholic Relief Services is trying to change that notion Giriama elders or kayas have been enlisted in an interfaith council that seeks to reach people and inform them that it is illegal for girls younger than 17 to marry and that violators can go to prison John Baya Mitsanze dresses in blue and white scarves that signify he is a Giriama traditional leader Its a big problem a serious problem  especially when you have young girls getting pregnant while in school Mitsanze says Poverty is actually the driving force Our cultural values are being seriously eroded UNICEF studied sexual exploitation of children in Malindi and listed several reasons why the crimes go unreported cultural acceptance a complicated verification process for sex crimes against minors and rampant corruption among police who demand bribes to take action The Malindi Child Protection Center was opened by the government three years ago to try to curb early marriage Naomi Kazungu is its manager Its like when you have a case and its supposed to be taken to court and its for a child like its an early marriage case nobody can give you money Kazungu says meaning that there is no one to pay off the police in order to pursue the case She says she has referred 13 such cases to the police but they have made no arrests Local leaders are so concerned that Malindi is gaining a worldwide reputation for sex tourism that the local marine association is launching a campaign against child sex exploitation Steve Trott is the chairman What we are seeing is certain tourists coming from mainly from Europe coming here for the sun sex and sand experience Trott says And thats something we need to stop it in its tracks A Principals Passionate Battle If theres a hero in this story it is Esther Kutto principal of Dabaso Primary School in the beach resort of Watamu Her teachers act like social workers If they notice a girl has dropped out of school they go looking for her And if they find that the girl has been married off or sold to a white foreigner they notify the police Like the kaya elders Kutto educates her students parents that early marriage is wrong They did not know even what the rights of the children were But now that we are teaching the children of their rights they also in turn go to teach their parents about their rights she says In fact one of the basic rights of the young children is education Kutto says underage pregnancies at her school have dropped from 29 in 2009 to five so far this year So passionate is the principal about saving girls from early marriage that two years ago she repaid a bride price of 70 for one of her students who had been married off She snatched the teenager away from her indignant husband and brought her back to school The girl is about to graduate and Kutto expects her to become an advocate to convince other girls to take a stand against early marriage and sexual exploitation Copyright 2014 NPR,20121203,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/11/24/165776654/legal-pot-has-arrived-now-what?ft=3&f=,On Election Day voters in Colorado and Washington state legalized the use of marijuana for recreational use Whats next No really what happens now Residents in the MileHigh State are already looking to buy says William Breathes a professional pot critic for the Denver alternative weekly Westword By the way thats a pen name for reasons that may be obvious I was in a shop the day after the amendment had passed here and the shop owners were getting calls left and right from people asking if they could just come in and buy marijuana legally Breathes tells NPRs Jacki Lyden People are just expecting to be able to walk into these medical stores right away But they cant  at least not until next year Like Washington Colorado still needs to set up a regulatory framework to handle what is expected to be a big expansion of its marijuana market even though the state already has more medical marijuana dispensaries than it has Starbucks The growth of that industry has been remarkable to watch Breathes has written Three years ago he was hardpressed to find pot more potent than bud from a dedicated grower with a few basement lamps But now you see some really beautiful product in the stores he says Some really wellgrown medicine And also prices have come down from nearly 400 an ounce in 2009 to around 250 today When legalization is fully implemented prices could fall even further Theres a big market for it I think people really want to get out and get to these shops Breathes says Its pretty interesting and really liberating to go into a store and purchase marijuana legally Its just a matter of seeing whos going to step up and open the first recreational shop Thats because it could open the door to a clash between the state and federal government which still classifies pot as an illegal drug With lawmakers in Rhode Island and Maine planning to introduce legalization bills next year Daily Beast reporter Tony Dokoupil says the question of legalized marijuana across the nation is not whether but when 2014 he says Big pot is here Rebounding From Reagan The push toward legalization may seem like a modern movement But Peter Bourne who served as President Jimmy Carters drug czar in the late 70s says its been a long time coming The Carter administrations position basically was that the penalty for marijuana use did infinitely more damage to people and their lives than the drug did he says So Carter asked Congress to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana and suggested states be free to legalize if they chose Prolegalization advocacy groups ran ads on television in support of the president Legalization seemed inevitable Then came the Reagan administration President Reagan famously called pot the most dangerous drug in the United States and by the end of the 80s Nancy Reagans Just Say No campaign had made the issue of legalization far less popular To me Bourne says thats equivalent to telling somebody whos depressed to have a nice day Reagan successfully changed the national conversation around marijuana use Bourne says But before that happened big tobacco companies were poised to get in on the act I was in fairly regular discussion with the tobacco people Bourne says They very clearly had contingency plans that they developed to grow and market marijuana should it be legalized Big Weed And Room To Grow Now that legal pot is here will cigarette companies dust off their old plans for mass commercialization Tony Dokoupil a reporter for Newsweek and The Daily Beast who has written about the changing legal status of marijuana says theyd like to  if history is any indication In the 70s he says there were highlevel conversations about adding marijuana to tobacco creating a line of marijuana cigarettes and being ready to jump in and market this As recently as 1993 when it looked like France was poised to legalize marijuana Philip Morris trademarked the name Marley But when the estate of Bob Marley complained the company claimed it had nothing to do with the reggae singer Philip Morris said No no it could be any kind of Marley  Dokoupil says like Jacob Marley the cheap cantankerous teetotaler from A Christmas Carol Cigarette companies are staying mum on whether customers could see Marleylike products in the US anytime soon But Dokoupil says the regulatory market such products would enter into  once it was created  could look a lot like the forprofit regulatory model in Colorado now Theres a ban on advertising he explains There are cameras that track the marijuana from bloom to endconsumer so the diversion into the black market is limited There are extensive background checks on people who are part of the marketplace  so if you want to open a marijuana shop you have to go through an extensive background check Once that model is in place the consumer side of things might look a lot like Starbucks I think you will have a variety of products at different levels of intensity exactly like Starbucks Dokoupil says You might be able to walk in there and in the case theyll have 12 different strains of cannabis Behind the counter there might be hash There might be edibles like fizzy drinks or brownies There could be a hot dog wheel turning You could put THC in anything And according to Breathes legal weed could even draw tourism to states that offer it I got a lot of emails from people really excited about this  he says Theyre looking forward to visiting Colorado now Copyright 2014

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/11/13/164981433/legalizing-and-regulating-pot-a-growth-industry?ft=3&f=,When reporter Tony Dokoupil was a teenager he found out that his father had sold marijuana but he just thought his parents were hippies A few years ago while working on a story about his fathers drug dealer past he discovered that actually in the 1970s and 80s his father Anthony Dokoupil had been a bigtime marijuana smugglerHe was arrested in the early 90s on a job selling 17 tons of marijuana Dokoupil tells Fresh Airs Terry Gross which was enough at the time to roll a joint for every college kid in the USDokoupil is now writing a book about the controversial plant and is the author of the recent Newsweek cover story The New Pot Barons about the group of entrepreneurs who are growing medical marijuana in Colorado and hoping to cash in on the plants recent legalization there for recreational use On Election Day Colorado and Washington became the first states to greenlight marijuana for recreational use which is big news for the expanding marijuana industryIf legalization is here to stay Dokoupil says Colorados tightly regulated forprofit medical marijuana market will likely be the basis for the legalized recreational markets in other states as well In Colorado more than 1 million square feet of warehouse space outside of Denver are dedicated to growing marijuana and hundreds of dispensaries sell it To manage this growing business the state has 200plus pages of regulation to explain what is legal and isnt Marijuana grown in the state says Dokoupil is tracked from the time it blooms to final sale  every single ounce is accounted forInterview HighlightsOn the initial Green RushAfter Eric Holder and the Obama administration suggested that they werent going to crack down on medical marijuana everybody and their brother grabbed a trash bag full of weed out of their backyard and were like All right medical marijuana here for sale  Then Colorado was really interesting  because theres a core of young educated politically connected and wellfinanced guys who said Whoa whoa whoa We cant have former black market drug dealers and bikini girls as the face of our industry because the communitys not going to accept itSo they partnered with law enforcement They partnered with state legislators They hired incredibly highlevel political consultants and lobbyists who have worked nationally And they are the inside force that led to the creation of Colorados regulated medical marijuana industry which is unlike any in the country and which will be the basis for the legalized regulated market And so in response to the craziness that we saw in 2009  a movement toward controlled regulated notinyourface nonconfrontational pot culture has begunOn Colorados tightly regulated commercial medical marijuana growing marketSo in Colorado the medical marijuana growers have to have 24hour video of their operations and that video is accessible by the state at any time  they can tap into it And they all have these badges and they had to go through background checks to get these badges So theres an attempt to keep black market money out of it  in Colorado youre unlikely to see a situation where a dispensary is in fact just a front for a Mexican cartel And then they had this additional rule which is pretty revolutionary  its called a 7030 rule where 70 percent of all the marijuana that each store sells they have to grow themselves  That goes a long way to eliminating the introduction of black market weed  Stores arent just buying all their weed from Mexican cartels and marking it up Thats a huge reason why the feds have focused on California California doesnt have tight regulations on who grows marijuana where it comes from So the feds move in and what they claim is that these med marijuana businesses are fronts for what are in fact just oldschool black market drug dealers And theyre not growing medical marijuana in small batches for patients Theyre growing it in Mexico or theyre growing it in the hills and theyre just bringing it in and it suddenly magically becomes legal once it gets in the store But in fact its based on illegality Colorado doesnt have thatOn the commercial potgrowing houses in ColoradoI hope that in the future there are tours of marijuana warehouses in the same way that there are tours of breweries today because its really incredible By law you have to grow indoors in Colorado And to do that these rooms are rigged with lights that mimic the effects of sunlight to grow the plant and different rooms have different seasons And theres a perpetual grow and different plants require different kinds of sunlight So you walk into these warehouses and at first you dont see anything because the actual plants are inside smaller rooms within rooms And all you hear is the buzz of electricity Its damp  you expect a forklift to come in from a side door And you get a little deeper in and you open one of these doors which are about the size of like Winnebagos where the actual plants are and your eyes just recognize Oh my god  its summer sunshine Its like you want lemonadeAnd then you see a field of plants waving gently because theyre stirred by fans and there will be classical music playing or there will be hard rock depending on what the grower says the plant likes And then you go to another room and you open the door and it will have like a honeycoated light and youll be like Oh fall I want a pumpkin latte  how beautiful And there will be workers in there too And the workers are like the Keebler Elves of cannabis They live among the plants They sleep there Theyre caring for the plants constantly Theyre deeply devoutly about the plant and theyre usually shirtless or walking around barefootOn the threat of big marijuana businessWeve seen legalization in two states  thats the first step toward legalization in other states Thats a step toward legalization nationally So you have a third vice industry like tobacco and like alcohol The problem with that is that 80 percent of the profits tobacco companies and alcohol companies make comes from heavy users The business model is based on people consuming more than they should And so theres a strong economic incentive for big marijuana companies to create as much addiction as possible And yeah sure marijuana is less harmful than Jack Daniels but its not the same thing as safe or helpful in the home or helpful in the workplace or goodAnd so the longterm worry is that you have sophisticated marketing programs in place distribution programs in place that create a double or tripling of the current level of marijuana usage And  by the way Americans already use marijuana at triple the global average So were talking about a tripling of a tripling and thats a big deal Its something to think about which is why many people are in favor of  or I believe will become more in favor of as they realize the risks  of severe limitations on the size of marijuana businesses and the advertising that they can undertakeOn the cult of marijuana smugglers like his father in the 70s and 80sThe people who were defying President Reagan and before that Nixon are not typical characters So the golden era of marijuana is considered to be the 70s and early 80s and the swashbuckling hero types who brought in marijuana at a time when the government was trying to crush marijuana culture  those people are not theyre just not normal people They dont have normal egos They dont have normal connections to substances themselves They see themselves as larger than life Theyre entitled to whatever comedowns they should want in exchange for the fantastic good theyve done flooding the market with good marijuanaAnd by the way this is not them just saying that this is how theyre seen This is the way how people in the 70s and 80s saw marijuana smugglers  they saw them as heroes Theres a very very interesting article written by Timothy Leary the aciddropping Harvard professor called The Dope Dealer as Robin Hood and it makes the case that the folk hero of the 70s is the marijuana smuggler  as important as rock stars and underground artists And this was an influential article  it was reprinted in High Times And then even more recently when my article came out I had people write to me and say Oh your father is the Rosa Parks of legalization I was like Oh my God What  Copyright 2014 NPR,20121113,marijuana

about losing vision in one eye because of cancer that said In the 60s during a period of experimenting with large doses of amphetamines I experienced a different sort of vivid mental imageryHe expands on this footnote in his new book Hallucinations where he writes about various types of hallucinations  visions triggered by grief brain injury migraines medications and neurological disordersOne chapter of the new book deals with altered states and Sacks personal experimentation with hallucinogenic and mindaltering drugs in the 60s He says the first time he tried marijuana it induced fascinating perceptual distortion He was looking at his hand and it appeared to be retreating from him yet getting larger and largerI was fascinated that one could have such perceptual changes and also that they went with a certain feeling of significance an almost numinous feeling Im strongly atheist by disposition but nonetheless when this happened I couldnt help thinking That must be what the hand of God is like Sacks tells Fresh Airs Terry Gross that he has always been fascinated with hallucinations  from reading about Pips hallucination of Miss Havisham in Charles Dickens Great Expectations to witnessing hallucinations of every sort as a medical student and doctor He had a personal interest in the phenomenon he explains because his brother was a schizophrenic  and would talk with his hallucinationsSacks has also had his share of noninduced hallucinations One day while mountain climbing he experienced an auditory hallucination after an injury that tore most of his thigh muscle and dislocated his knee His first impulse was to go to sleep  but then he heard a voice that he didnt recognize yet trusted No that would be death  he recalls it saying  Go on Youve got to keep going Find a pace you can keep up and keep it up And this was a very clear commanding voice It was a life voice and it was not to be disobeyed Neurologically Sacks speculates that this type of auditory hallucination is something that announces itself in extremity and is the ultimate safeguard some power or propensity which has been built into the structure of the mind the emotions and is not heard by most people in their livesSacks notes that the medicalization of hallucinations really only occurred in the 19th century  and that subsequent to that there was much more anxiety secrecy and shame about hallucinationsI think hallucinations need to be discussed he says There are all sorts of hallucinations and then many sorts which are OK like the ones I think which most of us have in bed at night before we fall asleep when we can see all sorts of patterns or faces and scenesWith the ability to visualize the brain through cuttingedge medical technologies Sacks believes the scientists sense of the brains complexity has been increased its now possible to see exactly whats going on in the brain while people are hallucinatingInterview HighlightsOn a memorable hallucination while taking LSDI had been reading about the color indigo how it had been introduced into the spectrum by Isaac Newton rather late and it seemed no two people quite agreed as to what indigo was and I thought I would like to have an experience of indigo And I built up a sort of pharmacological launchpad with amphetamines and LSD and a little cannabis on top of that and when I was really stoned I said I want to see indigo now And as if thrown by a paintbrush a huge pearshaped blob of the purest indigo appeared on the wallAgain it had this luminous numinous quality I leaped toward it in a sort of ecstasy I thought This is the color of heaven  I thought maybe this is not a color which actually exists on the Earth or maybe it used to exist or no longer exists All this went through my mind in 4 or 5 seconds and then the blob disappeared giving me a strong sense of loss and heartbrokenness and I was haunted a little bit when I came down wondering whether indigo did exist in the real worldI would turn over little stones I once went to a museum to look at azurite a copper mineral which is maybe the nearest to indigo but that was disappointing I did in fact have that experience again but when I had it the second time it was not with a drug it was with music  and I think music can take one to the heights in a way comparable with drugsOn hallucinations that accompany bereavementWith any hallucinations if you can do functional brain imagery while theyre going on you will find that the parts of the brain usually involved in seeing or hearing  in perception  have become super active by themselves And this is an autonomous activity this does not happen with imagination But hallucination in a way simulates perception and the perceptual parts of the brain become active  Theres obviously a very very strong passionate feeling of love and loss with bereavement hallucinations and I think intense emotion of any sort can produce a hallucinationOn the hallucinations accompanying his migrainesI usually get the zigzag but I may also see lattice patterns like tessellations sometimes these lattice patterns seem to cover peoples faces or a piece of paper Im writing on I mostly get complex geometrical patterns Ive never actually seen  images with a migraine although on at least on two occasions Ive had a smell  in particular a smell of hot buttered toast  with a strong sense that I was about 3 years old being put in a high chair and about to be given hot buttered toast A sort of olfactory hallucination often goes along with recollection in that sort of wayThe first time I got that I was in hospital and I went searching for the toast The second time I was driving on the Bronx River Parkway where there was obviously no toast to be hadHow visual migraines may have inspired ancient patterned art There are all sorts of complex geometrical patterns very symmetrical some of them looking like the finest doily  Patterns like this tend to appear in migraine but they may also appear with fever They also appear with various drugs They may also be seen as one is falling asleep and one cant help comparing them with various forms of ornamental art and cave art and wondering whether individuals or cultures have been inspired by some of these patterns which are built into the nervous system Copyright 2014 NPR,20121108,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/10/31/164054452/drug-sniffing-dogs-take-center-stage-at-high-court?ft=3&f=,The US Supreme Court heard arguments in two cases Wednesday testing what if any limits there are to the police using drugsniffing dogs By the close of two hours of argument it looked very much as though the court would rule against the use of drugsniffing dogs without a warrant in one case but not the other The protagonists in this story are Franky and Aldo Franky a chocolate Labrador had a nearspotless record as a drugdetection dog in MiamiDade County The question is whether his human police partners violated the Fourth Amendments ban on unreasonable searches After police got an anonymous tip they took Franky up to the front porch of a private home and when he alerted to drugs inside the police used that as justification for getting a search warrant Aldo had a less august dogdetection pedigree and the question was whether his qualifications as an expert were sufficient to justify the sniff of a truck Lawyer Gregory Garre represented Florida police prosecutors and the dogs in both cases starting with the one that involved a dog sniff at the front door of a private home Garres argument in defense of Frankys sniff at the home was that Franky was trained only to look for drugs In three prior cases Garre reminded the justices the court has emphasized that a drugdetection dog reveals only the presence of contraband and that nobody has a legitimate expectation of privacy in that But justices of every ideological stripe hammered Garre on that argument Justice Anthony Kennedy said he could not accept as a reasonable argument the premise that if theres contraband all the rules go out the window Justice Sonia Sotomayor added that if you have no expectation of privacy for contraband why bother with a search warrant at all Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg chimed in that if a dog sniff of one home is OK the police could just go down the street with a dog going door to door Garre responded that the police could indeed do that just as they can knock on every door But limited resources he maintained would prevent such dragnet searches For Justice Antonin Scalia the place of the dog sniff mattered because a home is private It isnt sniffing in the abstract he said its sniffing at the front door Garre emphasized that there exists an implied consent for police Girl Scouts or trickortreaters to go up to the front door But Ginsburg interjected saying there is no implied consent for a policeman to come up with a dog when the only purpose of the dog is to detect contraband Justice Stephen Breyer also took issue with Garres argument saying that people do have the expectation that someone can come to the door but not with a large animal who spends five to 15 minutes going back and forth sniffing the premises Finally Justice Elena Kagan observed that the court has repeatedly protected the home from technological surveillance without a warrant To that Garre responded Frankys nose is not technology Kagan pressed the question wondering if a machine were invented to detect drug odors from outside a house would that be permissible without a warrant too No replied Garre Dogs sniffs are different than machines because they involve the dogs Godgiven sense of smell Garres adversary public defender Howard Blumberg representing the accused marijuana grower also got quite a grilling from the court Kennedy called Blumbergs argument that people have a right to keep secret anything they want within their home equally unacceptable to Garres argument Blumberg was more successful with his second argument  that the dog sniff at the front door of a home is a trespass on private property He cited cases as far back as the 1700s that stand for the proposition that a mans home is his castle The Supreme Court has never ruled on dog sniffs at a private home It has said dog sniffs are permissible without a warrant in other spheres  cars stopped on the road for other reasons for instance or luggage at airports But as Wednesdays second argument illustrated even when a search could be legal there is a question as to whether the dog has adequate credentials for police to rely on In this case Aldo a German shepherd sniffed and alerted for drugs in a truck stopped for an expired license plate Police then searched the truck and found chemicals used to make methamphetamines Two week later however when police again stopped the truck the dog again alerted for drugs but this time no drugs were found Aldo had completed 120 hours of basic drugdetection training two years earlier but had not been recertified in 16 months  a defect that lawyer Garre acknowledged was a lapse Public defender Glen Gifford told the justices that since there is no national or state certification standard for drugdetection dogs judges should look among other things to field records of the dogs other searches to determine his reliability The justices however seemed to think that was a step too far Copyright 2014 NPR,20121031,marijuana

are trying to get their political messages across in the feverish leadup to Election Day Political blimps Conspiracyladen DVDs Talking greeting cardstyle mailers that play gaffes But the political messaging that may seem most inescapable is the triedandtrue TV ad You probably dont need a reminder that swing states especially are being flooded with them Since June more than 915000 presidential ads alone have aired on broadcast and cable TV  up more than 44 percent from 2008 according to the Wesleyan Media Project Add to that ads for House Senate and local races and youre looking at quite a barrage So whats it like to watch TV in swing states right now We decided to ask the team of public media reporters who have been contributing to our Message Machine project to weigh in  giving us a window into six tossup states Colorado Florida Iowa New Hampshire Ohio and Virginia In a similar experiment last month I cruelly perhaps made us all sit through ABCs Dancing With the Stars to track how many ads we saw in an hour of prime time Turns out it wasnt many As campaign ad expert Travis Ridout of Washington State University explained a lot of the advertising time in popular national shows like Dancing With the Stars is bought up by the big guns  Pepsi Honda WalMart etc Political campaigns like to be a bit more targeted He said campaign advertisers particularly like the local news He wasnt kidding On Wednesday the Message Machine reporters and I all watched a toprated news broadcast in each of our markets at 11 pm Eastern or 10 pm Central and Mountain And in roughly a halfhour of late night news we saw 87 political ads compared to just 12 total in an hour last month Heres how it broke down Colorado Denvers KUSA 15 political ads out of 25 ads tracked7 presidential ads7 House ads1 state issue ad marijuana legalization KUNCs Kirk Siegler took the prize for tracking presidential ads seeing four ads from President Obamas campaign two Mitt Romney ads and an antiObama American

incumbents against each other because of redistricting Democrat Leonard Boswell and Republican Tom Latham New Hampshire Manchesters WMUR 17 political ads out of 19 ads tracked4 presidential ads8 House

candidates and by political action committees Most of the ads were negative but pretty much all the candidates also ran one positive spot he reports A good chunk of the ads focused on the states competitive race for governor Ohio WBNS in Columbus 20 political ads out of 27 ads tracked5 presidential ads7 Senate ads2 House ads6 local race ads Unsurprisingly Karen Kasler in the uberswing state of Ohio won the bragging rights er complaining rights seeing the most political ads Kasler the chief of the Statehouse News Bureau for Ohio Public Radio and Television pointed out an NBC analysis showing more money being spent on political ads in Ohio than anywhere else 181 million so far about onefifth of the national total of 883 million In Columbus that translates into 6647 ads this month  or 333 a day On top of that Karen even saw an ad for the local sheriffs race Virginia WRC in Washington DC 16 political ads out of 26 ads tracked4 presidential ads7 Senate ads5 Maryland issue ads samesex marriage and gambling Living in a Northern Virginia suburb of DC I kind of cheated in the sense that five of the ads I tracked pertained to campaigns in neighboring Maryland  ballot questions I have no ability to even vote on But the presidential ads were squarely aimed at swingstate Virginia voters and the heat was really on in the close race for US Senate between two former Virginia governors One big takeaway for the evenings ad tracking came from Sarah At least when we did our Dancing With the Stars ad watch party we got a little break from politics Although we had to watch celebrities dance Im not sure which is worse honestly But not so tonight Not surprisingly this close to the election in a swing state politics dominated not just the ads but also the programming Or as

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/10/24/163558766/three-ballot-measures-would-ok-pot-beyond-medicine?ft=3&f=,Marijuana legalization is back on the ballot this year California voters defeated a legalization proposal in 2010 but now similar measures have cropped up in three more Western states This time around some of the most intense opposition is coming from the earlier pioneers of legalization  the medical marijuana industry In Colorado Amendment 64 would regulate marijuana much like alcohol says Howard Wooldridge a retired police detective from Texas and a longtime campaigner for marijuana legalization He has come to Greeley Colo to wave a sign for the measure This would free up precious police resources to go after real criminals drunk drivers etc as opposed to wasting time on a green plant he says Colorado already has a big medical marijuana industry but this amendment to the state Constitution takes things further It would allow people older than 21 to possess limited amounts of the drug for recreational use People would be allowed to grow the plant for personal use and the state would be directed to license and tax marijuana stores The amendment is ahead in the polls but that lead is eroding as it gets more pushback from business groups We dont want to become the pot capital of the United States says Roger Sherman who runs the Vote No campaign Thats not the image our economic development leaders want to use to attract businesses and conventions and tourists Luckily for those business groups Colorado has competition in the race to legalize pot Oregon has a similar ballot measure though its not polling well Passage is looking likely though in Washington Initiative 502  On a misty morning near Seattle legalization campaigners pose for a group picture shouting Dismantling prohibition one state at a time for the camera Theyre in a good mood because their initiative  called I502  is polling above 50 percent The initiative would permit the sale of small amounts of pot at stores regulated and taxed by the state Alison Holcomb a criminal defense attorney who has also worked for the ACLU helped to draft the initiative and she now runs the Yes campaign Weve reached a place in our society nationwide where now a majority support marijuana legalization Holcomb says She may be right In a Rasmussen poll earlier this year 56 percent of respondents favored legalizing and regulating marijuana The Washington initiative is getting support from across the political spectrum including two former US attorneys the Seattle city attorney and even the Republican candidate for Senate Michael Baumgartner The most vocal opposition meanwhile is coming from purveyors of medical marijuana Were horrified says Steve Sarich who runs the No On I502 campaign He is also a longtime producer of medical marijuana At his Seattle access point  thats what dispensaries are calling themselves in Washington at the moment  he shows off a display case full of potinfused products  Weve got everything from caramels to peppermint patties to chocolate covered pretzels to Almond Joy Sarich says He even sells marijuana dog biscuits We have dogs that have arthritis and that really really calms them down he says Its not clear how dog treats would be legal under the states medical marijuana law which requires a patient to have a doctors recommendation Sarich says this new world of legal medical marijuana will be in jeopardy if I502 passes Thats because he thinks the initiative is really a Trojan horse One of its provisions sets a maximum THC level in the bloodstream of drivers  essentially a blood alcohol limit for the active ingredient in marijuana The problem is that THC lingers in the blood and Sarich says regular users of medical marijuana would never be legal to drive even when feeling sober I wake up every morning with four times the limit in my blood Sarich says He consumes marijuana to relieve back pain He says hed have to leave the state or find a fulltime driver All they have to do is sit a half a block down the street and wait for me to pull away from the curb and Im going to jail for driving under the influence of drugs Sarich says Sarich says he doesnt believe the initiative is about legalization at all  he scoffs at the idea that the state would really follow through with official statelicensed pot stores  and he says the whole point of the initiative is to use the blood level limit to put the screws on medical marijuana users The initiatives sponsors say they had to include a blood level limit to win over cautious voters Without naming names Holcomb accuses some medical marijuana entrepreneurs of wanting to keep pot in a profitable gray area  unregulated and untaxed Its a concern echoed by King County Sheriff Steve Strachan For the rule of law for a civil society this ambiguity doesnt serve us well Strachan says Strachan calls the current medical marijuana law a twilight zone one that generates cynicism and contempt for law enforcement Weve had some examples since the medical marijuana law came into place of people smoking marijuana in a public place like a bus stop Well its not a place where you could smoke a cigarette and theyll say Well its medical marijuana so I can do that  he says So the sheriff who is also on the ballot this year has come out in support of legalization as has his opponent He hopes it will clarify the status of marijuana under state law even as it creates a potential showdown with the feds As far as that goes he can only hope against hope that national politicians will reconsider the federal prohibition on pot if confronted by outright legalization in the states Copyright 2014 NPR,20121024,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/09/02/160248690/the-writer-who-was-the-voice-of-a-generation?ft=3&f=,When writer David Foster Wallace committed suicide in 2008 at the age of 46 US literature lost one of its most influential living writersThe definitive account of Wallaces life and what led to his suicide was published in the New Yorker in March of the following yearNow DT Max who wrote that article has written a new a biography of Wallace Every Love Story is a Ghost Story Its a deeply researched look into the life and work of a writer who was called the voice of his generation Max spoke to Guy Raz host of weekends on All Things ConsideredInterview HighlightsOn how David Foster Wallace changed American literatureA number of things go into that Obviously just the pure pleasure of his most important books Reading Infinite Jest is certainly  it contains more pleasure more agony more of American life at the turn of the millennium I think the second thing is simply that he influenced so many people Writers from Dave Eggers to Chad Harbach  you just can see that he left disciples I think also something very interesting happened which is that the Web came along And the Web lends itself very well to the kind of writer that David really had pioneered that had nothing to do with the Web  and so now you go on the Web and you feel like youre reading 10000 imitators of David Foster Wallace Theres nobody else whos changed American prose to that extent that I can think of in generations I almost think about someone like Mark TwainOn Wallaces early life fraught with anxietyI think actually this was probably even a surprise to his family because he was good at hiding these things He traces his first anxieties back to being 8 or 9 He speaks about a morbid fear of mosquitoes and buzzing By the time hes in high school David is really I think  hes anxious all the time There are days when he cant get up and go to school At a college interview at Oberlin he was so anxious that basically as soon as the interview was over he threw up  and kept throwing up Shortly after that he goes to Amherst where his father went In those days at Amherst if you were the son of an alum and they liked you they would admit you at the interview So he was admitted at the interview and then his response was If I go to Amherst do I never have to do another college interview And his father said Yes And he said soldHow Wallace was drawn to fiction in collegeHe very much assumed that he would follow in his fathers footsteps as a philosophy professor He went through his first two years and he turned out to have a knack for sort of mathematical philosophy mathematical logic But David had a breakdown in college So he goes home  and this is a boy who wrote some in high school but he wasnt a writer in any sense of it  and really pretty quickly he begins to turn out extraordinarily good fiction So much so that by the time he is a senior back at Amherst  and hes only been writing for about a year and a half  he begins a thesis in fiction He does a double thesis one in fiction one in philosophy  but his fiction becomes The Broom Of The System his first I think incredibly brilliant novel One of the cool things about David is that you can really sense that in learning how to write what he was really doing was reverseengineering other writers He was looking at how Thomas Pynchon wrote he was looking at how Don DeLillo wrote He was breaking their sentences apart and seeing if he could write themOn Wallaces postgraduate struggle with addiction to drugs and alcoholHe always referred to himself as an addict He becomes deeply involved in 12step programs And his life changes He wouldnt have made it even to his mid30s I would think had he not found the strength to get away from his addictions Now his primary addiction was marijuana  it was not drinking And in a lot of ways one of the things about David thats so interesting is that his life  the accidents of his life  really gave him the key to his writing In a lot of ways the 12step program is what taught David how to write Infinite Jest or where the book should go  that it should be more than just a pretty piece of fictionWhy 2008 Wallace discontinued longtime use of an antidepressant which led to his suicide Physically the antidepressant he was on Nardil is hard to metabolize And it was kind of an outdated antidepressant He was also just miserable that he couldnt get his novel  The Pale King the book that was just published last year  because David works on it for a decade  but the writing wasnt coming And he thought that the Nardil was perhaps interfering with his ability to write well because it made things seem a little distant made his own relationship to reality a little less keyedup And he wondered if he could just get rid of the Nardil well that would help his writing And then the third reason which is something I discovered in working on the book is that you know having been a member of this 12step program  theres a whole group of people within 12step programs who think you should be completely drugfree No alcohol No marijuana No prescription antidepressants So poor David who always wants to be the best student in the class wanted to be the best possible 12step program participant And so he thought well Ill just get off it And once youre off one of these drugs it can be very very hard to stabilize yourself again And he just wasnt able toOn the title Every Love Story is a Ghost StoryShortly after I began the book I started to come into possession of letters that David had written to other people But David didnt keep any letters so all I have is Davids letters out And I noticed again and again in different places he would put in the phrase every love story is a ghost story It starts when hes a graduate student in the mid80s The phrase appears in The Pale King The title probably came to him through reading some correspondence of the novelist Christina Stead But why did that phrase stick in his head for so long It seems to me that it captures so perfectly what he always felt was the futility the difficulty of not just writing about people but actually being with people He had a great deal of trouble in his relationships and a great deal of trouble understanding relationships And then of course I also felt like that was really the readers relationship with David It wasnt really just a reference to his suicide but obviously contained a big aspect of the fact that he was gone now and whatever love readers felt for him was now going to be a love for an absence For a ghost Copyright 2014 NPR,20120902,marijuana

intentional zag to the mainstreams zig  the music he puts out under the name Actress is shadowy and decaying rather than grabby and bright But really hes off in his own world and it took him years to get there Cunningham wont say exactly how old he is but a rough guess puts him at 35 since he recalls being 13 or 14 when the first Boyz II Men album came out in 1991Actresss latest album RIP conjures several worlds within that darkness ranging from lovely to severe Eden and Tartarus Its music that feels ageless precisely because his vision  and achieving it  is the only thing that mattersInterviewing Cunningham ends up being a bit of a process He has an idiosyncratic aversion to openness  he doesnt wear a mask or a hood like his peers Burial and Zomby but hell give away his tracks on Twitter then suddenly make his account private Conditions for our conversation include the following He needs to know the topics in advance He wont talk on the phone He prefers to meet via computer Hes up for a chat one weekday evening that goes longer than expected Over two hours he sits in his South London office looking out the window at kids playing in a garden slowly responding to questions on Skype instant messenger in mysterious fragments that suddenly turn deepive spent a long time developing my own philosophy its a concrete idea of sound representation that i am looking for like u could almost touch it forming an environment rather than a music formHe wants to talk about RIP And nature Actress is all about nature right nowInspired by long walks around his leafy neighborhood with his dog he holes himself up in his studio where he digitally sands down samples from other music and field recordings of open air forming them into compositions he likens to sculpturei study nature a lot and how organisms including us react to our environments the texture of wood in water changes when the sun bakes it what is the sound of the reactionHe makes landscapes he makes moods The songs on RIP sound like gleaming sun on water then angry clouds full of lightning The specific track modeled on those woody thoughts is called Tree of Knowledge And though its made with the tools used to create much electronic dance music it adheres to a vivid unusual set of ideas It turns out that when hes composing hes not thinking of his product as musicsee u need to understand that the brain interprets things based on what u have already heard as music per se i try to ignore the music part as much as possible but i want to get an angle on the form and the sensationsActresss music ends up sounding minimal but alive an organic opposite to most other music made using the same toolsu may not be able to hear it but u can imagine itSonically Tree of Knowledge recalls the sloweddown hiphop of the late DJ Screw from Texas deconstructed and reanimated to seem as if its rustling in the wind Parts are held together with a glow Actress calls synth chakra He acknowledges the Screw sound  butthe difference is that what i am after is a direct representation of physical or organic matter i want to achieve the sound of wood bending warping creaking swayingWood is one inspiration Marijuana is another  which he talks about in almost every interview except this one So is death RIP was recorded after the passing of his friend the artist David Gormley The afterlife would seem to feature since the albums titles come from John Miltons epic Biblical poem Paradise Lost  but if there is any religion in the music its strictly on the natural level Told that two of his songs sound like heaven and hell Ascending and Shadows on Tartarus he says yes heaven and hell on earth The pianoplinking Jardin has as much to do with the Garden of Eden and the concept of innocence as an actual love of gardensHe sets himself apart in electronic music with an approach to sampling that involves completely obscuring the source and the way he uses synthesizers microphones and the computer program Ableton  but doesnt want to talk about any of that The more hes asked about technical aspects of composing or references to other musicians the more he wants to talk about his enjoyment of monkey puzzle plants  whose branches look like tails  and the sky Hes traveling to Seattle in September for the regions big electronic outing Decibel Festival and looking forward to the sky there tooi hear seattle has some serious lenticular cloudsHe doesnt spend more than two words describing his signature audio trick a unique deployment of sidechain compression Sidechaining is a common effect used by producers in dance music to make that pumping woompwoompwoomp sound Actress uses it in a punk rock way sidechaining elements of the track to the drum then removing the drum throwing away what was supposed to be the big draw  leaving rhythmic remnants of sonic pressure It makes the track feel like a sausage being squished from the outsideWhen I ask him to be more specific he offers onlyinvisible mechanicsShadowplay I typecouldnt have put it betterHis other main trick is a wicked use of ambience Sounds are often doused with static and crackle on RIP as if dying on the record Others are mixed uncomfortably up front in the field of listening On Jardin some of the percussion is like dust under your record needle and there is a gentle wave that sounds like the beach Actress says it is room atmoits pure sound i work with white noise a lot i can prickle it dapple it flatten it bwoon itAs a kid Cunningham beatboxed and sang Boyz II Men songs to girls in the street He played imaginary instruments until he was seven years old then recorder clarinet saxophone and guitar Despite his talents he set music aside for a dream of playing in the English football league which he pursued relentlessly his father also played semipro Young Cunningham played for West Bromwich Albion before injury took him out at 19 beginning what he calls the black period He moved from his hometown of Wolverhampton to London studied recording dedicated himself 100 to music and chose his name to mess with peoples perceptions He made a splash on the scene in 2008 with his debut Hazyville which introduced the world to the Actress sound Another splash followed with Splazsh his album from 2010 which veered into shattering funk and seething goth territory His and Zombys albums came out on Actress own label Werkdiscs  but after that Actress signed to Damon Albarns label Honest Jons Albarn and fellow British rock legends Radiohead are big fans though of course the attention leaves Actress unfazedRight now hes on a roll ive just begun the white period and plans to record another album this year in Jamaica which he might call Ghettoville Werkdiscs has recently become an imprint on the larger more established Ninja Tune Hes feeling productivewhen youre on the field a high number of visions pop into your head at a rapid rate ur main focus is putting the ball in the goal ive transposed my technical skill as footballer into brain reflexes through soundCan it be so simple Surely not But there is an analogy to be made since scoring in football is like writing a song And in one of the long football digressions of the interview he has advice for kids about that could also apply to music kicking a ball through a target is good practice But

examines a series of hotels to see whats wrong with them and he yells at the owners But finally after several weeks of nobody listening he throws the owner of a charming but dirty bed and breakfast to a shark Revolution NBC In this tense drama the world has to figure out how to move on after all the power goes out and batteries stop working because apparently physics and chemistry have been suspended A new subplot opens when we discover that all the sharks in the world have used the suspension of science to break out of their tanks flee to the ocean and set up their own power generation

for a while she is asked to treat a shark belonging to a mobster She acquiesces but after she fixes the shark the shark demands that she treat it for life or it will eat her and everyone she knows The name of the show is changed to The Shark Doctor and the rest of the episodes are devoted to the mob trying to reclaim their doctor and being defeated over and over again by the shark Animal Practice NBC It already has a monkey and everyone knows sharks are better than monkeys If a shark came into a scene riding a tiny ambulance you have to admit Youd pay attention Partners CBS The office where the lead characters in this buddy comedy work is invaded with tiny sharks who live in the pipes Out of fear both of them go into hiding and are never seen again This workplace buddy comedy is instantly four thousand times better even if its just an empty set where people walk around going Where are the guys who used to work in this office Elementary CBS This is actually a reasonably good show but theres nothing that cant be improved by being replaced with animatronic sharks In this case the puzzlesolver would be a shark named Sharklock and the assistant would be a fish named Flotsam So you would have Sharklock Holmes and Flotsam That is a show right there 666 Park Avenue ABC This is the show where this attractive young couple move into a sort of haunted possessed apartment building run by Satan and Mrs Satan Or possibly Satan and Mr Satan We dont know While there are plenty of scares in the pilot I think its safe to say that unlike haunted scary devil house apartment

nonfiction booksIt was twoforTexas time this week with two remarkable political developments starring a pair of leading Hispanics in that stateFirst Democratic leaders picked Julian Castro the youngish mayor of San Antonio to deliver the keynote address as their partys national convention in Charlotte next month This was the type of sudden exposure that promoted a young Illinois state legislator to national attention just eight years ago A Daily Beast headline this week posed this question Is Democratic Convention Keynote Speaker Julian Castro the Next ObamaThen Republican voters handed a surprise victory in their runoff for a US Senate nod to the youngish Ted Cruz a Tea Party favorite who bested the pick of the states establishment Lt Gov David Dewhurst Cruz appears headed to an easy win in November in the very red state and like Sen Marco Rubio will be touted as the bright hope for the GOP especially in winning back Hispanics and a certain contender for president in the very near futureCruz has by far earned the most ink this week but two of the leading media memes surrounding him each have holes Nearly every reporter within the smart set in DC labeled his win a sign of the Tea Partys growing power even as journos in Texas pointed out that Tea Partiers lost several other key races in the state on the same day Also there was the matter of former Tea Party darling Rick Perry backing his opponentPlus Cruz may have had the backing of the hard right but his platform varied little from Dewhursts and in fact he is about as establishment as they come with his Harvard degree positions in the Bush administration and appearances before the US Supreme Court often arguing on behalf of big businessThe other media meme held that Cruz would now become as the New York Times put it the intellectual head of the Tea Party caucus in Washington Now one could acknowledge thats not saying much But still despite his brains few mainstream reporters apointed out that this intellectual was nearly as wacky as the other rightwingers good roundup here Just one example his embrace just recently of a conspiracy theory that holds that the United Nations in league with George Soros is plotting a takeover of golf courses and other green spaces Or something like that Hes also one of those claiming Sharia law is about to take root in the United StatesCruzs father by the way came from Cuba  he fought with Castro then turned against him when he realized he was a Communist  but there are no holes in his narrative one problem Marco Rubio has faced However theres this fun fact Ted was born in Canada So future Democratic birthers might have some fun with the constitutional issues that could arise in a Cruz run for the White House it didnt stop McCain was born in PanamaAnyway I thought Id go to a few credible sources far beyond Washington  you know in Texas  for some tidbits and insight A few highlights more to come down the road a bitFrom the Texas Tribune on Cruz his leading funder  Peter Thiell the wealthy cofounder of Pay Pal Actually this poses some problems for Cruz in the primary as Thiell is also a major backer of gay rights and promarijuana issues From the Texas Observer forget the other malarkey Cruz was simply the better candidate and the Rick Perry era is overFrom the Burnt Orange site Maybe Cruzs opponent Paul Sadler does have a long shot From the Dem party statement Tonight was the Republican Partys Thelma and Louise moment It may feel pretty exhilarating now but that landings going to be hell A Ted Cruz victory is the worst thing that could have happened to Texas Republicans Its a Teaflavored mutiny plain and simple Now theyre saddled with the Texas version of Sharron Angle and Christine ODonnell The inmates are running the asylum and middle class Texans are taking noticeFrom Texas Monthly on Castro a full everythingyouneedtoknow It seems Castro who is 37 is the rare politician with an identical twin  Joaquin who is favored to win a House seat this November Their mother Rosie is a former community activist and La Raza Unida leader In 2002 Julian said To me the ideal would be for people to be able to run based on their ideas but still mean something to the community they come from because thats also part of what inspires peopleI admit I forgot about that major NYT magazine profile by Zev Chafets Rush Limbaughs buddy in 2010 Chafets wrote of Julian then He supports free trade including the North American Free Trade Agreement advocates an energy policy that includes fossil fuels believes in balanced budgets and refers to David Souter as his ideal Supreme Court justice Like a large plurality of his fellow San Antonians Castro is a Roman Catholic but he was the first San Antonio mayor to be grand marshal

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/07/30/157587802/foreign-policy-family-feud-in-peru?ft=3&f=,Michael Shifter is president of the InterAmerican Dialogue  Roger Clinton and Billy Carter have nothing on Antauro Humala the imprisoned brother of Peruvian President Ollanta Humala who marked his first year in office on July 28 Currently serving a 19year prison sentence for instigating a failed military rebellion in a remote Andean town in 2005 Antauro has according to reports smoked marijuana received unauthorized female visitors used a cell phone and left the facility a dozen times Such misbehavior prompted a series of prison transfers ultimately landing him in a highsecurity naval penitentiary where Antauro joined four other notorious detainees Abimael Guzmn arrested in 1992 as leader of the ruthless Maoist Shining Path insurgency Vladimiro Montesinos Perus disgraced spy chief during the 1990s Victor Polay former leader of another insurgent group the MRTA and Artemio another Shining Path leader captured just months ago The move to the latest prison has soured relations between the novice president and the rest of the Humala clan Their extremely vocal father Isaac a lawyer who gave his children the complete works of Marx and Engels to read has joined the fray asserting that the relocation was personally authorized by Humala and involved a group of hooded men who physically abused the presidents brother He even vowed to file a complaint against his son with the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States Long associated with a bizarre virulently nationalist ideology that favors the supremacy of copperskinned Peruvians Isaac had already become deeply disillusioned with his sons presidency He and other family members including older brother Ulises and sister Ima Sumac feel betrayed by Humalas failure to follow through on his commitment to sweeping change Although Humalas family had posed a problem for his political ambitions for some time  in 2006 his mother Elena called for shooting a few gays as a way to keep the rest closeted  the relationship has become notably adversarial in the past several months Although doubtlessly an uncomfortable distraction for the president there is no sign that the other Humalas have influenced his decisionmaking On the other hand the sway of Nadine Heredia the first lady has no rival Not only does the presidents wife and closest confidante tend to outperform her husband in the polls but there is speculation that she might be contemplating a run for the presidency herself despite some inconvenient laws preventing it Her clout was evident when during a recent press briefing she asked in a fit of pique Where is my minister The education minister at her side quickly responded Im here Seora here The public musings over who actually calls the shots  Ulises openly calls his sisterinlaw the actual president  represents yet another public relations headache for the administration Humalas family members arent the only ones disappointed in him The task of governing is turning out to be more difficult than the president may have expected Things arent necessarily going poorly but Peruvians are continually pressing for improvements Perus economic performance this decade has been impressive Not only has the economy been booming  it grew nearly 7 percent in 2011  but there has been an appreciable reduction in poverty and inequality Nevertheless Peruvians remain unusually tough on their political leaders Polls consistently reveal among the highest levels of distrust toward politicians in the region And the deep social schisms reflected in geographic and ethnic differences that have long bedeviled Peru persist Further complicating the situation is the states limited efficacy and the virtual absence of real political parties in contrast with personalitybased cliques centered on aspiring caudillos Moreover Peru overtook Colombia last year as the worlds largest producer of cocaine and public concerns about crime and corruption remain high In June a reported 245 riots and protests took place in the country most related to mining or oil and natural gas projects  an increase of 31 since Humala took office Humala came into office promising not only to keep Perus robust growth on track but to resolve the countrys deepseated problems and quell broad discontent He pledged to take advantage of the countrys vast mineral wealth  an expected 50 billion in new mining projects over five years  to accelerate the redistribution of resources and more effectively meet the needs of the poorest Peruvians He is seeking to avoid the fate of his predecessors  Alejandro Toledo and Alan Garca  who both left the presidency with rockbottom approval levels and administrations widely deemed to be missed opportunities Humala initially tried to fashion a government of the left though one more moderate than revolutionary It is no accident that during his 2010 presidential campaign he hired political advisors who worked with the Workers Party of former Brazilian President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva As South Americas star performer Lula had demonstrated that it was possible for a man of the left adored by the poor  whose lot improved markedly during his two terms  to preside over a buoyant economy and a vibrant democratic society Yet Humala was an improbable purveyor of the fashionable lulista social democratic formula for good governance that has also seen success in Chile and Uruguay As an army lieutenant engaged in fighting Perus internal war against the Shining Path in the early 1990s Humala was credibly accused of committing human rights violations Before their falling out he and Antauro led an unsuccessful revolt in 2000 against the government of Alberto Fujimori who is now serving a 25year sentence for corruption and human rights violations In 2005 while based in South Korea Humala initially supported though later criticized the uprising for which Antauro is now serving his sentence In 2006 having retired from the military and created the Peruvian Nationalist Party he made his political debut as the consummate outsider and came remarkably close to winning the presidency In that contest against Garca he aligned himself with Venezuelan populist Hugo Chvez  another leftist military veteran and onetime coup plotter  and pledged a thoroughgoing reordering of Peruvian society Fearing such a radical option Peruvians opted for Garca Following his narrow defeat Humala quickly set his sights on the next presidential contest A win in 2011 he became convinced required a move to the center At first to secure the lefts support he promised a great transformation though more moderate than his 2006 platform and then in a runoff vote against Keiko Fujimori the former presidents daughter shifted again to a more centrist road map stance in an appeal to more conservative voters The blessing of establishment figures like Nobel Prizewinning author Mario Vargas Llosa and former President Toledo gave Humala the political cover he needed to secure victory To read the rest of this article visit ForeignPolicycom Copyright

now heard from all the major broadcast networks and weve got a day of set visits and three days of cable to close things out after todays CW and Showtime presentations At ABC which presented Friday theres a less palpable sense of panic than you might expect given that theyre now in fourth place At the time they presented on Friday the Modern Family cast hadnt yet wrapped up their contract negotiations which they now have so that question dominated the executive session with entertainment president Paul Lee Lees press conference stood out for his remarkably consistent love of absolutely everything Within this one session he declared that he loved the new drama Nashville the existing drama Revenge country music a documentary he made about Woody Guthrie new aliensnextdoor comedy The Neighbors his job America ABC taking risks the concept of the failed show Duets the performances on failed show Duets and the title of Gotham a show he didnt pick up Paul Lee is a man who feels a lot of love The ABC shows this year seem easier to love in drama than in comedy Theyve tried to cross Revenge and Once Upon A Time their successes from last season and come up with 666 Park a horrorish soapish hour about a haunted apartment building run by apparently the devil It stars Terry OQuinn Lost and Vanessa Williams Ugly Betty most significantly and you should expect that the apartment building is only going to get more dangerous They also have Nashville a drama set in the worlds of country music and politics starring Connie Britton and Hayden Panettiere in a battle that everybody absolutely swears isnt supposed to bring to mind Reba McEntire and Taylor Swift Its got a strong cast that also includes Eric Close Robert Wisdom who played Bunny Colvin on The Wire and Powers Boothe and it comes from Callie Khouri who wrote Thelma and Louise with RJ Cutler also producing  he made the documentaries The War Room and The September Issue Theres perhaps a little too much going on in the pilot but its got the goods and you will hear some good music  theyve got TBone Burnett on board to produce it The third of the ABC dramas is Last Resort from producer Shawn Ryan who also made The Shield as well as the sadly shortlived Terriers and The Chicago Code Starring the marvelous Andre Braugher and onetime Felicity boyfriend Scott Speedman it tells the story of a submarine crew that questions an order and winds up  well going rogue sort of but Ryan is emphatic that they remain patriots who are at odds only with particular leaders not with the country Its an intriguing idea and they certainly have the talent on hand for it to be strong ABCs comedies are much less interesting unfortunately Theyre working less on the oddball side of their brand which supports Happy Endings and Suburgatory and more on their family comedy brand which supports Tim Allens Last Man Standing Its a return to what they had in the original TGIF days and this time around its bringing you Malibu Country starring Lily Tomlin and Reba formerly McEntire now just Reba as a mother and daughter who leave the daughters rotten husband in Nashville and head out to California The clip package contains a marijuana lollipop joke and I secretly suspect that California being crazy is most of the joke here Their other fall comedy launch seems to come from the same giggly part of Paul Lee that took great pleasure in taunting critics last year about how much he loved the crossdressing comedy Work It This one is about a family that moves into a neighborhood and finds that everyone who lives there is an alien named after a professional athlete Its a profoundly silly show but then so was My Favorite Martian and so was Alf The Neighbors actually made me chortle a couple of times as absolutely ridiculous as it is which is more than I can say for a lot of the fall comedies We also heard from CBS where things are so stable that theres always a limited amount of new stuff When your stuff is mostly working you dont have as many holes to fill and you dont throw out as many shows as a place like NBC or ABC Theyve only got one comedy in fact  called Partners its from David Kohan and Max Mutchnick Their big credit is creating Will  Grace but its important to keep in mind that they also created Good Morning Miami and the awful William Shatner version of Bleep My Dad Says So make of that what you will Partners stars two fine actors David Krumholtz and Michael Urie but its one of my least favorite pilots The relationship between the guys is all tell and no show in other words you wouldnt believe they liked each other or had any reason to like each other except that they keep telling you they do Uries character is an obnoxious knot of dated gay stereotypes which is confounding given that he brought such warmth to the role of Marc on Ugly Betty which so easily could have been an obnoxious knot of dated gay stereotypes Its a distressing waste of a good cast and as much as I try to give comedies multiple episodes to find their feet this is one I will find difficult to watch again The new CBS dramas on the other hand look pretty good Theyre taking a lot of heat for Elementary their Sherlock Holmes show in which Lucy Liu plays Watson who yes is a woman in this version simply because people like the BBC Sherlock so much But taken on its own terms Elementary is a solidly constructed crime procedural Jonny Lee Miller as Holmes and Liu are both good their relationship is intriguing and the producers swear it is a friendspartners relationship period and if they can manage a good mystery story every week it could fit in very well at CBS Obviously a lot of people who might otherwise like it will bring with them their attachment to Sherlock but there have been countless versions of Sherlock Holmes long before Sherlock  and that one coexists just fine with the Robert Downey Jr version so theres no reason there isnt room for this too Made In Jersey is positively featherweight its a lawyer show starring Janet Montgomery as a highhaired but very smart attorney surrounded by her big Jersey family Theres not a lot to this show yet at least based on the pilot but Montgomery whos actually a Brit incidentally is endearing and theyre not laying on the Jersey too thick at this point its a pretty loving portrayal The procedurals at CBS have gotten pretty heavy and dark CSI and so forth and even The Good Wife can be pretty depressing This gives them something with a little more comedy mixed in and probably a little less dark psychology than some of the other dramas on the network Wrapping up the CBS dramas I like Vegas quite a lot  set in 1960 it follows the story of Sheriff Ralph Lamb a real lawman who was there for the early days of the Vegas strip Lamb is played by Dennis Quaid the big mob guy is played by Michael Chiklis and theres a lot in the pilot thats promising Its sort of halfwesternhalfcopshow and they show a good balance in the first episode between a mystery that can be solved within the hour and a longer arc of the lawmafia battle that will continue So today includes presentations from the CW  which has a Green Arrow show called Arrow and a doctor show with Meryl Streeps daughter Mamie Gummer among others  and Showtime Showtime will be presenting returning shows including Dexter Weeds and the recently Emmynominated Homeland The cable days later this week will include all kinds of things BBC America which is presenting the scripted series Copper and The Spies Of Warsaw the latter starring David Tennant The

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/07/17/156550286/from-addict-to-activist-how-elton-john-found-his-cure?ft=3&f=,Sir Elton John is constantly remembering his life as a drug addict whether he wants to or notI still dream twice a week at least that Ive taken cocaine and I have it up my nose John tells NPRs Steve Inskeep And its very vivid and its very upsetting but at least its a wakeup callIn his new memoir Love Is the Cure the singersongwriter explains how he stopped using cocaine  and abusing drugs and alcohol  after he came to know Ryan White White was an Indiana teenager who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion His case did much to build public support to battle the disease When neighbors ostracized the White family John helped them move Then months after Whites death in 1990 the singer was forced to reconsider his own lifeIt got me to realize how out of whack my life was because I was just in and out of a drugfueled haze in the 80s I did nothing to help people with AIDS he says I was a gay man who really sat on the sidelinesAfter seeking treatment for his addictions he started the Elton John AIDS Foundation which now gives grants to AIDS and HIV prevention and treatment programs In the first of a twopart interview John tells Inskeep about his experiences with addiction his change of attitude toward AIDS and how he became an activistInterview HighlightsOn his first encounter with cocaine in the 70s when Johns manager brought it into the recording studioI was so ignorant about drugs and so naive I mean my band was smoking marijuana for years I didnt even know what a joint was And Id never seen a line of cocaine in my life and I dont know whether its bravado or OK Ill join in but in my stupidity I had a line of coke and that started the whole process  I fired my manager But it took me a long time to do it because I was never a confrontational person and it took me until the 90s to do thatOn what drugs did for him and where they led himI was just genuinely shy Id always been a shy kid And when I happened when my success started I was incredibly confident onstage because thats where I loved to be but offstage there was no balance I was the same little kid that went onstage but onstage I had all the bravado and the chutzpah necessary to do a great show but there was no balance in my life I always said cocaine was the drug that made me open up I could talk to people But then it became the drug that closed me down because the last two weeks of my use of cocaine I spent in a room in London using it and not coming out for two weeks And it completely shut me down So it started out by making me talk to everyone and then ended up by me isolating myself alone with it which is the end of the world reallyOn realizing he needed helpWhen I knew Ryan White I knew that my life was out of whack I knew that I had to change And after he died I realized that I only had two choices I was either going to die or I was going to live and which one did I want to do And then I said those words Ill get help or I need help Ill get help And my life turned around Ridiculous for a human being to take 16 years to say I need help On choosing a song to play at Ryan Whites memorialIts very hard to choose the appropriate song to sing at something like that Skyline Pigeon was on my very first album called Empty Sky and I chose it because I thought at that time it was the first really good song that wed ever written And it was a song about release and freedom and death is a kind of release and freedom Its a very pretty song a very pretty lyric And so I sang it then and it seemed the most appropriate thing to sing and the lyrics seemed to go beautifully with the passage of crossing over to the other side as it wereOn asking Florida not to cut funding for HIV and AIDS patients and Florida Surgeon General Frank Farmer suggesting he play a benefit to help raise money EJAF is an AIDS organization and whenever anybodys funding is cut  and its usually cut especially in this case in Florida for the people that can afford it least  then were going to write a letter about it And we wrote a letter to Florida Gov Rick Scott himself Its not my job to fund a states AIDS program Its the governments priority to do that I cant do benefit concerts for Florida for the people with AIDS in Florida Its their responsibility they need to do whats right And cutting funding for the people that can least afford it is criminalOn why funding for AIDS treatment is the governments responsibilityWe can solve this AIDS problem forever if the government gives the funding If people are encouraged to come out and say theyre HIVpositive and theyre given their treatments then obviously the people who are marginalized  like intravenous drug users prisoners people who are made to feel lessthan  if theyre given the support of the government and theyre given the funding then its going to help solve the spread of AIDS and HIV in America We have to try and get rid of this shortsightedness when it comes to HIV and the stigma around it Copyright 2014 NPR,20120718,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/07/12/156615024/fake-pot-is-a-real-problem-for-regulators?ft=3&f=,This week President Obama signed a law banning synthetic marijuana and other synthetic drugs Dozens of states and local governments have already tried to outlaw fake marijuana which has been blamed for hundreds of emergency room visits and a handful of fatalities But the bans have proved largely ineffective and there are fears that the federal law wont be any different Synthetic marijuana looks a bit like dried grass clippings Its readily available on the Internet and in convenience stores and smoke shops where its sold as herbal incense or potpourri A StandIn For Marijuana At roughly 20 a gram its unlikely that many buyers are using synthetic marijuana to freshen up the powder room Most are smoking it as a substitute for real marijuana Thats what Aaron Stinson was doing last September This is an actual packet that I found in his belongings in his bedroom says his mother Deirdre Canaday as she holds up a small shiny package The product is called Relaxinol  which the label promises can relieve unwanted state of mind Canaday found the packet in Stinsons apartment last year shortly after he died in his sleep at a friends house in upstate New York He had smoked a spice potpourri product called Mr Nice Guy Relaxinol Canaday says And he went to sleep And in the morning about 930 am his two friends woke up But Aaron  they found him totally unresponsive not breathing no pulse Canaday admits her son had a history of using drugs specifically marijuana But she says Stinson who was 26 was getting his act together He had a good job as a home health care aide Canaday thinks Stinson was using synthetic marijuana that night for the same reason many people do He was worried about passing a drug test for his job and he knew that synthetic marijuana was not likely to show up I think that my son the only thing he did wrong was to be naive Canaday says to believe this stuff thats packaged was all natural and safe and a good alternative to something that was illegal  because its not The pathologist determined the cause of Stinsons death to be acute intoxication due to the combined effects of ethanol from alcohol consumption and Relaxinol No charges were ever filed the company that makes Relaxinol did not respond to requests for an interview Drugs Bring Side Effects And Uncertainty There are no clinical studies about the health effects of synthetic marijuana But anecdotally health care providers report a long list of nasty side effects from agitation and paranoia to intense hallucinations and psychosis Christine Stork the clinical director of the Upstate New York Poison Control Center says that shes seen a steady stream of synthetic marijuana users turn up in emergency rooms over the past few years Theyre expecting a marijuana experience and pretty soon they realize theyre not getting their usual experience she says They can be quite agitated They can be quite paranoid They require drugs to sedate them and may have seizures which are pretty severe Stork says synthetic marijuana can be 20 times as potent as real marijuana But its hard to predict the strength of any particular brand or packet  in part because its remarkably easy for anyone to make and package synthetic marijuana without any oversight or regulation Video Tutorials In Drug Making In a video posted on YouTube an unidentified man shows how its done using damiana a Mexican shrub as the base All you need is some legal plant material and some chemical powders that can be easily ordered from overseas labs Anybody with a working knowledge of chemistry or that can follow a simple set of directions can obtain and mix these substances and create these compounds says James Burns a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration in upstate New York Most states have already moved to ban some synthetic cannabinoids  the chemical compounds that are the key ingredient in synthetic marijuana But Burns says its not that simple You have people that are very good with chemistry that continue to manipulate the molecular structure of these substances he says So that they are creating analogues or substances that are similar to those that have been banned The result is a big game of cat and mouse The government outlaws a certain compound or family of compounds But then producers tweak the chemical formula of their products to skirt the law A 5 Billion Market Despite a slew of federal state and local bans sales in the synthetic drug industry seem to be growing  to roughly 5 billion a year according to Rick Broider president of the North American Herbal Incense Trade Association You cant stop the market he says You know theres no piece of legislation thats going to stop market demand Broider runs a company called Liberty Herbal Incense in New Hampshire which he says recently changed its chemical formulas to keep its products legal He insists his industrys products are not for human consumption though he concedes that some people may be misusing the product by smoking it Were aware that there are a number of people who do choose to misuse our products for their euphoric effect We do not support that at all Broider says If youre going to misuse a product youre basically incurring a large risk to yourself But our question is dont Americans have the right to assume their own personal risk Would Broider allow his children to smoke herbal incense or synthetic marijuana products You know if my children are under 18 years old I would not allow them to do anything that I wouldnt deem appropriate to be doing under 18 years old he says When theyre over 18 years old I would see it no differently than alcohol or tobacco which are two products that have been proven to be addictive and have have proven to have negative health consequences That argument doesnt convince Canaday who blames her sons death on a different brand of synthetic marijuana I would say theyre cowards she says of manufacturers like Broider I would say theyre absolute cowards And worse than the drug dealers on the street that sell illicit drugs A New Federal Law So far law enforcement officials have been mostly stymied in their efforts to treat synthetic drugs makers like conventional drug dealers This week President Obama signed the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 It will mean tougher criminal penalties for selling some firstgeneration synthetic cannabinoids and many newer ones as well The new law should help says Burns of the DEA If we can make the bad guys react to what were doing instead of us reacting to what the bad guys are doing then I think thatll help us get a better handle on this issue he says But others worry that the new federal law is already obsolete Itll help in some regards that these things need to be listed and controlled And therell be no more discussion about I didnt know  says Anthony Tambasco a forensic scientist in Mansfield Ohio But youll have again new compounds coming through the door that well have to deal with As soon as Ohio outlawed a number of synthetic cannabinoids last year Tambasco says he started to see new compounds in local stores And he expects drug makers will react just as quickly to the new federal ban They already are Theyre already out in front of it Theyre already on their next batch he says When we spoke last week Tambaso said there were already three synthetic cannabinoid samples hed never seen before waiting for him in the lab Copyright 2014

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/06/25/155696941/new-republic-liberal-fat-cats-wimp-out?ft=3&f=,Alec MacGillis is a senior editor at The New Republic In early June a small group of President Barack Obamas top fundraisers gathered for an urgent meeting in a bar on Chicagos Michigan Avenue They had been summoned to town for a briefing from campaign manager Jim Messina to the several dozen moneyed men and women who make up Obamas finance committee But in a classic example of Citizens Unitedera subterfuge a handful of the attendees slipped away from the Renaissance Blackstone Hotel in the South Loop and headed to the bar Over drinks they met with Bill Burton and Paul Begala leaders of the superPAC that is supporting Obama Priorities USA Action which is forbidden by law from coordinating with the campaign Burton and Begala pleaded for help They said Dont you know some billionaires you can send us to says one of the finance committee members I tried to think of a couple With every passing week Democratic insiders are becoming more and more panicked that by November their Republican opponents will have buried them under a mountain of money After raising only 106 million through April Priorities has picked up the pace somewhat raising more than 9 million since But the GOP money machine  that is American Crossroads the superPAC cofounded by Karl Rove Americans for Prosperity the group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers and the US Chamber of Commerce  has vowed to spend 1 billion combined before Election Day Meanwhile the Mitt Romneyaffiliated superPAC Restore our Future has reported more than 60 million so far a tally that doesnt even include a recent 10 million donation from casino mogul Sheldon Adelson One might think this juggernaut would jolt Democratic donors into opening their wallets Instead it has prompted an outbreak of soulsearching So is this how far weve stooped Is this what weve come to Burton recalls a wealthy Chicago supporter telling him when he came calling on behalf of Priorities It turns out that the Democrats biggest problem this cycle isnt financial but existential   Theres one very obvious reason that Democratic superPAC fundraising is lagging and it can be gleaned from a cursory glance at the Forbes 400 Were not as rich as they are Its that simple says John Morgan a personal injury attorney from Florida whose firm gave Priorities 50000 and whom I reached as he waited on the tarmac for a flight to the French Open We dont have billionaires who are willing to spend ungodly sums of money adds the fundraiser who met with Burton and Begala in Chicago All we can turn up are people who give 38500  the maximum donation allowed to the campaign and party committee combined  and thats to have dinner with Anna Wintour Affluent liberals do exist of course but many of those who supported Obama in 2008 have been conspicuously absent this year Some are miffed loyalists who felt slighted early in the administration when as one Democratic insider put it the White House was more of a youre with us or against us Rahm place rather than a were all in this together Obama place There is speculation that this category includes Penny Pritzker the billionaire Hyatt Hotels heiress who led Obamas 2008 fundraising effort but who has only given the maximum 5000 to Obamas campaign alone and nothing at all to Priorities Meanwhile many of the Wall Street types who supported Obama last election have switched sides in a welldocumented fit of pique Democrats have been working hard to make inroads into Silicon Valley to make up for the shortfall But so far the political spending of tech tycoons has remained nanoscale focused narrowly on industry issues rather than a broader engagement with electoral politics And although Democrats can still depend on Hollywood most liberal Tinseltowners prefer seeandbeseen fundraising like glitzy dinners with the president The exceptions have included the 2 million that Priorities received from Jeffrey Katzenberg and the 1 million from Bill Maher That leaves a rump of wealthy dogooders  the core of bundlers who each raised hundreds of thousands of dollars from their associates for the 2008 campaign Their efforts combined with the contributions of countless small donors helped Obama set a fundraising record But while the dollar amount was eyepopping the breadth of the donors gave it an egalitarian sheen a crucial distinction to many of the bundlers This wasnt Bill Clintonera softmoney spending in exchange for an overnight stay in the Lincoln Bedroom it was that rare happy moment where principle and financial dominance converged Obama brought in a new crop says a former Democratic fundraiser The first time these people got involved in politics when they went out and raised money it was for their brand new guy a brand new brand The audience Priorities is selling to is people whove never been through the softmoney world This time around rather than simply rally their friends and colleagues around an inspiring cause these donors are also being asked to cut massive checks And because many of them share Obamas disdain for the excesses of a broken campaign finance system the exercise has prompted considerable squeamishness One bundler who has raised more than 800000 told me there was an aversion to the superPACs to the whole idea of them in the bundlers circle Its left a really bad taste in peoples mouths I think its awful says another bundler who has raised more than 600000 for the campaign this year Theres too much money being spent on these elections to begin with Why would anyone want to give 5 million to a superPAC to elect a president Its incomprehensible There are a lot of other things you can give your money to Such as Hospitals and investigative journalism offered the bundler Another donor who had contributed a sixfigure sum to Priorities was already experiencing serious buyers remorse Im very much against people who give everyone who gives to it has made a mistake lamented the donor I should not have given the money I gave I asked whether the stratospheric sums being raised by Republicans required wealthy Democrats to set aside these sorts of qualms After all Obama himself adopted this logic when he grudgingly endorsed Priorities efforts in February I understand the argument that the bad guys are using this But its a question of moral standing the donor explained We should have said This is bad for America and we should have appealed to the American people    Our side gave into panic for shortterm gain The fundraiser who met with Burton and Begala in Chicago essentially agreed With the benefit of hindsight they should have said no to going the superPAC route  its disgusting I think theyre shocked at how unsuccessful theyve been To be sure not all Democratic donors are so agonized John Law director of a California real estate firm sent 100000 to Priorities late last year After doing so Burton was like my new best friend Law jokes because no one else was giving Law is no fan of superPACs either but for him the calculation was an easy one I want the president to win he says Its that simple Unfortunately Law is a mere mortal by superPAC standards Im not a multibillionaire he says A hundred grand is a sizable contribution for me I cant write a milliondollar check There are a tiny number of liberals capable of singlehandedly reversing Priorities lackluster fortunes But financier George Soros has shown no signs of supporting Priorities his adviser Michael Vachon told me that this year his boss was more focused on Europe Meanwhile Progressive Insurance chairman Peter Lewis who gave 25 million in 2004 is currently concentrating on marijuanalaw reform and his adviser Jennifer Frutchy told me that he wont be contributing to Priorities He finds the idea of giving ones fortune to denigrate opponents with negative advertisements rather repulsive and doesnt really want to be a part of

of reductionism in our legal system Devins is a thirdyear law student at Duke University School of LawAn alltoocommon reaction to a given societal ill is to bellow  with righteous indignation of course  that There should be a law against that For drug abuse internet bullying bigotry even rudeness we have become a society conditioned to expect legal solutions to social problemsImplicit in our faith in the legal system however is the assumption that there is a linear relationship between the passage of a law and the consequences enabled by that law This assumption dictates that if we attach a civil or criminal penalty to an undesirable behavior then we should see less of that behavior In the legal world this concept is known as deterrence and since the writings of Jeremy Bentham it has been at the core of criminal justice policyYet it only takes a cursory study of this nations drug prohibition policy particularly the 40 million arrests it has generated since 1970 to acknowledge that the idea of deterrence has little empirical support This is because deterrence along with most core concepts in our modern legal system falls prey to the reductionist fallacyAn intellectual tradition that has captured the world since the invention of Newtonian physics reductionist methodology breaks down systems by studying their component parts Accordingly reductionism assumes that by understanding the parts we can understand the whole Early evolutionary biologists for example believed that macroscale phenomena such as the emergence of a new biological species could be explained by the microscopic process of gene variation and natural selection in individual organisms Now group selection and specieslevel selection are parts of evolutionary biologyIn short recent scientific advances have undermined the reductionist view of change in biological organisms and ecosystems The assumption that isolated genes cause particular phenotypes or physical traits turned out to be wrong Instead scientists realized that genes are not isolated entities like beads on a string one per trait but rather complex interconnected regulatory networksPhysical traits are actually emergent properties arising from the complex interactions within these networks It is rare that they can be understood by looking at any given geneThe legal system is a complex dynamic system akin to a biological ecosystemYet like the original evolutionary theorists who assumed a linear relationship between genes and physical traits mainstream legal analysis is still thoroughly reductionistLegal policy makers largely assume the same linear relationship between individual laws and the behaviors of the legal system and consequently society This assumption is dramatically wrong Each statute each regulation each caselaw precedent serves in the entire web of the law as an adjacent possible niche a tool that enables unprestatable consequences The behaviors enabled by our vast complex network of laws lead to outcomes markedly different than those sought by the policy makers who enacted each individual law You could say this is the law of unintended consequencesThe distinction between reductionism and emergence is far from semanticReductionist thinking ensures policymaking that is as destructive as it is uninformed The passage of many individual laws each seemingly inspired by common sense can in the aggregate unleash unforeseen cruelty There is perhaps no example more poignant than the American fascination with utilizing the force of law to repel people from sin Personal behavioral choices deemed immoral including drug and alcohol use abortion and prostitution have been punished with differing degrees of severity Even attitudes deemed unacceptable such as personally held bigotry have been specially targeted through sentencing enhancements in hatecrimes legislationBut are humans merely Pavlovian dogs ripe for social conditioning Does aberrant behavior disappear once it is criminally proscribed Let us acknowledge the true answer Of course notThese laws do not solve social problems They do trigger a litany of unintended cascading consequences  from black markets and the violent drug cartels they spawn to a prison system that incarcerates 25 percent of the worlds prisoners in a country with only five percent of the worlds population These emergent consequences counsel against using the legislative process to enforce personal moral valuesThe temptation toward formal moral condemnation  known in the legal world as the expressionist function of law  is bipartisan It is fundamentally not an ideological problem but a conceptual one Yet the use of law to force changes in individual behavior often ultimately ushers in deep social pathology that hurts conservatives and liberals alikeA law may be passed with noble intentions but its uses inevitably stray far from its original purpose As the legal system evolves dynamically laws come to serve as adjacent possible niches typically for the benefit of the powerful and to the detriment of the powerless The more numerous the laws and the heavier the sanctions the greater the opportunity for persecution of the innocentAs law professor Grant Gilmore once observed In Heaven there will be no law and the lion will lie down with the lamb  In Hell there will be nothing but law and due process will be meticulously observedWe ignore the emergent consequences of law at our perilNext week we will examine the criminal justice systems most notorious deterrencegonewrong story federal sentences

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/05/23/153442476/by-putting-patients-first-hospital-tries-to-make-care-more-personal?ft=3&f=,No one likes to go to the hospitalBut some hospitals around the nation are trying to make their patients stays a little less unpleasantTheyre members of an organization called Planetree which was founded by a patient named Angelica Thieriot who had a notsogood hospital experience back in the 1970sShe herself became very ill and was hospitalized says Planetree President Susan Frampton And while she felt she got good clinical quality care she was really horrified by the human experience that she had So she founded Planetree with a very lofty goal to change the health care system to be more patient and familycentered And that has been our mission  for the last three and a half decadesToday Planetree has certified or designated 30 hospitals and nursing homes in the US and four countries as meeting a specific list of criteria that qualify them as providing truly patientcentered careAmong the 14 Planetree hospitals in the US is Fauquier Hospital a 97bed facility in Warrenton Va on the outskirts of Washington DCCEO Rodger Baker says there was an element of business to his decision to transform his hospital into a more patientcentered place We felt it could differentiate us in a market with giants around us he saysBut mostly he wanted to make the change because he was convinced that something was wrong with the way hospitals were treating patientsWe put patients in rooms with gowns that dont have backs on them we strip them of their dignity we dont explain things to them And thats really not what they want he saysBaker says he first heard of Planetree in the early 1990s But he had his epiphany while listening to the head of a Planetree hospital in Oregon MidColumbia Medical Center several years laterHe talked about all the things they did in that hospital Baker remembers And for some reason it seemed to click with me in terms of it was the right thing to do  He talked about healing the whole person dealing with individuals in terms of not just doing the science but also healing the whole body in terms of the spirit as wellIndeed Fauquier which achieved its Planetree designation in 2007 offers a wide array of services not usually found in your average hospitalNot only is every one of its patient rooms a private one it has food cooked and delivered to order some from its own organic gardenThe walls are decorated with local art which is sold monthly to raise funds for the hospitals foundation And the hallways are carpeted to keep the noise level downWe have massage therapy we do hand massages says Lisa Spitzer the hospitals concierge We bake cookies every week we have volunteers come in once a week for this wonderful vanilla aromatherapySpitzer  whose job is essentially to make sure that patients staff and families have whatever they need whenever they need it  describes Fauquier as having a different energy about it since it adopted the Planetree modelDoctors and patients seem to agreeInterventional radiologist Adam Winick admits he was a skeptic at firstWinick says he was particularly concerned about doing away with set visiting hours which among other things gave patients families open access to the intensive care unitMy own little area that I was most worried about was in a code setting when the patients heart stops And having the family members standing there watching I felt would traumatize the patients families because they dont understand whats going on he saysBut that hasnt turned out to be a problem after all The hospital always makes sure a staff member is on hand to explain to the family whats going on in those situationsWinick also says that communication has improved between patients and staff and between doctors and nurses as a result of the changes Poor communication in the hospital was a key complaint in the poll conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard School of Public HealthIt puts everybody in the mindset that Im doing this for the patient he says A doctor doesnt mistreat a nurse out of anger because hes doing it or shes doing it  asking a question for the patients benefitPatients also seem to appreciate what they see as more personal careIts friendly its more like home says Marianna Traczuk whos been in and out of Fauquier several times being treated for ovarian cancer She says she prefers Fauquier to the hospital where she used to get care in Maryland Its nice to have someone walk in and say Hi how are you today instead of walking by and acting as if youre invisibleAnd how much more does all this pampering costActually unlike many hospitals Fauquier doesnt charge extra for private rooms or fancy foodAnd Planetree President Susan Frampton says that providing the kind of care that involves patients and their families and that patients actually want can cut costs She says that one hospital system that has some hospitals in the Planetree system and some that arent compared its orthopedic patientsAnd they found that the length of stay was actually shorter in the Planetree hospitals she says People healed quicker they were discharged more quickly and so the cost of care came down So it was interesting to counter that misbelief that care has to be more expensive if its done in a patientcentered context or in a place thats more pleasant to be inBut health quality experts like Don Berwick the former head of Medicare warn that the most important part of places that are designated by Planetree arent the fancy extras like alternative therapies or fancy food  its the actual involvement of patients and families in their own careThe amenities are nice of course he says But what really counts in patientcentered care is that the more patients and families and their loved ones participate in their own care really play an active role in the care itself the better the care gets Outcomes get better costs fall and satisfaction increases So this isnt about the amenities this is about the core of health careBerwick and other quality experts also warn that being a patientcentered facility doesnt itself guarantee highquality care Patients still have to make sure the medical staff is following proper guidelines for care and getting those good outcomes But they say that keeping the patient and family highly involved in their care is one important indicator of a good hospital Copyright 2014 NPR,20120523,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/05/13/152577588/gil-evans-essential-jazz-arranger-at-100?ft=3&f=,Gil Evans one of the most important jazz arrangers of the 20th century was born 100 years ago today Evans is best known for music he wrote between 1957 and 1963 for his 19piece orchestra which backed trumpeter Miles Davis The albums Sketches of Spain and Porgy and Bess were hailed for their rich harmonies and use of instruments not usually associated with jazz big bands But in a 1980 interview Evans said he wanted to use orchestral instruments in a new way Many great compositions have been written with the traditional sound of the orchestra You know what I mean Nothing much has been added to it as far as sound is concerned Evans gave the orchestra a different sound by creating unusual harmonies using colors he borrowed from Debussy Ravel and Stravinsky I got the harmonic language from the French Spanish and Russian Impressionists he said in the same interview Thats where the harmony comes from Evans made it sound easy but Emile Charlap  a music copyist who worked with Evans in the 50s filling out and finishing his scores  says the arranger labored to create that new sound He sat there all night composing Charlap recalls I had a secretary who worked for me who lived upstairs And she told me that she cant sleep because Gil is there all night and he plays F F F all night long  That was like the beginnings of Sketches of Spain Evans arranged Sketches of Spain in Charlaps New York offices Gil was beyond belief Charlap says He would work on one thing forever I dont know about the word slow Slow might be the right thing because he wanted it to be the note He would write a whole arrangement and leave out one note and come back two weeks later to put that right note in Birth Of The Cool Born in 1912 in Toronto and raised in Stockton Calif Evans spent a lifetime creating a new sound for a jazz orchestra and did it without any musical education He said he learned how to handle a popular song from copying the arrangements on early Louis Armstrong records He always played popular music in the 1930s he led his own dance band in Stockton But his music became more complex when he joined bandleader Claude Thornhills orchestra in 1941 Then in the late 1940s Evans met Miles Davis Their initial collaboration grew out of informal jam sessions at the arrangers apartment on 52nd Street where some of the best young beboppers in town showed up The result was a series of recordings that came to be known as Birth of the Cool credited today with launching the cool sound in jazz Among the musicians was a young French horn player Gunther Schuller Now a worldreknowned composer Schuller says the arrangements were amazing  in particular a piece called Moondreams written by Glen Millers pianist Chuck McGregor Gil Evans just recomposed this piece in his own much more advanced style Schuller says He composed this coda which starts with a dramatically dissonant chord very loud And over a period of about lets say a minute and a half the music subsides It gets softer and softer And it calms down also rhythmically Its very agitated at first And it finally comes to a very beautiful soft restful ending in B minor Its just an incredible piece of composition How he came up with that at that time  its just beyond even my comprehension and I knew him very well The Space Between The Notes Evans wrote dozens of scores that were never recorded Composer Ryan Truesdell spent the last three years unearthing 50 of them most written for the Thornhill Orchestra in the late 1940s He assembled a modern orchestra to record 10 songs for a record released today for Evanss birthday called Centennial Newly Discovered Works of Gil Evans Truesdell says what makes Evans sound distinctive is an air of mystery that comes from the space between the notes in his chords Its almost like a cloud that the music is able to float on he says With the brass section for instance Evans would write four maybe fivenote voicings But instead of putting them really spaced out so they took up all that range from bottom to top he would put them all together And then all of a sudden theres all this air between the bass  you know the walking bass line  and these instruments And it gives it a floaty very light effect In the 1960s Evans updated his orchestra with electric guitars and synthesizers but he continued to harmonize with his close note chords In 1983 a week before his 71st birthday Evans sat at the piano in his cramped New York apartment took a toke on the marijuana in his pipe and showed me how he harmonized the Jimi Hendrix song Up From the Skies Its got a certain spice to it right Because the notes are close he said Evans said he never made a cent off any of his records  but he was cool with that I started out as an arranger he said If Id known at the time it was such a losers game I wouldnt have done it because the arranger doesnt get any royalties But I had so much fun doing it I never even thought of that at the time Evans said there was no use complaining about the past he was only interested in what was happening now He died at the age of 75 in 1988

arguments on the fate of President Obamas health care law A transcript of Tuesdays arguments as prepared by the court followsCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS We will continue argument this morning in Case 11398 the Department of Health and Human Services v FloridaGeneral Verrilli ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B VERRILLI JR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS GENERAL VERRILLI Mr Chief Justice and may it please the CourtThe Affordable Care Act addresses a fundamental and enduring problem in our health care system and our economy Insurance has become the predominant means of paying for health care in this country Insurance has become the predominant means of paying for health care in this countryFor most Americans for more than 80 percent of Americans the insurance system does provide effective access Excuse me But for more than 40 million Americans who do not have access to health insurance either through their employer or through government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid the system does not work Those individuals must resort to the individual market and that market does not provide affordable health insuranceIt does not do so because because the multibillion dollar subsidies that are available for the the employer market are not available in the individual market It does not do so because ERISA and HIPAA regulations that preclude that preclude discrimination against people based on their medical history do not apply in the individual market That is an economic problem And it begets another economic problemJUSTICE SCALIA Why arent those problems that the Federal Government can address directlyGENERAL VERRILLI They can address it directly Justice Scalia and they are addressing it directly through this through this Act by regulating the means by which health care by which health care is purchased That is the way this Act worksUnder the Commerce Clause what what Congress has done is to enact reforms of the insurance market directed at the individual insurance market that preclude that preclude discrimination based on preexisting conditions that require guaranteed issue and community rating and it uses  and the minimum coverage provision is necessary to carry into execution those insurance reformsJUSTICE KENNEDY Can you create commerce in order to regulate itGENERAL VERRILLI Thats not whats going on here Justice Kennedy and we are not seeking to defend the law on that basisIn this case the  what is being regulated is the method of financing health the purchase of health care That itself is economic activity with substantial effects on interstate commerce And JUSTICE SCALIA Any self purchasing Anything I  you know if Im in any market at all my failure to purchase something in that market subjects me to regulationGENERAL VERRILLI No Thats not our position at all Justice Scalia In the health care market the health care market is characterized by the fact that aside from the few groups that Congress chose to exempt from the minimum coverage requirement  those who for religious reasons dont participate those who are incarcerated Indian tribes  virtually everybody else is either in that market or will be in that market and the distinguishing feature of that is that they cannot people cannot generally control when they enter that market or what they need when they enter that marketCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Well the same it seems to me would be true say for the market in emergency services police fire ambulance roadside assistance whatever You dont know when youre going to need it youre not sure that you will But the same is true for health care You dont know if youre going to need a heart transplant or if you ever will So there is a market there To  in some extent we all participate in itSo can the government require you to buy a cell phone because that would facilitate responding when you need emergency services You can just dial 911 no matter where you areGENERAL VERRILLI No Mr Chief Justice think thats different Its  We  I dont think we think of that as a market This is a market This is market regulation And in addition you have a situation in this market not only where people enter involuntarily as to when they enter and wont be able to control what they need when they enter but when they CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS It seems to me thats the same as in my hypothetical You dont know when youre going to need police assistance You cant predict the extent to emergency response that youll need But when you do and the government provides it I thought that was an important part of your argument that when you need health care the government will make sure you get it Well when you need police assistance or fire assistance or ambulance assistance the government is going to make sure to the best extent it can that you get it  get itGENERAL VERRILLI I think the fundamental difference Mr Chief Justice is that thats not an issue of market regulation This is an issue of market regulation and thats how Congress thats how Congress looked at this problem There is a market Insurance is provided through the market system JUSTICE ALITO Do you think there is a a market for burial servicesGENERAL VERRILLI For burial servicesJUSTICE ALITO YesGENERAL VERRILLI Yes Justice Alito I think there isJUSTICE ALITO All right suppose that you and I walked around downtown Washington at lunch hour and we found a couple of healthy young people and we stopped them and we said You know what youre doing You are financing your burial services right now because eventually youre going to die and somebody is going to have to pay for it and if you dont have burial insurance and you havent saved money for it youre going to shift the cost to somebody elseIsnt that a very artificial way of talking about what somebody is doingGENERAL VERRILLI No that JUSTICE ALITO And if thats true why isnt it equally artificial to say that somebody who is doing absolutely nothing about health care is financing health care servicesGENERAL VERRILLI Its I think its completely different The  and the reason is that the the burial example is not  the difference is here we are regulating the method by which you are paying for something else  health care  and the insurance requirement  I think the key thing here is my friends on the other side acknowledge that it is within the authority of Congress under Article I under the commerce power to impose guaranteedissue and community rating forms to end  to impose a minimum coverage provision Their argument is just that it has to occur at the point of sale and JUSTICE ALITO I dont see the difference You can get burial insurance You can get health insurance Most people are going to need health care Almost everybody Everybody is going to be buried or cremated at some point Whats the differenceGENERAL VERRILLI Well one big difference one big difference Justice Alito is the  you dont have the cost shifting to other market participants Here JUSTICE ALITO Sure you do because if you dont have money then the State is going to pay for it Or some GENERAL VERRILLI Thats differentJUSTICE ALITO Or a family member is going to payGENERAL VERRILLI Thats a difference and its a significant difference In this situation one of the economic effects Congress is addressing is that the  there  the many billions of dollars of uncompensated costs are transferred directly to other market participants Its transferred directly to other market participants because health care providers charge higher rates in order to cover the cost of uncompensated care and insurance companies reflect those higher rates in higher premiums which Congress found translates to a thousand dollars per family in additional health insurance costsJUSTICE ALITO But isnt that a very small part of what the mandate is doing You can correct me if these figures are wrong but it appears to me that the CBO has estimated that the average premium for a single insurance policy in the nongroup market would be roughly 5800 in  in 2016Respondents  the economists have supported  the Respondents estimate that a young healthy individual targeted by the mandate on average consumes about 854 in health services each year So the mandate is forcing these people to provide a huge subsidy to the insurance companies for other purposes that the act wishes to serve but isnt  if those figures are right isnt it the case that what this mandate is really doing is not requiring the people who are subject to it to pay for the services that they are going to consume It is requiring them to subsidize services that will be received by somebody elseGENERAL VERRILLI No I think that  I do think thats what the Respondents argue Its just not right I think it  it really gets to a fundamental problem with their argumentJUSTICE GINSBURG If youre going to have insurance thats how insurance worksGENERAL VERRILLI A it is how insurance works but B the problem that they  that they are identifying is not that problem The  the guaranteed issue and community rating reforms do not have the effect of forcing insurance companies to take on lots of additional people who they then cant afford to cover because theyre  they tend to be the sick and that is  in fact the exact opposite is what happens hereThe  when  when you enact Guaranteed Issue and Community Rating Reforms and you do so in the absence of a minimum coverage provision its not that insurance companies take on more and more people and then need a subsidy to cover it its that fewer and fewer people end up with insurance because their rates are not regulated Insurance companies when  when they have to offer Guaranteed Issue and Community Rating they are entitled to make a profit They charge rates sufficient to cover only the sick population because health JUSTICE KENNEDY Could you help  help me with this Assume for the moment  you may disagree Assume for the moment that this is unprecedented this is a step beyond what our cases have allowed the affirmative duty to act to go into commerce If that is so do you not have a heavy burden of justificationI understand that we must presume laws are constitutional but even so when you are changing the relation of the individual to the government in this what we can stipulate is I think a unique way do you not have a heavy burden of justification to show authorization under the ConstitutionGENERAL VERRILLI So two things about that Justice Kennedy First we think this is regulation of peoples participation in the health care market and all  all this minimum coverage provision does is say that instead of requiring insurance at the point of sale that Congress has the authority under the commerce power and the necessary proper power to ensure that people have insurance in advance of the point of sale because of the unique nature of this market because this is a market in which  in which you  although most of the population is in the market most of the time  83 percent visit a physician every year 96 percent over a fiveyear period  so virtually everybody in society is in this market and youve got to pay for the health care you get the predominant way in which its  in which its paid for is insurance and  and the Respondents agree that Congress could require that you have insurance in order to get health care or forbid health care from being provided JUSTICE SCALIA Why do you  why do you define the market that broadly Health care It may well be that everybody needs health care sooner or later but not everybody needs a heart transplant not everybody needs a liver transplant Why GENERAL VERRILLI Thats correct Justice Scalia but you never know whether youre going to be that personJUSTICE SCALIA Could you define the market  everybody has to buy food sooner or later so you define the market as food therefore everybody is in the market therefore you can make people buy broccoliGENERAL VERRILLI No thats quite different Thats quite different The food market while it shares that trait that everybodys in it it is not a market in which your participation is often unpredictable and often involuntary It is not a market in which you often dont know before you go in what you need and it is not a market in which if you go in and  and seek to obtain a product or service you will get it even if you cant pay for it It doesnt JUSTICE SCALIA Is that a principal basis for distinguishing this from other situations I mean you know you can also say well the person subject to this has blue eyes That would indeed distinguish it from other situations Is it a principle basisI mean its  its a basis that explains why the government is doing this but is it  is it a basis which shows that this is not going beyond what  what the  the system of enumerated powers allows the government to doGENERAL VERRILLI Yes for two reasons First this  the test as this Court has articulated it is Is Congress regulating economic activity with a substantial effect on interstate commerceThe way in which this statute satisfies the test is on the basis of the factors that I have identified If JUSTICE GINSBURG Mr Verrilli I thought that your main point is that unlike food or any other market when you made the choice not to buy insurance even though you have every intent in the world to selfinsure to save for it when disaster strikes you may not have the money And the tangible result of it is  we were told there was one brief that Maryland Hospital Care bills 7 percent more because of these uncompensated costs that families pay a thousand dollars more than they would if there were no uncompensated costsI thought what was unique about this is its not my choice whether I want to buy a product to keep me healthy but the cost that I am forcing on other people if I dont buy the product sooner rather than laterGENERAL VERRILLI That is  and that is definitely a difference that distinguishes this market and justifies this as a regulationJUSTICE BREYER All right So if that is your difference  if that is your difference Im somewhat uncertain about your answers to  for example Justice Kennedy asked can you under the Commerce Clause Congress create commerce where previously none existedWell yeah I thought the answer to that was since McCulloch versus Maryland when the Court said Congress could create the Bank of the United States which did not previously exist which job was to create commerce that did not previously exist since that time the answer has been yes I would have thought that your answer  can the government in fact require you to buy cell phones or buy burials that if we propose comparable situations if we have for example a uniform United States system of paying for every burial such as Medicare Burial Medicaid Burial CHIP Burial ERISA Burial and Emergency Burial beside the side of the road and Congress wanted to rationalize that system wouldnt the answer be yes of course they couldGENERAL VERRILLI So JUSTICE BREYER And the same with the computers or the same with the  the cell phones if youre driving by the side of the highway and there is a federal emergency service just as you say you have to buy certain mufflers for your car that dont hurt the environment you could  I mean see doesnt it depend on the situationGENERAL VERRILLI It does Justice Breyer and if Congress were to enact laws like that we JUSTICE BREYER We would be  or GENERAL VERRILLI My responsibility  and I would defend them on a rationale like that but I do think that we are advancing a narrower rationaleJUSTICE KENNEDY Well then your question is whether or not there are any limits on the Commerce Clause Can you identify for us some limits on the Commerce ClauseGENERAL VERRILLI Yes The  the rationale purely under the Commerce Clause that were advocating here would not justify forced purchases of commodities for the purpose of stimulating demand We  the  it would not justify purchases of insurance for the purposes  in situations in which insurance doesnt serve as the method of payment for service JUSTICE KENNEDY But why not If Congress  if Congress says that the interstate commerce is affected isnt according to your view that the end of the analysisGENERAL VERRILLI No The the  we think that in a  when  the difference between those situations and this situation is that in those situations Your Honor Congress would be moving to create commerce Here Congress is regulating existing commerce economic activity that is already going on peoples participation in the health care market and is regulating to deal with existing effects of existing commerceCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS That  that it seems to me its a  its a passage in your reply brief that I didnt quite grasp Its the same point You say health insurance is not purchased for its own sake like a car or broccoli it is a means of financing health care consumption and covering universal risks Well a car or broccoli arent purchased for their own sake either They are purchased for the sake of transportation or in broccoli covering the need for food I  I dont understand that distinctionGENERAL VERRILLI The difference Mr Chief Justice is that health insurance is the means of payment for health care and broccoli is CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Well now thats a significant  Im sorryGENERAL VERRILLI And  and broccoli is not the means of payment for anything else And an automobile is not CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Its the means of satisfying a basic human need just as your insurance is a means of satisfying GENERAL VERRILLI But I do think thats the difference between existing commerce activity in the market already occurring  the people in the health care market purchasing obtaining health care services  and the creation of commerce And the principle that we are advocating here under the Commerce Clause does not take the step of justifying the creation of commerce Its a regulation of the existing commerceJUSTICE GINSBURG General Verrilli can wecan we go back to Justice Breyer asked a question and it kind of interrupted your answer to my question And tell me if Im wrong about this but I thought a major major point of your argument was that the people who dont participate in this market are making it much more expensive for the people who do that is they they will get a good number of them will get services that they cant afford at the point where they need them and the result is that everybody elses premiums get raised So youre not  its not your  your free choice just to do something for yourself What you do is going to affect others affect them in  in a major wayGENERAL VERRILLI That  that absolutely is a justification for Congresss action here That is existing economic activity that Congress is regulating by means of this ruleJUSTICE SCALIA General Verrilli you you could say that about buying a car If  if people dont buy cars the price that those who do buy cars pay will have to be higher So you could say in order to bring the price down you are hurting these other people by not buying a carGENERAL VERRILLI That is not what we are saying Justice ScaliaJUSTICE SCALIA Thats not  thats not what youre sayingGENERAL VERRILLI Thats not  not JUSTICE SCALIA I thought it wasI thought you were saying other people are going to have to pay more for insurance because youre not buying itGENERAL VERRILLI No Its because youre going  in the health care market youre going into the market without the ability to pay for what you get getting the health care service anyway as a result of the social norms that allow  that  to which weve obligated ourselves so that people get health careJUSTICE SCALIA Well dont obligate yourself to that Why  you knowGENERAL VERRILLI Well I cant imagine that that  that the Commerce Clause would would forbid Congress from taking into account this deeply embedded social normJUSTICE SCALIA You  you could do it But  but does that expand your ability to to issue mandates to  to the peopleGENERAL VERRILLI I  I  this is not a purchase mandate This is a  this is a law that regulates the method of paying for a service that the class of people to whom it applies are either consuming JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR General GENERAL VERRILLI  or  or inevitably will consumeJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR General I see or have seen three strands of arguments in your briefs and one of them is echoed today The first strand that I have seen is that Congress can pass any necessary laws to effect those powers within its rights ie because it made a decision that to effect to effect mandatory issuance of insurance that it could also obligate the mandatory purchase of itThe second strand I see is selfinsurance affects the market and so the government can regulate those who selfinsureAnd the third argument  and I see all of them as different  is that what the government is doing and I think its the argument youre making today  that what the  what the government is saying is if you pay for  if you use health services you have to pay with insurance Because only insurance will guarantee that whatever need for health care that you have will be covered Because virtually no one perhaps with the exception of 1 percent of the population can afford the massive cost if the unexpected happensThis third argument seems to be saying what we are regulating is health care and when you go for health services you have to pay for insurance and since insurance wont issue at the moment that you consume the product we can reasonably necessarily tell you to buy it ahead of time because you cant buy it at the moment that you need itIs that  which of these three is your argument Are all of them your argument Im just not sure what the GENERAL VERRILLI So let me try to state it this way The Congress enacted reforms of the insurance market the guaranteedissue and communityrating reforms It did so to deal with a very serious problem that results in 40 million people not being able to get insurance and therefore not access to the health care environment Everybody agrees in this case that those are within Congresss Article I powersThe minimum coverage provision is necessary to carry those provisions into  into execution because without them without those provisions without minimum coverage guaranteed issue and community rating will as the experience in the States showed make matters worse not better There will be fewer people covered it will cost more Now the  so JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR So on that ground youre answering affirmatively to my colleagues that have asked you the question can the government force you into commerceGENERAL VERRILLI So  noJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR And there is no limit to that powerGENERAL VERRILLI No No Because thats  thats the first part of our argumentThe second part of our argument is that the means here that the Congress has chosen the minimum coverage provision is a means that regulates the that regulates economic activity namely your transaction in the health care market with substantial effects on interstate commerce and it is the conjunction of those two that we think provides the particularly secure foundation for this statute under the commerce powerJUSTICE KAGAN General youve talked on a couple of times about other alternatives that Congress might have had other alternatives that the Respondents suggest to deal with this problem in particular the alternative of mandating insurance at the point at which somebody goes to a hospital or an emergency room and asks for careDid Congress consider those alternatives Why did it reject them How should we think about the question of alternative ways of dealing with these problemsGENERAL VERRILLI I do think Justice Kagan that the point of difference between my friends on the other side and the United States is about one of timing They have agreed that Congress has Article I authority to impose an insurance requirement or other or other penalty at the point of sale and they have agreed that Congress has the authority to do that to achieve the same objectives that the minimum coverage provision of the Affordable Care Act is designed to achieve This is a situation if which we are talking about means Congress gets a substantial deference in the choice of means and if one thinks about the difference between the means they say Congress should have chosen and the means Congress did choose I think you can see why it was eminently more sensible for Congress to choose the means that it choseJUSTICE KENNEDY Im not sure which way it cuts If the Congress has alternate means lets assume it can use the tax power to raise revenue and to just have a national health service single payer How does that factor into our analysis In the one sense it can be argued that this is what the government is doing it ought to be honest about the power that its using and use the correct power On the other hand it means that since the Court can do it anyway  Congress can do it anyway we give a certain amount of latitude Im not sure which the way the argument goesGENERAL VERRILLI Let me try to answer that question Justice Kennedy and get back to the question you asked me earlier The the  I do think one striking feature of the argument here that this is a novel exercise of power is that what Congress chose to do was to rely on market mechanisms and efficiency and a method that has more choice than would the traditional MedicareMedicaid type model and so it seems a little ironic to suggest that that counts against itBut beyond that in the sense that its novel this provision is novel in the same way or unprecedented in the same way that the Sherman Act was unprecedented when the Court upheld it in the Northern Securities case or the Packers and Stockyards Act was unprecedented when the Court upheld it or the National Labor Relations Act was unprecedented when the Court upheld it in Jones and Laughlin or the  the dairy price supports in Wrightwood Dairy and Rock Royal JUSTICE SCALIA Oh no its not They all involved commerce There was no doubt that was what regulated was commerce And here youre regulating somebody who isnt coveredBy the way I dont agree with you that the relevant market here is health care Youre not regulating health care Youre regulating insurance Its the insurance market that youre addressing and youre saying that some people who are not in it must be in it and thats  thats difference from regulating in any manner commerce that already exists out thereGENERAL VERRILLI Well to the extent that we are looking at the comprehensive scheme Justice Scalia it is regulating commerce that already exists out there And the means in which that regulation is made effective here the minimum coverage provision is a regulation of the way in which people participate the method of their payment in the health care market That is what it isAnd I do think Justice Kennedy getting back to the question you asked before what  what matters here is whether Congress is choosing a tool thats reasonably adapted to the problem that Congress is confronting And that may mean that the tool is different from a tool that Congress has chosen to use in the past Thats not something that counts against the provision in a Commerce Clause analysisJUSTICE SCALIA Wait Thats  thats its both Necessary and Proper What you just said addresses whats necessary Yes has to be reasonably adapted Necessary does not mean essential just reasonably adapted But in addition to being necessary it has to be proper And weve held in two cases that something that was reasonably adapted was not proper because it violated the sovereignty of the States which was implicit in the constitutional structureThe argument here is that this also is  may be necessary but its not proper because it violates an equally evident principle in the Constitution which is that the Federal Government is not supposed to be a government that has all powers that its supposed to be a government of limited powers And thats what all this questioning has been about What  what is left If the government can do this what what else can it not doGENERAL VERRILLI This does not violate the norm of proper as this Court articulated it in Printz or in New York because it does not interfere with the States as sovereigns This is a regulation that  this is a regulation JUSTICE SCALIA No that wasnt my point That is not the only constitutional principle that existsGENERAL VERRILLI But it JUSTICE SCALIA An equally evident constitutional principle is the principle that the Federal Government is a government of enumerated powers and that the vast majority of powers remain in the States and do not belong to the Federal Government Do you acknowledge that thats a principleGENERAL VERRILLI Of course we do Your HonorJUSTICE SCALIA Okay Thats what we are talking about hereGENERAL VERRILLI And the way in which this Court in its cases has policed the boundary that  of whats in the national sphere and whats in the local sphere is to ask whether Congress is regulating economic activity with a substantial effect on interstate commerce And here I think its really impossible in view of our history to say that Congress is invading the State sphere This is a  this is a market in which 50 percent of the people in this country get their health care through their employer There is a massive Federal tax subsidy of 250 billion a year that makes that much more affordable ERISA and HIPAA regulate that to ensure that the kinds of bans on preexisting condition discrimination and pricing practices that occur in the individual market dont occurJUSTICE SCALIA I dont understand your GENERAL VERRILLI This is in JUSTICE SCALIA Whatever the States have chosen not to do the Federal Government can doGENERAL VERRILLI No not at allJUSTICE SCALIA I mean the Tenth Amendment says the powers not given to the Federal Government are reserved not just to the States but to the States and the people And the argument here is that the people were left to decide whether they want to buy insurance or notGENERAL VERRILLI But this  but Your Honor this is  what the Court has said and I think it would be a very substantial departure from what the Court has said is that when Congress is regulating economic activity with a substantial effect on interstate commerce that will be upheld And that is what is going on here and to embark on  I would submit with all due respect to embark on the kind of analysis that my friends on the other side suggest the Court ought to embark on is to import Lochnerstyle substantive due process CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS The key in Lochner is that we were talking about regulation of the States right and the States are not limited to enumerated powers The Federal Government is And it seems to me its an entirely different question when you ask yourself whether or not there are going to be limits in the Federal power as opposed to limits on the States which was the issue in LochnerGENERAL VERRILLI I agree exceptMr Chief Justice that what the Court has said as I read the Courts cases is that the way in which you ensure that the Federal Government stays in its sphere and the sphere reserved for the States is protected is by policing the boundary Is the national government regulating economic activity with a substantial effect on interstate commerceJUSTICE KENNEDY But the reason the reason this is concerning is because it requires the individual to do an affirmative act In the law of torts our tradition our law has been that you dont have the duty to rescue someone if that person is in danger The blind man is walking in front of a car and you do not have a duty to stop him absent some relation between you And there is some severe moral criticisms of that rule but thats generally the ruleAnd here the government is saying that the Federal Government has a duty to tell the individual citizen that it must act and that is different from what we have in previous cases and that changes the relationship of the Federal Government to the individual in the very fundamental wayGENERAL VERRILLI I dont think so Justice Kennedy because it is predicated on the participation of these individuals in the market for health care services Now it happens to be that this is a market in which aside from the groups that the statute excludes virtually everybody participates But it is a regulation of their participation in that marketCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Well but its critical how you define the market If I understand the law the policies that youre requiring people to purchase involve  must contain provision for maternity and newborn care pediatric services and substance use treatment It seems to me that you cannot say that everybody is going to need substance use treatment substance use treatment or pediatric services and yet that is part of what you require them to purchaseGENERAL VERRILLI Well its part of what the statute requires the insurers to offer And I think the reason is because its trying to define minimum essential coverage because the problem CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS But your theory is that there is a market in which everyone participates because everybody might need a certain range of health care services and yet youre requiring people who are not  never going to need pediatric or maternity services to participate in that marketGENERAL VERRILLI The  with respect to what insurance has to cover Your Honor I think Congress is entitled the latitude of making the judgments of what the appropriate scope of coverage is And the problem here in this market is that for  you may think youre perfectly healthy and you may think that youre not  that youre being forced to subsidize somebody else but this is not a market in which you can say that there is a immutable class of healthy people who are being forced to subsidize the unhealthy This is a market in which you may be healthy one day and you may be a very unhealthy participant in that market the next day and that is a fundamental difference and youre not going to know in which CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS I think youre posing the question I was posing which is that doesnt apply to a lot of what youre requiring people to purchase Pediatric services maternity services You cannot say that everybody is going to participate in the substance use market and yet you require people to purchase insurance coverage for thatGENERAL VERRILLI Congress has got Congress is enacting economic regulation here It has latitude to define essential the attributes of essential coverage That doesnt  that doesnt seem to me to implicate the question of whether Congress is engaging in economic regulation and solving an economic problem here and that is what Congress is doingJUSTICE ALITO Are you denying this If you took the group of people who are subject to the mandate and you calculated the amount of health care services this whole group would consume and figured out the cost of an insurance policy to cover the services that group would consume the cost of that policy would be much much less than the kind of policy that these people are now going to be required to purchase under the Affordable Care ActGENERAL VERRILLI Well while they are young and healthy that would be true But they are not going to be young and healthy forever They are going to be on the other side of that actuarial equation at some point And of course you dont know which among that group is the person whos going to be hit by the bus or get the definitive diagnosis And that JUSTICE ALITO The point is  no you take into account that some people in that group are going to be hit by a bus some people in that group are going to unexpectedly contract or be diagnosed with a disease that  that is very expensive to treat But if you take their costs and you calculate that thats a lot less than the amount that they are going to be required to paySo that you cant just justify this on the basis of their trying to shift their costs off to other people can youGENERAL VERRILLI Well the  the people in that class get benefits too Justice Alito They get the guaranteedissue benefit that they would not otherwise have which is an enormously valuable benefitAnd in terms of the  the subsidy rationale I  I dont think  I think its  it would be unusual to say that its an illegitimate exercise of the commerce power for some people to subsidize others Telephone rates in this country for a century were set via the exercise of the commerce power in a way in which some people paid rates that were much higher than their costs in order to subsidize JUSTICE SCALIA Only if you make phone callsGENERAL VERRILLI Well right But  but everybody  to live in the modern world everybody needs a telephone And the  the same thing with respect to the  you know the dairy price supports that  that the Court upheld in Wrightwood Dairy and Rock Royal You can look at those as disadvantageous contracts as forced transfers that  you know I suppose its theoretically true that you could raise your kids without milk but the reality is youve got to go to the store and buy milk And the commerce power as a result of the exercise of the commerce power youre subsidizing somebody else JUSTICE KAGAN And this is especially true isnt it General GENERAL VERRILLI  because thats the judgment Congress has madeJUSTICE KAGAN  Verrilli because in this context the subsidizers eventually become the subsidizedGENERAL VERRILLI Well that was the point I was trying to make Justice Kagan that youre young and healthy one day but you dont stay that way And the  the system works over time And so I just dont think its a fair characterization of it And it does get back to I think  a problem I think is important to understand JUSTICE SCALIA Were not stupid Theyre going to buy insurance later Theyre young and  and need the money nowGENERAL VERRILLI But thats JUSTICE SCALIA When  when they think they have a substantial risk of incurring high medical bills theyll buy insurance like the rest of usBut GENERAL VERRILLI Thats  thats JUSTICE SCALIA  I dont know why you think that theyre never going to buy itGENERAL VERRILLI Thats the problem Justice Scalia Thats  and thats exactly the experience that the States had that made the imposition of guaranteedissue and community rating not only be ineffectual but be highly counterproductive Rates for example in New Jersey doubled or tripled went from 180000 people covered in this market down to 80000 people covered in this marketIn Kentucky virtually every insurer left the market And the reason for that is because when people have that guarantee of  that they can get insurance theyre going to make that calculation that they wont get it until theyre sick and they need it and so the pool of people in the insurance market gets smaller and smaller The rates you have to charge to cover them get higher and higher It helps fewer and fewer  insurance covers fewer and fewer people until the system endsThis is not a situation in which youre conscripting  youre forcing insurance companies to cover very large numbers of unhealthy people JUSTICE SCALIA You could solve that problem by simply not requiring the insurance company to sell it to somebody who has a  a condition that is going to require medical treatment or at least not not require them to sell it to him at  at a rate that he sells it to healthy peopleBut you dont want to do thatGENERAL VERRILLI But that seems to me to say Justice Scalia that Congress  thats the problem here And that seems to be JUSTICE SCALIA That seems to me a selfcreated problemGENERAL VERRILLI Congress cannot solve the problem through standard economic regulation and that  and  and I do not think that can be the premise of our understanding of the Commerce Clause JUSTICE SCALIA Whatever GENERAL VERRILLI  this is an economic problem JUSTICE SCALIA  whatever problems Congresss economic regulation produces whatever they are I think Congress can do something to counteract them Here requiring somebody to enter  to enter the insurance marketGENERAL VERRILLI This is not a  its not a problem of Congresss creation The problem is that you have 40 million people who cannot get affordable insurance through the means that the rest of us get affordable insurance Congress after a long study and careful deliberation and viewing the experiences of the States and the way they tried to handle this problem adopted a package of reforms Guaranteedissue and community rating and  and subsidies and the minimum coverage provision are a package of reforms that solve that problemI dont  I think its highly artificial to view this as a problem of Congresss own creationCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Is your argument limited to insurance or means of paying for health careGENERAL VERRILLI Yes Its limited to insuranceCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Well now why is that Congress could  once you  once you establish that you have a market for health care I would suppose Congresss power under the Commerce Clause meant they had a broad scope in terms of how they regulate that market And it would be  it would be going back to Lochner if we were put in the position of saying no you can use your commerce power to regulate insurance but you cant use your commerce power to regulate this market in other ways I think that would be a very significant intrusion by the Court into Congresss powerSo I dont see how we can accept your its good for you in this case to say oh its just insurance But once we say that there is a market and Congress can require people to participate in it as some would say  or as you would say that people are already participating in it  it seems to me that we cant say there are limitations on what Congress can do under its commerce power just like in any other area all  given significant deference that we accord to Congress in this area all bets are off and you could regulate that market in any rational wayGENERAL VERRILLI But this is insurance as a method of payment for health care services CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS ExactlyGENERAL VERRILLI And that  and that is CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS And youre worried  thats the area that Congress has chosen to regulate Theres this health care market Everybodys in it So we can regulate it and were going to look at a particular serious problem which is how people pay for it But next year they can decide everybodys in this market were going to look at a different problem now and this is how were going to regulate it And we can compel people to do things  purchase insurance in this case Something else in the next case because youve  weve accepted the argument that this is a market in which everybody participatesGENERAL VERRILLI Mr Chief Justice let me answer that and then if I may Id like to move to the tax power argumentJUSTICE SCALIA Can  can I tell you what the something else is so  while youre answering it The something else is everybody has to exercise because theres no doubt that lack of exercise cause  causes illness and that causes health care costs to go upSo the Federal government says everybody has to  to join a  an exercise club Thats  thats the something elseGENERAL VERRILLI No The  the position were taking here would not justify that rule Justice Scalia because health club membership is not a means of payment for  for consumption of anything in  in a marketCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Right Right Thats  thats exactly right but it doesnt seem responsive to my concern that theres no reason  once we say this is within Congresss commerce power theres no reason other than our own arbitrary judgment to say all they can regulate is the method of payment They can regulate other things that affect this nowconceded interstate market in health care in which everybody participatesGENERAL VERRILLI But I think its common ground between us and the Respondents that this is an interstate market in which everybody participates And they agree that  that Congress could impose the insurance requirement at the point of sale And this is just a question of timing and whether Congresss whether the necessary and proper authority gives Congress because of the particular features of this market the ability to impose the  the insurance the need for insurance the maintenance of insurance before you show up to get health care rather than at the moment you get up to show CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Right No I think GENERAL VERRILLI  show up to get health care And that CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS  unless Im missing something I think youre just repeating the idea that this is the regulation of the method of payment And I understand that argument And it may be  it may be a good one But what Im concerned about is once we accept the principle that everybody is in this market I dont see why Congresss power is limited to regulating the method of payment and doesnt include as it does in any other areaWhat other area have we said Congress can regulate this market but only with respect to prices but only with respect to means of travel No Once youre  once youre in the interstate commerce and can regulate it pretty much all bets are offGENERAL VERRILLI But we agree Congress can regulate this market ERISA regulates this market HIPAA regulates this market The  the market is regulated at the Federal level in very significant ways already So I dont think thats the question Mr Chief Justice The question is is there a limit to the authority that were advocating here under the commerce power and the answer is yes because we are not advocating for a power that would allow Congress to compel purchases JUSTICE ALITO Could you just  before you move on could you express your limiting principle as succinctly as you possibly can Congress can force people to purchase a product where the failure to purchase the product has a substantial effect on interstate commerce  if what If this is part of a larger regulatory scheme Was that it Was there anything moreGENERAL VERRILLI We got two and they are  they are different Let me state them First with respect to the comprehensive scheme When Congress is regulating  is enacting a comprehensive scheme that it has the authority to enact that the Necessary and Proper Clause gives it the authority to include regulation including a regulation of this kind if it is necessary to counteract risks attributable to the scheme itself that people engage in economic activity that would undercut the scheme Its like  its very much like Wickard in that respect very much like Raich in that respectWith respect to the  with respect to the  considering the Commerce Clause alone and not embedded in the comprehensive scheme our position is that Congress can regulate the method of payment by imposing an insurance requirement in advance of the time in which the  the service is consumed when the class to which that requirement applies either is or virtually is most certain to be in that market when the timing of ones entry into that market and what you will need when you enter that market is uncertain and when  when you will get the care in that market whether you can afford to pay for it or not and shift costs to other market participantsSo those  those are our views as to those are the principles we are advocating for and its in fact the conjunction of the two of them here that makes this we think a strong case under the Commerce ClauseJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR General could you turn to the tax clauseGENERAL VERRILLI YesJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR I have to look for a case that involves the issue of whether something denominated by Congress as a penalty was nevertheless treated as a tax except in those situations where the code itself or the statute itself said treat the penalty as a taxDo you know of any case where weve done thatGENERAL VERRILLI Well I think I would point the Court to the License Tax Case where it was was denominated a fee and nontax and the Court upheld it as an exercise of the taxing power in a situation in which the structure of the law was very much the structure of this law in that there was a separate standalone provision that set the predicate and then a separate provision in closing JUSTICE SCALIA But fees you know license fees fees for a hunting license everybody knows those are taxes I mean I dont think there is as much of a difference between a fee and a tax as there is between a penalty and a taxGENERAL VERRILLI And that and  and I think in terms of the tax part I think its useful to separate this into two questions One is a question of characterization Can this be characterized as a tax and second is it a constitutional exercise of the powerWith respect to the question of characterization the  this is  in the Internal Revenue Code it is administered by the IRS it is paid on your Form 1040 on April 15th I think JUSTICE GINSBURG But yesterday you told me  you listed a number of penalties that are enforced through the tax code that are not taxes and they are not penalties related to taxesGENERAL VERRILLI They may still be exercise of the tax  exercises of the taxing power Justice Ginsburg as  as this is and I think there isnt a case in which the Court has to my mind suggested anything that bears this many indicia of a tax cant be considered as an exercise of the taxing power In fact it seems to me the License Tax Cases point you in the opposite direction And beyond that your the  it seems to me the right way to think about this question is whether it is capable of being understood as an exercise of the taxJUSTICE SCALIA The President said it wasnt a tax didnt heGENERAL VERRILLI Well Justice Scalia what the  two things about that first as it seems to me what matters is what power Congress was exercising And they were  and I think its clear that  that the  the  they were exercising the tax power as well as JUSTICE SCALIA Youre making two arguments Number one its a tax and number two even if it isnt a tax its within the taxing power Im just addressing the firstGENERAL VERRILLI If the President said JUSTICE SCALIA Is it a tax or not a tax The President didnt think it wasGENERAL VERRILLI The President said it wasnt a tax increase because it ought to be understood as an incentive to get people to have insuranceI dont think its fair to infer from that anything about whether that is an exercise of the tax power or notJUSTICE GINSBURG A tax is to raise revenue tax is a revenueraising device and the purpose of this exaction is to get people into the health care risk  risk pool before they need medical care and so it will be successful If it doesnt raise any revenue if it gets people to buy the insurance thats  thats what this penalty is  this penalty is designed to affect conductThe conduct is buy health protection buy health insurance before you have a need for medical care Thats what the penalty is designed to do not to raise revenueGENERAL VERRILLI That  that is true Justice Ginsburg This is also true of the marijuana tax that was withheld in Sanchez Thats commonly true of penalties under the Code They do  if they raise revenue they are exercises of the taxing power but their purpose is not to raise revenue Their purpose is to discourage behaviorI mean the  the mortgage deduction works that way When the mortgage deduction is  its clearly an exercise of the taxing power When its successful it raises less revenue for the Federal Government Its still an exercise of the taxing power So I dont JUSTICE KAGAN I suppose though General one question is whether the determined efforts of Congress not to refer to this as a tax make a difference I mean youre suggesting we should just look to the practical operation We shouldnt look at labels And that seems right except that here we have a case in which Congress determinedly said this is not a tax and the question is why should that be irrelevantGENERAL VERRILLI I dont think that thats a fair characterization of the actions of Congress here Justice Kagan On the  December 23rd a point of constitutional order was called to in fact with respect to this law The floor sponsor Senator Baucus defended it as an exercise of the taxing power In his response to the point of order the Senate voted 60 to39 on that propositionThe legislative history is replete with members of Congress explaining that this law is constitutional as an exercise of the taxing power It was attacked as a tax by its opponents So I dont think this is a situation where you can say thatCongress was avoiding any mention of the tax powerIt would be one thing if Congress explicitly disavowed an exercise of the tax power But given that it hasnt done so it seems to me that its  not only is it fair to read this as an exercise of the tax power but this Court has got an obligation to construe it as an exercise of the tax power if it can be upheld on that basisCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Why didnt Congress call it a tax thenGENERAL VERRILLI Well CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Youre telling me they thought of it as a tax they defended it on the tax power Why didnt they say it was a taxGENERAL VERRILLI They might have thought Your Honor that calling it a penalty as they did would make it more effective in accomplishing its objective But it is  in the Internal Revenue Code it is collected by the IRS on April 15th I dont think this is a situation in which you can say CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Well thats the reason They thought it might be more effective if they called it a penaltyGENERAL VERRILLI Well I  you know I dont  there is nothing that I know of that  that illuminates that but certainly JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR General the problem goes back to the limiting principle Is this simply anything that raises revenue that Congress can doGENERAL VERRILLI No There are certain limiting principles under the JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR So there has to be a limiting principle GENERAL VERRILLI  taxing power and they  and I think of course the Constitution imposes some got to be uniform cant be taxed on exports if its a direct tax its got to be apportioned Beyond that the limiting principle as the Court has identified from Drexel Furniture to Kurth Ranch is that it cant be punishment punitive in the guise of a tax And there are three factors of Court has identified to look at thatThe first is the sanction and how disproportionate it is to the conduct the second is whether there is scienter and the third is whether there is an  an  an administrative apparatus out there to enforce the taxNow in  in Bailey v Drexel Furniture for example the tax was 10 percent of the companys profits even if they had only one child laborer for one day There was a scienter requirement and it was enforced by the Department of Labor It wasnt just collected by the Internal Revenue ServiceHere you dont have any of those things This  the  the penalty is calculated to be no more than at most the equivalent of what one would have paid for insurance if you forgone There is no scienter requirement there is no enforcement apparatus out there So certain JUSTICE ALITO Can the  can the mandate be viewed as tax if it does impose a requirement on people who are not subject to the penalty or the taxGENERAL VERRILLI I think it could for the reasons I  I discussed yesterday I dont think it can or should be read that way But if there is any doubt about that Your Honor if there is  if  if it is the view of the Court that it cant be then I think the  the right way to handle this case is by analogy to New York v United States in which the  the Court read the shall provision shall handle the level of radioactive waste as setting the predicate and then the other provisions were merely incentives to get the predicate met andJUSTICE SCALIA Youre saying that all the discussion we had earlier about how this is one big uniform scheme and the Commerce Clause blah blah blah it really doesnt matter This is a tax and the Federal Government could simply have said without all of the rest of this legislation could simply have said everybody who doesnt buy health insurance at a certain age will be taxed so much money rightGENERAL VERRILLI It  it used its powers together to solve the problem of the market not JUSTICE SCALIA Yes but you didnt need thatGENERAL VERRILLI  providing for the JUSTICE SCALIA You didnt need that If its a tax its only  raising money is enoughGENERAL VERRILLI Its justifiable under its tax powerJUSTICE SCALIA ExtraordinaryGENERAL VERRILLI If I may reserve the balance of my timeCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Thank you gentlemen Well take a pause for a minute or so Mr ClementPauseCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Why dont we get started againMr ClementORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D CLEMENTON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS FLORIDA ET ALMR CLEMENT Mr Chief Justice and may it please the Court The mandate represents an unprecedented effort by Congress to compel individuals to enter commerce in order to better regulate commerceThe Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate existing commerce It does not give Congress the far greater power to compel people to enter commerce to create commerce essentially in the first placeNow Congress when it passed the statute did make findings about why it thought it could regulate the commerce here and it justified the mandate as a regulation of the economic decision to forego the purchase of health insurance That is a theory without any limiting principleJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Do you accept your the Generals position that you have conceded that Congress could say if youre going to consume health services you have to pay by way of insuranceMR CLEMENT Thats right Justice Sotomayor We say consistent with 220 years of this Courts jurisprudence that if you regulate the point of sale you regulate commerce thats within Congress commerce powerJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR All right So what do you do with the impossibility of buying insurance at the point of consumption Virtually you force insurance companies to sell it to youMR CLEMENT Well Justice I think there is two points to make on that One is a lot of the discussion this morning so far has proceeded on the assumption that the only thing that is at issue here is emergency room visits and the only thing thats being imposed is catastrophic care coverage but as the Chief Justice indicated earlier a lot of the insurance thats being covered is for ordinary preventive care ordinary office visits and those are the kinds of things that one can predictSo there is a big part of the market thats regulated here that wouldnt pose the problem that youre suggesting but even as to emergency room visits it certainly would be possible to regulate at that point You could simply say through some sort of mandate on the insurance companies you have to provide people that come in  this will be a highrisk pool and maybe you will have to share it amongst yourself or something but people simply have to sign up at that point and that would be regulating at the point of saleJUSTICE KAGAN Well Mr Clement now it seems as though youre just talking about a matter of timing that Congress can regulate the transaction and the question is when does it make best sense to regulate that transactionAnd Congress surely has within its authority to decide rather than at the point of sale given an insurancebased mechanism it makes sense to regulate it earlier Its just a matter of timingMR CLEMENT Well Justice Kagan we dont think its a matter of timing alone and we think it has very substantive effects Because if Congress tried to regulate at the point of sale the one group that it wouldnt capture at all are the people who dont want to purchase health insurance and also have no plans of using health care services in the near term And Congress very much wanted to capture those people I mean those people are essentially the golden geese that pay for the entire lowering of the premiumJUSTICE KENNEDY Was the governments argument this  and maybe I wont state it accurately  it is true that the noninsured young adult is in fact an actuarial reality insofar as our allocation of health services insofar as the way health insurance companies figure risksThat person who is sitting at home in his or her living room doing nothing is an actuarial reality that can and must be measured for health service purposes is that their argumentMR CLEMENT Well I dont know Justice Kennedy but if it is I think there is at least two problems with itOne is as Justice Alitos question suggested earlier I mean somebody who is not in the insurance market is sort of irrelevant as an actuarial risk I mean we could look at the people not in the insurance market and what wed find is that theyre relatively young relatively healthy and they would have a certain pool of actuarial risks that would actually lead to lower premiumsThe people that would be captured by guaranteed rating and community issue  guaranteed issue and community rating would presumably have a higher risk profile and there would be higher premiumsAnd one of the things one of the things Congress sought to accomplish here was to force individuals into the insurance market to subsidize those that are already in it to lower the rates And thats just not my speculation thats Finding I at 43A of the governments brief that  it has the statute And thats one of the clear findingsJUSTICE GINSBURG Mr Clement doesnt that work  that work the way Social Security doesLet me put it this way Congress in the 30s saw a real problem of people needing to have old age and survivors insurance And yes they did it through a tax but they said everybody has got to be in it because if we dont have the healthy in it theres not going to be the money to pay for the ones who become old or disabled or widowed So they required everyone to contributeIt was a big fuss about that in the beginning because a lot of people said  maybe some people still do today  I could do much better if the government left me alone Id go into the private market Id buy an annuity Id make a great investment and theyre forcing me to paying for this Social Security that I dont want but thats constitutionalSo if Congress could see this as a problem when we need to have a group that will subsidize the ones who are going to get the benefits it seems to me you are saying the only way that could be done is if the government does it itself it cant involve the private market it cant involve the private insurers If it wants to do this Social Security is its model The government has to do  has to be government takeover We cant have the insurance industry in it Is that your positionMR CLEMENT No I dont think it is Justice Ginsburg I think there are other options that are availableThe most straightforward one would be to figure out what amount of subsidy to the insurance industry is necessary to pay for guaranteed issue and community rating And once we calculate the amount of that subsidy we could have a tax thats spread generally through everybody to raise the revenue to pay for that subsidy Thats the way we pay for most subsidiesJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Could we have an exemption Could the government say everybody pays a shared health care responsibility payment to offset all the money that we are forced to spend on health care we the government but anybody who has an insurance policy is exempt from that tax Could the government do thatMR CLEMENT The government might be able to do that I think it might raise some issues about whether or not that would be a valid exercise of the taxing powerJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Under what theory wouldnt it beMR CLEMENT Well I do think that JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR We get tax credits for having solarpowered homes We get tax credits for using fuel efficient cars Why couldnt we get a tax credit for having health insurance and saving the government from caring for usMR CLEMENT Well I think it would depend a little bit on how it was formulated but my concern would be  the constitutional concern would be that it would just be a disguised impermissible direct tax And I do think  I mean I dont want to suggest we get to the taxing power to soon but I do think its worth realizing that the taxing power is limited in the ability to impose direct taxesAnd the one thing I think the framers would have clearly identified as a direct tax is a tax on not having somethingI mean the framing generation was divided over whether a tax on carriages was a direct tax or not Hamilton thought that was a indirect tax Madison thought it was a direct tax I have little doubt that both of them would have agreed that a tax on not having a carriage would have clearly been a direct tax I also think they would have thought it clearly wasnt a valid regulation of the market in carriagesAnd you know I mean if you look at Hilton against the United States thats this Courts first direct tax JUSTICE BREYER Let me ask  can I go back for a step because I dont want to get into a discussion of whether this is a good bill or not Some people think its going to save a lot of money Some people think it wontSo Im focusing just on the Commerce Clause not on the Due Process Clause the Commerce Clause And I look back into history and I think if we look back into history we see sometimes Congress can create commerce out of nothing Thats the national bank which was created out of nothing to create other commerce out of nothingI look back into history and I see it seems pretty clear that if there are substantial effects on interstate commerce Congress can actAnd I look at the person whos growing marijuana in her house or I look at the farmer who is growing the wheat for home consumption This seems to have more substantial effectsIs this commerce Well it seems to me more commerce than marijuana I mean is it in fact a regulation Well why not If creating a bank is why isnt thisAnd then you say ah but one thing here out of all those things is different and that is youre making somebody do somethingI say hey cant Congress make people drive faster than 45  40 miles an hour on a road Didnt they make that man growing his own wheat go into the market and buy other wheat for his  for his cows Didnt they make Mrs  if she married somebody who had marijuana in her basement wouldnt she have to go and get rid of it Affirmative actionI mean where does this distinction come from It sounds like sometimes you can and sometimes you cantSo what is argued here is there is a large group of  what about a person that we discover that there are  a disease is sweeping the United States and 40 million people are susceptible of whom 10 million will die cant the Federal Government say all 40 million get inoculationSo here we have a group of 40 million and 57 percent of those people visit emergency care or other care which we are paying for And 22 percent of those pay more than 100000 for that And Congress says they are in the midst of this big thing We just want to rationalize this system they are already inSo there you got the whole argument and I would like you to tell me JUSTICE SCALIA Well get to those questions in inverse orderJUSTICE BREYER Well no its one question Its looking back at that  looking back at that historyThe thing I can see that you say to some people go buy why does that make a difference in terms of the Commerce ClauseMR CLEMENT Well Justice Breyer let me start at the beginning of your question with McCulloch McCulloch was not a commerce power caseJUSTICE BREYER It was bothMR CLEMENT No the bank was not justified and the corporation was not justified as an exercise of commerce power So that is not a case that says that its okay to conjure up the bank as an exercise of the commerce powerWhat of course the Court didnt say and I think the Court would have had a very different reaction to is you know we are not just going to have the bank because that wouldnt be necessary and proper we are going to force the citizenry to put all of their money in the bank because if we do that then we know the Bank of the United States will be secureI think the framers would have identified the difference between those two scenarios and I dont think that the great Chief Justice would have said that forcing people to put their deposits in the Bank of the United States was necessary and properNow if you look through all the cases you mentioned I do not think you will find a case like this And I think its telling that you wont I mean the regulation of the wheat market in Wickard against Filburn all this effort to address the supply side and what producers could do what Congress was trying to do was support the price of wheat It would have been much more efficient to just make everybody in America buy 10 loaves of bread That would have had a much more direct effect on the price of wheat in the prevailing marketBut we didnt do that We didnt say when we had problems in the automobile industry that we are not just going to give you incentives not just cash for clunkers we are going to actually have ever everybody over 100000 has to buy a new car CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Well Mr Clement the key to the governments argument to the contrary is that everybody is in this market Its all right to regulate Wickard  again in Wickard against Filburn because thats a particular market in which the farmer had been participatingEverybody is in this market so that makes it very different than the market for cars or the other hypotheticals that you came up with and all theyre regulating is how you pay for itMR CLEMENT Well with respect Mr Chief Justice I suppose the first thing you have to say is what market are we talking about Because the government  this statute undeniably operates in the health insurance market And the government cant say that everybody is in that market The whole problem is that everybody is not in that market and they want to make everybody get into that marketJUSTICE KAGAN Well doesnt that seem a little bit Mr Clement cutting the bologna thin mean health insurance exists only for the purpose of financing health care The two are inextricably interlinked We dont get insurance so that we can stare at our insurance certificate We get it so that we can go and access health careMR CLEMENT Well Justice Kagan Im not sure thats right I think what health insurance does and what all insurance does is it allows you to diversify risk And so its not just a matter of Im paying now instead Im paying later Thats credit Insurance is different than credit Insurance guarantees you an upfront lockedin payment and you wont have to pay any more than that even if you incur much great expensesAnd in every other market that I know of for insurance we let people basically make the decision whether they are relatively risk averse whether they are relatively nonrisk averse and they can make the judgment based on JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR But we dont in car insurance meaning we tell people buy car  not we the states do although youre going to  Ill ask you the question do you think that if some states decided not to impose an insurance requirement that the Federal Government would be without power to legislate and require every individual to buy car insuranceMR CLEMENT Well Justice Sotomayor let me say this which is to say  youre right in the first point to say that its the states that do it which makes it different right there But its also JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Well that goes back to the substantive due process question Is this a Lochner era argument that only the states can do this even though it affects commerce Cars indisputably affect commerce So are you arguing that because the states have done it all along the Federal Government is no longer permitted to legislate in this areaMR CLEMENT No I think you might make a different argument about cars than you would make about health insurance unless you tried to say  but you know were JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Health insurance  I mean Ive never gotten into an accident thankfully and I hope never The vast majority of people have never gotten into an accident where they have injured others yet we pay for it dutifully every year on the possibility that at some point we might get into that accidentMR CLEMENT But Justice Sotomayor what I think is different is there is lots of people in Manhattan for example that dont have car insurance because they dont have cars And so they have the option of withdrawing from that market Its not a direct imposition from the governmentSo even the car market is difference from this market where there is no way to get outside of the regulatory web And thats I think one of the real problems with this because I mean we take as a given JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR But youre  but the given is that virtually everyone absent some intervention from above meaning that someones life will be cut short in a fatal way virtually everyone will use health careMR CLEMENT At some point thats right but all sorts of people will not say use health care in the next year which is the relevant period for the insuranceJUSTICE BREYER But do you think you can better than the actuaries or better than the members of Congress who worked on it look at the 40 million people who are not insured and say which ones next year will or will not use say emergency careCan you do that any better than if we knew that 40 million people were suffering about to suffer a contagious disease and only 10 million would get sick MR CLEMENT Of course not JUSTICE BREYER  and we dont know whichMR CLEMENT Of course not Justice Breyer but the point is that once Congress decides its going to regulate extant commerce it is going to get all sorts of latitude to make the right judgments about actuarial predictions which actuarial to rely on which one not to rely onThe question thats a proper question for this Court though is whether or not for the first time ever in our history Congress also has the power to compel people into commerce because it turns out that would be a very efficient things for purposes of Congress optimal regulation of that marketJUSTICE KAGAN But Mr Clement this goes back to the Chief Justices question But of course the theory behind not just the governments case but the theory behind this law is that people are in this market right now and they are in this market because people do get sick and because when people get sick we provide them with care without making them payAnd it that would be different you know if you were up here saying I represent a class of Christian scientists Then you might be able to say look you know why are they bothering me But absent that youre in this market Youre an economic actorMR CLEMENT Well Justice Kagan once again it depends on which market were talking about If were talking about the health care insurance market JUSTICE KAGAN Well we are talking about the health insurance market which is designed to access the health care marketMR CLEMENT And with respect to the health insurance market thats designed to have payment in the health care market everybody is not in the market And thats the premise of the statute and thats the problem Congress is trying to solveAnd if it tried to solve it through incentives we wouldnt be here but its trying to solve it in a way that nobody has ever tried to solve an economic problem before which is saying you know it would be so much more efficient if you were just in this market JUSTICE KENNEDY But they are in the market in the sense that they are creating a risk that the market must account forMR CLEMENT Well Justice Kennedy I dont think thats right certainly in any way that distinguishes this from any other context When Im sitting in my house deciding Im not to buy a car I am causing the labor market in Detroit to go south I am causing maybe somebody to lose their job and for everybody to have to pay for it under welfare So the cost shifting that the government tries to uniquely to associate with this market it is everywhereAnd even more to the point the rationale that they think ultimately supports this legislation that look its an economic decision once you make the economic decision we aggregate the decision there is a substantial effect on commerce That argument works here It works in every single industryJUSTICE BREYER Of course we do know that there are a few people more in New York City than there are in Wyoming who never will buy a car But we also know here and we dont like to admit it that because we are human beings we all suffer from the risk of getting sick And we also all know that well get seriously sick And we also know that we cant predict when And we also know that when we do there will be our fellow taxpayers through the Federal Government who will pay for this If we do not buy insurance we will pay nothing And that happens with a large number of people in this group of 40 million none of whom can be picked out in advanceNow thats quite different from a car situation and its different in only this respect It shows there is a national problem and it shows there is a national problem that involves money cost insuranceSo if Congress could do this should there be a disease that strikes the United States and they want every one inoculated even though ten million will be hurt its hard for me to decide why that isnt interstate commerce even more so where we know it affects everybodyMR CLEMENT Well Justice Breyer there are other markets that affect every one transportation food burial services though we dont like to talk about that either There also are situations where there are many economic effects from somebodys failure to purchase a productAnd if I could if I could talk about the difference between the health insurance market and the health care market I mean ultimately I dont want you to leave here with the impression that anything turns on that Because if the government decided tomorrow that they would come up with a great  some of these  some private companies come up with a great new wonder drug that would be great for everybody to take would have huge health benefits for everybody and by the way also if everybody had to buy it it would facilitate economies of scale and the production would be great and the price would be cheaper and force everybody in the health care market the actual health care market to buy the wonder drug Id be up here making the same argument I would be saying thats not a power thats within the commerce power of the Federal Government It is something much greater And it would have been much more controversial Thats why the important things In Federalist 45 Madison says the commerce power Thats a new power but its not one anyone has any apprehension aboutThe reason they didnt have any apprehension about it is because its a power that only operated once people were already in commerce You see that from the text of the clause The first kind of commerce Congress gets to regulate is commerce with foreign nations Did anybody think the fledgling Republic had the power to compel some other nation into commerce with us Of course not And in the same way I think if the framers had understood the commerce power to include the power to compel people to engage in commerce JUSTICE KAGAN Well once again though whos in commerce and what are they in commerceIf the effect of all these uninsured people is to raise everybodys premiums not just when they get sick if they get sick but right now in the aggregate and Wickard and Raich tell us we should look at the aggregate and the aggregate of all these uninsured people are increasing the normal family premium Congress says by a thousand dollars a year Those people are in commerce They are making decisions that are affecting the price that everybody pays for this serviceMR CLEMENT Justice Kagan again with all due respect I dont think thats a limiting principle My unwillingness to buy an electric car is forcing up the price of an electric car If only more people demanded an electric car there would be economies of scale and the price would go downJUSTICE KAGAN Not necessarily Mr Clement And its different because of the nature of the health care service that you are entitled to health care when you go to an emergency room when you go to a doctor even if you cant pay for it So the difference between your hypotheticals and the real case is the problem of uncompensated care which MR CLEMENT Justice Kagan first of all I do think there  this is not the only place where theres uncompensated care If some  if I dont buy a car and somebody goes on welfare Im going to end up paying for that as wellBut let me also say that there is a real disconnect then between that focus on what makes this different and statute that Congresses passed If all we were concerned about is the cost sharing that took place because of uncompensated care in emergency rooms presumably we have before us a statute that only addressed emergency care and catastrophic insurance coverage But it covers everything soup to nuts and all sorts of other thingsAnd that gets at the idea that there is two kinds of cost shifting that are going on here One is the concern about emergency care and that somehow somebody who gets sick is going to shift costs back to other policy areas  holders But there is a much bigger cost shifting going on here and thats the cost shifting that goes on when you force healthy people into an insurance market precisely because they are healthy precisely because they are not likely to go to the emergency room precisely because they are not likely to use the insurance they are forced to buy in the health care insurance That creates a huge windfall It lowers the price of premiumsAnd again this is not just some lawyer up here telling you thats what it does and trying to secondguess the congressional economic decisions This is Congresss findings findings I on page 43 A of the appendix to the governments JUSTICE BREYER All that sounds like youre debating the merits of the bill You ask really for limiting principles so we dont get into a matter that I think has nothing to do with this case broccoli okayAnd the limiting principles youve heard three First the Solicitor General came up with a couple joined very narrow ones Youve seen in Lopez this Court say that we cannot Congress cannot get into purely local affairs particularly where they are noncommercial And of course the greatest limiting principle of all which not too many accept so Im not going to emphasize that is the limiting principle derived from the fact that members of Congress are elected from States and that 95 percent of the law of the United States is State law That is a principle though enforced by the legislatureThe other two are principles one written into Lopez and one you just heard It seems to me all of those eliminate the broccoli possibility and none of them eliminates the possibility that we are trying to take the 40 million people who do have the medical cost who do affect interstate commerce and provide a system that you may like or not likeThats where we are in limiting principlesMR CLEMENT Well Justice Breyer let me take them in turn I would encourage this Court not to Garciaize the Commerce Clause and just simply say its up to Congress to police the Commerce Clause So I dont think that is a limiting principleSecond of all JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Yes but thats exactly what Justice Marshall said in Gibbons He said that it is the power to regulate the power like all others vested in Congress is complete in itself may be exercised to its utmost extent and acknowledges no limitations other than those prescribed in the Constitution But there is no conscription in the set forth in the Constitution with respect to regulating commerceMR CLEMENT I agree 100 percent and I think that was the Chief Justices point which was once you open the door to compelling people into commerce based on the narrow rationales that exist in this industry you are not going to be able to stop that processJUSTICE SCALIA I would like hear you address Justice Breyers other other two principlesMR CLEMENT Well the other two principles are Lopez  and this case really is not  I mean you know Lopez is a limit on the affirmative exercise of people who are already in commerce The question is is there any other limit to people who arent in commerce And so I think this is the case that really asks that questionAnd then the first point which was I take it to be the Solicitor Generals point is with all due respect simply a description of the insurance market Its not a limiting principle because the justification for why this is a valid regulation of commerce is in no way limited to this market It simply says these are economic decisions they have effect on other people my failure to purchase in this market has a direct effect on others who are already in the market Thats true of virtually every other market under the sunCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS And now maybe return to Justice Sotomayors questionMR CLEMENT Id be delighted to which is  I mean I  you are absolutely right Once youre in the commerce power there is not  this Court is not going to police that subject maybe to the Lopez limit And thats exactly why I think its very important for this Court to think seriously about taking an unprecedented step of saying that the commerce power not only includes the power to regulate prescribe the rule by which commerce is governed the rule of Gibbons v Ogden But to go further and say its not just prescribing the rule for commerce that exists but is the power to compel people to enter into commerce in the first placeI would like to say two very brief things about the taxing power if I could There are lots of reasons why this isnt a tax It wasnt denominated a tax Its not structured as a tax If its any tax at all though it is a direct tax Article I Section 9 clause 4 the Framers would have had no doubt that a tax on not having something is not an excise tax but a forbidden direct tax Thats one more reason why this is not proper legislation because it violates thatThe second thing is I would urge you to read the License Tax case which the Solicitor General says is his best case for why you ignore the fact that a tax is denominated into something other Because that is a case where the argument was that because the Federal government had passed a license not a tax that somehow that allowed people to take actions that would have been unlawful under State law that this was some special Federal license to do something that was forbidden by State law This Court looked beyond the label in order to preserve federalism there What the Solicitor General and the government ask you to do here is exactly the opposite which is to look past labels in order to upend our basic federalist system In this JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Would you tell me do you think the States could pass this mandateMR CLEMENT I represent 26 States I do think the States could pass this mandate but I JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Is there any other area of commerce business where we have held that there is a concurrent power between the State and the Federal Government to protect the welfare of commerceMR CLEMENT Well Justice Sotomayor I have to resist your premise because I didnt answer yes the States can do it because it would be a valid regulation of intrastate commerce I said yes the States can do it because they have a police power and that is the fundamental difference between the States on the one hand and the limited enumerated Federal Government on the otherCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Thank you Mr Clement Mr CarvinORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A CARVIN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS NFIB ET AL MR CARVIN Thank you Mr Chief Justice may it please the CourtId like to begin with the Solicitor Generals main premise which is that they can compel the purchase of health insurance in order to promote commerce in the health market because it will reduce uncompensated care If you accept that argument you have to fundamentally alter the text of the Constitution and give Congress plenary powerIt simply doesnt matter whether or not this regulation will promote health care commerce by reducing uncompensated care all that matters is whether the activity actually being regulated by the act negatively affects Congress or negatively affects commerce regulation so that its within the commerce power If you agree with us that this is  exceeds commerce power the law doesnt somehow become redeemed because it has beneficial policy effects in the health care marketIn other words Congress does not have the power to promote commerce Congress has  Congress has the power to regulate commerce And if the power exceeds their permissible regulatory authority then the law is invalidCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Well surely MR CARVIN Im sorryCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Well surely regulation includes the power to promote Since the New Deal weve said that regulation in  there is a market agricultural products Congress has the power to subsidize to limit production all sorts of thingsMR CARVIN Absolutely Chief Justice and thats the distinction Im trying to draw When they are acting within their enumerated power then obviously they are promoting commerce but the Solicitor General wants to turn it into a different power He wants to say we have the power to promote commerce to regulate anything to promote commerce and if they have the power to promote commerce then they have the power to regulate everything right Because CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS I dont  I dont think youre addressing their main point which is that they are not creating commerce in  in health care Its already there and we are all going to need some kind of health care most of us will at some pointMR CARVIN Id  Id like to address that in two ways if I could Mr Chief Justice In the first place they keep playing mix and match with the statistics They say 95 percent of us are in the health care market okay But thats not the relevant statistic even from  as the government frames the issue No one in Congress and the Solicitor General is arguing that going to the doctor and fully paying him creates a problem The problem is uncompensated care and they say the uncompensated care arises if you have some kind of catastrophe  hit by a bus have some prolonged illness Well what is the percentage of the uninsured that have those sorts of catastrophes We know it has got to be a relative small fraction So in other words the relevant CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Yet we dont know who they areMR CARVIN We dont No and we dont know in advance and  and but that doesnt change the basic principle that you are nonetheless forcing people for paternalistic reasons to go into the insurance market to ensure against risk that they have made the voluntary decision that they are not  have decided not to But even JUSTICE GINSBURG But the problem is  the problem is this they are making the reinvent of us pay for it because as much as they say well we are not in the market we dont know when the  the timing when they will beMR CARVIN Which is JUSTICE GINSBURG And the  the figures that how much more families are paying for insurance because people get sick they may have intended to selfinsure they havent been able to meet the bill for  for cancer and the rest of us end up paying because these people are getting costfree health care and the only way to prevent that is to have them pay sooner rather than later pay up frontMR CARVIN Yes but my point is this That with respect Justice Ginsburg conflicts the people who do result in uncompensated care the free riders Those are people who default on their health care payments That is an entirely different group of people an entirely different activity than being uninsuredSo the question is whether or not you can regulate activity because it has a statistical connection to an activity that harms Congress And my basic point to you is this the Constitution only gives Congress the power to regulate things that negatively affect commerce or commerce regulation It doesnt give them the power to regulate things that are statistically connected to things that negatively affect the commerce JUSTICE KAGAN Well Mr Carvin MR CARVIN Because  Im sorryJUSTICE KAGAN PleaseMR CARVIN I was just going to say because if they have that power then they obviously have the power to regulate everything because everything in the aggregate is statistically connected to something that negatively affects commerce and every compelled purchase promotes commerceJUSTICE BREYER In your view right there  in your view right there MR CARVIN Justice Breyer JUSTICE BREYER Can I just MR CARVIN Im sorryJUSTICE BREYER Im just picking on something Id like to just  if it turned out there was some terrible epidemic sweeping the United States and we couldnt say that more than 40 or 50 percent  I can make the number as high as I want  but the  the  youd say the Federal Government doesnt have the power to get people inoculated to require them to be inoculated because thats just statisticalMR CARVIN Well in all candor I think Morrison must have decided that issue right Because people who commit violence against JUSTICE BREYER Is your answer to that yes or noMR CARVIN Oh Im sorry my answer is no they couldnt do it because Morrison JUSTICE BREYER No they could not do itMR CARVIN YesJUSTICE BREYER They cannot require people even if this disease is sweeping the country to be inoculated The Federal Government has no power and if theres  okay fine Go aheadMR CARVIN May JUSTICE BREYER Please turn to Justice KaganMR CARVIN May I just please explain whyJUSTICE BREYER YesMR CARVIN Violence against women obviously creates the same negative impression on fellow citizens as this communicable disease but the and it has huge effects on the health care of our country Congress found that it increased health care costs by JUSTICE BREYER I agree with you that MR CARVIN Well but JUSTICE BREYER  that it had huge negative effects but the majority thought that was a local matterJUSTICE SCALIA I think thats his point LaughterMR CARVIN I  I dont know why having a disease is any more local than  that beating up a woman But  but  my basic point is is that notwithstanding its very profound effect on the health care market this Court said the activity being regulated ie violence against women is outside the Commerce Clause power So regardless of whether it has beneficial downstream effects we must say no Congress doesnt have that power Why not Because everything has downstream effects on commerce and every compelled purchase promotes commerce It by definition helps the sellers of existing JUSTICE ALITO Mr Carvin isnt there this difference between Justice Breyers hypothetical and the law that we have before us here In his hypothetical harm to other people from the communicable disease is the result of the disease It is not the result of something that the government has done whereas here the reason why there is cost shifting is because the government has mandated that It has required hospitals to provide emergency treatment and instead of paying for that through a tax which would be born by everybody it has required  it has set up a system in which the cost is surreptitiously shifted to people who have health insurance and who pay their bills when they go to the hospitalMR CLEMENT Justice Alito that is exactly the governments argument Its an extraordinarily illogical argumentJUSTICE BREYER Fine Then if thats so is  let me just change my example under pressure LaughterJUSTICE BREYER  and say that in fact it turns out that 90 percent of all automobiles driving interstate without certain equipment put up pollution which travels interstate  not 100 percent maybe only 60 percent Does the EPA have the power then to say youve got to have an antipollution device Its statisticalMR CARVIN What they cant do  yes if you have a car they can require you to have an antipollution JUSTICE BREYER Then youre not going on statistics youre going on something else which is what Id like to know what it isMR CARVIN Its this They cant require you to buy a car with an antipollution device Once youve entered the market and made a decision they can regulate the terms and conditions of the car that you do and they can do it for all sorts of reasons What they cant do it compel you to enter the marketJUSTICE BREYER Now we  now youve changed the ground of argument which I accept as  as totally legitimate And then the question is when you are born and you dont have insurance and you will in fact get sick and you will in fact impose costs have you perhaps involuntarily  perhaps simply because you are a human being  entered this particular market which is a market for health careMR CARVIN If being born is entering the market then I cant think of a more plenary power Congress can have because that literally means they can regulate every human activity from cradle to grave thought thats what distinguished the plenary police power from the very limited commerce powerI dont disagree that giving the Congress plenary power to mandate property transfers from A to B would be a very efficient way of helping B and of accomplishing Congresss objectives But the framers JUSTICE BREYER I see the point You can go back to go back to Justice Kagan Dont forget her questionJUSTICE KAGAN Ive forgotten my questionLaughterMR CARVIN I  I was facing the same dilemma Justice KaganJUSTICE GINSBURG Let me  let me ask a question I asked Mr Clement It just seems JUSTICE KAGAN See what it means to be the junior justiceLaughterJUSTICE GINSBURG It just seems very strange to me that theres no question we can have a Social Security system besides all the people who say Im being forced to pay for something I dont want And this it seems to me to try to get care for the ones who need it by having everyone in the pool but is also trying to preserve a role for the private sector for the private insurers Theres something very odd about that that the government can take over the whole thing and we all say oh yes thats fine but if the government wants to get  to preserve private insurers it cant do thatMR CARVIN Well I dont think the test of a laws constitutionality is whether it more adheres to the libertarian principles of the Cato Institute or the statist principles of someone else I think the test of a laws constitutionality is not those policy questions its whether or not the law is regulating things that negatively affect commerce or dontAnd since obviously the failure to purchase an item doesnt create the kind of effects on supply and demand that the market participants in Wickard and Raich did and doesnt in any way interfere with regulation of the insurance companies I dont think it can pass the basic JUSTICE GINSBURG I thought  I thought that Wickard was you must buy we are not going to let you use the homegrown wheat You have got to go out in the market and buy that wheat that you dont wantMR CARVIN Oh but lets be careful about what they were regulating in Wickard Justice Ginsburg What they were regulating was the supply of wheat It didnt in any way imply that they could require every American to go out and buy wheat And yes one of the consequences of regulating local market participants is itll affect the supply and the demand for the product Thats why you can regulate them because those local market participants have the same effect on the interstate market that a black market has on a legal marketBut none of that is true  in other words you can regulate local bootleggers but that doesnt suggest you can regulate teetotalers people who stay out of the liquor market because they dont have any negative effect on the existing market participants or on regulation of those market participantsJUSTICE KAGAN Thats why I suggested Mr Carvin that it might be different if you were raising an asapplied challenge and presenting a class of people whom you could say clearly would not be in the health care market But youre raising a facial challenge and we cant really know which which of the many many people that this law addresses in fact will not participate in the health care market and in fact will not impose costs on all the rest of usSo the question is can Congress respond to those facts that we have no crystal ball that we cant tell who is and isnt going to be in the health insurance market and say most of these people will be and most of these people will thereby impose costs on the rest of us and thats a problem that we can deal with on a classwide basisMR CARVIN No again The people who impose the costs on the rest of us are people who engage in a different activity at a different time which is defaulting on their health care payments Its not the uninsured Under your theory you could regulate anybody if they have got a statistical connection to a problem You could say since we could regulate people who enter into the mortgage market and impose mortgage insurance on them we can simply impose the requirement to buy private mortgage insurance on everybody before they have entered the market because we are doing it in this prophylactic way before it developsCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS No no thats not  I dont think thats fair because not everybody is going to enter the mortgage market The governments position is that almost everybody is going to enter the health care marketMR CARVIN Two points one of which Mr Clements already made which is the health insurance market is different than the health care market But let me take it on fullstride I think everybody is in the milk market I think everybody is in the wheat product market But that doesnt suggest that the government compel you to buy five gallons of meat or five bushels of wheat because they are not regulating commerceWhether youre a market participant or not they are still requiring you to make a purchase that you dont want to do and to get back to your facial example JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR I mean but thats true of almost every productMR CARVIN Ive sorryJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Its true of almost every product directly or indirectly by government regulation The government says borrowing my colleagues example you cant buy a car without emission control I dont want a car with emission control Its less efficient in terms of the horsepower But Im forced to do something I dont want to do by government regulationMR CARVIN You are not forced to buy a product you dont want And I agree with you that since the government regulates all markets there is no limiting principle on their compelled purchase When they put these environmental controls on the JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR They force me to buy MR CARVIN Im sorryJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR They forced me to buy if I need unpasteurized foods goods that dont have certain pesticides but have others There is government compulsion in almost every economic decision because the government regulates so much Its a condition of life that some may rail against but MR CARVIN Lets think about it this way Yes when youve entered the marketplace they can impose all sorts of restrictions on you and they can impose for example all kinds of restrictions on States after they have enacted laws They can wipe out the laws They can condition themBut what cant they do They cant compel States to enact laws They cant compel States to carry out Federal law And I am arguing for precisely the same distinction because everyone intuitively understands that regulating participants after A and B have entered into a contract is fundamentally less intrusive than requiring the contractJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR We let the government regulate the manufacturing process whether or not the goods will enter into interstate commerce merely because they might statistically We  there is all sorts of government regulation of manufacturing plants of agricultural farms of all sorts of activity that will be purely intrastate because it might affect interstate activityMR CARVIN I fully agree with you Justice Sotomayor But I think JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR So how is that different from saying you are selfinsuring today youre foregoing insurance Why isnt that a predecessor to the need that youre eventually going to haveMR CARVIN The cases you referred to I think effectively eliminated the distinction between participants in the intrastate market visvis participants in the interstate market None of those cases suggest that you can regulate people who are outside of the market on both an intrastate and interstate level by compelling them to enter into the market And that JUSTICE BREYER What about  the simplest counterexample for me to suggest is youve undoubtedly read Judge Suttons concurring opinion He has about two pages it seemed to me of examples where everyone accepts the facts that under these kinds of regulations the government can compel people to buy things they dont otherwise want to buyFor example he gives even in that farm case the farmer who was being forced to go out and buy grain to feed to his animals because he couldnt raise it at home You know and he goes through one example after another So what  what is your response to that which youve readMR CARVIN Judge Sutton is wrong in each and every example There was no  there was no compulsion in Raich for him to buy wheat He could have gotten wheat substitutes or he could have not sold wheat which is actually what he was doing There is a huge difference between conditioning regulation ie conditioning access to the health care market and saying you must buy a product and forcing you to buy a product And that that  Im sorryJUSTICE GINSBURG I thought it was common ground that the requirement that the insurers  what was it the communitybased one and they have to insure you despite your health status they cant refuse because of preexisting conditions The government tells us and the Congress determined that those two wont work unless you have a pool that will include the people who are now healthy But so  well first do you agree with your colleague that the communitybased  and whats the name that they give to the otherMR CARVIN The guaranteedissueJUSTICE GINSBURG Yes That that is legitimate Commerce Clause legislationMR CARVIN Oh sure And thats why but we dont in any way impede that sort of regulation These nondiscrimination regulations will apply to every insurance company just as Congress intended whether or not we buy insuranceJUSTICE GINSBURG Well then what about the determination that they cant possibly work if people dont have to buy insurance until they are  their health status is such that the insurance company just dealt with them on its  as it will I wont insure you because youre  youre already sickMR CARVIN It depends what you mean by work Itll work just fine in ensuring that no sick people are discriminated against What  what  but when you do that  Congress JUSTICE GINSBURG But the sick people why would they insure early if they had to be protected if they get insurance lateMR CARVIN Yes Well thats  this is the governments very illogical argument They seem to be saying look we couldnt just force people to buy insurance to lower health insurance premiums That would be no good But we can do it because weve created the problem We Congress have driven up the health insurance premiums and since weve created that problem this somehow gives us authority that we wouldnt otherwise have That cant possibly be right That would JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Do you think that theres  what percentage of the American people who took their son or daughter to an emergency room and that child was turned away because the parent didnt have insurance  do you think theres a large percentage of the American population who would stand for the death of that child MR CARVIN One of the most JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR They had an allergic reaction and a simple shot would have saved the childMR CARVIN One of the more pernicious misleading impressions that the government has made is that we are somehow advocating that people be  could get thrown out of emergency rooms or that this alternative that theyve hypothesized is going to be enforced by throwing people out of emergency rooms This alternative ie conditioned access to health care on buying health insurance is enforced in precisely the same way that the Act does You either buy health insurance or you pay a penalty of 695 You dont have doctors throwing people out on the street And  and so the only JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Im sorry did you say the penaltys okay but not the mandate Im sorry Maybe Ive misheard youMR CARVIN No No I was  they create this strawman that says look the only alternative to doing it the way weve done it if we condition access to health care on buying health insurance the only way you can enforce that is making sick people not get careIm saying no no Theres a perfectly legitimate way they could enforce their alternative ie requiring you to buy health insurance when you access health care which is the same penalty structure thats in the ActThere is no moral dilemma between having people have insurance and denying them emergency service Congress has made a perfectly legitimate value judgment that they want to make sure that people get emergency care Since the founding whenever Congress has imposed that public responsibility on private actors it has subsidized it from the Federal Treasury It has not conscripted a subset of the citizenry and made them subsidize the actors who are being hurt which is what theyre doing hereTheyre making young healthy people subsidize insurance premiums for the cost that the nondiscrimination provisions have put on insurance premiums and insurance companiesJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR So the MR CARVIN  and that  that is the fundamental problem hereJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR So the  I  I want to understand the choices youre saying Congress has Congress can tax everybody and set up a public health care systemMR CARVIN YesJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR That would be okayMR CARVIN Yes Tax power is JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR OkayMR CARVIN I would accept thatJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Congress can  youre taking the same position as your colleague Congress cant say were going to set up a public health system but you can get a tax credit if you have private health insurance because you wont access the public systemAre you taking the same position as your colleagueMR CARVIN There may have been some confusion in prior colloquy I fully agree with my brother Clement that a direct tax would be unconstitutional I dont think he means to suggest nor do I that a tax credit that incentivizes you to buy insurance creates problems Congress incentivizes all kinds of activities If they gave us a tax credit for buying insurance then it would be our choice whether or not that makes economic sense even though JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR So how is this different than this Act which says if a taxpayer fails to meet the requirement of having minimum coverage then they are responsible for paying the shared responsibility paymentMR CARVIN The difference is that the taxpayer is not given a choice Its the difference between banning cigarettes and saying Im going to enforce that legal ban through a 5 a pack penalty and saying look if you want to sell cigarettes fine Im going to charge you a tax of 5 a pack And thats JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR I think  I think thats whats happening isnt itMR CARVIN No Not JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR Were paying  I thought that everybody was paying what is it 10 a pack now I dont even know the price Its pretty highMR CARVIN Right And everyone understands JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR I think everybody recognizes that its all taxation for the purposes of dissuading you to buy itMR CARVIN Thats precisely my point And everyone intuitively understands that that system is dramatically different than saying cigarettes tomorrow are illegal It is differentJUSTICE BREYER It is different It is different I agree with that But you pointed out and I agree with you on this that the government set up these emergency room laws The government set up Medicaid The government set up Medicare The government set up CHIP and there are 40 million people who dont have the private insurance In that world the government has set up commerce Its all over the United States And in that world of course the decision by the 40 million not to buy the insurance affects that commerce and substantially soSo I thought the issue here is not whether its a violation of some basic right or something to make people buy things they dont want but simply whether those decisions of that group of 40 million people substantially affect the interstate commerce that has been set up in part through these other programsSo thats the part of your argument Im not hearingMR CARVIN Let me JUSTICE BREYER PleaseMR CARVIN It is clear that the failure to buy health insurance doesnt affect anyone Defaulting on your payments to your health care provider does Congress chose for whatever reason not to regulate the harmful activity of defaulting on your health care provider They used the 20 percent or whoever among the uninsured as a leverage to regulate the 100 percent of the uninsuredJUSTICE KENNEDY I agree  I agree that thats whats happening hereMR CARVIN OkayJUSTICE KENNEDY And the government tells us thats because the insurance market is unique And in the next case itll say the next market is unique But I think it is true that if most questions in life are matters of degree in the insurance and health care world both markets  stipulate two markets  the young person who is uninsured is uniquely proximately very close to affecting the rates of insurance and the costs of providing medical care in a way that is not true in other industriesThats my concern in the caseMR CARVIN And Your  I may be misunderstanding you Justice Kennedy I hope Im notSure It would be perfectly fine if they allowed  you do actuarial risk for young people on the basis of their risk for disease just like you judge flood insurance on the homeowners risk of flood One of the issues here is not only that theyre compelling us to enter into the marketplace theyre not  theyre prohibiting us from buying the only economically sensible product that we would want Catastrophic insuranceEveryone agrees the only potential problem that a 30yearold as he goes from the healthy 70 percent of the population to the unhealthy 5 percent And yet Congress prohibits anyone over 30 from buying any kind of catastrophic health insurance And the reason they do that is because they needed this massive subsidyJustice Alito its not our numbers CBO said that injecting my clients into the risk pool lowers premiums by 15 to 20 percent So Justice Kennedy even if we were going to create exceptions for people that are outside of commerce and inside of commerce surely wed make Congress do a closer nexus and say look were really addressing this problem We want these 30yearolds to get catastrophic health insuranceAnd not only did they  they deprived them of that option And I think that illustrates the dangers of giving Congress these plenary powers because they can always leverage them They can always come up with some public policy rationale that converts the power to regulate commerce into the power to promote commerce which as I was saying before is the one that I think is plenaryJUSTICE KAGAN Mr Carvin a large part of this argument has concerned the question of whether certain kinds of people are active participants in a market or not active participants in a market In your test which is a test that focuses on this activityinactivity distinction would force one to confront that problem all the timeNow if you look over the history of the Commerce Clause what you see is that there were sort of unhappy periods when the Court used tests like this direct versus indirect commerce versus manufacturing I think most people would say that those things didnt really work And the question is why should this test inactive versus active work any betterMR CARVIN The problem you identify is exactly the problem you would create if you bought the governments bogus limiting principles Youd have to draw distinctions between the insurance industry and the car industry and all of thatWe turn you to the Commerce Clause jurisprudence that bedeviled the Court before the 1930s where they were drawing all these kinds of distinctions among industries whereas our test is really very simple Are you buying the product or is Congress compelling you to buy the product I cant think of a brighter lineAnd again if Congress has the power to compel you to buy this product then obviously they have got the power to provide you  to compel you to buy any product because any purchase is going to benefit commerce and this Court is never going to secondguess Congresss policy judgments on how important it is this product versus that productJUSTICE ALITO Do you think they are drawing a line between commerce and everything else that is not commerce is drawing an artificial line drawing a line between Congress and manufacturingMR CARVIN The words inactivity and activity are not in the Constitution The words commerce and noncommerce are And again its a distinction that comes Justice Kagan directly from the text of the ConstitutionThe Framers consciously gave Congress the ability to regulate commerce because thats not a particularly threatening activity that deprives you of individual freedom If you were required if you were authorized to require A to transfer property to B you have as the early cases put it a monster in legislation which is against all reason in justice because everyone intuitively understands that regulating people who voluntarily enter into contracts in setting changing conditions does not create the possibility of Congress compelling wealth transfers among the citizenry And that is precisely why the Framers denied them the power to compel commerce and precisely why they didnt give them plenary powerCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Thank you Mr Carvin General Verrilli you have four minutes remainingREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B VERRILLI JR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS GENERAL VERRILLI Thank you Mr Chief JusticeCongress confronted a grave problem when it enacted the Affordable Care Act The 40 million Americans who cant get health insurance and suffered often very terrible consequences Now we agree I think  everyone arguing this case agrees that Congress could remedy that problem by imposing the insurance requirement at the point of saleThat wont work The reason it wont work is because people will still show up at the hospital or at their physicians office seeking care without insurance causing the cost shifting problem And Mr Clements suggestion that they can be signed up for a high risk pool at that point is utterly unrealisticThink about how much it would cost to get the insurance when you are at the hospital or at the doctor It would be  it would be unfathomably high that will never work Congress understood that It chose a means that will work The means that it saw work in the States and in the State of Massachusetts and that and that it had every reason to think would work on a national basisThat is the kind of choice of means that McCulloch says that the Constitution leaves to the democratically accountable branches of government There is no temporal limitation in the Commerce Clause Everyone subject to this regulation is in or will be in the health care market They are just being regulated in advance Thats exactly the kind of thing that ought to be left to the judgment of Congress and the democratically accountable branches of governmentAnd I think this is actually a paradigm example of the kind of situation that Chief Justice Marshall envisioned in McCulloch itself that the provisions of the Constitution needed to be interpreted in a manner that would allow them to be effective in addressing the great crises of human affairs that the Framers could not even envisionBut if there is any doubt about that under the Commerce Clause then I urge this Court to uphold the minimum coverage provision as an exercise of the taxing powerUnder New York v United States this is precisely a parallel situation If the Court thinks there is any doubt about the ability of Congress to impose the requirement in 5000Aa it can be treated as simply the predicate to which the tax incentive of 5000Ab seeks accomplishment And the Court  as the Court said in New York has a solemn obligation to respect the judgments of the democratically accountable branches of government and because this statute can be construed in a manner that allows it to be upheld in that way I respectfully submit that it is this Courts duty to do soCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS Thank you GeneralCounsel well see you tomorrow Copyright 2014

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/03/20/148538071/do-juvenile-killers-deserve-life-behind-bars?ft=3&f=,The US Supreme Court hears arguments Tuesday in two  homicide cases testing whether it is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual  punishment to sentence a 14yearold to life in prison without the possibility  of parole There are currently 79 of these juvenile killers who  will die in prison  Whats more in many states the penalty is mandatory  meaning neither judge nor jury is allowed to consider the youngsters age or  background in meting out the sentence In cases dealing with punishment for juveniles context  is everything  In 2005 the Supreme Court struck down the death penalty for  juveniles declaring that kids are different from adults The court said that  because of their youth their brains are literally less developed they are more  impulsive more subject to peer pressure and less able to see the consequences  of their acts Two years ago the court used the same rationale when it  struck down the penalty of life without parole for nonhomicide crimes committed  by juveniles  But in Tuesdays cases the court faces the question of life  without parole in homicide cases A case from Arkansas involves a teenager who was not the  triggerman  Fourteenyearold Kuntrell Jackson and two other kids held up a   video rental store  One of the other boys pointed a sawedoff shotgun at  the cashier and when she threatened to call the police shot and killed her   Under Arkansas felonymurder law Jackson was deemed just as  responsible as the triggerman He was tried as an adult for aggravated murder  and under state law received a mandatory sentence of life without parole The other case from Alabama involves Evan Miller a boy so  brutalized as a child that by the time he was arrested for murder at age 14 he  had tried to kill himself six times the first time when he was 5 years old  Miller and a 16yearold friend went nextdoor to the  home of a neighbor who was dealing drugs to Millers mother The neighbor  52yearold Cole Cannon gave the boys liquor and marijuana Miller consumed a  fifth of whiskey as the boys engaged in drinking games with Cannon and planned  to steal his wallet Eventually a fight broke out and the boys severely beat Cannon set fires in the trailer and fled ignoring  Cannons pleas for help  Cannon died of smoke inhalation The  16yearold friend made a deal with prosecutors in exchange for his  testimony and got life with parole eligibility  Fourteenyearold Miller got life without parole Bryan Stevenson the lawyer who represents the boys in both of these cases  will make two basic arguments before the Supreme Court  The first is that a  mandatory punishment of life without parole for a 14yearold is cruel and  unusual punishment because the defendants age and background are irrelevant and  cannot mitigate punishment Judges cant consider it Juries cant consider it No  one can consider it says Stevenson The states counter that the juveniles age has already  been considered by taking the death penalty off the  table If the defendant is not going to get the death penalty  then at the very least the defendant ought to get life without parole to counterbalance the harm he has  inflicted says Alabama Solicitor General John  Neiman But the big question before the Supreme Court on Tuesday is  whether life without the possibility of parole is itself an unconstitutionally  cruel and unusual punishment when it is applied to  juveniles Defense lawyer Stevenson  notes that the American legal system treats minors as both less culpable and  less responsible  Fourteenyearolds for instance are not allowed to drink  to marry to vote to serve on juries or even to drive Were not saying that juvenile offenders who commit  homicide cant be punished severely Stevenson says They may even end up  spending the rest of their lives in prison But its premature excessive and  unfair to say we know  this juvenile will never be rehabilitated Indeed a brief filed by the Council of  Juvenile Correctional Administrators and other juvenile crime experts points to  many amazing cases of rehabilitation Among them is 16yearold Scott  Filippi who shot his mother but after his release joined the Army and became a  member of the Presidential Honor Guard Or there is Raphael Johnson who shot  and killed a classmate when he was 17 but  after his release got bachelors and masters degrees with  honors and started a community policing program in Detroit  Or there is  Lawrence Wu a 15yearold New  York gang member who eventually became the  editorinchief of the Columbia Law Review One of the most famous of those who have changed their  lives is awardwinning actorproducer Charles Dutton By age 12 he had quit  school and was living a life of fights and crime on the streets of Baltimore I liked getting in trouble says Dutton I enjoyed  getting in fights I enjoyed the challenge of  battle By age 17 he was sentenced to prison for  manslaughter Even in prison though he continued his fighting ways assaulting  a guard and getting eight years added to his sentence  A decade or so later he  was on his way to the  hole for solitary confinement when he picked up a book of plays sent to him by a  girlfriend   It ended  up changing his life As he puts it he found what he was born to do Up until that point in time I didnt really  concentrate on the life I had taken he says But only at that moment of  rediscovering my own humanity could I go back and have a very very strong and  sincere heartfelt remorse for taking that life Now four decades later he says he thinks of the man he  killed every day and wonders who he would have been Dutton says he understands the desire to avenge a  terrible crime but theres no sense in destroying a second life if that life  is actually redeemable If theres anyone who still has a modicum of redemption  left in their life its a juvenile The states that have adopted life without parole for  juvenile killers have a very different view The one thing that we dont know is what the potential  of the life would be that was snuffed out in the crime says Arkansas Attorney  General Dustin McDaniel The hypothetical of who might be rehabilitated in  prison is a hard one to analyze but there have to be some circumstances under  which these persons can serve life without parole Indeed Alabama Solicitor General Neiman notes that 38 of the 50 states  authorize life without parole for a 14yearold convicted of murder and the  federal government authorizes it for 15yearolds  Part of the justification  for that he observes is the notion of retribution As a moral matter it is OK for a government to say even if there is a  possibility that someone will rehabilitate themselves if a person commits a  sufficiently egregious crime then they just deserve a very severe sentence  Neiman says Defense lawyer Stevenson counters that in reality only 18 states have imposed life without parole on a 14yearold and only 79  killers who are 14 or younger are currently serving lifewithoutparole  sentences Arkansas Attorney General  McDaniel says that even if those statistics are accurate and he  disputes them it doesnt prove much Its not because society doesnt have the moral stomach  to impose those sentences McDaniel says Its because  realistically 14yearolds dont commit a lot of  murders Finally the states argue that life without parole is a  sufficiently severe sentence that  it  will deter at least some juveniles from committing murder Defense  lawyer Stevenson  dismisses that argument echoing the sentiments of many experts who deal with  violent juveniles Most of my clients had never heard of life imprisonment  without parole and had no capacity to appreciate what it would mean Stevenson  says It takes them years before they even get what it means to be sentenced to  life in prison without parole because theyre just not used to thinking that far  ahead Copyright 2014 NPR,20120320,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/03/14/148160372/as-gangs-move-to-new-york-suburbs-so-does-crime?ft=3&f=,Over the past few years authorities have arrested more than 200 gang members in an unexpected place the treelined suburbs along the Hudson River in New York Drug traffickers with ties to the Bloods the Latin Kings and other gangs have put down roots there Authorities say they brought shootings and stabbings with them Middletown NY is 90 minutes northwest of the city On West Main Street you can find tidy brick buildings from the 1800s a brew pub and a restaurant that sells fresh mussels and escargot But last month a law enforcement task force used helicopters and SWAT teams to find something else more than two dozen suspected members of the Bloods street gang accused of racketeering conspiracy and drug charges that could send them to prison for a decade An indictment says the group operated like a criminal machine pushing cocaine marijuana and heroin from the Bronx into New Yorks northern suburbs For three months court papers say authorities tracked them using wiretaps and cameras set up on telephone poles and trees Preet Bharara US attorney for the Southern District of New York is best known for prosecuting Wall Street executives But he says preventing gang bloodshed is his top priority It all began when he sat down in upstate New York with a group of moms almost three years ago When you think what is the worst thing you can hear from somebody Bharara recalls It was this A mother there talked about how she had lost her own son to gang violence in Newburgh NY and it made a big impression on me and the other people in that room And then when you think what could be worse than that We listened to the next mom who spoke who said she had lost two sons Violent crime is at historic lows in New York City But here in Middletown reports of violence ticked up last year and some neighboring cities like Newburgh have the highest rate of attacks per capita in the state One incident a stabbing connected to the Bloods gang last summer took place at a local diner along one of Middletowns busy thoroughfares On a chilly recent morning as parents walked their children to school Ruben Rivera arrived to pick up his breakfast Rivera has lived in Middletown for more than 20 years raising nine children It used to be quiet No more he says No No You gotta do something No A few years ago Rivera says he got mugged by a man carrying a knife Now he tells his youngest daughter to stay inside at night Ten minutes away at the Middletown Police Department an officer takes an accident report in the front room while Lt Greg Metakes describes the gang presence in the city Whereas in the past it was somewhat I guess you could say underground now theyre a little more open more willing to display colors and things of that nature Metakes says Back in New York City the sheer number of law enforcement officers makes it hard for big gangs to meet openly there the way they did back in the 1980s so many gang members who have left state prison have migrated north Less heat more opportunity And that opportunity is focusing on Orange County home to Newburgh and Middletown all too often for the liking of District Attorney Frank Phillips Hes working out of a nondescript office building these days after Hurricane Irene left six inches of water in his grandjury room Then the mold set in But Phillips whos served as the top county prosecutor since 1986 has another plague on his mind gang leaders in his community These arent the drug addicted street urchins who are being swept up there for statistical purposes he says These are the real movers and shakers behind the level of violence thats being committed upon our citizens throughout the county Phillips welcomes help from federal authorities who have the resources to wiretap gang members and conduct surveillance If they can keep taking the top echelons down I think that will go a long way to keeping a lid on the violence as best we can he says The man on the front lines is FBI agent James Gagliano He runs the Safe Streets Task Force in the area  10 FBI agents and 20 more officers from federal state and local agencies We use these drug cases to you know to compel cooperation which in turn allows us to go after the folks that are doing the shootings and the stabbings Gagliano says The strategy works like this Long before they bring any criminal charges investigators try to identify the key leaders in the gang They look at whether those kingpins may have prior drug and weapons convictions which expose them to decades more in the federal prisons That leverage could help prosecutors pressure them to plead guilty Deputy US Attorney Richard Zabel a former gang prosecutor says if gang members cooperate with authorities they can unlock other mysteries Often  we are able to solve what have been unsolved homicides longterm unsolved homicides Zabel says Gagliano the FBI agent says he has a bigger responsibility than just solving crimes He coaches basketball to kids from the rougher neighborhoods It also gives me an opportunity to interface with some of these young kids at a young age before the Bloods or the Latin Kings or La Eme or the Benkard Barrio Kings or Mad Drama or any of these other gangs get their claws into these kids Gagliano says He still watches some kids follow a dangerous path but Gagliano says he has the attitude of a guy who watches forests Hell clear out the dead wood but stick around to help the young trees grow straight Copyright 2014 NPR,20121214,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/03/12/148293470/drones-over-america-what-can-they-see?ft=3&f=,Unmanned aircraft systems or drones have long played a role in military operations But imagine thousands of drones flying over US skies  something we may see in just a few years In February President Obama signed an aviation bill requiring the Federal Aviation Administration to make plans to integrate drones into American airspaceOn Mondays Fresh Air John Villasenor a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a professor of electrical engineering at UCLA explains what these drones will be able to see and how they work He also talks about the privacy and national security concerns raised by using drones for surveillance purposesVillasenor tells Dave Davies that drones which are currently in use over the US border with Mexico have an endless list of nonmilitary uses from providing overhead surveillance for police departments to spotting wildfires and monitoring illegal border crossingsDrones could also be used commercially by real estate firms to get overhead images of a property by surveyors and cinematographers and even by paparazzi trying to fly over celebrity homes says VillasenorThat is going to be certainly some of the tests of what the limits are going to be provided by paparazzi he says The paparazzi will want to use drones if they can and obviously thats going to raise some very significant questionsOne question about drone usage obviously concerns privacy In 1986 the Supreme Court ruled that police officers who used a small singleengine airplane to spot hidden marijuana plants in someones backyard in California did not violate the Fourth Amendment because they were in public navigable airspace in a physically nonintrusive mannerNow if you take that ruling and apply it to a world in which there are hundreds or thousands of drones that obviously gives rise to some very significant concerns says Villasenor If you interpret that ruling by itself as things stand today that would certainly suggest that people would have a fair amount of latitude to make observations using dronesBut several rulings involving what can be observed from outside a property to look inside a property may also apply says Villasenor He points to the 2001 case Kyllo v United States in which the Supreme Court ruled that the use of a thermal imaging device to monitor heat radiated from inside someones home without a search warrant violated the Fourth AmendmentTheres a very interesting piece of language in that ruling that when you map it to drones is really interesting he says It says Where as here the government uses a device that is not in general public use to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion the surveillance is a search One of the interesting phrases in that language is not in general public use If we fastforward two or three years from now when drones are in public use does that change the legal foundation for what you can and cant observe from the outside of a home that would have been previously unknowable without physical intrusionInterview HighlightsOn types of drones There are drones that are powered by jet There are drones that could literally fit in a backpack or the palm of a hand There are drones that are basically like balloons that sit up there in the sky in one place and can observe enormous swaths of territoryOn drones that can stay in the air for weeks at a time These drones arent flying at 400 mph Theyre going very slowly and they have wings which are paper thin which have solar panels which are mounted on the top and they also have batteries that store energy collected during the day so they can continue to turn the propellers and fly at nightOn whether drones can capture audioDrones generate some noise themselves and so I dont think a drone could sit 1000 feet above and hear the conversation of two people sitting at an outside table at a coffee shop I think its mostly imagery and then to a smaller extent wireless signalsOn drones helping traffic patternsFive years from now you can probably imagine that in addition to having helicopters with people in them youll have drones above the ground taking pictures of those thingsOn drones being used by terroristsUnfortunately I think that is a legitimate concern and honestly it keeps me up at night I worry about that It doesnt take too much imagination to understand that a drone is very hard to stop It flies low and it isnt stopped by all of the infrastructure we have in place to make sure people dont go to the places theyre not supposed to go to Fences and walls and gates and barriers it simply goes over those things  As these drones get cheaper more prevalent easier to get attract less attention it raises the risks that they will fall into the wrong hands and be used inappropriatelyOn the FAA and privacy concernsThe FAA I would imagine has more aviation lawyers than Fourth Amendment constitutional lawyers To be fair to the FAA their primary mission  is to provide what they call the safest most efficient aerospace system in the world And frankly I think theyve done an extremely good job of that So their concern as they go through the steps of this aviation bill that was enacted on Feb 14 2012 is first and foremost to integrate drones into the airspace in a safe manner And I think that is the right priority In addition of course there are the privacy concerns But I think it is going to be left to the broader government  obviously with the input of nongovernmental groups  to address those Copyright 2014 NPR,20120313,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2012/02/11/146752819/music-superstar-whitney-houston-dies-ap-reports?ft=3&f=,Whitney Houston who ruled as pop musics queen until her majestic voice and regal image were ravaged by drug use erratic behavior and a tumultuous marriage to singer Bobby Brown died Saturday She was 48 The Beverly Hills Police Department say Houston was found dead Saturday afternoon at the Beverly Hilton Hotel The cause of death has not been reported Her body remained in the hotel and Beverly Hills detectives were investigating Houstons death came on the eve of the Grammy Awards Its a showcase where she once reigned and her death was sure to cast a heavy pall on Sundays ceremony I am absolutely heartbroken at the news of Whitneys passing music producer Quincy Jones said in a written statement I always regretted not having had the opportunity to work with her She was a true original and a talent beyond compare I will miss her terribly A Tumultuous Career At her peak Houston was the golden girl of the music industry From the middle of the 1980s to the late 90s she was one of the worlds bestselling artists She wowed audiences with effortless powerful and peerless vocals that were rooted in the black church but made palatable to the masses with a pop sheen Her success carried her beyond music to movies where she starred in hits like The Bodyguard and Waiting to Exhale She had the perfect voice and the perfect image a gorgeous singer who had sex appeal but was never overtly sexual who maintained perfect poise She influenced a generation of younger singers from Christina Aguilera to Mariah Carey who when she first came out sounded so much like Houston that many thought it was Houston But by the end of her career Houston became a stunning cautionary tale of the toll of drug use Her album sales plummeted and the hits stopped coming her once serene image was shattered by a wild demeanor and bizarre public appearances She confessed to abusing cocaine marijuana and pills and her once pristine voice became raspy and hoarse unable to hit the high notes as she had during her prime The biggest devil is me Im either my best friend or my worst enemy Houston told ABCs Diane Sawyer in an infamous 2002 interview with thenhusband Brown by her side It was a tragic fall for a superstar who was one of the topselling artists in pop music history with more than 55 million records sold in the United   States alone From The Beginning She seemed to be born into greatness  Houston daughter of Gospel and RB singer Cissy Houston was born in Newark NJ Aretha Franklin was her godmother Houston first started singing in the church as a child In her teens she sang backup for Chaka Khan Jermaine Jackson and others in addition to modeling It was around that time when music mogul Clive Davis first heard Houston perform The time that I first saw her singing in her mothers act in a club  it was such a stunning impact Davis told Good Morning America To hear this young girl breathe such fire into this song I mean it really sent the proverbial tingles up my spine he added Before long the rest of the country would feel it too Houston made her album debut in 1985 with Whitney Houston which sold millions and spawned hit after hit Saving All My Love for You brought her her first Grammy for best female pop vocal How Will I Know You Give Good Love and The Greatest Love of All also became hit singles Another multiplatinum album Whitney came out in 1987 and included hits like Where Do Broken Hearts Go and I Wanna Dance With Somebody The New York Times wrote that Houston possesses one of her generations most powerful gospeltrained voices but she eschews many of the churchier mannerisms of her forerunners She uses ornamental gospel phrasing only sparingly and instead of projecting an earthy tearful vulnerability communicates cool selfassurance and strength building pop ballads to majestic sustained peaks of intensity When You Love You Love Her decision not to follow the more soulful inflections of singers like Franklin drew criticism by some who saw her as playing down her black roots to go pop and reach white audiences The criticism would become a constant refrain through much of her career She was even booed during the Soul Train Awards in 1989 Sometimes it gets down to that you know she told Katie Couric in 1996 Youre not black enough for them I dont know Youre not RB enough Youre very pop The white audience has taken you away from them Some saw her 1992 marriage to former New Edition member and soul crooner Bobby Brown as an attempt to refute those critics It seemed to be an odd union she was seen as pops pure princess while he had a badboy image and already had children of his own The couple had a daughter Bobbi Kristina in 1993 Over the years he would be arrested several times on charges ranging from DUI to failure to pay child support But Houston said their true personalities were not as far apart as people may have believed When you love you love I mean do you stop loving somebody because you have different images You know Bobby and I basically come from the same place she told Rolling Stone in 1993 You see somebody and you deal with their image thats their image Its part of them its not the whole picture I am not always in a sequined gown I am nobodys angel I can get down and dirty I can get raunchy Back In The Game It would take several years however for the public to see that side of Houston Her moving 1991 rendition of The Star Spangled Banner at the Super Bowl amid the first Gulf War set a new standard and once again reaffirmed her as Americas sweetheart In 1992 she became a star in the acting world with The Bodyguard Despite mixed reviews the story of a singer Houston guarded by a former Secret Service agent Kevin Costner was an international success It also gave her perhaps her most memorable hit a searing stunning rendition of Dolly Partons I Will Always Love You which sat atop the charts for weeks It was Grammys record of the year and best female pop vocal and the Bodyguard soundtrack was named album of the year She returned to the big screen in 199596 with Waiting to Exhale and The Preachers Wife Both spawned soundtrack albums and another hit studio album My Love Is Your Love in 1998 brought her a Grammy for best female RB vocal for the cut Its Not Right But Its Okay I Was Losing Myself But during these career and personal highs Houston was using drugs In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2010 she said by the time The Preachers Wife was released doing drugs was an everyday thing  I would do my work but after I did my work for a whole year or two it was every day  I wasnt happy by that point in time I was losing myself In the interview Houston blamed her rocky marriage to Brown which included a charge of domestic abuse against Brown in 1993 They divorced in 2007 Houston would go to rehab twice before she would declare herself drugfree to Winfrey in 2010 But in the interim there were missed concert dates a stop at an airport due to drugs and public meltdowns She was so startlingly thin during a 2001 Michael Jackson tribute concert that rumors spread she had died the next day Her crude behavior and jittery appearance on Browns reality show Being Bobby Brown was an example of her sad decline Her Sawyer interview where she declared crack is whack was often parodied She dropped out of the spotlight for a few years Houston staged what seemed to be a successful comeback with the 2009 album I Look To You The album debuted on the top of the charts and would eventually go platinum Things soon fell apart A concert to promote the album on Good Morning America went awry as Houstons voice sounded ragged and offkey She blamed an interview with Winfrey for straining her voice A world tour launched overseas however only confirmed suspicions that Houston had lost her treasured gift as she failed to hit notes and left many fans unimpressed some walked out Canceled concert dates raised speculation that she may have been abusing drugs but she denied those claims and said she was in great shape blaming illness for cancellations NPRs Sami

groove wafted two decades ago from Bristol a bohemian university town in the west of England Though its prime movers  Massive Attack Tricky and Portishead  all loathe the term the word triphop has become synonymous with the style created by Bristol bands like Massive Attack and Smith  Mighty The sensuous groove fulfilled a timeless human need for a bassheavy sound to touch the secret recesses of the imagination and lure our dreamworld onto the dance floor Triphop was tailormade for the moment  and it happens every night  when a bopper wants to get tender Or when domestic listeners seek to wander within themselvesNot all local grooves take flight but triphop most certainly did Over the next two decades it was reimagined as chillout downtempo illbient and lounge music Its subtle tendrils have woven into music round the world  Washington DCs Thievery Corporation with their exotic cosmopolitan edge drifty Brazilian sounds like Ceu whose dulcet lilt earned her maximum market penetration a Starbucks CD Londons Ninja Tunes artists like Bonobo and Berlins technotinged Sonar Kollektiv As music writer Simon Reynolds notes People like Flying Lotus and Gonjasufi on the West Coast are doing trippy hiphop Though its not quite the same thing they probably are the inheritors of the spirit of Massive Attack Tricky Earthling and DJ VadimTo qualify as true triphop music has to share the sense of opiated mystery of Trickys tantalizing mumbles on the classic album 20 years old last year that launched triphop worldwide Massive Attacks Blue Lines Its magical Unfinished Sympathy cast a spell over the worlds clubbers Produced by Nellee Hooper later of Soul II Soul and Bjork among many others the welltimed sound was just one manifestation of a movement taking place in Bristol at that timeScene initiators included Smith  Mighty and the DJ collective The Wild Bunch from which came Massive Attack and Tricky The Pop Groups volatile postpunk added another element to the scene later splitting into the savage free explorations of Float Up CP and hornhappy PigbagBristol fed off its slave port for hundreds of years now its one of Britains blackest cities culturally and socially Its long been home to a West Indian community and shebeens and sound systems were a way of life for all musicloving Bristolian youth Being a port Bristol was always awash in hashish and other plantbased mindbenders like marijuana  not to mention more macrobiotically sound locallygrown lifeenhancers like scrumpy cider and hallucinogenic mushrooms legal back then grown in the surrounding countryside  that undoubtedly fuelled Bristols music sceneMuch of this musical experimentation took place at a club called The Dug Out As Hooper has said The Dug Out couldnt have had a better location at the top of the hill from St Pauls  the heart of the black music scene  and just down the hill from Clifton and the trendy punkart scene It was  just dangerous enough for trendies to feel edgy music cool and edgy enough to confuse and enthuse the dreads  perfectDisclosure I got a chance to explore Massive Attacks creative process first hand over a few years What follows is a typically incestous Bristolian saga The links between town and gown  the students and the locals  plus the charming citys many liberal artsy types made for a scene with a hectic social creative and romantic dynamicBlue Lines was born in an upstairs bedroom of the terraced West London home of AfroSwedish hiphop diva Neneh Cherry and her producer husband singer Cameron McVey Before her solo hits began with Buffalo Stance Neneh sang with Float Up CP and as her first husband was Bruce Smith drummer for the Pop Group and The Slits with whom Neneh also sang Bristol was yet another home to her The young Massive Attackers Daddy G 3D Mushroom and Tricky became Cherry and McVeys protegs They took over the small side bedroom soon cluttered with reeltoreels and tape machines and a record deck on which they would earnestly sift through possible samples A superb chef my friend Neneh would be in the kitchen concocting feasts in between writing rhymes with Massive Attack wandering in for cups of teaYears later after the band had released Blue Lines and were preparing the album that became Protection I visited Bristol to collaborate with them eventually cowriting the track Sly Samplebased songwriting in those predigital days could be laborious I bought a childs Casio keyboard to help fill the gaps which came in handy for Sly but the process often involved someone getting on their bike and cycling down to the

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2011/12/06/143205414/remembering-larry-levan-the-jimi-hendrix-of-dance-music?ft=3&f=,The audio link above is a radio story for All Things Considered about the late Larry Levan the  producer and DJ whose residency at New Yorks Paradise Garage between  1977 and 1987 remains the most storied in clubland For the story I  spoke with music writer Will Hermes whose recently published Love Goes To Buildings On Fire deals with part of that period in New York Citys history and a pair of DJs who were profoundly influenced by LevanJustin Berkmann is the founder of Ministry of Sound the London superclub and record label that this fall released Live  Remastered 20th Anniversary  a box set containing five DJ mixes originally recorded during  Ministrys early years The easy highlight of the box is the earliest  mix by Levan  the inspiration for Ministry and  widely fted as the greatest DJ of them all He spoke to me from NPRs London bureauNative New Yorker Danny Tenaglia was a Garage regular from its early days and went on to some major DJ residencies of his own particularly at Twilo and the Tunnel Currently he headlines clubs and events worldwide and holds down a legendary stint in Miami during the annual danceindustry confab Winter Music Conference at which he plays some 12 to 14 hours a shot I spoke to Tenaglia at 84 King Street the former home of the Paradise Garage Today its a parking garage We started at the buildings entranceDANNY TENAGLIA This is the ramp you would enter Its totally the same We would actually enter on the side there This was always a parking garage as is it is now There were always trucks down here They would have a little barricade This building goes all the way to the next street so its very very big So we would approach here and this is where doorman security staff would be You would queue up but they would try to keep it as minimal as possible because they had plenty of space up the rampIt was a very friendly welcome It was not tense with bullysecuritytype people You had to have a membership card to get in the Garage or be with a friend with one In the early days you had to often notify them that you were bringing a guest They were really really smart This is the first nightclub I went to  or anywhere besides an airport  where they had a metal detector I never saw much trouble here at all like fights or drama It was all about prevention I realized today on the way here that my membership card says 8081 Im like Wow 30 years OuchAfter you paid your admission fee there was a wonderful corridor entrance If you went straight ahead you were in a lounge and off to the right was a locker room You could actually check your clothes here Not all your clothes but you could change your clothes and some people did that They got out of their jeans and put on tank tops and shorts they even sold some garments like that for more comfortable dancingIf you went to the back where the lounge was it was sort of like a bar but there was no liquor served I think that was one of the most precious things about the Garage there were no drunken people here and it was very minimal on the drug usage  maybe some marijuana a little bit of something else but it wasnt obvious and blatant They always had fruit out on the bars and free juices and water It was so many different rooms to go in and be free You were so happy to be here that you never wanted to leaveMM At the Saint or Studio 54 some of the really legendary clubs of the time people were having sex under the stairs Did that happen much at the Garage DT I am so happy to say that I have never seen that here and I cant say I have heard any stories about it Im sure they would have stopped them if they saw something like that They did have a movie room but it wasnt porno videos They would show anything from The Exorcist to whatever was current It was just like a chillout room with movies playing Ive never seen anything disrespectfulI would arrive early in the early years because then it would get so crowded at times and hot and sweaty I was already a DJ so I wanted to absorb as much as I could This was also a school for me I would say 75 of the time I came here I came by myself Friday was predominantly straight and Saturday was predominantly gay and also predominantly black I would recollect the Garage was 65 black 20 HispanicLatino always a good mixture It wasnt very whiteI think the way to describe it was a house party mentality when you got there all the house lights were pretty much on They had a lot of pin spots and they really used them cleverly It wasnt like fluorescent house lights In the early days the opening time was 1 am The light man might not even be in the booth yet You might see him on a ladder putting gels up That was also part of my educationLarry was to us the Jimi Hendrix of dance music Which was both good and kind of freakysad in a way  like the world lost Jimi and then we lost Larry to drugs But thats what made him legendary an icon and what were standing here and talking about now He was known to be moody and I guess that acted out on his mood of the day You hear stories of how he would come down and push a speaker a half a foot It made a difference to him and that made a difference to us that it made a difference to him and wed talk about it the next day He knew something wasnt right Im sure that there were times that he heard a speaker fatiguing and it would annoy him It was nothing short of a performance He was thinking along the lines of a rock band onstageLarry would often take his shirt off because it was a very hot place and that was his house That was his place of comfort Probably the happiest place on earth for him to be was right up there in that booth When you went up the ladder to the booth you would enter a zone It wasnt open to that many people just industrytype people his friends I got a job working in nightclubs and started to work in a roller disco which back in 1980 was a happening thing I got into For the Record the same record pool as Larry Thats when I got privileged to become a member of the Garage  you had special access without having to wait on line because you were a memberI think for the most part I definitely preferred being downstairs in the dance floor I was a dancer For the most part it was definitely freestyle dancing People just expressed themselves with their bodies You wouldnt see what you were seeing in many other clubs It wasnt welcomed to see people doing the Hustle It was a predominantly black thing They really would move their bodies in a very expressive way in an artistic way and you appreciated that I certainly wasnt doing that but I was being myself If you think back to that era so much was going on punk rock clubs Danceteria the Mudd Club and sometimes patrons would come there and just be themselves and nobody would care It was about losing yourselfA bell goes off at the garage Pink Floyd Time  you wouldnt be surprised to hear that too Thats Larry ringing the bell from heaven Hes adding a little drama to this momentJUSTIN BERKMANN If I had never gone to the Paradise Garage there never would have been a Ministry of Sound Having gone there for the best part of a year and a half and experienced the whole situation there and fallen in love with the club and the scene and then going though the experience of it closing and not being there anymore I came back to London to build my own version of it Thats what Ministry of Sound was  it was about 85 Paradise GarageThe whereabouts of the original or the Paradise Garage sound system is probably unknown I heard that it was in a lockup I heard of it being here and there and it was used for this and that I have to say I cant say theres any proof of it ever reappearing It definitely was not installed into Ministry  thats a false rumor Ministrys system was installed by Austin Derrick who was an assistant to Kenny Powers one of the original Richard Long associates  Richard Long being the installer of the Garage system So it was a facsimile of the systemThe Garage system was I think I can quite safely say the best sound system ever made in a nightclub It was tuned to perfection They made the room perfect for the system It was created for 1970s production values vinyl pressing  all the equipment in those days was much more rudimentary to what we have today so it was all about getting the best out of what you had Obviously the subs subwoofers were a key element Those were the subs that Richard Long had designed for the Earthquake movie of 74 Charlton Heston running around Los Angeles  Sensurround I think they called it with the whole cinema vibrating at a few hertz to give you a feeling of earthquake Those were the subs that were in the Garage The other thing that was kind of cool about it was they had stuck up little horns and speakers into corners that pealed off at certain frequencies You actually got threedimensional soundWhen I came to New York I didnt know anything about it I came to New York on a long trip and it was the only place I went I was a wannabe DJ I went on a Friday unaware that Friday was straight and Saturday gay On a Friday night there was quite a bit of hostility to a white guy on his own walking around in there and I was getting bumped and jostled quite a lot by the crowd There was hostility still especially in that era towards black people and gay people in New York So I think the Garage was an island for them to feel comfortableJust as I as leaving a guy came up to me and said You should be here on Saturday night this is obviously not your scene you should check it out tomorrow night I came back on the Saturday night The vibe was completely different I was there every week without fail until closingI knew Levan pretty well I eventually had the honor of meeting him and convincing him to come to London and then hosting over here for his rather extended stay He was only supposed to stay for three days and he stayed three months My career as a DJ is mostly thanks to him He said Look its very simple If you have a constant level of frequency your ears fatigue quickly and your perception of the volume drops so if you continually fiddle with the bass and the treble and change the frequencies your ears fatigue slower and the perception of the music is louder for longer It adds so much more to it Today the music has that built into it Its all idiotproofed In the old days it was raw and you were given the opportunity to add more to it With the advent of technology in the way it is today its a dying art formWell there was never a quiet moment when he was around lets face it He was quite a character Theres no question that when he arrived in the airport with no records it was a rather interesting to figure out what he was going to play No he didnt have any He just didnt have any He didnt own any records He would sell them on a regular basis Apparently friends of his would be going to carboot rummage sales and find records that were his and go around and give them back to him and he would sell them again He didnt have any particular connection or any emotional attachment to his vinyl and to be honest having gone through that 24 hours with him its understandable He didnt really need it He had maybe gone beyond that point where he didnt need any connection to the music he could just create it through being Larry I guess Levan and Berkmann visited four London disco collectors and ended up with about 120 records for the evenings performanceThat set was absolutely outstanding I DJed before him very pleased with myself I was still extremely green at that point It was right at the beginning of my education And when he came on the first record he put on it was like someone turned the screen from black and white to color it was just all of a sudden there was a new dynamic there was a new dimension it was just like night and day I probably just stood back and just thought The master has arrived The lesson has started It was an amazing experience It was one of the proudest moments of my life in the club I had built around my experiences in New York and around the Garage to have him there and stamp his authority It was very emotional Copyright 2014 NPR,20111206,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/12/04/143025654/migrants-say-theyre-unwilling-mules-for-cartels?ft=3&f=,Mexican drug cartels have found a new source of labor to backpack marijuana into the United   States illegal immigrants Federal agents prosecutors defense attorneys and migrants themselves say that traffickers have begun recruiting undocumented immigrants at the border both voluntarily and forcibly Now US courts along the border have to decide what to do with terrified immigrants who come before them and say The cartel made me do it Rodolfo and Jose Luis were fairly typical economic immigrants Strong resourceful and poor they arrived at Ojinaga Mexico with the intention of crossing the border and making their way to Colorado to look for work as roofers But when they arrived at the Rio Grande on Oct 21 ready for the journey north they were met by three trucks full of heavily armed young toughs belonging to La Linea a drug gang based upriver in Juarez They hit us threw us on the ground searched us and took our money Rodolfo said at the Pecos Criminal Justice Center in Pecos  Texas Then they told us if we didnt smuggle drugs for them they would kill us They didnt give us any other option So thats what Rodolfo and Jose Luis did They each shouldered a 50pound backpack full of marijuana and carried it across the dry riverbed into Presidio County  Texas The cartel guide who accompanied them carried a radio but no weapon So as soon as they were out of sight of the border they dropped the dope in the brush and hightailed it north The next morning Border Patrol agents found them tromping through the desert and arrested them for illegal entry I told the Border Patrol that we were forced to carry it Rodolfo said They told us we were lying I said No Im telling the truth Well show you So we took them to the place near the river and the marijuana was still there In November the prosecutor dropped the charges Rodolfo and Jose Luis  fearing for their lives  were deported back to Mexico They asked that their last names not be used in this story Fear Of Going Back This is the new calculus for illegal border crossers They have to deal with criminal syndicates that control all 2000 miles of the international divide To them immigrants are just another income stream Theyre robbed theyre kidnapped and their families are extorted and increasingly theyre dragooned into helping the gangs About a year and a half ago ourselves as well as our investigators started seeing these clients that would say I dont care how long Im going to get I cant go home  theyll kill me says Elizabeth Rogers a federal public defender in West Texas for 27 years Rodolfo and Jose Luis were her clients Its difficult to say how many cases like this are in federal courts along the border Rogers says most of her backpacker cases these days claim coercion and they didnt used to The individual stories vary but the common denominator is fear We have grown men rawboned cowboy guys from Chihuahua begging for protection from deportation Rogers says In Tucson criminal defense attorney Raul Miranda says about onethird of his clients these days are telling him they were unwilling drug mules Most say they were planning to cross the border but the human smuggler they were dealing with turned out to be a marijuana smuggler Theyre told by the people  who obviously work for the cartels  that they have to carry the bundle or theyll reduce the fee that theyre going to have to pay or theyll forgive the fee Miranda says But the people who are telling them this are armed and the people feel threatened if they say no The identical story is heard 1000 miles east in Laredo Texas They kind of feel like they dont have a choice because now theyve been approached to do this and you dont really want to say no to people who are committing such violent acts in Mexico says Myrna Montemayor a federal public defender The Mexican city of Nuevo Laredo  where the PanAmerican Highway becomes Interstate 35  is a major terminus for drug and human smugglers Migrants headed north or people just deported from the US end up here at a churchrun shelter called Casa del Migrante Boys make a line please a volunteer yells at dinnertime Young men in baseball caps and baggy pants take their seats at long tables served with bowls of vegetable stew Fernando is a slight Honduran in his early 20s with thick kinky hair He wears a dirty hoodie with a Tasmanian devil on it He says hes had several runins with the violent drug mafia the Zetas here on the border Oh yeah they force you to work for them and if you tell them you dont want to theyll kill you Theyll use you as a lookout or a kidnapper or to carry drugs north Fernando says Some people who dont have family to help them join these gangs because its the only way they can cross the river I wont work for them  I wont ask the cartel for help I ask God to help me Validity Questioned The US justice system is generally skeptical of immigrants who claim the cartel made me do it One fedup federal prosecutor in fact told a California jury in a cocaine smuggling case Why dont we send a memo  and say Dear drug traffickers when you hire someone to drive a load tell them that they were forced to do it Lately public defenders in courts along the southwest border have raised this duress claim more often in attempts to get the judge to lower their clients punishment The defense is rarely successful Rodolfo the immigrant who crossed the border with Jose Luis is the exception Federal agents believed his story only after he volunteered to show them where he dropped the dope Usually though theres no corroborating evidence all the judge has is the defendants word I think that no doubt some of them are valid says Robert Pitman US attorney for the Western District of Texas I think based on the information I get that the vast majority of them are not valid If you think about it there are few things people can say in their defense when theyre caught with a load of illegal drugs To test the duress claim federal investigators look at an immigrants criminal history and interview codefendants to see if all the stories match up What were finding out in our investigations in a lot of cases is in fact thats not true Theyre just kind of using that as a trendy defense because maybe they think its gonna work says Will Glaspy assistant special agent in charge with the DEA in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas Their individual stories may or may not be true but they are entirely plausible The trend of cartels preying on migrants has been well documented A Tough Defense On Oct 16 the Mexican army rescued 61 immigrants from a safe house in Piedras Negras across the river from Eagle Pass Texas Mexican authorities say the immigrants were being held for ransom and forced to work for the cartel From a traffickers perspective using migrants to smuggle drugs is a reasonable tactic Youre placing the risk onto the migrants as theyre coming into the US In essence youre not exposing your foot soldiers to capture says Fred Burton vice president for intelligence with the Austinbased global intelligence firm Stratfor Defense attorneys in three states interviewed by NPR say they are frustrated that the government maintains its longstanding distrust of duress claims despite the new reality along the USMexico border Its a tough defense because its another country and we cant even investigate properly over there So theres no proof And thats not to say that theyre not true says Marissa PerezGarcia branch chief of the public defenders office in Laredo One immigrant defendant according to his lawyer recently blurted out in a West Texas courtroom Just kill me here so my family can claim my body

kids in Texas to court with misdemeanor charges Some schools have started rethinking the way they punish students for bad behavior after watching many of them drop out or land in prison because of tough disciplinary policies In a downtown Houston municipal court Judge David Fraga has presided over thousands of cases involving students ticketed by school police His docket is still relatively small at the moment with only 45 to 65 cases per night I suspect probably when school is in full bloom probably well have between 125 and 150 Fraga says He isnt referring to cases involving adults ticketed for driving under the influence or suspended licenses but rather young people ticketed by school police for fighting disrupting class or using profanity  all Class C misdemeanors In other words these infractions are the equivalent of crimes like insurance fraud and criminal mischief Erlin Zavala is making his second court appearance for skipping school The gangly 13yearold has jet black hair combed back with gel He listens quietly to questions Fraga asks him with his tiredlooking mom at his side Fraga is a true believer in second chances He wont decide Erlins fate today but he usually recommends community service just to keep kids mistakes from becoming part of their permanent record I mean you gotta show these young people that theres hope Fraga says Winding up in a courtroom for skipping school might seem a bit excessive but beginning in the mid 1990s most states adopted rigid zero tolerance policies in response to school shootings and gang violence Schools in Texas went further by ticketing things like truancy tardiness dress code violations and the use of profanity at school Deborah Fowler legal director for Texas Appleseed a public interest law firm says schools criminalized kids misdeeds no matter how small What we are seeing now are hundreds of thousands of Class C misdemeanor tickets being issued to juveniles in Texas who are being processed for those tickets through what is really an adult criminal justice court system she says This summer an exhaustive study by the Council of State Governments found that by 12th grade more than half of all 14 to 15yearolds in Texas are ticketed expelled or suspended at least once After theyre ticketed sent to court and fined hundreds of dollars students arent always allowed to go back to their home school Instead theyre sent to an alternative school a holding pen of sorts where kids are supposed to learn their lesson Learning Their Lesson Thomesha Turner 18 is a senior in the Waco independent school district She was a good student and had never been in trouble before a verbal altercation with a teacher She says the teacher pointed a finger in her face and called her a little girl I told her to get out of my face cause I wasnt a little girl and I cussed her out I said Miss You get out of my face or Ill beat your bitch ass up Theres a different way I couldve handled it Turner says but I didnt handle it in a more mature way Danielle Delgado 12 is a diminutive girl with a hairtrigger temper Shes at the Waco Alternative School Campus for fighting with another student Delgado recalls She told me I have some big feet I said you got a big face She swung but she missed and so thats when we started fighting in the hallway And security got me and then security took her to the vice principals office Delgado has been suspended three times The first time she was only 8 and in third grade Turmoil In Young Lives At Wacos only alternative school absolute obedience and compliance with the rules is mandatory School uniforms are a must and students cant speak in the hallways Seventy students are referred to this school every day and theyre all expected to change for the better But the more these kids open up the more it becomes apparent that their behavior has a lot to do with the turmoil in their young lives Karen McPhetridge 14 says shes been in foster care since she was 3 I got back with my mom like three years ago and then my dad abandoned me McPhetridge says Ive been angry with him and Ive been angry with my sister because as soon as she graduated she became a stripper and now shes like all strung out on drugs McPhetridge was expelled for smoking marijuana on school grounds Kids like her have gotten in to trouble but until now schools have had no way to deal with the root causes of their bad behavior Neglect abuse and family problems are issues that students like Saul Cornejo 16 bring to school every day Teachers at school they dont understand it he says They just dismiss you put you off instead of like really trying to get to the real problem which most of the time originates at home and stuff Cornejo has been suspended several times for fighting He lives with his older brother but is pretty much on his own His principal says hes really bright but Cornejo is facing felony charges for burglary and wont be allowed to return to his home school Schools give up on kids like Cornejo all too often says John Hudson the director of attendance truancy and dropout recovery in the Waco alternative school Hudson says When you look at the numbers of times students are disciplined in school suspended separated from school placed in disciplinary alternative education placement the unintended consequence is that their education suffers to the point where it puts them farther and farther away from graduating Hudson thinks these unintended consequences prove that the schools disciplinary policies are not working This seems to be the growing consensus in Texas but its going to take a lot of work to undo the damage the harsh disciplinary policies have caused Worth Rescuing For the past two years Waco had the secondhighest suspension and expulsion rates in Texas Today administrators and teachers are trying to turn that around by being less punitive The district has even started a tiny pilot program that teaches parents how to help their kids control their behavior For Delgado Turner and McPhetridge it may be too late They say they feel labeled and stigmatized McPhetridge says This will go on my record and it worries me like what kind of colleges would want to accept someone who was put in alternative school Turner has similar concerns  When they see alternative on your background they look at you different because theyre like alternative Thats for bad kids Already a mother of two with another child on the way Turner is determined to graduate next spring Delgado isnt so sure Im pretty sure Ill do fine she says but then adds in a whisper Ill be back here  Im a bad child The Waco schools superintendent Bonnie Cain took over two years ago She says a few teachers and administrators may still think some kids will always be trouble but from now on the districts disciplinary policy will assume that deep down even the toughest students can change and are worth rescuing Nobody wakes up in the morning and says You know what Im going to make everybody mad today Im going to get expelled  Cain says We need to take that child where they are and work with them to get them on the right track because if we dont do it who will With more state lawmakers now supporting this view school districts in Texas are rethinking their disciplinary policies Researchers hope Texas will be a model for other states to do the same This story was

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/10/26/141659461/reporting-on-the-front-lines-of-mexicos-drug-war?ft=3&f=,Since 2006 40000 people have been murdered in Mexico as drug cartels battle each other and the Mexican military British journalist Ioan Grillo has spent the past 10 years covering the Mexican drug trade His book El Narco traces how Mexico came to dominate drug trafficking how it spread throughout the country and how the drug cartels have radically transformed the area along the USMexico border Grillo tells Fresh Airs Dave Davies that Mexicos dominance in the drug trade has developed over the past 20 years In the 1980s he explains the Colombian cartels dominated the Latin American drug market They had this incredible cocaine and they used to fly it straight from Colombia across to Miami Grillo says And the American military and Drug Enforcement Agency realized that it was very easy to create a choke point in the Caribbean and make it very difficult to smuggle cocaine to Florida The Colombians he says changed tactics They started smuggling their cocaine through Mexico The Mexicans began as couriers and then they took over the business from the Colombians he says And then they owned the lions share of the cocaine business where the real money was The rise of the violent Mexican drug trade coincided with the political collapse of the Institutional Revolutionary Party PRI which had held power in Mexico for more than 70 years The PRI had a very good system of controlling all aspects of national life  all the local police forces and organized crime were controlled through a very wellconstructed system of power where the power flows down like water and the money rises up like gas says Grillo So the corruption rises up like gas And the system of corruption was broken down so what we started to see were the police forces controlled by different political parties and actively fighting each other  There was a real fragmentation of the state And that is one of the core reasons why the conflict has gotten so bloody and so out of control Turf wars began to break out in towns along the MexicoUS border The Zeta cartel one of the deadliest drug trafficking groups in Mexico started expanding all across the country In some areas says Grillo they even started advertising for new recruits They actually had blankets hanging from bridges saying Why be poor Why take the bus to work If youre exmilitary or an expoliceman come to us and well give you a good job  In the past decade says Grillo the level and type of violence in Mexico has changed The first beheadings took place in 2006 when two policemen were killed Those killings he says started a precedent for hundreds of beheadings and other brutal tactics The cartels saw themselves as military personnel controlling territory he says How do you control a territory You sow terror against the population When Felipe Calderon took office in 2006 he vowed to wage war on the drug cartels He authorized the use of military force against the drug runners and started extraditing drug kingpins The cartels in turn turned on the police and the military  In the past four years more than 3000 policemen and soldiers have been killed by the cartels Its gone way beyond the bounds of organized crime he says When we think of Al Capone and organized crime we think of the largest massacre where there were seven people killed Whereas in Mexico in a single massacre youve seen 72 people murdered Youve seen mass graves with 200 bodies groups of men with RPGs and AK47s attacking police bases and military units Its gone way beyond the bounds of a mafia war Grillo says the question of how to tackle the cartels will be a major issue in the upcoming 2012 Mexican presidential election Many members of the public when asked in surveys if they should make pacts between the cartels they say yes he says Politically its very difficult to say this  to say we want to work with the cartels to make pacts is to say that youre supporting their drug trafficking But there are cases mainly in the US when prison officials sit down fighting rival gang members and say We have to stop this fighting Youre not giving them anything Youre saying Its not benefiting anybody to have this fighting Grillo says one way to stop the fighting would be to look at ways to potentially legalize and decriminalize drugs in the United States The debate about the Mexican drug war has to be linked to the debate on the American drug policy he says We have to understand that its the same question These drug cartels are receiving 30 billion from American drug users and if you look at that over 10 years youre talking about 300 billion  Is American drug policy effective now Many people say its not effective right now  If you legalize marijuana for example would it affect drug cartels It certainly will affect the cartels We know they make billions of dollars every year selling marijuana in the United States  and we know billions of dollars go to Mexico from selling marijuana and end up paying assassins hit men and corrupt politicians Copyright 2014 NPR,20111026,marijuana

personally knew Fred Vinson Earl Warren Warren Burger William Rehnquist and John Roberts Stevens clerked during Vinsons appointment practiced law during Warrens tenure and served on the court with Burger Rehnquist and RobertsIn a wideranging conversation with Terry Gross on Wednesdays Fresh Air Stevens discusses his career as well as his views on some of the decisions handed down from the court during his 35 years on the benchIn his final decade on the court some of his best known opinions were his dissenting ones  in Bush v Gore which stopped the Florida recount and in Citizens United v Federal Election Commission which ended restrictions on corporate spending in electionsStevens also wrote the opinion for the court in two cases that successfully challenged the Bush administrations approach to the war on terrorism  Rasul v Bush which said detainees at Guantanamo had the right to challenge their incarceration in American courts and Hamdan v Rumsfeld which ruled against the Bush administrations plan to use military tribunals at Guantanamo  Legal journalist Jeffrey Toobin describes those decisions as the summit of Stevens achievements on the benchInterview HighlightsOn the role of the chief justiceHe has the same role as every other justice in the sense that he does his best to persuade others to share his views and each of the rest of the justices do the same thing If he ends up being one of the five justices in the majority he has the same responsibility that he has if theres a unanimous opinion Namely he assigns the author of the opinion to express the views of the majorityOn becoming more liberal over the course of his time on the Supreme CourtThose terms are a little bit misleading because you have so many issues that you address as a member of the court that on some issues you might be regarded as to use your word as a liberal and on others you might be regarded as a conservative And its difficult to place a simple label on the entire work product of a member of the courtOn his dissenting opinion in the Citizens United rulingAs I explain in the opinion there were narrower grounds that would not have caused any major changes in the law And that could have been used to decide the case And having explained that I then get into a discussion of why I thought that the particular cases that the court overruled in that case had been correctly decided and should not be overruled  The court has held I think incorrectly that the First Amendment protects the right to use money just as though money were speech And of course expenditures for campaigns go for many things other than speech such as travel expenses wardrobe expenses public polls In the Watergate incident some of that campaign money was used for illicit purposes and should not be regarded as protected by the First AmendmentOn the term activistWhenever a court makes decisions that are not necessary in order to dispose of the particular issues of the case the word activist may apply to that work But thats not a criticism of the impartiality of the justices on the courtOn the right to bear armsI think its fairly clear that the framers expected the states to have the last say on what kind of use of the people to keep and bear arms should be authorized They certainly didnt expect in my judgment federal judges to have word on what kinds of firearms states could authorize for themselvesOn the Second AmendmentThe more that you looked at the text and the drafting history of the Second Amendment the more you come to the conclusion that the current courts reading is much broader than what the draftsmen expectedOn his robesThats the one tax deduction that judges have if I can remember If you buy new robes thats a business expense and can be deductedOn the Bush v Gore decision I guess the thing that surprised me the most was the fact that any justice thought there was irreparable injury shown by the petitioners that would justify the action that was takenOn his viewpoints evolving over timeAny judge or justice has views that evolve over time because he  becomes more and more educated and better able to do certain things  Theres been some change in my views about the death penalty but I  think theres more of a change in the jurisprudence of the court that  made me eventually reach the conclusion that the death penalty as it is  presently administered is unconstitutionalOn whether a decision is constitutional vs whether it is a wise policyChief  Justice Burger and Justice Blackmun for example originally voted to  uphold the constitutionality of the death penalty Justice Blackmun  later changed his views on that particular issue But both of them were  very clear in believing that it was not wise policy They both came from  Minnesota which does not have a capital punishment statute and I  think they were not fans of the death penaltyOn being in the position of upholding the constitutionality of a ruling while believing that its not good policyThe example that comes to mind most readily is Gonazales v Raich  a case that we had 78 years ago involving the constitutionality of  federal enforcement against the use of marijuana in California It was after California passed a statute allowing its use for  medical purposes  The women involved in the case who grew marijuana  in their own backyard and had strong medical justification for using the  drug  I thought it was most unwise to prohibit them from doing so but I  think that it was equally clear that the federal constitution did  authorize the federal government to enforce the statutes on the books Copyright 2014 NPR,20111019,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2011/10/16/141365474/electronic-music-festivals-in-the-medias-cross-hairs?ft=3&f=,On Labor Day weekend a bustling sea of music fans in their late teens and early 20s were stuffed onto a grassy open field in New   York One of them stood out dancing in a sweatdrenched black Tshirt that read Sex drugs and dubstepObviously it wasnt Woodstock but in between the neon sunglasses and hot pants I saw remnants of hippie culture in tiedye and plumes of weed smoke Electric Zoo is a threeday electronic music festival held annually on Randalls Island in New York this year 80000 people walked through the gates Earlier this summer on the other side of the country The Electric Daisy Carnival drew 230000 people Ryan Raddon also known as DJ Kaskade was one of the DJs that played therePeople are like This is the biggest thing happening in California he says Im like Dude this is the biggest thing happening in the world Ive got news for you Ive played Creamfields Ive played all these festivals all over the world U2 doesnt do this Thats why its like well you cant ignore it much anymoreThe thing is electronic music festivals havent been ignored Theyve received quite a bit of press coverage but much of the attention has focused on drug use and danger This years Electric Daisy was held in Vegas after it got kicked out of the LA Coliseum following the death of a 15yearold last year Her parents are now suing the Coliseum commission and the promoter of the festival Insomniac Events In June the death of a 19yearold made headlines when an Insomniac event in Dallas was shut down early for violating fire codesA month later a documentary about the Electric Daisy Festival caused a furor of its own when riot police were ordered in to control largerthanexpected crowds after Raddon tweeted that he would DJ a free party outside of the eventNobody wanted that outcome Raddon says Thats not what was supposed to happen But definitely the media  from what actually happened to what I saw in my hotel room there was a huge differenceOn cable news networks the word riot scrolled under reports of the scene outside the movie premiere Three people were arrested and there were no major injuries reportedAfter the premiere Dan Turner of the Los Angeles Times published an editorial titled Electric Daisy Events Not Worth It For Los Angeles writing If any city is equipped to handle an unruly crowd of young people high on drugs its Las VegasWere really not editorializing against raves or young people going to concerts were editorializing against Insomniac says Turner Were happy theyre going to Las VegasThe CEO of Insomniac Pasquale Rotella countered with an editorial of his own headlined Dont Trample The Electric Daisy in which he took issue with the term rave Betty Kang a publicist for the Electric Zoo festival in New York says that word carries a history of negative connotations that dont apply to events like hersDance music was not allowed in the clubs and there were these underground parties quote unquote raves she says talking about the mid1990s when druguse was the main focus of reports on raves from mainstream outlets like 2020 There was no organization Like it was some kids in the woods or in an abandoned building throwing a party with no safety no security So I think those situations created this negativity around it because they were illegalI worked so much overtime trying to talk about how the rave scene wasnt all about drugs Ariel Meadow Stallings told The Record in July She published and edited the rave zine Lotus in Seattle during the late 90s It was very noble of me and I still do believe it wasnt all about drugs But it is a drug culture Even if youre not on drugs the culture of the party is determined by the fact that there are people there who areI think drug fairs are nothing uncommon They may be shocking to editors who think its just awful and can get some headline writer to do something clever says Barnard Collier who reported on Woodstock for the New York Times in 1969 Music has had drugs attached to it since caveman times I suspect so to me the idea that music and drugs shouldnt be intimately connected is absurdWhen Collier went to Woodstock more than 40 years ago he says that at first his editors at the Times didnt want to cover the event at all and when he persuaded them they wanted his story to fit a certain frameThat was that these were a bunch of druggedout hippies who were causing great trouble and catastrophe that cost the county of Sullivan tons of money and should be closed down by the governor forthwithCollier says thats not what he saw It didnt look that way to me I was ready to quit if I had to I said Look I wont write it if you dont put it in like I said It eventually got up to the editor Scotty Reston James Reston then the executive editor of the paper and Scotty said Look we have to write it as he sees itNevertheless the paper followed his report with an editorial titled Nightmare in the Catskills that opened with the line The dreams of marijuana and rock music that drew 300000 fans and hippies to the Catskills had little more sanity than the impulses that drive the lemmings to march to their deaths in the seaNot all of the coverage of Woodstock in 1969 characterized the attendees as insane The BBC coupled their descriptions of rampant drug use with accounts of hippies behaving well lauding the cooperative spirit of the event According to the New Yorkers music critic Ellen Willis there was a romanticized theme that ran through the coverage of Woodstock which she believed was inaccurate In a piece she published in the magazine in 1969 she wrote The cooperative spirit did not stem from solidarity in an emergency  the We all forgot our differences and helped each other phenomenon that attends power blackouts and hurricanes  so much as a general refusal to adopt any sort of emergency psychologyIn many ways romanticism and demonization in news stories come from the same place says Todd Gitlin a professor of Journalism and Sociology at Columbia University According to him the press has a penchant for the sensationalMedia are drawn to vivid and conflictfilled situations the colorful the spectacular the lurid the bloody the ghoulish the hilarious the freakish the bang bang he says This has been true for a long time I was at Altamont and it was certainly true thereHe adds that the media build newsframes that suit their audiences which in the case of print news tend to be olderTheres a gravitating towards the Oh my god look at whats happening to the kids story he says Its a frame that didnt just begin Its a staple because the press is surveying the society for menacesBetty Kang admits that there is drug use at Electric Zoo but notes that the event has never had a drugrelated death she says thats because of the amount of hard work that goes into the festivalWe work with the NYPD she says We work with the fire department We work with the parks department to put on this event at Randalls IslandA lot of people at electronic music festivals arent there for drugs  theyre there for the music says Ryan Raddon He insists that much of the way dance music is covered has to do with the fact that its only beginning to cross over into the mainstreamElectronic music mainly because its new does get tagged as something bad as rock and hiphop did he says Hiphop still gets griefIf past history is any indication mainstream media coverage of nonmainstream cultural events is as likely to stoke the flames as it is to put out any fires Copyright 2014 NPR,20111016,marijuana

and got her  6yearold daughter ready for school At 630 the two of them left their house  in Ciudad Juarez  Mexico in a tan  2003 Ford Focus They headed toward the Stanton Street Bridge  crossing into Texas Martinez is a teacher at a bilingual charter  school in El  Paso She had just been named the Teacher of the Year at  her school By the end of the day the  35yearold mother of two would be under arrest accused of attempting to  smuggle more than 100 pounds of marijuana into the United  States Because Martinez crossed daily into the US  she had applied for a SENTRI pass from the Department of Homeland Security The  pass costs 122 a year and pass holders must submit to a rigorous background  check In exchange they can use the SENTRI Express Lane at the border where  travelers generally are processed much faster Because of her SENTRI pass and  because of her regular commute Martinez unwittingly had fallen victim to a new  scheme by a local drug smuggling gang This Is Not  Happening To Me As Martinez drove onto the bridge on the  morning of May 26 her daughter was strapped into a car seat in the back  Newspaper vendors wandered through the traffic waving the latest edition of  El Diario  Filthy young men with  squirt bottles threatened to wash commuters windshields Mexican soldiers were  randomly inspecting vehicles on the Mexican side of the  bridge They asked me to pull over  Martinez says  They also asked me to open my trunk One of the requirements of the  SENTRI pass program is that users must keep their personal belongings visible to  the customs agents So on her morning commutes Martinez would put her purse and her daughters  schoolbag on the front passenger seat She says she never put anything in her  trunk So when I saw the two suitcases in  my trunk I thought it was like a bad dream she says I thought This is not  real This is not happening to me Of course you know already that something  bad is inside Inside was more than 100 pounds of  marijuana Martinez immediately declared that shed  never seen the two bags before She begged the soldiers to let her call her  husband to come pick up their daughter but they wouldnt let  her I had to keep myself calm because I  wanted her to remain calm Martinez recalls She was looking at me she says of  her 6yearold She was looking at the military all around us with their  weapons  She was very mature for a little girl at that age Very  calm Martinez saw one of her coworkers driving  by and she frantically waved for her to stop Martinez tried to give her daughter to the  coworker but again the military officers wouldnt allow it Eventually the  soldiers took Martinez and her daughter together to the local  prosecutors offices We stayed there a couple of hours  Finally they let me give my daughter to my husband she says Martinez was sent straight  to a Mexican jail Free Miss  Ana Juarez is the murder capital of  Mexico  More than 3000 people were  killed in drugrelated violence there last year Extortion is rampant Most  crimes go unpunished and theres a general sense of lawlessness Residents  often roll their eyes or throw up their hands when asked whether they have faith  in the justice system But something different happened  after Martinez  was arrested Hundreds of people protested outside the jail declaring that she  was innocent In Mexico female teachers regardless  of their marital status or their age are often called Miss  Bumper stickers  appeared saying Free Miss Ana Martinez was known both at her church in  Juarez and her school in El  Paso as a devout Catholic and a hardworking mother Her  husband toiled in a maquiladora  one of the lowpaying free trade factories in Juarez Her friends her priest her coworkers all  declared that it was impossible that Miss Ana was a drug smuggler Yet the case against her was strong  Shed been caught redhanded with 100 pounds of pot in her trunk Mexican  prosecutors ratcheted up the charges against her from possession of marijuana to  intent to export narcotics Unknown to Martinez on the US side of the bridge FBI agents were closing in on a marijuanasmuggling  ring they say was headed by two men  Jesus Chavez and Carlos Gomez An FBI spokesman in El  Paso Texas declined to discuss the case because its ongoing  but a criminal complaint filed in US District Court details the investigation Eight days after Martinez was arrested an FBI informant wearing a wire met  with Gomez at the Shogun Steakhouse in El Paso According to a transcript of the  recording filed in federal court Gomez acknowledged planting the marijuana in  Martinezs car  And he worried about all the publicity her case was attracting We made such a  f    ing mess Gomez said On the FBIs recording Gomez said  hed been tracking Martinez for almost a year and her commute was  ideal Shes like a clock boss Boomboomboom  Always The alleged smugglers knew her  routine  where she lived where she worked They referred to her as the  teacher They knew her face Gomez even commented at one point She was kind  of cute A CrossBorder  Scheme But across the border in Juarez  Martinez  remained held without bail at the local jail In the beginning it was very  scary Martinez  says When I got there the only information I had about the jail was what  you see on TV movies You see that when you get there its all about  violence To pass the time she started  offering English classes to other inmates A few miles away across the  Rio Grande the  FBI determined that Chavez and Gomez were using lookouts to monitor the  SENTRI Express  Lane at the border The lookouts identified targets   people with regular commutes who primarily drove Ford vehicles According to  the FBI affidavit the smugglers would follow their targets and get the vehicle  identification number off the cars dashboard Then a corrupt locksmith with  access to Fords vehicle database would make a duplicate  key Keys in hand the gang would put  drugs in a car at night in Mexico and then pick up their shipment from the  parked vehicle the next morning in Texas authorities  say Martinez had been in jail for more than a  month and it looked like she might remain there for years Then FBI agents  filed a criminal complaint in US District Court detailing exactly how they  say Chavez and Gomez were targeting  SENTRI pass holders All charges against Martinez were dropped She  calls it a miracle The FBI has documented four other  cases of crossborder commuters who were found recently with black duffel bags  of marijuana in their trunks All of the duffel bags were similar Each bag  contained roughly 50 pounds of packaged pot All the drivers said they had no  idea how the marijuana got into their cars Officials with US Customs and  Border Patrol say they arent making any changes to the SENTRI pass program as a  result of this smuggling scheme  They do however remind users that the  program is not a free pass across the border and all vehicles coming into the  US remain subject to  search Copyright 2014 NPR,20110721,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/07/20/138467156/project-nim-a-chimps-very-human-very-sad-life?ft=3&f=,In 1973 an infant chimpanzee was taken from his mothers arms and sent to live with a human family as part of a Columbia University psychology experimentThe goal of the project was to see if the animal named Nim Chimpsky could be conditioned to communicate with humans if he was raised like a human child in a human household He learned some very basic words in American Sign Language but Nim continued to act like a chimp  he bit the children in the house and didnt understand how to behave like a human child It was decided that the family could no longer care for Nim and he was shuffled from caretaker to caretaker for several yearsIn 1977 Nim attacked one of the people taking care of him and the experiment ended At that point researchers said he knew more than 125 ASL signs  but no one knew quite what to do with Nim He was sent to a medical research facility where he lived in a cage with other chimps for the first time in his life before being rescued and sent to an animal sanctuary He died in 2000Nim and the many people who raised him over the years are the subjects of James Marshs new documentary Project Nim Marsh and two of the people who worked with Nim join Fresh Airs Terry Gross for a discussion about the film and about the controversial experimentThe premise of the experiment was to treat him as much like a human child as possible and to give him the nurturing of a human child in order to see if he would behave like one Marsh says And it was quite striking that there wasnt an investigation into what chimpanzees actually were or what theyre like And the wild animal comes out in him very quickly and no one was prepared for thatJenny Lee He Was Just Included In The FamilyThe first family to take Nim in lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in a giant brownstone Jenny Lee who was 13 years old at the time remembers her mom Stephanie LaFarge raising Nim alongside her and her siblings She says her mother grew quite attached to the chimp even breastfeeding him throughout his stay at their houseHe needed diapers he needed bottles he needed feedings Lee recalls And it was odd he was a chimp But at the same time there was kind of a normalcy about it in that he was just included in the family right awayWhile Jenny and her siblings went to school Nim learned sign language with researchers at Columbia  University The goal was to open up a window into Nims thoughts and to see if he could develop real language skills When he came home each night Nim would play with the Lee children and mimic their behavior But as he aged he became more aggressive  and no one knew what to doIt was really the biting that became the big problem after maybe he was a year old because its painful and it can draw blood Lee says and with human babies you can teach them not to do that And that was not something that Nim was able to learn to really controlNim left the familys house and moved in with a series of caretakers before going to a primate facility on the grounds of the University of OklahomaBob Ingersoll Keeping Chimpanzees In Cages Is TortureBob Ingersoll a graduate student at the University of Oklahoma was working as a research assistant at the primate facility and met Nim on his first dayYou could read fear and apprehension through his facial expression and his body language Ingersoll says It was very distressing to him and  we were really worried about Nim and we spent quite a lot of time with him making sure he was eating and drinking and not being picked on by the other chimpsIngersoll immediately began using sign language with Nim to comfort him He says the chimp was never aggressive around him  and quickly became one of his good friendsIt was easy to hang out with him he says He did for me the same thing that I think that I did for him which was make him feel comfortable and certain and familiar with the situationWhile taking long walks around the grounds of the primate facility Ingersoll occasionally smoked pot with Nim who had been introduced to marijuana in New   York City and even appeared in the magazine High Times in 1975He actually signed stone smoke time now to us first Ingersoll says We were shocked Although we were familiar with chimpanzees that did things like drinking and smoke cigarettes and that sort of thing Id never had a chimpanzee request weed from me That was an eyeopenerIngersoll and Nim spent much of their time together until Nim was once again moved this time to a medical research laboratory Ingersoll later helped rescue Nim from the research facility and the chimp was moved to a ranch for abused animalsWhat he needed at that point was to be with other chimps Ingersoll says Chimps dont need to be with humans They need to have a chimp life So my own personal need to hang out with Nim or walk with Nim wasnt as important to me as doing the right thing for Nim  Chimpanzees in captivity is just not where they ought to be  I would hope that one of the lessons that we learned from Nims life is that keeping chimpanzees in cages is torture and really plays havoc on their mental health

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/07/06/137445310/spillover-violence-from-mexico-a-trickle-or-flood?ft=3&f=,Note This is the second of a twopart series The Obama administration asserts that as a result of its twoyear  Southwest Border Initiative the southern boundary has never been more secure But Texas state officials and some border ranchers disagree theyve been saying that the violence in Mexico is spilling over and the president is not protecting the homeland Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano weighed in earlier this year It is inaccurate to state as too many have that the United States side of the border is overrun with violence or out of control she said Hundreds Cross Not All Make It Earlier this year the Government Accountability Office issued a report that the US Border Patrol has achieved operational control of 44 percent of the southern border Its mission to bring the entire border under control is hindered by difficult terrain lack of roads and a need to prioritize hot spots on the western border What that means is that basically everything downstream of El Paso Texas is under less control Thats no surprise to Mike Vickers who has a ranch not too far from the border From his fourwheeler the whitehaired rancher notices with concern a flock of buzzards perched in an oak tree He knows what that can mean Hundreds of illegal immigrants  and the occasional drug trafficker  cross his ranch every year going north And some dont make it Vickers is a veterinarian cattleman and agitator For at least six years hes been telling anyone wholl listen that the border remains porous His ranch straddles a busy smuggling corridor in Brooks County 70 miles north of the Rio Grande He says he frequently finds the bodies of immigrants who were abandoned by their smugglers and perished in these hot dry thorny pastures These people are being left out here to die Vickers says Its a horrible death getting cramped up going down maybe even have wild animals out here finish you off  And most of these people are within 15 or 20 minutes of where were sitting right here So were tired of it Were fed up with it And for President Obama to go to El Paso and say that the border is secure I just cant understand that So were here to say otherwise Horror Stories Of Spillover Violence Abound Some of the grim stories are real  like the bodies that turn up on Mike Vickers ranch Or the tattooed young men who are spotted hiking through ranchland with backpacks full of marijuana But some of the stories are imaginary a product of the fear that has taken root in the border country Consider the barbarous news streaming out of Mexico  like the cartel that held a fiesta and hung its enemies like piatas and beat them to death for pleasure Its the type of spillover violence that Texans expect and dread any day Freddy Longoria is a ranch foreman on a South Texas ranch His boss asked NPR not to name it What I heard is that they had killed a lady on the Old Mines Road going towards Laredo over like a retaliation he says They beheaded her I mean they cut her head off Other stories include an oilfield worker attacked and decapitated by immigrants who wanted his pickup and a ranch outside of Laredo taken over by mafiosos from the Zetas cartel These are three of the rumors you hear in the cafes and taquerias of South Texas these days Law enforcement says every one of them is false Nevertheless they have an effect Longoria  with the lanky grace of a cowboy  leans against his pickup and watches a herd of bison feeding and grunting contentedly You hear a lot of stories out here Some of those sometimes they hit too close to home he says You get worried you get a little bit paranoid you start carrying a gun and taking more precautions Spillover Hard To Define The challenge is how to define spillover violence The federal government says spillover must be drugrelated violence that targets innocent civilians or law enforcement on US soil But others think thats too narrow They think spillover should include any traffickerontrafficker violence in the US that originates with Mexican organized crime El Paso has had incidents Twice bullets from shootouts in Juarez flew across the Rio Grande and struck public buildings in El Paso And in 2009 a trafficker who lives in Horizon City Texas a suburb of El Paso lost his shipment to Border Patrol agents Afterwards cartel hitmen kidnapped him from his home took him to Juarez and executed him El Paso Mayor John Cook acknowledges that this was spillover violence but he says this type of crime is rare This drug war now has lasted for three years and you have one case of spillover violence that we can clearly identify in a city of 800000 people Cook says Study No Violent Crime Increase In US From Cartels Across from Tamaulipas Mexico where the Mexican cartel war is raging lies the Rio Grande Valley sector of the US Border Patrol where Rosendo Hinojosa is the chief agent Are we seeing the level of violence in the immediate border area that were seeing south of the border Absolutely not Hinojosa says Were not seeing carteloncartel violence here in the US that Im aware of Were not seeing the 40mm grenade launcher in downtown cities like in Mexico Our job is to make sure that type of activity doesnt come into the US Hinojosa acknowledges the border is more growing more dangerous for his nearly 2500 agents But are we seeing it out of control are we seeing a shooting every week Absolutely not he says Last year the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service CRS took up the question of whether mayhem is spilling over from Mexicos cartel war It examined the FBIs violent crime rates in all 230 US cities where investigators say Mexican cartels have infiltrated  from Del Rio Texas to Liberal Kan to Kalamazoo Mich In all 230 cartel distribution hubs CRS concluded there has been no statistical increase in violent crime Spillover The Flavor Of The Month Lupe Trevino is the elected sheriff for Hidalgo County Texas His office is what youd expect from a South Texas sheriff  deer heads on the wall guns under glass a rattlesnake in amber on his desk Hes been a border lawman for 25 years The Texas Department of Public Safety  which says spillover violence is plaguing South Texas  reports that in the first five months of 2011 there were 22 murders 24 assaults 15 shootings and five kidnappings And a third of them occurred in Sheriff Trevinos county of Hidalgo The question you should be asking me is this Is the border under control No its not Because if it was under control it would be completely sealed there would be absolutely no smuggling whatsoever either north or southbound Trevino says Trevino is friendly to the Obama administration He sits on a task force that reports to Secretary Napolitano So we ask Even if the border isnt secure is it like the Wild West We have always had drug violence anywhere in the United States because that is the nature of the business he says If we had the time we could go back to the archives and I can show you dozens of drug related murders that occurred prior to 2007 2008 Now was that spillover back then You know why its spillover now Because that is the flavor of the month Nevertheless the Obama administration has extended the deployment of 1200 National Guard on the border to help stem the illegal flow of people and drugs This story was produced for broadcast by Marisa Pealoza Copyright 2014 NPR,20120807,marijuana

Americans  patriotism  and leave others feeling  cheated From Connecticut to California new regulations to be enacted on  July 1 when most states begin a new fiscal year will change how people live in  ways big  Illinois is repealing its death penalty law  and small  California is mandating carbon monoxide detectors While each state has distinct needs legislation approved  across the nation addresses many of the same issues such as budget shortfalls  immigration voter eligibility health care and workers  rights In this nascent economic recovery  many states found ways to raise revenue without taking the politically suicidal  step of raising taxes So people may not see more money removed from their  paychecks but they will shell out more at the cash register in the form of  higher sales taxes For instance Connecticut residents will be taxed on yoga  sessions manicures and even valet parking Unlike other states Connecticut didnt flinch  in imposing the largest tax increase in state  history The key issue has been money and  budgets Everybody is dealing with that says William Pound executive director of  the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures It has been  through reductions or increases in fees Like raising tuition at higher  education institutions or fees at state parks Were putting more of the cost  of the service on the individual using it rather than on the taxpaying public at  large Immigration was another common  target More than 1500 related bills and resolutions were introduced in state  legislatures this year according to the National Conference of State Legislatures  By the end of March 26 states had enacted 63 laws addressing the education and  employment of illegal immigrants human trafficking or enforcement of existing laws Heres a sampling of new laws taking effect Friday Immigration  Crackdowns And Expansions  Job candidates in  Georgia now face felony charges for  submitting false information and documents to potential employers Thats the only major  provision in the new state law that takes effect Friday The other provisions  which include allowing local police to verify a suspects immigration status and  detain them are under temporary injunction by a federal judge as part of a lawsuit aimed  at overturning the law On Sept 1 a similar law takes  effect in Alabama That states version is regarded as  the strictest in the nation in part because it requires public schools to  determine the immigration status of pupils On the other side of the immigration  divide Illinois will enact its version of the DREAM  Act Development Relief and Education for Alien Minors becoming the first  state to establish a private scholarship fund for the children of illegal immigrants And in Connecticut illegal immigrants who are high school graduates will be eligible for instate tuition at state colleges A  similar law passed in Maryland and was scheduled to take effect  Friday but likely wont because of an ongoing petition drive aimed at forcing a  voter referendum to overturn it Both laws require students to be on a path to  gaining legal status Digital Donts  Gabbing Bullying And Sexting Connecticut raised fines for talking on a cellphone and texting while driving A first offense will cost 125 up from 100 a  second offense between 150 and 250 and future citations could reach 400 Connecticut also banned school bullying both  in person and virtually via the Internet and digital  devices Florida eased punishments for minors caught  sexting the practice of sending lewd photos via text message The law aimed  at protecting children from prosecution for more serious crimes such as child  pornography imposes a 60 fine or eight hours of community service for  firsttime offenders A second violation is a firstdegree  misdemeanor Dead  People Do Vote  Others Must Show  ID In Virginia if you send in  an absentee ballot but die before Election Day your vote still will be  counted In Oklahoma voters

and no jail time In Virginia patrons may be  allowed to bring their own wine to restaurants The law is voluntary leaving  the decision up to the individual restaurant Establishments can also charge a

MEXICO CITY  When the UN Office on Drugs and Crime UNODC releases its annual status report on the narcotics trade later this month it will almost certainly show a decrease in the volume of cocaine traveling through Mexico into the United States Last years report did too  a 40 percent drop in seizures between 2006 and 2008 Worldwide the cocaine market today is worth about half as much as it was just 15 years ago  88 billion compared with 165 billion in 1995 This would be excellent news  if it werent for some alarming trends going in the other direction As the cocaine trade through Mexico has fallen dramatically the violence here has risen remarkably Whereas 2006 saw just over 2000 deaths attributed to drug violence in 2010 there were an estimated 11000 such killings according to data from Stratfor and local press accounts Ciudad Juarez a border city of approximately 2 million at the center of the ongoing violence has seen a particularly sharp spike In 2001 there were just 16 murders for every 100000 Ciudad Juarez residents In 2010 that number reached 93  an increase of nearly sixfold  according to the Mexican Commission for the Defense and Promotion of Human Rights In other words the war on drugs may be taking its toll on the narcotics trade but it hasnt done anything to end the violence  a stubborn fact that runs counter to an emerging consensus about the drug war Across Latin America intellectuals scholars and even policymakers are increasingly arguing that there is just one thing that can bring an end to the narcotroubles the decriminalization of the drug trade in the United States Legalize and regulate use proponents argue and prices would drop and the illicit trade would disappear overnight Cartels would be starved of their piece of the global illicit drug pie which the UNODC has estimated at some 320 billion per year But would legalization really work With each day that passes it looks like it wouldnt be enough for one overarching reason The cartels are becoming less like traffickers and more like mafias Their currency is no longer just cocaine methamphetamines or heroin though they earn revenue from each of these products As they have grown in size and ambition like so many big multinational corporations they have diversified The cartels are now active in all types of illicit markets not just drugs Mexico is experiencing a change with the emergence of criminal organizations that rather than being productoriented  drug trafficking  are territorial based says Antonio Mazzitelli head of the UNODC office in Mexico City They now specialize in running protection rackets of all kinds he says which might explain why the violence has gotten so bad Mafias enforce their territorial control by force killing anyone who resists or gets in the way Before we had organized crime but operating strictly in narcotrafficking adds Eduardo Guerrero Gutierrez a consultant and former advisor to the Mexican presidency Now we have a type of mafia violence  and they are extorting from the people at levels that are incredibly high  from the rich from businesses For this reason Mazzitelli says legalization would have little effect Cartels such as the Zetas and La Familia long categorized as drugtrafficking organizations have transformed themselves into territorial overlords With distinctive zones of influence complex organizations and a wealth of manpower on which to draw they act as shadow governments in the areas they control collecting taxes on local establishments and taking a cut of the profits from illegal immigration to the United States This fight is not solely or primarily to stop drug trafficking Mexican President Felipe Calderon told the US Congress in May 2010 The aim is to ensure the safety of Mexican families who are under threat of abuse and wanton acts of criminals The cartels expansion may have begun through their everyday narcotrafficking work  namely through money laundering one of the most discussed topics in Mexican politics today Once upon a time this was quite easy to do cartels could wire the money in convoluted ways or open new accounts to which individuals would report earnings from businesses that existed only on paper But as the government cracked down in recent years the cartels got more creative In June 2010 Mexican authorities put strict limits on how much cash any individual could deposit into a bank on any given day or in any given month They also limited the amount of cash one could use to buy things like airplanes or cars So the cartels started engaging in actual trade which helps them launder their drug profits explains Shannon ONeil a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington They buy consumer goods such as televisions and perfumes in the United States and sell them on the Mexican side at a loss The revenues are clean money And as a bonus the cartels have a network of vendors ready and willing to sell illicit goods Other markets are entirely separate from the narcotics business Perhaps the most dramatic example is oil one of Mexicos largest exports and increasingly a vehicle for illicit trade On June 1 the countrys national oil company Pemex filed a lawsuit accusing nine US companies of colluding with criminals linked to the drug trade to sell as estimated 300 million worth of stolen oil since 2006 Thats an amount equal to the entire cocaine market in Mexico says UNODCs Mazzitelli In other words if the cocaine trade dried up the cartels would still have access to an equally large source of revenue Equally troubling is the firearms trade which has a direct link both to the violence and to the sustainment of the criminal organizations working across this country of 107 million There are no reliable estimates of just how big this market is but according to a recent US Senate investigation some 87 percent of the weapons used by the cartels are sourced from the United States If this were Southeast Asia theyd be bombing the gun stores in Arizona as if thats the Ho Chi Minh trail says Ted Lewis head of the human rights program at Global Exchange Mexicos cartels have also infiltrated the government and security forces though primarily at a local level Just going by all the reports  academic and media  we could safely assume that all municipal police departments are infiltrated argues Walter McKay a security consultant who has spent the last three years working in Mexico But its not just the police We focus on police and police corruption but the entire apple is rotten In the latest example of how high the rot goes the exmayor of Tijuana Jorge Hank Rhon was recently arrested for gunrunning and alleged links to organized crime Then there is the cartels sheer size An estimated 468000 people worked in the drug trade in 2008 making the cartels collectively among the biggest industries in Mexico By comparison the state oil company the largest firm in Mexico has about 360000 employees The cartels also now outnumber the police estimated at just over 400000 personnel nationwide in 2010 The corruption and weakness of the police explains why over the last halfdecade Calderon has deployed 50000 troops across the country to decapitate the cartels leadership and reclaim their territory block by block Take away a criminal organizations leadership and turf the thinking goes and you also rob it of the ability to control just about every market  not just the narcotics trade Just on Tuesday June 21 the government apprehended Jose de Jesus El Chango Mendez leader of the socalled Knights Templar cartel Calderon quickly touted the arrest as a coup by the federal police against organized crime on Twitter Yet critics of the governments strategy say it has been far too militarized Violence has increased every year since the drug war began and many civil society groups here accuse the national security forces of hurting as many civilians as they do actual criminals And even success risks a balloon effect as a cartel squeezed in one location will almost inevitably pop up elsewhere This effect is already painfully visible in Latin America as a whole with Mexican cartels such as the Zetas moving into Guatemala and overwhelming the muchweaker state Many activists are thus calling for a completely new approach Silvano Cantu a researcher at the Mexican Commission for the Defense and Promotion of Human Rights argues that Mexico needs to think bigger than trying to win back its turf city by city We need to be talking to everyone he says mentioning the United States Colombia Europe and anywhere they clean money and buy arms The government too is frustrated with the guns cutting down on the sale in the United   States is one of the Calderon administrations key demands The legalizers a group that includes former heads of state from Brazil Colombia and Mexico largely agree with this comprehensive approach Trying to cut supply without cutting demand is a losing game they argue The global war on drugs has failed with devastating consequences for individuals and societies around the world they wrote in the most recent report of the Global Commission on Drug Policy an independent panel that has called for a dramatic rethinking of the drug war Their recommendations call for the normalization of drugs that is legalization of possession linked with publichealth regulation including cocaine That would almost certainly hurt the cartels but it probably wouldnt be enough counters Mazzitelli of the UNODC Legalization is a fake solution to the problem of security he argues citing a 2010 Rand Corp report that found that legalizing marijuana in California would cut cartel profits by just 2 to 4 percent If it does come legalization is also quite a ways off  and Mexicos crisis is happening now Only about half of US citizens polled last year by Gallup supported legalizing marijuana the least lucrative and arguably the least dangerous drug entering the country from Mexico If legalization is out and sending in the Army doesnt work whats left Among the most popular alternative ideas floating around Mexican civil society is that of creating citizen security  empowering local communities to resist organized crime That means not only improving policing but also reintroducing the state in other ways through education economic opportunity and a judicial system that investigates and punishes crime explains Edgar Cortez a researcher for the Mexican Institute of Human Rights and Democracy The broken justice system is unquestionably part of the problem Mexico has a poor record of holding criminals to account for all manner of improper activity  from trafficking to homicide to regular old theft You have all these arrests and more than 40000 deaths but we dont have anybody arrested and investigated successfully says McKay the security consultant Most police departments in the United States and Canada he notes have an 80 to 90 percent solve rate of finding the alleged perpetrator In Mexico its almost zero Its no coincidence that crime rates of almost every kind are up according to the Mexican governments own data Extortion bank robbery kidnapping and armed robbery have all risen dramatically since 2006 The sheer amount of progress needed to stop the cartels is daunting But Cantu the human rights researcher chooses to remain optimistic We have to put forward alternative options he argues We have to call upon the people to have hope Copyright 2014 Foreign Policy,20110623,marijuana

chorus of opposition to the senseless war on drugs has become so appalling that you almost start thinking Cornel West was right About Obamas supposed lack of interest in black concerns that is I know thats not actually the problem the president has to prioritize With the economy such as it is and the three wars we are waging abroad such as they are its not surprising that Obama has not taken on the politically fraught task of truly ending the New Prohibition I have written that Obama should get to the war on drugs in his second term But that was two years ago now there are preliminaries positions possibilities to be investigated So far Obama refuses to make even a pretense Its gotten this bad On Tuesday representatives of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition sought a hearing with Obamas drug czar Gil Kerlikowske who has refused repeated requests for even a simple sitdown LEAP includes officers judges prosecutors agents and military officers united in the conclusion that the war on drugs has been a failure and all they wanted was to put in Kerlikowskes hands their new report on the issue Kerlikowske wouldnt even appear instead sending down a skittish aide Just look at how the encounter played out in this photo of LEAPs executive director Neill Franklin on the left with the aide in question Serious people with a serious concern seek a bit of face time with the administration devoted to change we can believe in and they get treated as if theyre a bunch of 11yearolds agitating for one more Harry Potter movie Kerlikowske has actually claimed that the Obama administration has ended the war on drugs  but what he means is that they have decided not to call it that This is mere semantics of the it depends on what is is kind Obama has said We have to think more about drugs as a public health problem but under his watch punishment for drug possession and use has been funded more highly while funds for treatment under the Department of Education have been slashed by a third It gets worse Drug arrests during Obamas first year in office were higher than they were in George Bushs first year There have been about 100 marijuana raids under the Obama administration so far while during all eight of the Bush years there were only about 200 If there is any through line from Obamas speech at Chicagos Grant Park to this Im having trouble gleaning it The Obama folks are so grievously behind the curve on the war on drugs that their approach will look as tacky and antique in the history books as Herbert Hoovers support for Prohibition as an experiment noble in purpose Sixtyseven percent of our nations police chiefs consider the war on drugs a failure The Global Commission on Drug Policy declared the same thing and we assume that folks like Kofi Annan George Schultz and Paul Volcker must be on to something In response to them the Obama folks trotted out statistics showing that drug use has declined some since the 1970s How nice  but at what cost Surely Obama Kerlikowske and Attorney General Eric Holder dont think that the massive uptick in incarceration the hideous disproportion of black men subjected to it and the destruction of black communities in the wake of that incarceration rate have been a mere matter of the eggs one must crack to make an omelet Truly  they simply cannot think this and do not Yet Holder when asked recently whether he thought ending the war on drugs would cut down on the deaths of police officers mumbled I dont think thats right   and walked away watch that one here This willful lack of attention to such an urgent problem is one of the few ways in which the Obama administration seems callous at this point Not to mention just plain fake The Hoobama analogy goes further Hoover privately liked a postwork drink and had previously cultivated a wine cellar meanwhile LEAPs report properly notes The Obama administration like at least the two that preceded it is led by people who used illicit drugs and went on to have productive lives It is a source of great shame that none of these presidents took real steps to end a policy which if fairly administered would likely have prevented them from entering politics in the first place Put it this way Obama could get people like West off his back and be a meaningfully problack president  not to mention a bracingly prohuman one  by addressing the war on drugs for real No more lip service such as Holders dutifully hoping for another season of The Wire despite his apparent lack of interest in actually putting to use the shows lessons about the drug war The Wires creator David Simon hit the bullseye in saying that he and cocreator Ed Burns would be happy to launch a new Wire season if the Obama administration would get real about the war on drugs We should let President Obama know that the time has come in large numbers Over the past week more than 2500 people have sent letters to him about the drug war through LEAPs

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/06/15/137202798/planned-texas-execution-has-mexico-up-in-arms?ft=3&f=,A planned execution in Texas has the state at odds with the federal government and the International Court of Justice The dispute involves Humberto Leal Jr a Mexican national who was convicted of murder and sentenced to death When he was arrested Leal was not informed of his right to notify his embassy or consulate Mexico cried foul the International Court of Justice agreed and the US government asked Texas to review the case But the state has refused and plans to execute Leal in three weeks The Case On the night of May 21 1994 16yearold Adria Sauceda attended a party on the south side of San Antonio Witnesses testified that the teenager ingested so much alcohol cocaine and marijuana she became extremely intoxicated A group of eight or nine young men took her into the backyard and took turns sexually assaulting her Anyone who tried to intervene was told to back off Sandra Babcock Leals lawyer and a professor at Northwestern University  Law School says when Leal arrived at the party and learned what happened to Sauceda he became very upset and said that he was going to take her home Leal says that on the ride home Sauceda tried to get out of the car Leal pulled over she got out he tried to get her back in they argued he pushed her and she hit her head But Leal maintains he didnt kidnap her and he didnt rape her And thats the crux of his defense because without those additional crimes Leal would not have faced a capital murder charge and a death penalty conviction So although there was evidence that he was with her before she died  and that he may have had some involvement in her death  the evidence that shows that he committed a sexual assault is reed thin and the evidence that shows that he kidnapped her is even weaker Babcock says Babcock accuses the public defenders assigned to defend Leal of putting on a lazy defense And that particularly galls the government of Mexico All parties agree that Leal a Mexican national in Texas legally should have been told he had a right to notify his consulate in San Antonio The Mexican government says had it known it would have paid for Leal to have topflight legal representation investigators and experts to assist his defense Mexico has a longstanding tradition  internationally recognized tradition  about assisting their nationals says Victor Uribe head of the legal section at the Mexican Embassy in Washington DC Of course due to the opposition of Mexico to the death penalty capital cases are a priority for Mexico Texas Has Been Resistant In Complying Including Leal there are 51 Mexican nationals on death row in the US who were never informed of their rights In frustration Mexico took these cases to the International Court of Justice in The Hague In 2004 the court ruled that the US had violated its treaty obligations and ordered the US to review these cases to see if the violation had prejudiced the mens defenses Its not a favor that we do for foreigners who travel in the United States The United States is a party to this treaty because it protects Americans when we travel abroad says John Bellinger a partner at Arnold  Porter in Washington Bellinger is the former legal adviser at the State Department who handled these cases for the Bush administration To the surprise of both conservatives and liberals President Bush was persuaded by this State Departments argument and ordered states to review their foreign national cases But Texas Gov Rick Perry said no and to the Bush administrations chagrin the Republican governor challenged his predecessor in federal court  and won Texas has been particularly resistant to complying I think Texas and the governor have tended to think this is a question of bowing to pressure from Washington or protecting the sovereignty of Texas from international tribunals in The Hague Bellinger says Although Perry the state attorney generals office and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles all declined to speak to NPR Perrys staff in the past has said The world court has no standing in Texas and Texas is not bound by a ruling or edict from a foreign court Its very important to remember that these individuals are on death row for killing our citizens Texas has already executed two Mexican nationals who werent informed of their rights Now Leal is on deck to be put to death the first week of July Having witnessed the powerlessness of the International Court and the president of the United States to stop these executions Uribe at the Mexican Embassy says theyve appealed to the real power in all this Perry We are respectfully requesting him to exercise his legal power to suspend Mr Leals execution until his conviction and sentence are reviewed and reconsidered according to the decision of the ICJ Uribe says Leals time is running out His best hope probably lies in federal court His lawyer has filed a federal habeas petition asking the court to put Leals execution on hold long enough to give Congress time to consider legislation that would order the states including Texas to comply Democratic Sen Patrick Leahy of Vermont introduced the legislation Tuesday Copyright 2014 NPR,20110615,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/06/08/133272681/yemeni-photographer-turns-her-lens-on-the-west?ft=3&f=,I clicked on Amira AlSharifs video a couple of months ago while surfing the Web for inspiration Her story was featured on a website called Kickstarter  a site where pretty much anyone can make a video plea to get his quirky personal projects funded On the video she says Im looking for your support during my year in America My project will be documenting the lives of American women my age and to compare and contrast them with the lives of Yemeni young women AlSharif 28 was born in Saudi  Arabia and grew up in Yemen She was the first person from her family who graduated from a university And in the US she was turning her camera lens on us Thats why I wanted to meet her  I liked the idea of a Middle Eastern journalist flipping the script It seems like its always the other way around Western journalists documenting Arab women Shes already been pushing the boundaries that were around her  and that was one of the reasons why we thought she was such a great candidate to bring to the States says Stephanie Sinclair an American photojournalist who has been documenting childmarriage issues for the past eight years AlSharif was her interpreter in Yemen She has that thing that you cant give people You cant ever teach people how to get along with people How to make them trust you  and she has that innately Sinclair says Being Bold In Tompkins Square Park Sinclair was inspired by AlSharifs guts and raw talent So she found a way to bring her to the International Center of Photography in New York City And thats where I met AlSharif nine months ago Were in the East Village making our way to Tompkins Square  Park so AlSharif can take pictures for one of her first assignments Shes wearing sneakers a flowing longsleeve shirt over jeans and a pretty silk scarf over her hair This is not her usual outdoor attire in Yemen  shes usually wearing a figureconcealing black abaya and a face veil called a niqab that has a narrow opening for the eyes People think the girl who wear niqab  she cant do whatever she wants And if its like this why am I here If I cant do anything she says And really there are a lot of women in Yemen nobody know about them Nobody knows how much they are strong how much they have fighting spirit AlSharif has only been in the US for a few weeks at this point but she is bold The first time she took photos in New York was on a Sept 11 anniversary  and she was wearing her hijab At Tompkins  Square Park theres a free punkrock show going on and AlSharif has found her subject in the crowd a 38yearold park regular Matt Logan The guy is the visual stereotype of hard living complete with face tattoos and not the artsy kind We spent most of that first day with Logan AlSharif asked him about living away from home getting arrested and doing drugs What do you feel when you smoke marijuana she asks him I feel very relaxed and in tune and in touch with nature and everything surrounding me Logan says I feel like Im in sync with the universe AlSharif seems pretty fascinated with Logan Maybe its because his life is nothing like hers She may have a fighting spirit  but that fight can never be a fullon rebellion like Logans It comes down to family honor She never wants to embarrass her family to shame them And I feel that on our first visit She was very careful not to say anything that might be construed as criticism of her homeland or her culture You Cannot Disappear In Yemen Four months after that first encounter AlSharif is showing me some of her work at the International Center of Photography Shes struggling with her American Women photo project Her subjects disappear  theyll stop calling or texting her back I think its the difference Yemen is more like families and groups  you cannot disappear she says You should have tribes like us AlSharif has had the most luck with her subject Anna Shes a 24yearold Brooklynite whose hobbies include fire dancing Although Annas not a member of a tribe in that Yemeni sense she surrounds herself with a group of freespirited musicians and artists And she has allowed AlSharif full access to her world She invited me to go with her for her Thanksgiving in Massachusetts Its like every day in Yemen Every day in Yemen is Thanksgiving She showed me her favorite photo from that trip A shot of Anna her nieces and her grandparents all hanging out on a double bed AlSharif liked it so much she emailed it to her family and friends in Yemen They were like ah  American people are life like this  more individual  live alone something nice because its more like Yemen AlSharif is drawn to the traits in her subjects that remind her of home And thats where she wants to make it as a photojournalist  a Yemeni documenting Yemen I realized that people here they dont know where is Yemen she says I really would love American people to know Yemen To understand more about women issues in Yemen Im being here as a body but my spirit is there AlSharif is looking forward to catching up with her spirit in Yemen when her program at the ICP is finished in June Shes hoping her country makes the transition from dictatorship to democracy and that shes there to capture it This is Yemen history she says The people want to live free I really need to be there Copyright 2014

little tempted to turn off our brains Dont do it Summer reading  in this case summer reading about the science of the mind  can be a lot more fun than dodging volleyballs on a beach Neuroscience isnt just about parts of the brain and hardtopronounce chemicals the books listed here cover everything from religion to pornography from diehard optimists to remorseless sociopaths Sure theres a lot of knowledge to be mined in these volumes but most importantly theyre all fast fun reads As subject matter the brain it turns out makes for the ultimate pageturner and science dont tell my high school bio teacher I said this the epitome of coolThe Compass Of Pleasure How Our Brains Make Fatty Foods Orgasm Exercise Marijuana Generosity Vodka Learning And Gambling Feel So GoodBy David J Linden hardcover 240 pages Viking list price 2695Unless youre at the kind of cookout where words like amygdala and dopamine get tossed around instead of Frisbees youre probably not thinking too intently about whats going on in your medial forebrain pleasure circuit That might change if you read neuroscientist David J Lindens The Compass of Pleasure a hugely entertaining look at why we enjoy the things we enjoy Theyre not all vices either  your brain can be stimulated by sex and drugs but it also derives pleasure from working out and believe it or not paying your taxes Theres hardcore biology here but its tempered with personal anecdotes penetrating observations and quotes from the likes of comedian Mitch Hedberg and Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy If youre sciencephobic dont worry Linden is incredibly smart but comes across as the funny patient professor you wish youd had in collegeThe Believing Brain From Ghosts To Gods To Politics And Conspiracies  How We Construct Beliefs And Reinforce Them As TruthsBy Michael Shermer hardcover 400 pages Times Books list price 28Beliefs come first explanations for beliefs follow Thats the argument professional skeptic Michael Shermer makes in The Believing Brain a book that fuses neuroscience sociology and the authors own biographical stories into a compelling and sometimes deeply personal read  even if you dont agree with him on everything And you wontShermer a former evangelical Christian who became an agnostic in college now dedicates his sprawling career to debunking what he sees as superstitions and failures of logic from religion to alien abduction to Sept 11 conspiracy theories In this his 17th book he argues that supernatural beliefs are the product of our brains and that we arrive at those beliefs in spite of  not because of  scientific evidence Shermer is a convincing voice but hes not necessarily a hardliner  he points out that while the scientific method remains the best tool ever when it comes to deflating paranormal claims we must always remember that we could be wrongThe Psychopath Test A Journey Through The Madness IndustryBy Jon Ronson hardcover 288 pages Riverhead list price 2595When you think about relaxing summer reading studies of psychopaths probably dont pop into your mind At least we hope not But that shouldnt stop you from picking up Jon Ronsons The Psychopath Test The subject matter is yes disturbing but Ronsons book is one of the funniest and most entertaining of the year In its enjoyable pages the British journalist and author of The Men Who Stare at Goats goes in search of one of the worlds most enigmatic and frightening personality disorders He talks to psychiatrists a patient at a notorious English psychiatric hospital an exiled terrorist and a disgraced CEO One theory suggests that psychopaths who seem to lack a conscience do inordinately well in business Its unsettling stuff to be sure but Ronson is a charmingly selfdeprecating and remarkably charismatic author The bad news Scientists estimate that 1 percent of the population is psychopathic The good news A psychiatrist assures Ronson if youre worried you might be a psychopath youre almost certainly not oneThe Optimism Bias A Tour Of The Irrationally Positive BrainBy Tali Sharot hardcover 272 pages Pantheon list price 2595Even the most cheerful and upbeat among us might be tempted to bang our head against a wall if we are forced to hear Dont Worry Be Happy one more time But as Tali Sharot points out in her fascinating new book The Optimism Bias that stubbornly sunny attitude is not necessarily what optimism means Even if youre a dedicated cynic you might be surprised to learn that your brain is wearing rosecolored glasses whether you like it or notDrawing from biology and psychology  as well as from such unlikely sources as the Los Angeles Lakers Shirley Temple and Guinness stout  Londonbased scientist Sharot explains why the brains of most people are programmed to predict happy endings in all facets of our lives Hope isnt just a campaign slogan she argues its an instinct of selfpreservation What your irrepressibly chipper friends have been telling you is right studies show that optimists tend to live longer and pessimists die younger Optimism might just be your mind playing tricks on you but it turns out theres a good reason for thatA Billion Wicked Thoughts What The

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/06/06/136924131/herbal-relaxation-drinks-make-suspect-claims?ft=3&f=,Caffeineladen drinks and herbal pickmeups now keep many of us going through the day and well into the night But what happens when its time to relax unwind and even go to sleep Older insomniacs may reach for a glass of wine warm milk or some chamomile tea But the new relaxation rage is soda and brownies Relaxation drinks are sort of the initial backlash to the energy drink craze If Im nervous or if I am having a bad day I can just crack open a Mary Janes instead says Eric Shogren Shogren is the man behind the Californiabased Relaxing Company maker of Mary Janes relaxing soda  The soda is one of a handful of new herbal products aimed at chilling out todays stressedout consumer  If youre hyped up on too much caffeine jetlagged or work has you tense and anxious manufacturers claim their drinks can calm you down or help you fall asleep Herbs That Aim To Take The Edge Off The name Mary Janes he explains is a playful nod toward marijuana but the soda actually contains passion flower extract and kavakava   two legal herbal products the company claims have been shown to relax people and reduce anxiety Our products arent meant to make people tired or sleepy it just kind of takes the edge off a little bit if youre nervous or stressed out says Shogren Soft drinks waters and brownies containing  herbal supplements like passion flower kava valerian root rose hips melatonin and GABA are hitting shelves across the country With catchy phrases like unwind from the grind  slow your roll and tired of being wired these products claim to be the perfect antidote to a hectic lifestyle  In the words of one advertisement its safer than a glass of warm milk and more effective than counting sheep Taking Straight Herbs Vs Drinking Products With Herbs And with cool names like iChill Dream Water and Lazy Cakes  they are becoming increasingly popular  especially among teens and young adults The research on most of these herbal supplements is spotty and inconclusive explains Brent Bauer of the Mayo Clinics Complementary and Integrative Medicine program  Since herbs cant be patented and the FDA doesnt require companies to prove their claims with research or even standardize their ingredients there is no financial or legal incentive for them to do extensive science on their products But even where there is good evidence the herbs themselves do what the companies claim such as in the case of kava explains Bauer thats not necessarily the case once they have been baked or added to a soda So there is no question kava as a drink by itself can work  the question is can we take that information and then take a very small amount of that put it into a drink and see the same benefits  And I think this is where the science gets a little thin Bauer says There is no definitive scientific evidence that any of the products on the market create relaxation or induce sleep but theres no evidence they dont either   And what works for one person may not work for another   or be safe When you look at it very simplistically and think we can just dump things in a drink and then give it to many many different people without respect to their personal condition their own health issues what medications they are taking I think weve made a dangerous jump says Bauer What is perhaps more worrisome than an ineffective product say experts is an effective one  Its important that consumers realize any substance powerful enough to have real effects also carries real risks Caution Around Melatonin Because they are packaged like food some worry that consumers are more likely to treat them like food  not medicine  Ziad Shaman of Metro Health Medical Center in Cleveland says thats certainly the case for melatonin a hormone produced naturally in the body It is a drug  and I am repeating this  it is a drug  Just because it looks like a brownie doesnt mean its just a brownie says Shaman Shaman prescribes melatonin to patients in his sleep clinic and says it can be very effective  But he also cautions that it can have a host of side effects shouldnt be used while driving and can even be dangerous in children Most experts say children should not consume  these products unless a doctor approves them But melatonin and other herbal supplements have been available in pill form for decades so why is adding them to food and drinks suddenly all the rage Shaman says putting the herbs in sodas and brownies automatically targets them at teens and young adults who are more likely to be up late and have poor sleeping habits Bauer says marketing them as natural and healthful alternatives to other drugs adds to the appeal I think there is always this societal interest in trying to find something where we can get it for free In other words we want to find that nice herb that gives us an altered sense of reality but has no consequences and so I think thats where some of this advertising is coming from says Bauer Experts argue that although the drinks may be cool when it comes to your health good nutrition exercise proper sleep habits and stress management techniques are going to be more effective and have longer lasting results than herbal supplements in any form And as for that cup of chamomile tea Feel free to indulge   Its perfectly safe says Shaman who admits he occasionally enjoys a cup himself But theres no scientific evidence it will make you sleepy either Copyright 2014 NPR,20110606,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/06/01/136829224/el-salvador-fears-ties-between-cartels-street-gangs?ft=3&f=,Last of a threepart series Read Part 1 and Part 2The drug war in Mexico is having ramifications throughout the hemisphere as Mexican cartels seek new markets and smuggling routes for their productsAs the Mexican government has attacked the cartels several of them have been moving into Central America where security forces are illequipped to confront them The migration of the cartels into Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador has given the region the highest homicide rate in the hemisphereIn El Salvador theres fear that the Mexican cartels are aligning themselves with the countrys ubiquitous street gangsEl   Salvador has had a gang problem for quite some time The two main gangs  the 18th   Street and the Mara Salvatrucha or MS  are so powerful and so volatile that their members get sent to separate prisons Impoverished neighborhoods in the capital San Salvador are clearly divided as belonging either to the MS or to the 18th StreetThe gang members control streetlevel drug sales charge local residents for security and battle to keep their rivals outA Risky BusinessLuis Alberto Espinoza Aranda is a 23yearold gang member in San Salvador Tattoos on his shoulders reading 18 make his allegiance clear Its a tough life he says You suffer a lot of discrimination from the authorities and ordinary peopleEspinoza joined the 18th Street gang five years ago along with his two brothers Just as Espinoza was completing a oneyear prison term for murder his younger brother was sent away for drug traffickingIts a world where like in prison the authorities and everyone treats you like you dont have a right to anything just for the fact that youre a gang member Espinoza saysHe says the Mexican cartels have been moving aggressively into El Salvador over the past couple of years and that they mainly try to hire gang members to transport drugsThis is the riskiest thing  to move the drugs he says Selling it doesnt pose that much risk Youre just in one place But when youre moving it around in the streets this is when youre going to clash with the police or the soldiersEspinoza like many gang members also has a regular job  he and his mother sell tostadas from a stand in the street Hed like to get out of the gang life he says but thats a difficult thing to do The 18th Street gang doesnt allow its members to leaveConnecting Street Gangs With CartelsThe Mexican drug cartels control roughly 90 percent of the cocaine flowing from South America into the US according to a 2010 State Department report Much of that cocaine comes through Central America As the Mexicans move south its led to huge cartel massacres in Guatemala a skyrocketing murder rate in Honduras and more drugs on the street in El SalvadorHoward Augusto Cotto the deputy director for investigation with the Salvadoran National Civilian Police says there have been some largescale seizures of drugs recently in El Salvador But he says there have been no firefights between the security forces and Mexican narcos like those that have unfolded for instance in neighboring GuatemalaThe Mexican cartels are not paying with money no theyre paying with drugs Cotto says A lot of people are talking about if the maras the gangs here are involved with criminal organizations in Mexico I dont think that in this moment that relationship is high or is strong but we are very concerned about thatThe police commissioner points out that the Salvadoran gangs and the Mexican cartels are very different organizations The Mexican cartels have relatively vertical structures focused on criminally lucrative activities The maras have horizontal structures and offer security to their members and a way to make some moneyThe maras could offer  and according to some security analysts already are offering  the Mexican cartels access to a vast criminal network The maras have stashes of weapons established communications networks and ruthless foot soldiers who have no qualms about smuggling drugs or assassinating rivals  for a priceBoth the 18th   Street gang and the Mara Salvatrucha originated on the streets of Los Angeles several decades ago Their presence grew in El  Salvador as members were deported from California US officials warn that an alliance between the Salvadoran gangs and the Mexicans could pose a great danger because the Salvadorans already control streetlevel drug distribution in some American citiesSelling Drugs Is For The Benefit Of EveryoneUsiel Pena a sociologist in San   Salvador is standing on a dirt path amid shacks made of cinder blocks and metal sheeting in the barrio La Victoria which is controlled by the Mara Salvatrucha or MSPena was a soldier with the leftist FMLN rebels during El Salvadors civil war As a guerrilla he was based in this crowded neighborhood He says the MS now controls this area the same way the FMLN did in the 1980sIts the same web the same structure as when the guerrillas were here Its the same neighborhood the same little old grandmother who prays for them he says with a laughThe smoke from cooking fires wafts through the air as does the pungent smell of marijuana Outhouses serve as toiletsThe second in command of the MS in La Victoria is a 33yearold who only wants to give his nickname BlueThe head of the MS here Triste is laying low after a couple of people were gunned down in the barrio the night before Blue says the MS only sells drugs to outsiders except marijuana which is permitted by the gangSelling drugs is for the benefit of everyone he says If someone sells drugs its because of all the needs of everyone in the community There are colleagues who dont have a mother or anything and only the gang helps them  no one elseProtecting The CiviliansWith his shirt covering his tattoos Blue looks more like an evangelical preacher than a leader in one of the most feared gangs in the hemisphere Hes wearing a shortsleeved beige buttondown shirt and black slacks His hair is neatly parted and swept across his brow Only his missing right arm which got blown off by a hand grenade hints at his violent careerBlue talks of the MS as a social organization that protects the civilians in the neighborhood They help get water lines connected Theyre refurbishing the community hall To him its normal that residents have to pay rent to the gang for these servicesHis clique of the MS doesnt yet work with the Mexican cartels but he says it would if the conditions were right Roughly half the members of the MS in El Salvador are in prison and Blue says its nearly impossible for them to find work when they get outThere are a lot of my colleagues who want to learn something have something function in a different way without bothering people constantly with extortion he saysBut for gang members in El Salvador Blue says there are few good options available And thats why theyre quite open to the arrival of the Mexican narcotics cartels Copyright 2014 NPR,20110602,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/05/16/136368744/in-warrantless-search-case-top-court-rules-for-police?ft=3&f=,The US Supreme Court has made it significantly easier for police to force  their way into a home without a warrant On Monday the court by an 81 vote  upheld  the warrantless search of an apartment after police smelled marijuana and feared  that those inside were destroying incriminating  evidenceThe Constitution bars warrantless searches except in  certain circumstances  for example when police fear that evidence of a crime is  being destroyed  The question in this case was whether police by themselves  creating such emergency  circumstances unconstitutionally evade the warrant requirementThe case came from Lexington Ky where police pursuing a drug suspect  banged on the door of an apartment where they thought they smelled marijuana After loudly identifying themselves police heard movement inside and  suspecting that evidence was being destroyed kicked in the door There they found Hollis  Deshaun King smoking marijuana  Police also found cocaine inside the  apartmentAs it turned out King was not the suspect  police had been looking for but the drug evidence in the apartment was more  than enough to charge him with multiple crimes King was  sentenced to 11 years in prisonBut the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the  drugs found in the apartment could not be used as evidence because the only  emergency circumstances were those created by the police loudly alerting those  inside The state court said that instead of banging on the door and letting  the inhabitants know the police  were there the police should have requested a warrant a procedure that usually takes  only a matter of minutesThe  US Supreme Court however disagreed with the state court The justices said that the Fourth Amendment bars unreasonable  searches and here the police acted reasonably Writing for the court majority  Justice Samuel Alito noted that when occupants respond to a police knock on the  door they are not required to grant police permission to enter their homes  But he said if there is no response and police hear movement inside that  suggests destruction of evidence they are justified in breaking inCriminal law experts said the ruling will undoubtedly lead to more  warrantless searches like this one In practice says George Washington University law  professor Stephen Saltzburg the decision means that whenever  the police have suspicion that there is drug activity going on in a particular  apartment or house and they knock and they hear movement inside and any  reasonable delay in opening the door they are going to break it inSaltzburg  author of a leading text on criminal law says the decision  resolves conflicting decisions in the lower courts It provides greater clarity  to the police as to what they are permitted to do and it provides less  protection for homes and apartments than a lot of people thought they had and  think they should have he saysPhilip Heymann former head of the US Justice  Departments Criminal Division and now a professor at Harvard Law School says the standard laid out in Mondays decision  will be very tempting for law enforcement officers to abuse  namely allowing  police to break in and search without a warrant when they knock on the door and  hear sounds suggesting destruction of evidence That is a very fuzzy  indeterminate easily faked  if the policeman wants to  test when drugs have  afterwards been found says HeymannAnd that says University of Chicago law professor  Bernard Harcourt will mean a different set of police imperatives  Once there  is probable cause to believe that there are drugs in a home  and in this case the  probable cause was the smell of marijuana emanating from the home  the police  no longer need to stop and think about whether they should get a  warrantThese and other  criminal law experts said that under Mondays ruling police could go  door to door in an apartment complex where there is known drug activity and if  they smell marijuana bang on the door and if they hear noises that suggest the  destruction of  incriminating evidence they can break in and seize evidence in  plain sightJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg the lone dissenter from the courts ruling accused the majority of arming the police with a way  routinely to dishonor the Fourth Amendments warrant requirement in drug  cases In lieu of presenting their evidence to a neutral magistrate she  said police officers may now knock listen then break the door down  never mind that they had ample time to obtain a  warrant Copyright 2014 NPR,20110516,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/05/12/136234581/new-republic-two-very-different-kinds-of-mormons?ft=3&f=,Matthew Bowman is a PhD candidate in American religious history at Georgetown University and associate editor of Dialogue A Journal of Mormon Thought He blogs about Mormon history at The Juvenile Instructor Jon Huntsman former governor of Utah ambassador to China and potential presidential contender used to play the keyboard in a prog rock cover band called Wizard In fact he dropped out of high school temporarily in favor of music practices in a warehouse on the outskirts of Salt Lake City The underground music scene of mid70s Salt Lake City was a bit tamer than most but Huntsman faithfully toured the citys bars fraternized with recreational marijuana users and grew a shaggy mane  until his nineteenth birthday when he got a haircut and left for Taiwan to serve a twoyear mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints For many presidential hopefuls such teenage escapades might be little more than an embarrassing aside but in Huntsmans case its a striking example of his deft ability to negotiate between his Mormonism and the world around it His coreligionist and fellow presidential contender Mitt Romney on the other hand has rarely displayed the same sense of ease On the campaign trail in 2008 Romney appeared nervous and awkward when confronted with questions about his faith often attempting to defuse the situation with a thudding joke about polygamy I believe marriage is between a man and a woman And a woman And a woman Although it was meant to seem selfdeprecating the gag only highlighted Romneys distinct awareness of his own otherness Huntsman is only 13 years younger than Mitt Romney but they are generations apart in temperament Romney trying on Huntsmans leather jackets and shades or hopping on one of his motorcycles would rightly make him look ridiculous But beyond mere differences of personality Romney and Huntsman also represent two very different strains of Mormonism While both men are the progeny of the same class of wealthy Mormon elite Huntsmans public life is born of a younger strain of Mormonism than is Mitt Romneys  a Mormonism increasingly welladapted to the boisterous diversity of early twentyfirst century America and perhaps because of that a Mormonism with which America is growing increasingly comfortable Romneys 2008 presidential bid was dogged with the sort of accusations and rhetoric flung at Mormons since the time of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young Mormonism according to its detractors was secretive authoritarian esoteric hierarchical and cultish Damon Linker in the pages of this magazine worried that the grim specter of Mormon ecclesiastical authoritarianism would render the potential president a puppet of his faith rather than an agent of democracy Opponent Mike Huckabee played the cult card engaging in a bit of fauxregretful public contemplation of the weird things Mormons believe And Florida televangelist Bill Keller for his part sent an email to 24 million fans declaring that a vote for Romney was a vote for Satan For Romney and many other Mormons Keller and Huckabees accusations were cruel distortions and Linkers baffling because they have never imagined their faith to be anything other than fully compatible with American democracy In the midtwentieth century the men who led Mormonism were entirely sincerely and guilelessly committed to what they understood the American project to be Their strain of Mormonism was shaped by a fierce Protestant work ethic that had made their Mormon grandparents successful settlers of the Salt Lake desert and by a reflexive suspicion of federal government hammered into their bones during the late nineteenthcentury polygamy prosecutions They believed in competence and selfreliance in hard work and duty All of this made midtwentieth century Mormons incredibly successful practitioners of capitalism and helped ease their way toward assimilation with an America that valorized the boardroom and economic success This strain of Mormonism  business Mormonism  was deeply patriotic for all the same reasons Calvin Coolidge and Dwight Eisenhower were The church was meritocratic and technocratic devoted to having meetings and wearing ties to words like responsibility and delegate and to a firm optimism that dogged effort led to inevitable improvement But as American society endured the social conflagrations of the 1960s and 70s business Mormonisms emphasis upon rectitude and moral behavior led it increasingly to emphasize its own moral distinctiveness and warn of the dangers of what it frequently called the world Brigham Young  University mandated a business haircut for men in the 1960s the same decade Mitt Romney was a student there and the rhetoric of church leaders grew increasingly hostile toward popular culture This Mormonism was awkward around or even suspicious of the cultural diversity and religious pluralism evident in late twentiethcentury America  it was simultaneously committed to an ideal American way of life and wary of the fast decay of traditional American culture Romney is very much a product of these values Though he tried to downplay his Mormonism on the campaign trial he was a man simply trying too hard The faiths language and presumptions style and values imprinted his every move and he was very very aware of it When reporters asked about his beliefs he visibly tensed Brought up among Mormons dedicated to selfdiscipline and hard work and with a long memory of the hostility American culture once inflicted upon them Romney expected to be assailed for his Mormonism and reacted accordingly In addition to polygamy jokes he veered between aggressive declarations of pride in his faith and attempts to downplay its theological differences with other American Christianities Romney felt his Mormonism needed acknowledgment explanation and perhaps even justification he believed firmly that it was consistent with American values but at the same time that Americans needed to be convinced of this As a result Romneys 2008 campaign attempted to defuse doubts about Mormonism by pointing at the way he had lived his life his wellscrubbed wholesome family his success at business and his public service This was not an attempt to dodge issues of theology  rather it simply reflected what Mitt Romney genuinely believes religion is In his 2007 speech on Mormonism and faith in America in College Station Texas Romney dealt with American religious pluralism by boiling all faiths down to what he called a common creed of moral convictions  a common ground of behavioral norms on which Americans of different faiths meet and stand as a nation united But to many evangelicals who distrust Mormonism precisely because of its doctrinal distinctiveness his words rang hollow  or even deceptive  and played into fears of Mormon secrecy and elusiveness In the past two decades however the Mormon Church has worked tirelessly to counter these fears and images In 1995 Gordon B Hinckley a charismatic public relations professional became president of the church and sought to remake the way his faith related to the world Hinckleys familiarity with media  and his ease in maneuvering around figures like Mike Wallace and Bill Clinton  signaled a subtle shift in Mormon rhetoric Hinckley who died in 2008 continued to emphasize the importance of moral behavior but he also expressed devout hope that this would not make Mormons stodgy and boring He jettisoned pessimism about the world in favor of apparent delight at taking questions from Larry King He urged his flock to seek opportunities to be good neighbors and regularly offered praise for the wonderful things that he saw outside the boundaries of the church He traveled to Asia and Europe and in Africa he took photo opportunities with Desmond Tutu He seized upon the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City simultaneously working to welcome the world while avoiding any hint of a Mormon Olympics The Mormonism of Gordon B Hinckley was in short comfortable with going to the movies once in a while This was the faith of Jon Huntsmans adulthood Hinckley in fact called Huntsmans father to fulltime service within the church in 1997 and Jon Sr left his chemical business Huntsman Corporation in the hands of his children The younger Jon worked there for many years helping reinvent the company as a global corporation  one thats heavily involved in Asia and has taken great care to manage its media image

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/03/25/134850972/town-relies-on-troubled-youth-prison-for-profits?ft=3&f=,First in a twopart series on private prisons Prisons are filled with stress and violence without proper supervision they can revert to primitive places Thats what happened at Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility in Mississippi an NPR news investigation has determined As the nations largest juvenile prison Walnut Grove houses 1200 boys and young men in a sprawling onestory complex ringed by security fences about an hours drive east of Jackson  The State of Mississippi pays a private corrections company to run the prison NPRs investigation found that allegations swirling around the prison raise the fundamental question of whether profits have distorted the mission of rehabilitating young inmates An Environment Of Violence Walnut Grove started out and it was formed to be something good for youth but somewhere down the line it took a turn for the worse said former inmate Clayborne Henderson 27 He spent two years for kidnapping in the Grove as they call it between his 19th and 21st birthdays Now hes working at a car wash and taking community college courses in Jackson trying to straighten out his life He and other former inmates describe an environment of violence inside the youth prison as so pervasive it became entertainment Itd be like setting up a fight deal like you would with two dogs Henderson said I did witness twice while I was at Walnut Grove they actually bet on it It was payday for the guards The Southern Poverty Law Center and the ACLU National Prison Project have filed a classaction lawsuit on behalf of 13 inmates against the prison operator GEO Group the prison administration and state officials The complaint describes rampant contraband brought in by guards sex between female guards and male inmates inadequate medical care prisoners held inhumanely in isolation guards brutalizing inmates and inmateoninmate violence that was so brutal it led to brain damage When we began investigating conditions inside this facility and seeing how these kids were living with the beat downs and the sexual abuse and violence and corruption it became a nobrainer It became something we had to do said Sheila Bedi the lead attorney on the case and deputy legal director for the SPLC Earlier this year the Civil Rights Division of the US Department of Justice launched its own investigation into some of these charges A spokesperson in Washington DC said the probe is ongoing and declined to comment Questionable Prison Guards Several former inmates who spoke to NPR say guards are a big part of the problem Justin Bowling who spent 17 months in the Grove in 2007 and 2008 for marijuana possession says the prison is overrun with gangs whose members include correctional officers A lot of times the guards are in the same gang If the inmates wanted something done they got it If they wanted a cell popped open to handle some business about fighting or something like that it just pretty much happened Bowling said Theres also a problem of too few guards A state audit in 2005 and another one last year noted that staffing at Walnut Grove decreased even as the prisoner population increased According to the audit in 2009 there were three inmate injuries a day In the first six months of 2010 there was more than one fight a day an assault on staff at least every other day and nine attempted suicides The Council of Juvenile Correctional Administrators whose members represent youth facilities in all 50 states reports that a guardtoinmate ratio of 1 officer to 10 or 12 juvenile prisoners is common The state audit of Walnut Grove found the guardtoinmate ratio to be 1 to 60 Salaries are the largest expense of a correctional budget and reducing staffing is typically a way to keep costs down Pablo Paez vice president for corporate relations for GEO Group based in Boca Raton Fla declined repeated requests by NPR to give the companys side of the story He cited the pending lawsuit GEO which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange is the nations second largest prison corporation and had more than 1 billion in revenue last year Mississippi Corrections Commissioner Chris Epps also declined repeated requests for an interview citing the litigation In a brief email in January he wrote If staff  abused inmates they should be punished However I have no knowledge of them abusing inmates He added that the facility has improved since GEO took over last August Two months later his spokesperson confirmed in an email to NPR that the Department of Corrections had hired an independent consultant experienced in fixing troubled lockups to review operations at the Grove Ethel Heard is one of 100  parents who have banded together to pressure the state to make reforms at Walnut Grove Her 21yearold son Tyrone is serving time there for armed robbery We know that our children have made mistakes she said Were not asking that they open the cell doors and let our kids out Were asking for them to have better treatment Creating A Distinct Youth Facility When Walnut Grove opened 10 years ago it was a model youth facility The idea was to get teenaged felons out of the notorious Parchman penitentiary and away from hardened criminals As one young inmate said An old fool has lived his life but a young fool can change But thats not how it has turned out says state representative John Mayo a member of the corrections committee that oversees Walnut Grove and other Mississippi prisons To me in my mind its just a prison he said Its another adult prison Mayo says the Legislature kept raising the age of inmates sent there  from 18 all the way up to 22 He says he voted against the age increases Today Walnut Grove is the only juvenile facility in the country that locks up 22yearolds with 13yearolds Initially it was to be 13 through 18yearolds Mayo said And then quite frankly that did not populate Walnut Grove to what Im going to call a profitable operation Two years ago Walnut Grove added 500 beds to accommodate all the new prisoners According to the 2008 and 2009 annual reports for Cornell Companies the prison operator at the time the expansion created an extra 34 million in revenue GEO acquired Cornell last year George Cole a career educator who served as principal of the prison school for four years was at a legislative hearing held in January to look into alleged abuses at Walnut Grove I thought when I went to Walnut Grove I was going to a place that was really interested in the rehabilitation of our children but I found out quite the opposite And I guess as a private facility they had to make money Cole testified The hearing was heavily attended by inmates parents most of whom are black and all of whom wore bright orange Tshirts that read Friends  Family Of Youth Incarcerated At Walnut Grove Though invited neither GEO nor the state corrections department sent a representative to the hearing Taking Educational Grant Money NPR examined thousands of pages of public records associated with federal grants paid to the Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility Records show that Warden Brick Tripp and his deputy wardens  already paid by GEO  have been receiving checks for 2500 to 5000 as supplemental salaries for administering federal Title 1 education funds The warden and deputy warden had no dealings whatsoever with educating students Cole stated emphatically in a phone interview The warden declined an interview request Jeff Webb the lawyer who represents the fivemember Walnut Grove Correctional Authority which writes the checks says overseeing the grants is part of the wardens job though he did not say why deputy wardens receive paycheck bonuses GEO Groups Paez was also asked why the prison administration was receiving supplementary paychecks from federal education grants which have nothing to do with the civil rights lawsuit or Justice Department investigation He said he had no comment NPR forwarded the paycheck supplements to the US Department of Education and asked if this was normal Chief of Communications Justin Hamilton said the agency is concerned and has referred the matter to its Office of Inspector General for investigation Support For Walnut Grove Despite all the controversy the youth prison has staunch defenders         Dennise JonesPutnam municipal clerk of the town of Walnut Grove says her nephew is in the prison boot camp program He will be one of the first ones to tell you thats the best thing thats ever happened to him Its turned his life totally around she said As to why the kids are frequently placed on lockdown and fight with staff Walnut Grove is not a day care said the Rev Justin Chaney the prison chaplain there from 2007 to 2010 Im afraid a lot of people think it might be just a little detention center Its maximum security So yea you do have those that can be rough Grady Sims mayor of Walnut Grove says he visits the prison frequently and knows the staff well I wouldnt interfere with the way theyre operating it he said Theyve done an excellent job Why The Prison Matters To The Town The town of Walnut Grove is so small theres no stoplight or supermarket In fact inmates outnumber citizens 2 to 1 The prison just about saved this town from extinction The 200 prison jobs helped fill the void when a shirt manufacturer and a glove maker closed and moved overseas several years ago The mayors own vending company has 18 snack machines inside the prison Its been a sweet deal for Walnut Grove Sims said Indeed every month the prison pays the town 15000 in lieu of taxes  which comprises nearly 15 percent of its annual budget For a small town thats a lot of money the mayor said and it helps us maintain a fulltime police department that we wouldnt be able to afford without that income Theres more GEO pays the Walnut Grove Correctional Authority  which sends the prison all of its grant money  4500 a month Webb the authoritys lawyer says the money is kept in escrow and rarely spent Finally theres a fulltime state corrections employee whose job is to monitor how the prison is run His salary is reimbursed by GEO All of this raises the question Is oversight of the Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility negligent because its a golden goose All this community is just making so much money off Walnut Grove that no one wants to upset the applecart Then that means theyre not gonna make their money anymore says State Representative Earle Banks chairman of the state Juvenile Justice Committee He called the recent hearing to investigate Walnut Grove Banks a plaintiffs lawyer is suing the prison for wrongful death of an inmate That handsoff policy might be about to change If theres mistreatment going on at Walnut Grove and the Justice Department finds that it is they ought to sue the hell out of somebody Mayo said I cant understand why we have to be sued to do whats right Aarti Shahani contributed to this NPR News investigation and report Copyright 2014 NPR,20110328,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/03/01/134132526/u-s-defends-doma-despite-dropping-support?ft=3&f=,The Obama administration says it will continue to deny health care benefits to the samesex legal spouse of a federal court employee despite the fact that it has abandoned its court arguments in support of the Defense of Marriage Act Known as DOMA the 1996 law bars the federal government from recognizing samesex marriage On Monday the administration took the latest in a series of convoluted actions relating to the statute Last week the administration stirred up a tempest in the legal community when it notified Congress that it would no longer defend DOMA as constitutional It was the first time the administration has notified Congress of a refusal to defend a statute in court The administrations approach differed markedly from the way it dealt with the dont ask dont tell law which the administration did defend in court but persuaded Congress to repeal Dealing with DOMA the administration did the opposite It has abandoned the law in court but has not asked Congress to repeal it An Incoherent Switch Until last week the administration had defended DOMA but Walter Dellinger who served as solicitor general in the Clinton administration contends that throwing in the towel was the right course for the administration at this point He notes that the administration for the first time was going to have to articulate whether a law that singles out homosexuals for different treatment should be treated with special skepticism by the courts The Justice Department was going to have to argue that there had been no discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation Dellinger says And given a legislative record replete with comments hostile to homosexuals that is an argument that neither the president nor the attorney general believe Harvard law professor Charles Fried who served as solicitor general in the Reagan administration calls the administrations rationale for switching positions incoherent Although Fried says his personal view is that the law is unconstitutional the Justice Department he maintains is dutybound to defend any federal law as long as some reasonable argument can be made to support it  even though the argument may ultimately be a losing one The reasonable argument is that in terms of tradition and in terms of the view of the majority of the people of the United States marriage is between one man and one woman Fried says Benefits For SameSex Couple In notifying Congress of its decision not to defend DOMA in court the Obama administration said it would continue to enforce the law so that Congress could defend the law if it wishes to in court In other words the administration said it would with one hand enforce the law in order to preserve a legal case for Congress to defend but at the same time the administration would tell the courts it believes the law is unconstitutional Thus in Mondays California case the administration said the federal Office of Personnel Management would continue to deny health care benefits to the legal samesex spouses of federal court employees Last week the administration said the Internal Revenue Service would refuse to recognize the marital status of an 81yearold widow who in 2007 legally married her female partner of 44 years The IRS action means the widow owes 360000 in estate taxes that would not be owed if her spouse were a man Some former Justice Department officials are critical of this twotrack approach contending that if a president really thinks a law is unconstitutional he should not enforce it Shannen Coffin who served in the Bush Justice Department and as counsel to former Vice President Dick Cheney says it seems incongruous to conclude that the administration will continue to enforce a statute that they have found flatly unconstitutional Coffin agrees however that the issue of enforcement is something of a conundrum that forces the president to either take apparently contradictory positions or usurp the power of the legislature by unilaterally refusing to enforce a law George  Washington University law professor Orin Kerr also contends that the administration is in an impossible situation because theyre going to get criticized no matter what they do depending on what political interest is offended by their decision Precedent While the administrations DOMA shift is unusual it is not rare It has happened more than a dozen times since 2004 and many more in the past 60 years including in some very important cases During the Eisenhower Kennedy and Truman administrations the presidents in one form or another refused to defend separatebutequal facilities in schools and hospitals The Ford Justice Department refused to defend the postWatergate campaign finance law much of which was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court The Reagan administration refused to defend the independent counsel law a law subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court by a 7to1 vote It also refused to defend the onehouse legislative veto of many executive actions in that case the administration was more successful winning 72 in the Supreme Court The Clinton administration refused to defend a federal law mandating the dismissal of military personnel who were HIVpositive The George W Bush administration refused to defend a federal law that denied masstransit funds to any transportation system that displayed ads advocating the legalization of marijuana And in the George HW Bush administration the Justice Department refused to defend a federal law providing affirmative action in the awarding of broadcasting licenses  a law subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court by a narrow 54 vote Solicitor General Kenneth Starr was recused in the case so the lead counsel for the government in the case was Starrs deputy a fellow by the name of John Roberts now the chief justice of the United States Copyright 2014 NPR,20110302,marijuana

protracted civil war according to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton And the US is considering military options such as a nofly zone Clinton told a House committee Tuesday morningSaying that all options are being considered as possible ways to stop the bloodshed Clinton said We have also with our NATO allies and with the Pentagon begun to look at potential planning One of those actions that is under review is a nofly zone she saidSpeaking about Libya to the House Foreign Policy Committee Clinton also said that any US military role would have to be considered very carefullyClinton discussed some of those options when she sat for an interview with Michele Kelemen in Geneva Monday Following is a transcript of the interview in which Clinton says US and European response to the situation includes planning that runs across a full range of potential optionsKELEMEN You have targeted sanctions and an arms embargo  What more did you talk about with your partners here about  specifically how to stop this bloodshedCLINTON Well we spoke at some length with our European colleagues because they have a much greater connection with Libya than we do  They have many more economic relationships  They have many more of the assets of the Gadhafi family that are being located in Europe  So theyre going to be announcing their own sanctions and I dont want to jump the gun on them  They get to do that for themselves  But I think it will further increase the pressurePart of what were trying to do is to send a message to those around Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi that the cost is getting intolerable that if you want to get out and end the bloodshed you need to move now  And I think that would be a powerfully delivered message by the Europeans  And also we are looking at all other options  The decision made by NATO at the North Atlantic Council a few days ago was to direct the military command the supreme commander in Europe to begin prudent planning  And that runs across a full range of potential options  So theres a lot going onKELEMEN A nofly zoneCLINTON Well thats on the list of things that need to be considered  It is in the view of some a very cumbersome not very effective approach  It is in the view of others an effort worth making  But the military planners are the ones who have to really get into the details of what assets there are whose assets they are what would be an appropriate mix and the like  So its one of the many issues that are being examinedKELEMEN Sanctions work on sort of rational people but this is Moammar Gadhafi that were talking about the mad dog of the Middle East as President Reagan once put it  So I mean whats the end game with himCLINTON Well its uncertain which is one of the reasons why much of what we are doing now is not focused only on delivering a message to him  He has family members he has close regime supporters he has business supporters they have to know theres a price to pay  The longer this goes on the more bloodshed and violence there is the more likely that they are going to be at risk  be at risk physically be at risk financially be at risk of not having a place to go  So this is a message not only directed at him  and who knows how receptive he is to it  but it is a clear unmistakable message but also to the remaining support system that he hasKELEMEN The Libyan government such as it is was really built around him  What are you worried about in a postGadhafi government or a postGadhafi sceneCLINTON Well were worried that there isnt any institutional support for what comes next  Unfortunately he did a quite thorough job in destroying and discrediting all the institutions that one would expect to see in a state  Look at the difference between Egypt and Libya  The military in Egypt played a very constructive role in navigating through the protests  It is still managing a government  Gadhafi made sure he didnt have a strong military that had any respect of the peopleSo we are very conscious of the uncertainty that lies beyond Gadhafi  If you look at power centers within Libya you have mostly a tribal base for that  Somebody told me who has studied Libya that if you look at the opposition there are monarchists there are tribal leaders there are Islamists there are some representatives of a very small civil society  You really dont have anyone emerging  But there is an effort in the east around Benghazi to try to begin putting together what is called an executive council and well be certainly along with others reaching out to them to see how we can helpKELEMEN Libya is by far the bloodiest of all these changes weve seen in the Middle East  What other countries are you really worried about nowCLINTON Well I think that no country is immune and each country has unique characteristics and is responding in a particular way  As I said in my speech to the Human Rights Council we see the efforts in Jordan and Bahrain as moving in the right direction  Theyre trying to open a dialogue  Theyre trying to make reforms  There still is a lot of work to be done but we support both the King of Bahrain and the King of Jordan  In Yemen that was already a very fractured society and what will happen in the future is extremely hard to predictOne thing the United States knows is that alQaida in the Arabian Peninsula poses a threat to the region to Europe to us and thats where its headquartered in Yemen  So we think that this is still evolving and its way too soon to predict what the outcomes will be Copyright 2014 NPR,20110301,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/02/02/133279945/hezbollah-israel-and-egypt-what-happens-next?ft=3&f=,All of our assumptions about the Arab world have been turned on their heads in the past month says veteran Middle East correspondent Thanassis CambanisEverything that the experts say and everything that the activists and politicians have taken for granted for a generation at least is really off the table he tells Fresh Airs Terry Gross Whats been happening first in Lebanon and then in Tunisia and now in Egypt and who knows further afield suggests that new forces have been unleashed and we have no idea where they might lead and what new dynamics they might createOn Wednesdays Fresh Air Cambanis puts what has been going on in Egypt in a historical context  and explains the rising influence of the political party Hezbollah in the region He says the recent explosion of popular anger and activism in Egypt opens up the possibility for a new political movement  one not endorsed by autocratic regimes or rooted in Hezbollahs Islamist ideologyThere are a lot of people both dispossessed and powerful who want dignity but they dont necessarily want endless war  which is what the Hezbollah school of thought advocates he says I think they would be hungry for and very receptive to an Egyptcentered political movement that talks about Arab empowerment but not endless warCambanis is the author of A Privilege to Die Inside Hezbollahs Legions and Their Endless War Against Israel which traces the growth of Hezbollah and its ideologicalbased militancy across the Middle East He explains that Hezbollah has thrived because of a complete vacuum of Arab leadership in the regionThats why its had tremendous influence in regions way beyond its context he says Though its a small Shia group its leader Hassan Nasrallah is the most popular leader in the entire Arab world Sunni Arabs in Egypt admire him Christians in Egypt Lebanon and Syria admire him Atheists  who have no truck with religious movements at all  admire him and this movement thats called the Party of God That frankly speaks to a region that has been stripped of meaningful discourse and is really open receptive or vulnerable  depending on your perspective  to this kind of ideologyIn Cambanis view Hezbollah has two goals to construct an Islamic resistance society and to continue a perpetual war against Israel Cambanis says leaders and members of Hezbollah have told him that theyre ready for a war with Israel because theyve restored their rocket arsenal their militia strength is back and they feel like theyre militarily much stronger than in 2006Theyll engineer it at the moment that is most propitious to them says Cambanis In their ideal world they manage to engineer a situation in which Israel attacks and they can blame the beginning of the war on Israel  They seem to feel like theyve changed the balance of power between Hezbollah and Israel  not that they could defeat Israel but they think they can inflict so much damage on Israel in another war with missiles on Tel Aviv or much more destructive missiles on Haifa that Hezbollah will hold the cardsBut Cambanis says its unlikely that other military forces in the Middle East will join Hezbollah in attacking Israel  at least for the time beingIn terms of timing I think its unlikely that well see something like 1967 where all the Arab armies were coordinating to attack Israel at the same time On the other hand what we could see in five or 10 years were likely to see an array of Arab governments that today are sympathetic to the West and Israel changing allegiance and being more sympathetic to this axis of resistance or Hezbollah mindset That will have very real consequences for Israels security and for the projection of American power in the regionThanassis Cambanis the former Middle  East bureau chief for The Boston Globe contributes regularly to The New York Times and The Boston Globe He also teaches at Columbia Universitys School of International and Public AffairsInterview HighlightsOn Mohamed ElBaradeiWhen I was talking to opposition activists last summer they had given up on him They said this guy has nice ideas but he doesnt have a popular following he doesnt have the charisma he doesnt have the drive to do the kinds of things necessary to make an impact in Egypt That detachment and weakness has in an odd sense propelled him to the front of the protest movement now but not as its leader by any stretch of the imagination Hes been put at the front of the opposition coalition and he hasnt been put there by the mass of people on the street Hes been put there by the small organized political parties that are supporting the uprising and he has been agreed to because hes a weak figureIf the Muslim Brotherhood and the secular party and the traditional leftist parties want one figure who can negotiate on their behalf its got to be someone whos not allied with any of them and whos not powerful enough to threaten any of their political bases Thats why Baradei is a consensus choice If he were someone who had a tremendous current and popular support to tap into the Brotherhood and secular parties would be wary of delegating its negotiating authority to himOn whether Egypts government could collapseI think fears of Egypt collapsing are overblown This is a rickety state but its a state nonetheless This is not Saddam Husseins Iraq where the time Saddam was toppled his government was a shell of a state and really lacked any meaningful institutional reach Egypt is a creaky poorly run but pervasive unitary state and I think even if the leadership is decapitated that state will remain And it just doesnt seem to me a likely candidate for years of instability and looting and successive governments I think well see some form of stability in Egypt in the near future It might not be one that we like or love but it will be something that will be enduringOn Egypts secret police forceIn Egypt the secret police are ubiquitous and they make a point of not being all that secret Several of my interviews with Muslim Brothers this summer were shadowed by the secret police who came and sat at the next table and ostentatiously made a point of letting us know that they were watching us  In functioning Egyptian society you come across stories constantly of people beaten and harassed by the police for everything from political activism to being gay to smoking marijuana to being from the wrong class in the eyes of a policeman and they have untrammeled authority Part of their daily goal has been to remind the people that the police have complete power over their lives and are ready and willing to use any brutality necessary to keep order Copyright 2014

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/01/12/132869081/High-Court-Weighs-Warantless-Entry?ft=3&f=,The US Supreme Court is wrestling with a case that could give police greater power to forcibly enter a home without a warrant The Constitution bars warrantless searches except in certain circumstances  for example an emergency search to prevent the destruction of evidence But on Wednesday the question before the court was whether police by themselves creating such exigent circumstances are unconstitutionally evading the warrant requirement The case before the court began in 2005 when Lexington Ky police banged on the door of an apartment where they thought they smelled marijuana After loudly identifying themselves police heard movement inside and fearing the destruction of evidence they broke inInside they found Hollis Deshaun King smoking marijuana Police also found marijuana and cocaine on the kitchen counter King was convicted of drug trafficking and related offenses But the Kentucky Supreme Court reversed the conviction The state court ruled that the drugs found in the apartment could not be used as evidence against King because police had no warrant for the search and the only emergency circumstances were those created by the police themselves when they loudly alerted the suspect to their presence Prosecutors appealed to the US Supreme Court which heard arguments in the case Wednesday Kentucky Assistant Attorney General Joshua Farley told the justices that since the smell of marijuana gave police probable cause to believe a crime was occurring in the apartment and since police heard movement inside after they knocked they lawfully broke in to prevent the evidence from being destroyed Chief Justice John Roberts tested Farleys theory So you have an apartment building where the police know from experience there is a lot of illegal activity a lot of drugs Can police every two weeks walk through and knock on every door and break in when they hear movement inside Is that all right Farley responded that it would be all right as long as police had separate probable cause to believe a crime was occurring In this case he said the probable cause was the smell of marijuana Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked whether this meant that police could merely sniff at every door knock on those doors where they smelled marijuana and break in once they heard a noise It would be perfectly fine for the officers to do that Farley responded Fourth Amendment Issue But Ginsburg noted that the smell of marijuana would be enough to get a warrant We start out with a strong presumption that the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant she observed Why wouldnt the police just get a warrant she asked rather than knocking on the door and alerting the people inside Justice Antonin Scalia pointed out that if the suspects had quickly answered the door and simply refused to permit entry the police would have been powerless to do more The police he said were taking advantage of the stupidity of the criminals Justice Elena Kagan worried that allowing police to create exigent circumstances would be essentially eviscerating the warrant requirement in  the one place that the Fourth Amendment was most concerned about If there is one place where the warrant requirement has real force she said its in the home Without a warrant she suggested all the police really have to say is We saw pot we heard noise  and they would be able to break in Kentucky public defender Jamesa Drake arguing on behalf of the defendant urged the court to consider the consequences for all citizens if the warrant requirement is diluted There is no difference between what happened in this case and how an innocent person would respond she said noting that police had banged on the door loudly at 10 pm and all they heard inside was movement  a noise that she seemed to suggest did not necessarily indicate the destruction of evidence But Drake seemed unable to persuade the justices that she had a workable rule to supplant the broad one suggested by prosecutors And she struggled to draw a distinction between this case and what she saw as genuinely exigent circumstances that justify a warrantless search A decision in the case is expected by summer Copyright 2014 NPR,20110112,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2011/01/10/132800776/the-root-reading-the-constitution-is-fundamental?ft=3&f=,Sherrilyn A Ifill who teaches at the law school of the University of Maryland writes about the law for The Root I started carrying around a pocket version of the US Constitution in my purse in 1998 after I visited South   Africa for the first time It was only four years after the first full democratic election in that country When the ANC was voted the ruling party in 1994 and Nelson Mandela was elected president hundreds of thousands of black South Africans stood in lines extending for miles to exercise their franchise for the first time Four years later everyone  from parliamentary officials to the woman selling tea at a makeshift kiosk in the townships outside Cape   Town  carried a small copy of the South African Constitution on their person It was inspiring to see how engaged everyone was with the foundational document of their country So all things being equal I have no objection to the leadership of the newly elected US House of Representatives deciding to open the first session last week with a reading of the Constitution It was also gratifying to see the reading turn into a bipartisan affair Of course as noted by Rep Elijah Cummings DMD the House didnt have the stomach to read the original Constitution along with its amendments Thus the reading excluded some of the framers greatest constitutional hits including Article I Section 2 the counting of slaves as threefifths of all other Persons for representation purposes Nothing like reading an edited and sanitized version of the Constitution to demonstrate respect for it But the deletion of the unpleasant parts of the Constitution is only one of the problems with the constitutional readin that opened the new congressional session Many of us hoped that members of Congress would have read the Constitution before they took the oath of office  in fact before they ran for office so that they would be familiar with the structure of government they hoped to influence But if Republican leaders who hatched this stunt believe that reading the Constitution aloud is the same thing as understanding it then this new Congress is in for a bumpy year Its important for our leaders to understand that a constitution differs from other sources of law Unlike a statute or regulation a constitution sets out the fundamental legal regime by which a nation is organized Constitutions are meant to stand the test of time It was Chief Justice John Marshall who reminded us in 1819 that our Constitution was intended to endure for ages to come  and to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs The framers understood this They provided a means of amending the Constitution but also drafted language that left enough room in the joints of our governing structure so that successive generations could ensure that our government could function The perfect example is the Article I necessary and proper clause which gives Congress the authority to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for executing the powers vested in the legislative branch by the Constitution Determining when a law is necessary and proper to the execution of a constitutionally enumerated power cannot be determined simply by reading the words of Article I Section 8 over and over Likewise determining the extent of Congress power under the commerce clause to regulate commerce  among the several states has been subject to centuries of interpretation by the Supreme Court Thursdays spokenword performance has not revealed the parameter of Congress power in this area Behind the Republican leaders constitutional posturing of course the stage is set for an effort to repeal the newly enacted health care law Challenges to the constitutionality of the law in federal court have centered on the breadth of Congress powers under Article I Section 8 The new health care law seems to fall squarely within Congress power under the commerce clause which has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to authorize Congress to legislate in a variety of areas As long as economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce the court has been inclined to find that Congress may legislate in that area For example the Supreme Court ruled that Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which forbids hotel owners from denying services to clients based on race is an exercise of Congress commerce clause power and ruled that the commerce clause permits Congress to regulate medical marijuana in the states But Judge Henry E Hudson in Virginia v Sebelius offers a cramped analysis of the commerce clause that seems at odds with these cases In striking down the health care law Hudson concedes that Congress can regulate economic activity that affects interstate commerce But Hudson contends Congress cannot regulate inactivity Thus according to Hudson Congress cannot regulate those who seek not to participate in the health care market by having insurance Hudsons decision has been derided by many legal scholars and conflicts with the decisions of other courts that have reviewed challenges to the health care law Hudson has also been criticized for his financial connection with an organization that provides services to a number of Republican elected officials  including Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli who filed the legal challenge to the health care law But simply reading the Constitution without reference to the nearly 200 years of Supreme Court interpretation of its various provisions doesnt help us understand the interplay between the commerce clause the necessary and proper clause and Congress power to levy taxes Nor will it bring the new Tea Partyspooked congressional Republicans any closer to completing the hard work of enacting legislation in a divided Congress Whats even more disturbing are those Tea Party activists and Republicans who position themselves as the only true protectors of the Constitution In fact the whole exercise of reading the Constitution at the start of the new House session was designed to suggest that Republicans will be operating within the confines of the Constitution in contrast with their Democratic counterparts It is ironic therefore that its most often members of the Republican Party who seem most determined to change or overturn provisions of the Constitution  whether its Iowa Rep Steve Kings new proposal to overturn the Constitutions birthrightcitizenship provision or earlier efforts to amend the Constitution to outlaw samesex marriage Other Republican elected officials recently advocated nullification  the refusal by states to comply with federal law  a term most often associated with Southern resistance to school desegregation orders But no matter The Constitution  along with patriotism national security and family values  is fast becoming yet another term coopted as part of the permanent GOP campaign Almost 200 years ago Chief Justice Marshall cautioned against defining Congress power in Article I so narrowly that our foundational document would become merely a splendid bauble Congressional Republicans will need to do more than merely admire the Constitution or parrot its many provisions en masse to fulfill their oath of office Its all well and good to carry a copy of the Constitution in ones pocket  in fact its an excellent habit for the citizens of any country But our nations legislators will need to do more than carry and read the Constitution They will have to do the hard work of enacting legislation to strengthen our nation and to advance the people of this country as the framers empowered them to do Copyright 2014 The Root,20110110,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2010/09/24/130099092/civil-rights-judicial-bias-surround-texas-drug-case?ft=3&f=,A legal drama has been playing out for almost three years in the Texas town of Clarksville of Red River County During that time two black brothers have seen their lives turned upside down and a white judge was recused from the case after allegations of judicial bias and criticism for pushing a drug case that just about everyone urged him to drop Clarksville Texas Clarksville was one of the first places settled in the state of Texas After 190 years since its founding the town of 3200 retains a slightly dilapidated Southern charm In the town square stands a large statue of a Confederate soldier Col John C Burks Whatsstrange is that the statue is not facing east toward Murfreesboro Tenn where Burks and many other locals lost their lives charging a Union battery Nor is it facing south in honor of Burks beloved Confederacy The Confederate colonel faces northwest as if looking toward Idaho But the way Vergil Richardson sees it the statue is actually keeping an eye on the towns black neighborhood Richardson grew up in Clarksville He led the local high schools basketball team to two state championship games and eventually came back to coach the team He says that since the days of Reconstruction the Confederate officer has been sending a quiet message from Clarksvilles white community to its black community The message is whatever you do Im watching and they are Richardson says  Cops Everywhere  Three blocks south from Clarksvilles town square on South Columbia Street is Richardsons twobedroom house As Thanksgiving approached in 2007 six members of the Richardson family including two brothers  Vergil now 40 and Mark 38  had gathered to celebrate They did not know it but the Richardsons were being watched  not by Col Burks but by Clarksville law enforcement As 1030 pm approached a few family members were playing dominoes and watching TV while others had already gone to bed Suddenly the police burst through the door without knocking They were screaming yelling telling us to get on the floor cursing us out Vergil says The high school coach had never been in trouble hadnt even had a traffic ticket I was very scared didnt know what to do I looked up because I know some of them The prosecutor he was there with a gun in his hand Vergil recalls Meanwhile Vergils brother Mark was sitting in a car outside the house talking to a friend And I looked and said Oh my God Look its cops everywhere And they did not see us And I was like We better get out She was like No lets stay in here  Mark says Mark and his friend did get out of the car and were immediately handcuffed He says law enforcement officers screamed at his friend as she stood there bewildered You know where the drugs are Were going to put you up under the jailhouse Mark recalls the officers yelling at his friend  The Sale Earlier in the day 25yearold Kevin Calloway Vergil and Marks halfbrother had sold a bag of marijuana to a police informant Calloway was a student at nearby Paris Junior College and Vergil was letting him stay in his Clarksville house As Vergil stood handcuffed in the kitchen the sheriff explained the situation The sheriff said Calloways been selling drugs out of your house And I said Well if you had told me that I would have kicked him out  Vergil recounts Vergil asked to see the search warrant The question seemed to take the sheriff by surprise He said Yeah Im going to let you see it And I asked him again you know right after that and he said Im going to let you see it And I said Well OK Please let me see it  Vergil says According to Vergil the sheriff finally pulled out of his front pocket a white piece of paper about the size of a receipt flashed it in his direction and quickly stuffed it back in his pocket He then yelled at the officers Get these guys out of here In a police interrogation room a few hours later Kevin Calloway confessed to the sheriff that he kept a stash of marijuana cocaine and methamphetamine locked in the garden shed in the backyard There was just one key to the lock and Calloway kept it in his pocket On the interrogation room videotape Calloway sits elbows on his knees dejectedly looking at the floor The sheriff asks him again and again Did the others know what you were doing Calloway says eight different times during the interview that the drugs belonged to him and his brothers did not know he was dealing Hiring Lawyers Despite Calloways confession the other five members of the Richardson family present that night were charged with manufacture of a controlled substance intent to distribute and organized crime They all faced life in prison and suffered the consequence of being suspected drug dealers High school head basketball coach Vergil Richardson was fired immediately Although the family was stunned the Richardsons were not penniless They hired wellknown East Texas trial attorney Mark Lesher whose first order of business was to get District Attorney Val Varley off the case Varley was with the police when they broke down the door Not only is he dressed up  hes got a flak jacket on and an assault rifle Hes part of the raid Lesher says Val Varley declined to speak to NPR about the case But his decision to participate in the raid ended up having farreaching consequences By making himself a witness to the arrests and the gathering of evidence Varley eventually had to step aside from prosecuting the case So the judge in Clarksville John Miller asked the state attorney generals office to prosecute it Questions About The Case The state prosecutors quickly became wary of the Clarksville case One problem was that it appeared the search warrant had been issued after the raid  after Vergil Richardson had repeatedly asked the sheriff if he could see it In three different sections in the discovery it stated that the search started at approximately 1030 pm And the search warrant was signed at 1049 pm And the search was conducted before the search warrant was signed Its just illegal period Lesher says The search warrant issue potentially compromised the drug evidence found in the shed Shock Waves Through The Courthouse  Lesher the trail lawyer sent a shock wave through the small Red River County courthouse when on behalf of the Richardson brothers he filed a 2 million civil rights lawsuit against the district attorney the sheriff and the Clarksville police chief all of whom participated in the raid Then the news got even worse for Red River County The attorney generals office told Miller that the prosecutors were going to dismiss the charges against the Richardson family with the exception of Kevin Calloway who had already confessed Prosecutors wrote the judge that they were dismissing the charges in the interest of justice But the judge in the case made it clear to both the prosecutors and the defense lawyers that he had no intention of backing off A judge can sit a case but the judge cant force that case to trial Ive never seen a motion to dismiss signed and executed by the district attorney thats never been signed by the judge Its always just pro forma Lesher says State Judge John Miller refused to accept the attorney generals decision to drop the case The ruling was so unusual that it lifted legal heads around the state But the judge was just getting started He told defense lawyers that he intended to replace the attorney generals office and appoint a new special prosecutor someone who would agree to prosecute all of the members of the Richardson family not just their halfbrother Calloway Outside The Courtroom The judge approached one of Vergil Richardsons defense lawyers and asked him to step into a deserted jury room As Clyde Lee recalls Miller told him that he wanted to cut a deal According to Lee Miller offered a quid pro quo If Vergil would dismiss his civil rights lawsuit then the judge in return would dismiss the criminal charges But Vergil refused and a few weeks later the judge offered a different deal Miller then got real specific in saying that my client should testify against the other codefendants with respect to their drug activity and what he knew had to be true Lee says While it is standard for prosecutors and defense lawyers to negotiate plea deals that is not usually the judges role Miller did not respond to repeated requests by NPR for comment A History Of Not Following The Book The question remains Why would a judge insert himself so provocatively into a case Bill Hankins a reporter for The Paris News in nearby Paris Texas who has been covering the story closely thinks this case is about more than just race You know Red River County is a poor county  and I think  Miller is concerned about the lawsuit eating up funds that they dont have he says As for the repeated overtures from the judge to defense lawyer Lee outside of court Hankins says it has to be understood in the context of a small town Im going to say that it has been done many times before but it is not the proper way to do it And Im going to say that Red River County has a history of doing things probably in ways that dont follow the book Hankins says The Nightmare Ends In Hankins view the Richardsons are actually bit players in their own drama The leading roles go to the two powerful political interests in the white community  the district attorney and judge on one side and the trial lawyers on the other If Hankins theory is true the trial lawyers began to gain the upper hand after Lesher filed a motion to remove Miller from the case alleging bias And in a case of unlikely allies state prosecutors supported the defendants request to recuse the judge No dismissal hearing was held after a new judge was appointed Instead the new judge told the Texas attorney generals office to mail him the motions to dismiss which he signed recently The Richardsons threeyear nightmare was finally over But scars still remain I told my wife that I might need to go see a psychiatrist Mark says because every time a cop gets behind me theyll run my license plate They are going to stop me because those charges will show up Picking Up The Pieces Like his brother Vergil Mark Richardson had never been in trouble with the law He had always thought AfricanAmericans in East Texas exaggerated when they told stories about local law enforcement Hes a different man now Asked if he thinks what happened to him and his brother is related to their being black Mark says yes he thinks so And thats so sad because I didnt really believe that at first Mark says Thats why its so hard for me to say that but its true They dont like blacks It will take time for the Richardsons to get their lives back Vergil hopes to once again coach high school basketball Two years after he was fired his team went on to win the state championship without him As for Mark he would like to sell the house in Clarksville and put his hometown in his rearview mirror The Richardsons civil rights lawsuit against the Red River County district attorney the sheriff and the chief of police begins early next year Copyright 2014 NPR,20101123,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=131162797&ft=3&f=, They say you never get a second chance to make a good first impression  but if youre a TV talkshow host that rule doesnt always hold Every time you launch a new show you get more attention and more reviews  and usually more viewers  than at almost any other time But after that opening night as viewers decide whats changed and what hasnt and whats appealing and what isnt things start to level off quickly The first time Conan hosted a talk show virtually no one knew who he was He was building his comic identity from scratch and without much support from NBC The second time when he inherited The Tonight Show ratings for the first few nights were very solid  but then the more conservative viewing audience decided Conan was an acquired taste they were in no hurry to acquire Conan tried to alter the show to appeal to the mainstream but didnt succeed  and once again didnt get much support from NBC But now hes on basic cable where things are just a little looser and where Conan OBrien can play to his audience doing what he wants to do Thats the theory In practice however  in Mondays opening show  there seemed to be more constraints and stiffness not less This was Conans third chance to make a good first impression and Im sorry to say this time he feels flat As flat as his interview segments  which were painful to watch The celebrity guests for the opening night of Conan were Seth Rogen  seemingly a solidgold booking for Conans collegeage stoner fans  and Lea Michele the Glee star who has similarly strong appeal for a younger audience And the musical guest was Jack White who played an old rockabilly tune with Conan and the shows Basic Cable Band The music was fine and energetic and fun The conversations were not Both guests were guided rather awkwardly through their prepared stories Rogen talked about proposing to his girlfriend and joked about the ease of getting a prescription for medical marijuana in California Michele talked about no one being aware of her singing talent until she tried out for her first Broadway audition  a story that lost its punch when she explained that she was 8 years old at the time Conan also asked about her controversial recent photo spread in GQ magazine but that was only to set up a bit where a high school picture of himself was inserted into the photograph But at least it was a visual Otherwise the guests arrived emptyhanded Rogen was promoting his next movie but he didnt have a clip because the movie is still two months away Michele didnt show a clip from tonights installment of Glee because  well I dont know why What I do know is that the parts worth watching much less remembering were few An opening filmed piece that traced his move from NBC to TBS was OK  but not the caliber youd expect from a piece they had months to prepare I still remember how Conan opened his version of The Tonight Show running across country because hed forgotten to move from New  York to LA I liked Conans musical and vocal duet with Jack White on Eddie Cochrans Twenty Flight Rock And I liked portions of Conans monologue where on occasion he delivered the sort of warped perspective that Ive come to expect But the rest Andy Richter returning as sidekick added better conversational adlibs than Conan did but their exchanges often seem to exclude rather than embrace the audience And all that fuss about the background set with its threedimensional moving moon That reminded me of opening night on Chevy Chases talk show on Fox where he made a big deal out of the fact that he had a real tropical fish tank behind him with real tropical fish It quickly became obvious on that show that the fish were the only thing worth watching If the scenery on Conan is more fun than the guests  and on opening night it was  something is starting out very very wrong David Bianculli is founder and editor of TVWorthWatchingcom and teaches TV and film history at Rowan University in New Jersey  Copyright 2014 NPR,20101109,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=131106638&ft=3&f=,At the core of the grisly Mexican cartel war traffickers are fighting over border crossings the gateways to the worlds richest illegal drug market In Nuevo  Laredo Mexico the Gulf Cartel is battling the Zetas for control of the plaza whose prize is the World Trade  Bridge the biggest commercial port on the southwest border Each day 4800 trucks cross the bridge Thats one truck every 15 seconds From there via Interstate 35 its a straight shot to Americas drugloving heartland By far not only is it the busiest in the amount of trucks but it is also the busiest in the narcotics that are seized here each year says Gene Garza the longtime Laredo port director for Customs and Border Protection We get a lot of tile shipments where we find drugs We get a lot of furniture with marijuana loads out of the centralwestern Mexican state of Jalisco The Numbers Game Truck traffic through Laredo has tripled since the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA came into force 16 years ago If customs inspectors examined every truck it would cripple free trade Instead one out of every five trucks is unloaded and inspected So drug traffickers play the numbers game Theyre probably thinking  My truck is not gonna get examined Were gonna go through Laredo to see if we can get through Garza says This fiscal year more than 47 million commercial trucks crossed into the US from Mexico According to the Department of Homeland Security agents seized 96 tons of marijuana from trucks at southwest ports of entry in 2010 more than twice as much as in 2006 Officials say tougher enforcement in the lonesome stretches between border towns is funneling more contraband through these busy border crossings First Thing You Look At Is Their Hands Customs and Border Protection officer Lawrence Madrid screens trucks all day at the Bridge of the Americas in El Paso Texas He quizzes the grizzled driver of a white Freightliner truck hauling vehicle electrical systems Buenos das buddy Where are you going Madrid asks in Spanish The driver answers hes headed to a warehouse in Laredo And what are you carrying Harnesses he answers Madrid watches him carefully throughout their exchange When theyre handing you the documentation first thing you look at is their hands whether theyre trembling the agent says Whether they  take time to answer the questions or that theyre stuttering when they answer  just stuff like that you pick up According to US federal law enforcement and Mexican security sources drug mafias have thoroughly infiltrated Mexican export and trucking companies Sometimes drivers are paid to haul dope that they know is hidden in their cargo In 2010 Mexican truckers accounted for 78 percent of all security breaches to the US customs program that expedites cargo shipped by companies with preapproved security plans But sometimes the drivers are clueless A Constant Threat A Mexican trucker who gives his name as Andres sits in the cab of a black Kenworth idling at a truck stop in Nuevo Laredo about to haul a load of blackberries across the bridge First you have to stay very close to your truck he says Dont leave it alone because in an unguarded moment when you leave to go buy some food someone can put a package in there It doesnt take long for them to do that Thats why Im sitting right here in my truck keeping an eye on things With the economic power to corrupt almost anyone who is useful to them drug mafias have also gained access to shipping departments inside export plants Weve seen it at the manufacturer says Jerry Robinette special agent in charge of investigations at the San Antonio office of US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Many of these drugsmuggling organizations will go out and buy a business so that theres at least records of legitimate transactions legitimate importations or exportations And then they gradually utilize those companies to smuggle either contraband north or proceeds southbound into Mexico It is costly and timeconsuming for a company to get certified under the US governments expedited trade program For that reason most export plants do not want to jeopardize that relationship with a drug bust says Alberto Islas a Mexican industrial security consultant who advises maquilas the exportoriented Mexican assembly plants along the border that make everything from auto parts to laptops The threat of organized crime going into maquilas is a constant threat It was something we didnt see five or 10 years ago Islas says Organized Crime Affects Everything A case in point A man named Eduardo who has requested anonymity because of safety concerns owns a private security company in a Mexican border city where he is hired by maquilas to make sure their USbound loads are clean He is a former Mexican police official who boasts a long list of industrial clients which he showed to prove his authenticity Eduardo says he is speaking out because hes fed up Its horrible he says You feel super impotent when you cant do anything Unfortunately organized crime affects everything Even companies you thought were clean Eduardo says he recently discovered that a large company that was certified by US customs was passing drugs into the US According to Eduardo drug traffickers paid a manager in the company 50 to 100 per pound of marijuana that successfully made it across the border Expediting Security By Contract What is startling about his allegation is that it happened at a wellknown company that is certified under the CustomsTrade Partnership Against Terrorism CTPAT Under the USadministered program a Mexican exporter submits its personnel and security procedures to thorough checking by US Customs and once they are satisfied the cargo enjoys expedited transit through US ports of entry Eduardo says he saw evidence that company managers had smuggled marijuana in at least two trucks past his dogs and his men Alarmed he says he alerted his client and US customs officials to the discovery but nothing happened Its assumed we have a contract to check the cargo inside the plant Eduardo says They pay us to do that but they never call us to enter the plant We only check the trucks they send us If a US customs agent asks to see the companys paperwork theyll show him they have a contract with us But the contract doesnt reflect the reality He adds that he believes few exporters subvert the CTPAT program and he plans to let his contract expire with the company in question Brad Skinner head of CTPAT at the Department of Homeland Security says he is not aware of Eduardos story We have no direct corroborated information that any particular drug trafficking organization is specifically targeting the CTPAT shipments Skinner says Where we know of an incident where a CTPAT member was involved well take action to suspend those members According to Skinner the ports of entry are more secure than theyve ever been bolstered by devices such as Xray machines and radiation monitors A Billion Dollars Worth Of Cargo At the inspection dock at Laredos World  Trade Bridge port director Garza shows off all the security measures they employ We have the contraband enforcement team officers working there We have the canines working there Theres a lot of looking at the merchandise There are a lot of people that go into the trailer he explains as inspectors in blue uniforms use forklifts to remove pallets from the cavernous trailers Once a drugsniffing dog checks them out the goods can be reloaded and begin their journey northward The peanuts are going to Minneapolis Minnesota The Nivea skin cream is going to Norwalk Conn and the air conditioners are going to Lenexa  Kan Garza says checking manifests on a clipboard With a billion dollars worth of cargo crossing the USMexico border every day free trade is one of the greatest gifts for drug traffickers Copyright 2014

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130840027&ft=3&f=,When California voters go to the polls Tuesday to decide whether to legalize recreational marijuana use the ballot initiative will be closely watched in Mexico In California supporters of Proposition 19 say one reason to legalize pot in the state is to help reduce the violent illegal drug trade south of the border where Mexicos drug war has claimed some 29000 lives over the past four years But in Mexico there is no clear consensus on how the passing of Proposition 19 would affect the Mexican drug trade Mexicos War On Drugs Every year Mexico destroys about 50000 acres of cultivated marijuana and seizes 1500 tons of packaged pot Yet truckloads of the product still flow north each year into the United States According to the UN the wholesale price for a kilogram of marijuana in Mexico is roughly 80 That same amount is worth almost 7000 once smugglers move it across the border The huge price differential generates billions of dollars each year in profits to some of the most sophisticated and violent criminal syndicates in the world Rene Arce a Mexican senator who supports legalizing marijuana says the drug war is not winnable and is destroying Mexico The number of victims is very high Arce says Consumption isnt going down Production isnt going down Money laundering isnt going down Violence isnt going down Almost four years after President Felipe Calderon declared war on the drug cartels there is not one positive sign that the policy is succeeding Arce says He applauds Californias initiative though he believes passing Proposition 19 will not bring down the consumption but will at least bring down the violence Arce says legalization on both sides of the border would allow the governments to better control the drug trade and treat addicts All Drugs Are Dangerous The link between the marijuana trade and violence was underscored again on Oct 25 when 13 people were gunned down at a drug treatment center in Tijuana Local prosecutors say they believe the massacre was linked to the seizure of 134 tons of pot in the city on Oct 18 But many people in Tijuana do not believe that simply legalizing marijuana in California will change things The citys police chief has said that if the initiative passes Californians will be smoking weed stained with Mexican blood Ricardo Sanchez Huesca who runs a youth advocacy program in Mexico City says the California initiative sends a message that marijuana is not dangerous All drugs are dangerous he says Theres no difference between hard or soft drugs People might be thinking that Oh now marijuana is legal now it doesnt cause much damage This is a huge error A Debated Effect Californias Proposition 19 has fueled a fierce debate in Mexico over Calderons drug war Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has said that both the US and Mexico should consider legalizing drugs as a way to reduce the violence associated with the drug trade Meanwhile Calderon remains opposed to legalization Calderon has blasted what he called an inconsistent US drug policy which on the one hand criminalizes narcotics and on the other allows medical marijuana sales He has blamed Mexicos drug war problem on the huge demand for drugs in the US Raul Benitez Manaut a researcher at the Center for Research on North America at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico  City says even if California legalizes pot it will have a very limited impact in Mexico Many people believe that this will be a big effect in Mexico I dont believe that The effect will not be big not be direct and immediate he says Benitez notes that the Catholic Church remains a powerful force in Mexican society and that on social issues such as drug use most of Mexico remains quite conservative So while the ballot initiative in California is causing debate in Mexico Benitez says it is unlikely to change Mexican drug policy in the short term Copyright 2014 NPR,20101028,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130832710&ft=3&f=,In California supporters of Proposition 19 liken their cause to the lifting of prohibition on alcohol nearly 80 years ago Making pot legal and regulating it like alcohol they say could raise millions in tax revenues and wipe out the black market along with the social costs associated with it But breaking the underground trade in marijuana might not be so easy This past summer dozens of drug agents in paramilitary gear marched into a remote area of northern California west of the town of Redding As helicopters swirled over the sunbaked hills the agents used machetes to chop down more than 10000 bright green marijuana plants The plants were then lashed into 500pound bundles and airlifted out For Lt Steve Solus of the Shasta County sheriffs office this operation was one of dozens of raids on illegal pots farms this year Theres lots of water The growing temperature is just right The elevations are just right And the big thing here they have too is I5Interstate 5 Solus says All of those conditions make it easy to transport the marijuana out he says Marijuana Fields In Northern California Marijuana seizures are running at record levels in California having more than tripled since 2005 But drug agents say they are getting only a fraction of the total crop And in Californias saturated pot market dealers big and small are moving the drug out of state in ever larger quantities using everything from overnight delivery services to tractortrailers Were seeing more and more of the marijuana cultivated in California being exported where there is a market that will pay more says Bill Ruzzamenti a former special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration who now heads a regional agency that monitors drug trafficking in California Ruzzamenti says the pot cultivation boom in California began soon after voters legalized medical marijuana 14 years ago Now he believes California could be a net exporter of the drug Literally we have had shipments of marijuana from California seized in all 50 states Ruzzamenti says And theyre going to where they can maximize their profits The surging demand for Californiagrown marijuana is good news for some growers and bad news for the drug war But the trend could challenge a key goal of Proposition 19  wiping out the illegal drug trade The Effect On The Black Market A TV ad featuring former San Jose police chief Joe McNamara began airing this week claiming that if passed Proposition 19 will generate billions of dollars for local communities allow police to focus on violent crimes and put drug cartels out of business In an interview McNamara drew parallels to the repeal of alcohol prohibition Al Capone and his bootleg gangsters were shooting up the streets not because they were drunk on booze It was for the vast underworld profits And once alcohol was legalized it put them out of business as bootleggers And thats the goal of Prop 19 that would be achieved very quickly McNamara said But opponents argue the black market will persist because the measure will not change federal law or statutes in other states There are millions of plants being grown illegally says George Mull who heads the California Cannabis Association a medical marijuana group that opposes Proposition 19 A lot of it is being sent out of the state Theres no way to think that if Prop 19 passes those same people are going to register theirmarijuanagrows and then keep all of their plants here in California Mull says even if Proposition 19 passes the black market will continue because prices will stay higher in other states where pot remains illegal leaving in place a premium for smugglers Theres a great deal of incentive to sell your product where you can get a higher price Mull says The Growers Perspective NPR spoke with more than a dozen growers from big illegal players to smallscale cultivators and they agreed that the black market would persist unless marijuana is legalized at a national level One of them is an illegal grower who works in a bunkerlike growing facility located in a rural area north of San Francisco In a large garage retrofitted with vents fans and expensive air filters several rows of squat marijuana plants stand in 20gallon pots with buds about the size of golf balls almost ready for harvest The grower who spoke on the condition of anonymity has grown marijuana illegally for years He has also acted as a broker to major trafficking groups that ship thousands of pounds of pot out of California every six months He says legalization in California would force prices down and probably take street dealers out of business But higher prices for exports would keep other illegal growers and dealers afloat Even a massive crackdown by law enforcement probably would not affect the underground market Where there is demand and big profits to be made there will always be supply the man said But other growers say its not just money that keeps the black market alive The Cowboy Mentality There is a tradition that we come from here that is of the cowboy mentality And that is steeped and it runs very very deep says Gabriel Martin who runs a legal medical marijuana collective in the coastal town of Ft Bragg Calif On a recent evening Martin was busy making a batch of his special hash which requires mixing marijuana stems and leaves with crushed ice and then filtering the concoction through a washing machine Martin says many growers like himself support Proposition 19 because they are willing to trade high profits for a greater sense of security and community But he says that does not mean the underground trade will go away This is what I tell people I mean if youre going to engage in contraband sales  or private sales as we call them  that market is going to consistently exist he says Its anywhere you have finance youre going to haveablack market Parallels Between Alcohol And Marijuana Some California law enforcement officials worry that the black market could grow even stronger with criminal gangs using legalization as a cover for massive smuggling operations But former police chief McNamara says similar arguments were made against the lifting of alcohol prohibition and they proved wrong He says marijuana is no different Commercial growers would be regulated he says They would be controlled They would be subject to law enforcement And if they were illegally exporting the drug that would be against California law as well McNamara says he hopes the push for legalization will spread across the country making it easier to enforce state regulations California voters will decide for themselves on Nov 2 This story was produced as part of a collaboration between member station

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130855252&ft=3&f=,Deron Snyder is a regular contributor to The Root Banning menthol cigarettes which 80 percent of AfricanAmerican smokers prefer wont make folks quit As with virtually every other AfricanAmerican smoker I know the only acceptable brands of cigarettes for me came in greenandwhite packs If you didnt puff Salems  my cancer sticks of choice  you probably consumed Newports or Kools I always found it odd that the top three brands shared the same color scheme It took a few years to realize that menthol was another commonality which Dave Chappelle had fun with on his I Know Black People gameshow sketch on his Comedy Central show He asked contestants why blacks love menthol so much I dont know said a social worker That is correct Chappelle said No one knows for sure Whatever the reason for that preference  shared by an estimated 80 percent of black smokers according to most reports  cigarette manufacturers and antitobacco groups are well aware that we favor menthol But a proposed ban on mentholated cigarettes has caused a rift among forces that advocate on behalf of blacks interests In one corner favoring a ban are the NAACP the National African American Tobacco Prevention Network and the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council In opposition are the Congress of Racial Equality the National Black Chamber of Commerce and the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives The NAACP joined the debate last week just three days after the other groups urged the Food and Drug Administration to reject calls for a ban on menthol flavored cigarettes The issue appears to be a Catch22 You either support blacks access to a dangerousbutlegal product and arguably sustain its usage or you support discrimination against the mostly black consumers of a dangerousbutlegal product and arguably promote growth in the illicit cigarette trade I havent been a smoker for more than 20 years and have no intention of picking up the habit again But if I did and discovered that my Salems were forbidden while those disgusting Marlboros were still on sale Id be livid Why would the government ban the cigarettes that I prefer while the estimated 78 percent of nonLatino white smokers who prefer nonmentholated cigarettes are allowed to keep on puffing Were in dangerous territory when the government functions as Big Brother and the same is true when it operates as Big Daddy Lawmakers shouldnt try to legislate the behavior of grown folks on health choices such as soda fast food or mentholated cigarettes There must a middle ground between paternalism and absolute laissezfaire Im not suggesting the social acceptance of crystal meth and heroin But Prohibition didnt work too well with alcohol and ground is being gained on the legalization of marijuana in some states Cigarettes would never get legal approval if they were hitting the market today But were way past the point where the government can just outlaw them Try as it might the government cant even tax them away as evidenced by the rise of smuggling operations A Department of Justice report states that cigarette smuggling into the United   States is a significant problem that attracts international and domestic criminal groups with the lure of high profits and relatively low risk If a ban is passed the inevitable rise in illicit menthol cigarettes concerns black law officers Jessie Lee Executive Director of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives writes In Canada studies have shown that the size of the contraband market there  caused by substantial tax increases  is so substantial that it represents half of all cigarette smoking in some provinces Its an amazing statistic One of every two cigarettes sold in some areas are illegal As much as we wish that smokers would quit or never get started in the first place we have to accept their existence Weve done our best to make the habit inconvenient and socially unacceptable shunning smokers from public places indoors and outside Weve restricted tobacco manufacturers ability to market their products though cigarettes are still the most heavily advertised drug in America according to the American Academy of Pediatrics But health officials know that tobacco is a powerful adversary and cigarettes offer a persistent appeal to old and young alike A report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found 81 percent of teen smokers preferred the same three brands favored by adults Marlboro Newport and Camel More than threequarters of black high school smokers preferred Newport Banning Newports or other mentholated brands isnt the answer not unless all cigarettes are banned Education and enforcement of underage smoking laws is the best bet Other efforts to reduce cigarette use should be applied evenly across the board with the full realization that many smokers will continue to satisfy their habit  with or without government approval Copyright 2014 The Root,20101027,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130829657&ft=3&f=,Ed Kilgore is a special correspondent for The New  Republic He is also Managing Editor of The Democratic Strategist and a senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute  Californias ballotinitiative system has a way of touching off culture wars that dwarf the buzz surrounding mere state and congressional elections Think of Proposition 8 or Proposition 187 But even by California standards this years Proposition 19 is becoming something of a legend In case you havent heard Proposition 19 would legalize the possession and cultivation of small quantities of marijuana while enabling the state andor local governments in theory at least to license and tax larger commercial potgrowing enterprises The initiative has been hailed not only by Californians with a taste for cannabis but by economic boosters who hope it would transform California by creating a massive new growth industry that solves the states chronic fiscal problems In fact theres so much interest in Proposition 19 that polls show nearly everyone in California already knows about the initiative  without advocacy groups spending more than a few dimes As Firedoglakes Jon Walker explains According to a Field Poll as of midSeptember a remarkable 84 percent of likely voters in California know that prop 19 is on the ballot Among that same group just under 40 percent had heard about Prop 23 and Prop 25 two other important measures to be decided this November For a historic comparison look at the numbers for 2008s Prop 8 Californias hotly contested antigay marriage initiative from around roughly the same time in the election cycle A Field poll from midSeptember 2008 found that only 70 percent of likely voters had heard that Proposition 8 was on the ballot Even more impressive than the generally high awareness of Prop 19 among voters is how nearly every likely voter under 30 has heard of Prop 19 Looking at the cross tabs via the Sacramento Bee from this Field Poll we see 944 percent of likely voters under 30 have heard or read about Prop 19 To give you an idea of how broad this awareness is that 56 percent who is unaware is probably greater than the polls margin of error for that subgroup Almost no politician in the country has name recognition among young voters anywhere near 944 percent This phenomenon is making it extremely difficult for political analysts to gauge support for Proposition 19 via traditional means For one the marijuanalegalization initiative has not generated the kind of epic pro and con spending that usually has a major effect on voter attitudes The most prominent opposition group Public Safety First had spent about a quartermillion dollars as of October 16 the California equivalent of pocket change  something all the more remarkable when you consider that virtually every major statewide candidate has gone on record opposing the initiative The biggest spender on the pro side a medicalmarijuana dispensary which may be positioning itself to become a major commercial pot retailer in the future has spent under a million dollars Until yesterday neither side had run TV ads Meanwhile about 120 million is being spent on other California initiatives including around 37 million on Prop 23 pro 9 million anti 28 million which would suspend the states landmark carbonemissions law 25 million on the far less sexy Prop 25 pro 8 million con 17 million which would abolish the twothirds requirement for passing a budget in the state legislature and even 5 million on Prop 22 pro 4 million con about 1 million which involves an arcane system whereby the state borrows local transportation funds Three recent polls have shown support for the measure dropping into negative territory ReutersIpsos 43 percent yes  53 percent no PPIC 44 percent yes  49 percent no and LA TimesUSC 31 percent yes  59 percent no SurveyUSA still has the initiative with majority support at 48 percent to 44 percent but it also shows opinion trending negative But because of the unusual nature of Proposition 19 many analysts are loath to take them at face value They are concerned that numbers might be skewed by something like a stoner Bradley Effect  Nate Silver has dubbed it the Broadus Effect after Snoop Dogg  in which marijuanalegalization supporters tell interviewers they dont favor legalized pot when they actually do With the Bradley Effect raciallymotivated voters wont admit to pollsters that race would affect their votes Theres some evidence that this is occurring since the anonymous robopoller SurveyUSA  which would be least likely to skew in this way  shows the strongest levels of support for the initiative But there are factors pushing the other direction too One possible explanation for the polling trend is that Governor Arnold Schwarzeneggers apparent effort to undercut Proposition 19 by pushing through legislation that all but decriminalizes smallscale pot possession has worked This new law which Schwarzenegger signed on September 30 makes possession of under one ounce of pot an infraction punishable by a 100 fine  significantly less than the average California speeding ticket This may have deflated support for Proposition 19 among voters who are less motivated by the desire to fire up a doobie themselves as by concerns about the injustices caused particularly against minorities by criminal sanctions on the use of marijuana Another possibility is that voters were affected by the publicity surrounding US Attorney General Eric Holders assurances that the feds will not let California license commercial marijuana operations This statement makes the economic and fiscal arguments for Proposition 19 a great deal weaker And finally it may be that softer support for Proposition 19 has been revealed by likelyvoter screens  which pollsters usually introduce closer to Election Day and which tend to focus on an electorate that is older and whiter than the registeredvoter or all adults samples typically applied earlier in the electoral cycle Only on election night will we know the voters true intentions No one should be that astonished if Proposition 19 passes and it may well be that the prolegalization youth vote can rescue a few notable Democrats in very close races As it is Jerry Brown appears to be pulling away from Meg Whitman in the governors race despite or maybe even due to eMegs astonishing campaign spending and Barbara Boxer is maintaining a small but steady lead over Carly Fiorina Yet by the same token it would be a little foolish for Democrats to rest all their hopes on a lastminute unpolled surge of potsmoking youngsters at the polls Theyve been burned that way before Copyright 2014 The New

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130755883&ft=3&f=,The debate over the California initiative to legalize marijuana has formed some unlikely alliances On one side some stoners and marijuana growers oppose Proposition 19 while some cops and mothers support legalization Californians will vote whether to make recreational marijuana legal on Nov 2 Currently in the state anyone with a doctors recommendation can use pot as medicine but this initiative would allow local and state government to tax and regulate all marijuana At a garden cafe in Sonoma County Dragonfly de la Luz lights up her glass Hello Kitty pipe filled with primo California weed I get stoned every day she says through clouds of marijuana smoke De la Luz is a marijuana connoisseur for West Coast Cannabis and Skunk magazines and TVs Cannabis Planet She has a monthly column called Getting High with Dragonfly in which she reviews the latest flavors of ganja My favorite strain these days has to be Dr Walkers Daze she says Its a pretty epic mood elevator Youre instantly happy and you stay happy De la Luz says she was excited at first to hear California was trying to legalize pot I thought it was a dream come true she says Then I read it and realized it was a nightmare Shes now actively campaigning with her group Stoners Against Prop 19 She says the initiative would create too many restrictions Californians would be able to legally possess process share or transport only one ounce of pot And they would be able to grow it only in a 25squarefoot area These exotic strains that we know and love are going to quickly become obsolete because a 5by5 space is just not enough space to breed and experiment with all these new strains she says It would be a real shame if we lost all of this variety Big Business Takeover  Proposition 19 allows local governments to license commercial marijuana companies which worries selfprofessed stoners like de la LuzWere kind of like antiWalMart and antiMcDonalds she says So for them to try to sneak in and turn cannabis into a corporation thats disgusting As the election nears de la Luz has been debating opponents and trying to convince other pot smokers Her arguments worked on a man who calls himself Ali Baba whos in California for the marijuana harvest season and stopped by to share a few joints This particular cannabis this Dr Walkers Daze this beautiful frosty sativa bud Im holding did not come from a licensed dispensary de la Luz tells him Under Prop 19 it would be illegal for me to possess and smoke this It looks a lot more like freedom today in California than it would be if Prop 19 were to pass Why would it be illegal Ali Baba asks Because Prop 19 prohibits possession of cannabis that was bought anywhere other than a licensed dispensary she explains Wow he says Theyre really trying to capitalize on this industry You guys better vote no Hallelujah brother says de la Luzs friend Chris Wilson as he highfives Ali Baba Wilson says hes a smalltime grower who ekes out a living cultivating medical marijuana for himself and a collectiveIts borderline legal illegal grayarea stuff he says breeding high strain high quality high medicinal marijuana in a sacred way Wilson says Proposition 19 would put him out of business He wouldnt be able to grow enough to supply himself much lessthe collective And hed have to pay taxes and fees to operate Theyre going to tax the hell out of meWilson says And I barely make it as it is Im just getting by Theyre taxing everybody they can just because California is in debt They see the money can be made like unbelievable taxation enough to push me out of business Another grower named Jay doesnt want to use his last name because part of his crop ends up on the black market He cultivates his plants in his garage like so many others in a cottage industry of momandpop pot growers who fuel the economies of Mendocino Humboldt and Trinity countiesknown as the Emerald Triangle in Northern California Jay worries that legalization will flood the market as people grow their own marijuana and bigger businesses take over Everyones really scared of the prices going down he says We all have invested money here we all live here I have a daughter here my wifes a teacher Everyones scared because we dont know what the prices are going to be Already the prices have gone down and down Its harder to sell it Like many who live off the grid in Mendocino Michael Dork grows his pot outdoors He says he doesnt want to live by anybody elses rules I really dont want to be on the map AndI think it would affect the high I believe more in being free of all that stuff he says Cops Say Yes On the other side Proposition 19 also has some unlikely allies a group of former judges prosecutors and cops are all for legalizing pot No one in the history of marijuana use has ever died of an overdose from marijuana says Stephen Downing a retired deputy chief of the LAPD Downing says marijuana is less harmful than alcohol or tobacco And he says arresting people for possessing marijuana is a waste of time for police he says instead they should be solving violent crimes and targeting those controlling the black market Marijuana provides 95 percent of the cartels profits says Downing citing the hundreds of murders along the USMexico border attributed to the drug cartels And theyre using the hundreds of thousands of gang members to bring about  their distribution their collections their enforcement and their  assassinations We have a major major violence problem and if we take the cartels profits away were going to start drying them up Downing says taxing and regulating marijuana would be a start William Cox is another member of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition or LEAP The former LAPD sergeant and LA county district attorney says officers are more likely to bust young AfricanAmericans and Latinos on marijuana charges The white kids are not swept up in this because they are able to have the resources to get out of it if they are caught Cox says Police officers often will let them off the hook if they catch them with a small amount of marijuana If they are white middleclass and acting respectfully toward the officers theyre told to go home Moms Against Prohibition The push to legalize recreational marijuana has other unlikely supporters moms A small group of mothers gathered at a childrens playground in West  Hollywood last week to advocate for regulation Among them was Skyla Chapman who brought her yearandahalfold daughter Isis to the Yes on 19 event When its regulated then its no longer in the drug dealers hands Its in respectable businesses hands Theyll card or ID you she says Proposition 19 would ban smoking pot on school grounds and around minors Only adults older than 21 could possess cultivate or transport marijuana for personal use Marijuana activist Dale Sky Jones who is eight months pregnant saysher groupis following the lead of mothers in the 1930s who helped end the ban on alcohol Prohibition ended because of moms Jones says They knew the true danger from prohibition violence profits illegality This is an opportunity to end a failed policy Jones says Proposition 19 would put marijuana sales out of the hands of criminals and in the hands of those that will control cannabis away from children If Proposition 19 passes California would make history as the first state to legalize recreational marijuana But with some moms for it and some stoners just saying no its a complicated issue that many voters are still trying to wrap their heads around Copyright 2014 NPR,20101029,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/2010/10/21/130706611/for-u-s-troops-peril-on-the-afghan-pakistan-border?ft=3&f=,Standing next to a dusty helipad in eastern  Afghanistan earlier this month Kenneth Bolin the bulletheaded first sergeant  of Alpha Company gives his men a little advice Dont go down the cliff he barks instructing his men in how to disembark safely from their helicopter Left door exit half the birds going to be hanging over a cliff Birds going to be wobbly a bit Dont rush out the door Make sure youre on solid ground Afghanistan combines some of the worlds roughest wartorn mountains with one of the worlds most complicated political landscapes American soldiers such as these navigate both kinds of terrain Like most of the troops in Afghanistans Kunar River valley Alpha Company of the 3327 Infantry 101st Airborne Division had passed the first two weeks of October scrambling up and down the mountains looking for Linda Norgrove the Scottish aid worker kidnapped in September They scaled 10000foot peaks searching for Norgrove and set up blocking positions to prevent her captors from slipping her into Pakistan On Oct 8 Special Forces found Norgrove but accidentally killed her in a rescue attempt Many of the soldiers in Alpha Company felt sad about it but mostly they were dogtired and ready to get back to their home bunks at a small mountain outpost called Monti The Soviets  and before them the British  had a base in the same spot commanding a view of the Kunar River valley as well as a few other mountain passes toward the border Americans renamed it Monti after an Army sergeant who was awarded the Medal of Honor In fact all four of the Medals of Honor given in Afghanistan came from heroic acts in Kunar province which might say something about the desperate fighting that has gone on in the mountains along the Pakistani tribal areas A Rescue Call On The Pakistan Border After the search for Norgrove ended Alpha Company was just beginning to push out on foot patrols again last week when Capt Thomas Billig got the call A US Chinook helicopter  a titanic bananashaped craft with a propeller at each end  had landed at the Ghakhi Pass border crossing with Pakistan When the gaping hatch of the chopper opened an insurgent fired a rocketpropelled grenade inside An Afghan interpreter died several were wounded and everyone on the landing zone took smallarms fire Next to the LZ military shorthand for the helicopter landing zone Staff Sgt Scott Mark prepped his men for battle Every element out there under contact right now You got friendlies everywhere and Taliban everywhere Its a hot LZ OK he said The troops scrambled  even though some of them had been out on a patrol that morning at 3 am They crowded into Black Hawk helicopters but then flew to another base to wait Sitting in the hot sun next to a dusty helicopter landing zone with all the water and ammunition they could carry some of them fell asleep on the gravel Darkness brought a chill with it and Alpha Company didnt move out again until midnight Hanging Off A Cliff In The Dark Of Night By that time the battle was over but the Chinook was still a mess and blocking the helipad So the men jumped from a wobbling helicopter with just one wheel on the ground and the other side of the bird hanging over a cliff at 7000 feet The moon had long ago set and even with night vision goggles the men couldnt see each others faces They walked past the broken Chinook which mechanics were stripping down so it could be hoisted out by another chopper Alpha Company walked down a steep mountain track wondering if there were any more insurgents on the hillside Sgt Jon Horton radioed with the jets and choppers up above  earlier they had dropped a 500pound bomb on a compound up the ridgeline That house that has that flag on it There are two individuals hes just confirmed Horton said into the handset But hes not going to fly over it because hes pretty sure its Pakistan Yeah it is Well theyre watching us After walking about half a mile the men from Alpha Company stopped at their objective a series of bunkered outposts astride the road They cleared the rooms out but discovered some strange litter  nice sleeping bags fleece jackets and uniforms  quite valuable in Afghanistan and strange things to leave behind The men were tired so they established a guard duty while the others pulled out their sleeping bags and crashed on the dirt floor curled up for warmth A chilly dawn drew back the curtain on a stunning view of the valley to the west into Afghanistan and razor wire marking the Pakistan border just 50 yards east But a stranger sight lay across the dirt road  a concrete building that looked as if a bomb was dropped on it But it wasnt said one soldier The Mystery Of The Abandoned Base It wasnt blown up they abandoned this he said This was all selfdestruction Like the vehicles that we passed way up there they just abandoned all these compounds Im not sure the reasoning behind it Part of the reasoning has to do with who left this compound in such a hurry  the soldiers all refer to them as the OGA which stands for Other Government Agency and is common slang for the CIA The CIA declined to comment But interviews with Pakistani border guards and US soldiers and some Pakistani press reports all suggest that the CIA built this massive base compound more than two years ago The construction included a road the helicopter landing zone and several hard structures including one at the top of the mountain called Camp  Karzai Now its all charred and demolished Up the hill half a dozen vehicles are jammed together and burned Another brandnew pickup has had the engine stripped out An Army generator sits in one demolished building The occupants appear to have left in a hurry though with few signs of battle other than a floor littered with shells from a beltfed machine gun The sight of hundreds of thousands of dollars wasted doesnt go down well with the soldiers in Alpha Company but theyve got a more personal gripe Many of them spent the summer fighting in the valley to the west  killing scores of Taliban and losing some of their own  in an operation called Strong Eagle meant to clear the Taliban out of the area The OGA base at the Ghakhi  Pass served to keep the border under control the soldiers say The Taliban Reseeding The Valley But when this base was evacuated all the US military assets in this part of Kunar were looking for Norgrove and there was no time to send anyone to the border The soldiers in Alpha Company draw a clear line from the abandoned compounds  what they say was a spy base  the rocketpropelled grenade that hit the Chinook helicopter The Taliban has reseeded the valley a little bit  not to the extent it was before when we first cleared it out says Billig Alpha Companys commander The bird Chinook came here and took contact as a result of this position being abandoned The day turns out quiet and a few of the officers in Alpha Company make an effort at a little international diplomacy Lt Ken Kovach clambers down the hill behind the outpost to chat with the Pakistani border guards who seemed just as curious It gets a little testy when one Pakistani tells him with rough translation by an Afghan interpreter that he thinks Americans dont care about Pakistan How can he believe that Kovach says We have our helicopters giving aid for all the flooded areas How can he believe we dont want to help them Tempers are soothed quickly when the Pakistanis bring milky chai which they pass carefully in white teacups through the razor wire to the Americans Billig the company commander goes a step further some hours later and strolls with a few of his men down to the Ghakhi border point where his counterpart on the Pakistani side Lt Colonel Ahmed Salim is Anything we can do for you youre just welcome says Salim a tall man with a neatly trimmed mustache Mistrust Along the Border American officials say the Pakistani army has made gains in Bajaur the tribal district across the way but theres still mistrust Elements of the Taliban and alQaida are believed to cross the border at this point from safe havens inside Pakistan There are misgivings on the other side as well All of the Pakistani border guards have put reflective tape in a cross on top of their helmets  to keep Americans drones from bombing them they say Still Salim invites the Americans across the border for lunch pointing them up some steps to his outpost Several of the US soldiers flinch On the rooftop are three dozen men with beards turbans and Kalashnikov rifles But theyre not Taliban Salim insists Dont think they are Talibs he says with a laugh They are the local Lashgar who are working with us  the local population which is supporting the government Billig accepts the invitation despite some strained looks from his men and walks up the stairs to a Pakistani banquet of chicken mutton rice lentils and yogurtThe conversation is friendly but it starts with a rather pointed question from the host about the empty bases up the hill Why didnt you tell us they were pulling out Salim wants to know adding that his border guards would have adjusted if they knew the other side was suddenly going to be empty Without mentioning the OGA Billig simply nods in agreement and allows that the abrupt departure came as a surprise to him as well Taliban In Their Midst The long lunch ends when the Pakistani colonel is called away and the Americans walk back up the hill Full bellies heavy flak jackets and the altitude at 7000 feet have everyone moving a bit slowly but then they get some information from their interpreter that makes them walk a little faster The interpreter tells the soldiers that some of the Pakistani commanders men are spies for the Taliban So he suggests we get out of here quickly a soldier tells Billig Returning to the abandoned compound the soldiers find Afghan border guards have arrived They emerge from one of the bombedout rooms in a cloud of pungent smoke marijuana plants cover the hills like milkweed Some of the members of the Afghan force who appear to be less stoned than others talk for a while with the Americans about how many reinforcements theyll need to hold this border But its a bit of a fiction The Afghan border police dont have the helicopters to resupply this place and the road from the center of Kunar is far too dangerous for them to travel And its not clear the Americans will be manning it either despite the strategic importance of the pass Later in the afternoon Lt Col Joel Vowell shows up to award a couple of citations Im damn proud of you guys Vowell says I think whats going to happen here is another two days or so were waiting for Afghan border police So were going to clear it hold it and then put the Afghan border police in here And if they dont want to come in here were going to go home Back to Monti he says In fact the men from Alpha Company dont even stay the night With dusk comes an order to pack up and march up the hill again to the landing zone where the broken Chinook helicopter is ready to be hoisted away After getting warmed up on the hike the Alpha guys sit for another several hours in the cold as choppers come and go blasting them with dust Near midnight the Chinook is lifted out like a bundle in a storks beak Then the guys from Alpha make it back to Outpost Monti in the small hours of the morning take showers and get ready for more foot patrols in the hills of Kunar Copyright 2014 NPR,20120523,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130186398&ft=3&f=,In Los Angeles medical marijuana dispensaries once outnumbered Starbucks But after months of a major crackdown the number of pot clinics has plummeted Now a series of lawsuits and counterlawsuits over city regulations is playing out in court And its still uncertain how many dispensaries will be left in LA when the smoke clears Magnets For Criminals In some neighborhoods the drama over marijuana clinics continues Take for example Eagle Rock Its filled with Craftsmanstyle homes oldfashioned shops and hipster coffeehouses Its like this little bucolic kind of a throwback town and yet here it is literally like the pot dispensary capital says disheartened resident Ellia Glassing Yeah we moved to Weedville says Carrie Hanson another resident Glassing and Hanson say they support providing patients with medical marijuana But they say thats not who theyre seeing at the dispensaries on the streets where they live The guys who walk in and out look like a bunch of young healthy guys Hanson says They just feel they are above the law Glassing adds They look like theyre walking fine to me and theyre happy and theyre ready to deal the dope to the car that pulls up behind them From her kitchen Glassing says she sees people smoking their medicine on the streets in the parking lots and outside her home They deal they smoke they litter they urinate she says and there have been confrontations Some of the citys marijuana dispensaries have become magnets for criminals wanting cash and pot and even the site of murders including a recent triple homicide Frustrating City Regulations In April police began cracking down on clinics that werent legally registered with Los Angeles with the goal of reducing the numbers from more than 800 citywide to something more manageable Theres going to be somewhere between 70 and 180 shops that will be open for you as patients provided they arent breaking other laws special assistant city attorney Jane Usher told Eagle Rock neighbors at a recent community meeting Usher drafted LAsmedical marijuana ordinance which allows only those dispensaries that correctly registered in 2007 to operate legally Usher admits that the city regulations have been frustrating to those who want access to their medicine and frustrating for those who want to limit the number of marijuana outlets Lots of people in our community say They are open today And the next day they call us and say Theyre closed And the next day Op They opened up again  Usher said Hey look we are trying to be as responsive to your issues and concerns as possible She asked the residents for patience till we get it right Violating A Technicality The city attorney is now suing many of the dispensaries still operating and there are at least 35 countersuits challenging LAs regulations So its not clear how many will be left until the courts sort it out Im not saying to let it be the Wild West or have a freeforall and allow collectives to run rampant says attorney David Welch who represents 80 dispensaries in LA I think the city needs to develop reasonable regulation Some of the dispensaries Welch represents registered with the city on time some of them didnt In court Welch has been arguing that the city ordinance sets an arbitrary limit without due process before ordering shops to close He notes that the city accepts tax dollars from the dispensaries and some of them have building permits allowing them to operate as marijuana collectives The truth is these are legitimate businesses and organizations he says adding that they are nonprofit Still the city clerks office found that only 41 of the dispensaries thought to be operating legally have actually met LAs requirements The rest face closure for violating a technicality in the law that states they cannot change ownership or management The city attorneys office has been overtly hostile towards medical marijuana since the beginning says Michael Backes who runs Cornerstone Research Collective in Eagle Rock Its one of the dispensaries that may be forced to close which Backes says is absurd given how squeaky clean we try to operate Cornerstone has a reputation for providing scientific research and homegrown marijuana to patients suffering from cancer or other diseases Backes says dispensaries like his are unfairly being swept up with what he calls fly by night pot shops those simply in business for a profit and those with questionable patients Backes says the city didnt grant conditional use permits or make the process a meritocracy Instead theyre trying to reduce the numbers by whatever method is available to them he says We just think its absurd But could all of this be a moot point if California voters legalize the recreational use of marijuana in November Some say if the public referendum is adopted it will make marijuana so widely available that it could hurt the demand for medicinal pot Others say the new laws would make it easier for dispensaries to operate Those are just more uncertainties the dispensaries face as they battle for their futures in court Copyright 2014

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130185883&ft=3&f=,In Washington theyre arguing about taxing rich people Much like the debate in Congress about extending the socalled Bush tax cuts a ballot initiative in Washington state comes down to the question of whether top earners should pay more in taxes The initiative would create the states first personal income tax since the 1930s It would apply only to individuals who make more than 200000 a year or couples making at least 400000 The initiative has triggered an argument between some of the states wealthiest citizens with Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his father favoring the tax and current Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Amazoncoms Jeff Bezos lined up against it Thats just one of several initiatives related to taxes that are on the Washington state ballot this November Across the country voters will decide on measures regarding union organizing smoking bans and whether they want to block the new federal health care law A Lot About Pot As opposed to recent election cycles theres not one issue that stands out as dominant across numerous states like gay marriage or minimumwage increases in past years But medical marijuana initiatives which have cropped up in many states are on the ballot in Arizona and South Dakota Oregon which has already approved medical marijuana usage will decide whether to create dispensaries as a way to let people buy it Californias Proposition 19 meanwhile would legalize marijuana sales If that measure passes Oregon state Rep Peter Buckley said Monday he would introduce similar legislation in his state next year The motivation for Buckley as with most elected officials in California who are backing Proposition 19 is the possibility of collecting tax revenue from legal regulated sales of pot Its Money That Matters Fiscal questions in fact have emerged as atop issuein ballot measures this year Voters in Massachusetts will decide whether to cut their own sales taxes by more than half to 3 percent They will also decide whether to repeal a tax on alcohol In Missouri voters statewide will decide whether a local income tax imposed by St Louis and Kansas City should be subject to local voter approval Californians will choose not only whether to tax marijuana sales but whether to erect taller hurdles preventing the Legislature from imposing all manner of fees and charges There are efforts to increase revenues and to cut taxes says Jennifer Drage Bowser who tracks ballot measures for the National Conference of State Legislatures There are just a lot of things with big dollar signs associated with them Voters dont automatically embrace the idea of lower taxes Massachusetts voters in 2008 overwhelmingly rejected a measure to abolish the state income tax This past May Arizona voters approved a penny increase in the state sales tax But Bowser points out that the mood may have shifted given the continuing problems in the economy and rise of the Tea Party movement Who Pays The Bill Ballot initiatives have become a big money concern themselves Campaign spending in support of a single initiative can reach into the tens of millions of dollars Most initiatives reach the ballot as the result of paid signature gatherers not volunteer efforts They are often sponsored by people or groups who have a direct financial interest in their outcome  often from out of state Charles and David Koch oil billionaires in Kansas gave 1 million earlier this month to support Proposition 23 which would suspend Californias global warming law that seeks to reduce energy consumption and emissions until the states unemployment rate drops below 55 percent The American Beverage Association has spent more than 14 million seeking to defeat Washingtons initiative to impose beverage and candy taxes Also in Washington retailers and beer distributors are spending millions attacking each others arguments about two separate initiatives that would privatize sales of alcohol Were not shying away from the fact that retailers will certainly find some financial benefit about this says Ashley Bach spokesman for one of the initiative campaigns But he says The no side has received three times the amount of money that we have Letting The Voters Decide In other words ballot measures sometimes amount to interest group warfare by other means The idea that impassioned volunteer citizens are collecting signatures is a romantic notion says Bowser of NCSL The initiative process is owned  lock stock and barrel  by the moneyed interests There are very few exceptions to that Paul Jacob president of Citizens in Charge which promotes the initiative process does not agree There are certainly moneyed interests behind many ballot measures Jacob says but he points out that they dont always win Its still up to the voters This year Jacob notes a number of measures were put there by legislatures themselves Theyve seen that contentious measures that win voter approval can have a lot more impact  and influence in other states  than laws passed by politicians themselves Its this desire to affect the national debate at the state level Jacob says They want voters to be focused on it They want that success at the ballot box not just in the legislature Copyright 2014 NPR,20101001,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129930970&ft=3&f=,Marijuana advocates have been arguing for years that pot is not only harmless but has beneficial qualities Such claims are having an effect Fewer than half of Americans think marijuana should be legalized  but just barely half The most recent Gallup and CBS News polls on this topic both show that 44 percent favor legalization Compare that with roughly 25 percent in favor from the late 1970s into the mid1990s The change in attitude toward pot shows up not only in polls but in use A survey released Thursday by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration showed that use of illegal drugs rose last year to the highest levels in nearly a decade Marijuana use was most prevalent but ecstasy and methamphetamine posted gains too Drug policy experts say this reflects changes in the perceived risks of taking drugs  both of being caught and of suffering societal disapproval A California initiative to legalize marijuana this November would amplify this effect if it passes There is such a push on the part of the marijuana lobby to soften up the public says Eric Voth a physician who chairs the Institute on Global Drug Policy an antidrug alliance of physicians scientists and attorneys The perception of harm has dropped You saw this increase in pot first and now youre seeing this increase in ecstasy and meth Taking It To The States Fourteen states and the District of Columbia allow people to use marijuana for medical purposes such as improving the appetite of cancer and AIDS patients What people are responding to is the realization that the government has been lying for decades and that marijuana is less harmful than legal drugs like alcohol and tobacco says Mike Meno communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project which favors legalization Medical marijuana has become big business Americans are spending 25 billion a year on marijuana according to Harvard University economist Jeffrey Miron The number of patients and licensed dispensers has doubled over the past year in Rhode Island alone In July the Oakland City Council approved construction of four industrialsized marijuana factories Last month the Boulder County SWAT team destroyed 7500 marijuana plants  about five football fields worth But medical marijuana remains a growth industry in Colorado Next week doctors dispensers and marketing experts will gather at a downtown Denver hotel for the Plant Medicine Expo  Healthcare Provider Conference Its way beyond legalizing Voth says The medical excuse opened the door What Goes Down Must Come Up Voth and other drug war veterans say theyve seen this all before During the 1970s about a dozen states decriminalized marijuana Eventually the eras spike in drug use  particularly cocaine  prompted harsher laws under the Reagan administration and a parents movement that forced a crackdown Use of marijuana and other illegal drugs reached their peak in the late 1970s In 1979 1 out of every 3 high school seniors was smoking dope on a regular basis according to Herbert Kleber a Columbia University psychiatrist who served as deputy drug czar under President George HW Bush That number dropped markedly during the early 1990s With people witnessing fewer ill effects due to diminished drug use it started to seem safe again to indulge Drug use isstill nowhere near the levels of the 1970s but the latest figures mark a reversal nonetheless Its not so much that the rise is so great as that it contrasts with the long period of decline says Lloyd Johnston a social psychologist at the University of Michigan Clearly that decade of improvement has come to a halt Changes In Attitude Those who oppose recreational use of marijuana blame the wellorganized and funded campaign to normalize it Attitudes for all kinds of reasons have been softening about the risks and dangers of marijuana says John Carnevale an economist and drug policy consultant who has worked on the issue during both Republican and Democratic administrations including those of presidents Clinton and Reagan Drugs that enjoy a patina of medical approval  whether marijuana or prescription drugs such as OxyContin which has seen enormous growth in recreational use  seem safe or at least safer than street drugs If doctors prescribe them how bad can they be The idea that smoking is medicine is an indicator in the minds of young users that this is not harmful Carnevale says Looking To California California voters who approved a pioneering medical marijuana initiative in 1996 will soon decide whether to legalize marijuana altogether Novembers Proposition 19 has not yet attracted the same number of wealthy outofstate backers such as financier George Soros as the earlier initiative But it has garnered support from a number of state and local officials eager for the billions in tax revenues that legalized pot promises to generate On Monday the Service Employees International Unions California State Council  one of the biggest public employee unions in the state  endorsed Proposition 19 Polls indicate the proposition has roughly a 5050 chance of passing Both marijuana advocates and opponents agree that passage would have an enormous impact with other states likely to follow suit and the drug becoming more readily available to young people If California were to pass Proposition 19 it would be revolutionary says Meno the Marijuana Policy Project spokesman People would see that the sky doesnt fall the police will have more resources to fight crimes and there will be more revenues for local budgets Future Growth  Or Backlash Its not clear how the Obama administration which announced last year that it would end the Bush administration policy of routinely raiding medical marijuana dispensaries would react to outright legalization in one state Every former chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration has called on Attorney General Eric Holder to oppose the initiative I dont expect to see us returning to a drug war hysteria under an Obama administration says Miron the Harvard economist But he adds If Proposition 19 passes some Republicans will get energized and demand that theres a federal response The Obama administration will be in a pickle if that happens They dont want to be fighting over that issue but they dont want to be seen as too much in the prodrug camp Robert L DuPont president of the Institute for Behavior and Health says that regardless of the outcome in California marijuana advocates have already won by shifting the terms of debate and increasing acceptance of drug use He predicts that illegal drug use will continue to rise But DuPont who served as a top drug policy official under Presidents Nixon Ford and Carter also predicts that increasing use will in time bring tolerance to an end Im confident these folks have created the reaction that will stop them he says The datas going to get worse in coming years and thats going to recreate the bipartisan opposition to illegal drug use that we saw between 1979 and 1991 Copyright 2014 NPR,20100918,marijuana

selfdeprecating sexually explicit standup act and for his frequent appearances on Howard Sterns radio shows died Friday from injuries suffered in a car accident He was 60 years oldSchimmels comedy was dark and raunchy and often based on the minutiae of everyday life But his straightshooting standup often touched on provocative moments too when he married and divorced the same woman three times and when he was diagnosed with cancer  the illness that killed his sitcom and then threatened to kill himAfter entering remission Schimmel wrote the memoir Cancer on 5 a Day How Humor Got Me Through the Toughest Journey of My Life  about the insights he gained after his diagnosis and how he was able to find humor in his failing body He joined Terry Gross in March 2008 and described how he viewed the cancer cells invading his lymphatic tissueIts like Robert Schimmel the person  whoevers in my head  that part doesnt have cancer he said And its like Im trapped in a body thats betraying me And I dont feel sick in my head you know You dont feel like youre dying You dont even look bad when you have cancer Its the treatment that makes you look bad and it feels like my bodys the Titanic and its going down and Im the captain of the ship and its going to take me down with it You cant switch to another bodySchimmel was named one of Comedy Centrals 100 Greatest Comics and appeared regularly on the Conan OBrien and Howard Stern shows He is survived by his father a sister a brother and five children a sixth child died of cancer at age 3Interview HighlightsOn receiving his diagnosisI was in the oncologists office with my parents and my wife and he said Theres Hodgkins disease and nonHodgkins lymphoma and you have nonHodgkins And I said You know thats just my luck I got the one thats not named after the guy And he laughed and he said Youre going to be OK And I said How do you know And he said Because of your attitude  youre who you are and youre finding humor And he said thats a healthy thingOn smoking pot during chemotherapy to deal with the side effectsWell I had done it earlier in my life but I was 50 years old and not Rodney Dangerfield so I wasnt doing it then But my mother and father were there in the doctors office And when he said If youre openminded you might consider marijuana because it helps with the nausea and the appetite And it definitely does  But to hear a doctor at Mayo Clinic tell me that its OK to smoke pot in front of my parents was almost worth the diagnosis Because you know it was like Wow where were you 25 years ago Thats when I really needed you On losing his hair south of the borderYou know I was losing my hair anyway before chemotherapy And so just jokingly I said to the guy You got one a hairpiece for you know south of the border And the guy said As a matter of fact we do And I was shocked and he was showing me pictures of them And they basically  it looked like a donut that somebody dropped on a barbershop floor And they had different models It wasnt just one Theres like the executive the adventurer salt and pepper the surfer And it was really the craziest thing that I ever bought in my lifeOn telling his father that he wanted to commit suicide during chemotherapyHe came in and said How you doing And I said Really bad Dad And I said If you really love me youll help me unhook the IV and get me to the window and I want to jump And he said How could you say something like that And I said Because if Im going to die then I want to do it my way And if I jump out the window then I take the cancer with me and it dies the minute I hit the sidewalk And he said Ill be back in a minute And he walked out and came back in with my son Jacob who was 2 years old then and Aliyah my daughter who was 9 years old then and said Tell them what you just told me And I couldntOn watching his young son Derek die of cancerI had this unusual fear of death until I went through that with Derek And it went away And I am convinced that Derek and I are connected from another time another place and that he chose that path to go through what he went through because he knew that I had to watch him go through that for me

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129578732&ft=3&f=,Republicans have been tagged as the Party of No  unfairly they argue despite what their Democratic opponents say is persuasive evidence to the contrary But soon the party  which has employed a disciplined manthebarricades strategy in attempts to block White House legislative efforts from a health care overhaul to Wall Street reforms  will unveil a midterm agenda  And in a campaign climate that increasingly favors their party Republican leaders in the House have insisted that the plan will include specific initiatives on how they would tackle the economy spending and of course health care law  or the repeal or rollback of the overhaul advocated by President Obama and his fellow Democrats Whatever we include in this agenda will be something that we will fight to accomplish  a list of deliverables that have the support of the American people says Brendan Buck of the House Republicans legislative initiatives office House Minority Leader John Boehner appearing to position himself as speakerinwaiting in recent highly publicized speeches has begun to prepare the ground for the partys plan knocking White House economic policy and committing to the war in Afghanistan But despite promisingforRepublicans midterm election polls and prognostications the agenda is being written for a party thats in flux and increasingly fragmented  not only buffeted by the Tea Party fiscal conservatives who have helped dump party regulars like incumbent Alaska Sen Lisa Murkowski but also pressured by loyalists alarmed at the partys direction Republicans have been united strongly on what theyre against not what theyre for says Donald Kettl dean of the University of Marylands public policy school and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution Their challenge is to galvanize around an agenda Kettl says a task he characterizes as complicated by the partys emerging and evolving factions And that includes the one represented by the huge crowd of Tea Party activists and others who showed up Saturday for conservative radio and Fox News Channel talk show host Glenn Becks religiousthemed rally on Washingtons National Mall  a gathering that writer Christopher Hitchens suggested reflected white unease in a rapidly changing country  Not Quite Contract With America The Sequel The new GOP agenda is yet unbranded  the party has been collecting suggestions on a website it calls America Speaking Out But please dont call it a newcentury Contract with America the seminal 1994 manifesto issued by thenHouse Minority Whip Newt Gingrich just weeks before Republicans won surprise control of the House  the partys first majority in the chamber in four decades What will come from Republicans in midSeptember when Congress returns from its summer break will be its own document Buck says And it will be one that party leaders say they hope will help galvanize a message and support but very likely wont be as bold as the 94 contract Though politicos continue to debate the Contract with Americas effect on the 1994 midterm election  well be fighting about that forever says Kettl  there is no argument that it provided GOP lawmakers with a legislative blueprint after their unexpected takeover of the House  While the antigovernment sentiment today is similar to that of the mid1990s when Democrat Bill Clinton occupied the White House experts argue that there are more differences in the current political world than similarities to that time Todays economy is in much worse shape and Republican agendawriters face unique and decidedly delicate intraparty issues that didnt exist back then say experts like Kettl and James Gimpel both of whom have written extensively about the original Contract with America The biggest difference between now and then is that in 1994 there were only one or two people who thought that a Republican takeover of the House was even possible says Gimpel a University of Maryland government professor and former Capitol Hill staffer Now polls and other indicators suggest that a takeover by Republicans is possible and maybe even likely says Gimpel author of Legislating Revolution The Contract with America In Its First 100 Days That seems to me to place a little more weight on the agenda He and others have described the original Contract with America as a set of slogans to draw together the GOP caucus  not a document most expected they would have to act on The growing possibility that the party could win the House suggests Gimpel says that the new document might not be as impressive as the Contract with America in terms of its reach and boldness The original contract set out 10 legislative initiatives from balancing the budget and overhauling the welfare system to requiring congressional term limits and placing limits on adjudicated punitive damages The lasting effect of the original contract outside of the welfare overhaul  which Clinton appropriated as his success  is also debatable Though Gingrich as speaker brought all of the contracts issues to votes in his first 100 days most died in the Senate or on the presidents desk Gingrich resigned after the party suffered damaging losses in the 1998 midterms  Kettl coauthor of Fine Print The Contract With America Devolution and the Administrative Realities of American Federalism argues that the contracts biggest legacy may be simply that it happened and served as a rallying cry for Republicans and told the country where the party stood Its most immediate legacy however was the 1996 reelection of Clinton and the resulting fragmentation of politics he says Though its wrong to blame the contract for all of that the ensuing political battles have taken us to a very bad place for government What Will It Say Republican leaders remain circumspect about the precise ambitions of their agenda including whether it will delve into the sensitive social issues of samesex marriage for example or address some Tea Party activists desires including phasing out Social Security and shuttering the Department of Education But it is almost certain to include pledges to reduce the deficit rein in spending create jobs roll back  or repeal  the recent health care overhaul and crack down on illegal immigration That last issue remains a hot button on the campaign trail despite evidence that as the Pew Hispanic Center reported Wednesday the number of illegal immigrants in the US has fallen for the first time in 20 years thanks in large part to increased enforcement along the borders and tough economic times that have made jobs harder to get The economy has given Republicans plenty of fodder The national unemployment rate has remained stubbornly close to 10 percent and the Census Bureau reported this week that federal domestic spending increased by a record 16 percent last year to 32 trillion Much of that the bureau reported was due to aid to the unemployed and the economic stimulus package  California Republican Rep Kevin McCarthy who chairs the America Speaking Out project has used the metaphor of a Washington drunk with power where elites are living the good life while Main Street is choked with fear and anxiety Those themes are expected to run through the Republican agenda Currently that image of America is being promoted by GOP House members in Speaking Out town meetings across the country The No 1 issue that weve been hearing across the country has been the economy  the lack of jobs the uncertainty out there thats hurting investing and hurting job creation and the deficit McCarthy said Wednesday The House GOP agenda he says wont just be triggered to what happens after the election It will also include legislation that leaders plan to introduce before then You will see legislation introduced and pushed that will help create jobs and control spending McCarthy added The blueprint will also include measures McCarthy said that look to the reform of Washington itself including requirements for reading proposed bills Republicans have already said they will push for that Read the Bill legislation which would require that bills be posted online for 72 hours before being submitted for a final vote in the House Democratic leaders have stymied the proposal At the Speaking Out website which has been subject to some online hazing proponents of legalizing marijuana for example have mounted an impressive effort to get that on the GOP agenda turning back the health care overhaul fiscal discipline and deporting illegal immigrants have been common themes New World Anger Democratic pollster and strategist Doug Schoen suggests that Republicans would be welladvised to stick with basic fiscal issues that have driven the Tea Party movement but steer clear of the more controversial positions taken by some of the movements favorites including GOP Senate candidates Rand Paul in Kentucky and Sharron Angle in Nevada What is animating and motivating people are fiscal issues says Schoen who with conservativeleaning pollster Scott Rasmussen has written a new book Mad As Hell How the Tea Party Movement Is Fundamentally Remaking Our TwoParty System The book is scheduled for release Sept 14 Since the Republican Party itself has been largely bereft of ideas the Tea Parties provide it an outline for an agenda if not a program he says From where I sit its critically important to the health of the Republican Party that it adhere to Tea Party fiscal principles as articulated Schoen also scolds Democrats for failing to respond to fiscal issues that motivated Tea Party adherents and for not competing for a segment of those voters  especially during the past year when the unpopularity of the Republican Party as a whole rivaled the disdain heaped on Democrats According to USA TodayGallup survey results released Wednesday more people now trust Republicans when it comes to the economy and jobs Rasmussen the pollster says that if he were giving Republicans advice it would be this Say you will vote to repeal health care but replace it with more popular reforms  people want health care reform Come up with something on jobs and the economy but put it in the context of why increasing government spending is bad for the economy for your children and grandchildren he also advises Anything you talk about that moves away from the economy spending and the deficit dilutes the message Im not saying that this is healthy for the nation Rasmussen says but its a good political strategy Bottom line he says Whatever the agenda says they better be prepared to act on it And as Gingrich discovered and GOP leaders are no doubt learning an agenda can be a very tricky thing indeed Copyright

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129526384&ft=3&f=,Ethan Nadelmann is the founder and executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance For those of us who fought long and hard to reform the notorious 100toone crackpowder cocaine disparity in federal law the Fair Sentencing Act signed by President Obama on August 3 is at once a historic victory and a major disappointment Its both too little too late and a big step forward The AntiDrug Abuse Act of 1986 which punished the sale of five grams of crack cocaine the same as 500 grams of powder cocaine reflected the bipartisan drug war hysteria of the day and was approved with virtually no consideration of scientific evidence or the fiscal and human consequences The argument for reform has always been twofold sending someone to federal prison for five years for selling the equivalent of a few sugar packets of cocaine is unreasonably harsh and it disproportionately affects minorities almost 80 percent of those sentenced are AfricanAmericans even though most users and sellers of crack are not black The new law increases the amount of crack cocaine that can result in a fiveyear sentence to 28 grams ie an ounce thereby reducing the crackpowder ratio to 18to1 It also eliminates the fiveyear mandatory minimum sentence for simple possession without intent to distribute of crack cocaine thereby marking the first time since 1970 that Congress has repealed a mandatory minimum sentence What is the broader significance of the new law First its one more indication that Obama is making good on his commitment to roll back the drug war Few reformers including myself would have bet that Obama would deliver  in fair measure and within eighteen months  on all three of the pledges he made while running for president He said hed reverse the governments antagonism to state medical marijuana laws  and he did with the Justice Department announcing last fall that it would essentially defer to local authorities in determining whether medical marijuana facilities were operating legally He also said hed support ending the ban on federal funding for needle exchange programs to reduce HIVAIDS  and he did And he said hed push to repeal the crackpowder disparity  which he did That commitment appeared on the White House website within 24 hours of his inauguration Attorney General Eric Holder described it as a personal priority and a legacy issue for him White House and Justice Department officials joined with Congressional Black Caucus CBC members and other top legislators to try to eliminate the disparity  and then to achieve the best possible compromise To be sure the Obama administration has been disappointing on other aspects of drug policy Law enforcement and futile interdiction programs make up the large majority of drug war expenditures as they have since the Reagan era Politics continues to trump science notably in blocking heroin maintenance supervised injection facilities and other harmreduction innovations that have proved highly successful abroad And Obamas drug czar Gil Kerlikowske refuses to acknowledge any merit to the arguments for reforming marijuana policy Theres plenty of work left but at least Obama made good on his specific commitments The victory also showed that traditional civil rights leaders are finally beginning to prioritize criminal justice reform Black support for the late80s drug war helped legitimize the policies that led to the incarceration of millions of young AfricanAmericans The dawning realization of what they had wrought led the Rev Jesse Jackson Representative Charlie Rangel and thenSCLC president Joseph Lowery to start calling for reform of the crackpowder disparity in the early 1990s  but it never became a priority for them the NAACP the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights or the CBC The key advocates for the past two decades have been organizations committed to broader drug and sentencing reform  the ACLU the Open Society Policy Center the Sentencing Project Families Against Mandatory Minimums and my organization the Drug Policy Alliance Some would argue that sentencing reform is still a low priority for most civil rights organizations but at least AfricanAmerican leaders are beginning to own the issue CBC members on the House Judiciary Committee  including Bobby Scott Sheila Jackson Lee Maxine Waters Mel Watt and chair John Conyers  have pushed hard to repeal not just the crackpowder disparity but also mandatory minimum sentencing more generally NAACP president Ben Jealous has described criminal justice reform as his top priority And the Leadership Conference has at last stepped up to the plate Change is clearly afoot Black legislators are often at the forefront of sentencing and other drug policy reform efforts in state capitals Michelle Alexanders powerful new book The New Jim Crow in which she calls out civil rights organizations for failing to grasp that the drug war is accomplishing what Jim Crow once did is stirring up muchneeded debate And the endorsement of Californias marijuana legalization initiative Proposition 19 by both Alice Huffman the influential head of the California NAACP and the National Black Police Association proves that courageous leadership is possible Perhaps most surprising was the apparent ease with which the crackpowder reform gained bipartisan support Dick Durbin may have provided the key leadership in the Senate where the bill passed by unanimous consent but the reform would have died without help from Republicans like Jeff Sessions Orrin Hatch and Lindsey Graham Ditto in the House where support from the libertarian Ron Paul and his Republican colleagues James Sensenbrenner and Dan Lungren both longtime proponents of the drug war trumped the opposition of Lamar Smith the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee Theres no telling what personal political or philosophical considerations motivated these Republicans to abandon their partys obstructionist playbook Hatch and others had advocated for clemency for a few victims of the harsh mandatory minimum laws The laws costs and gross racial disproportionality may have offended core principles Advocates in Congress and outside may have been persuasive And certainly a surprising array of conservatives joined the call for reform including Grover Norquist the libertarian director of Americans for Tax Reform Ward Connerly the influential AfricanAmerican opponent of affirmative action and David Keene chair of the American Conservative Union which hosts the annual Conservative Political Action Conference Also influential was Pat Nolan the formerly incarcerated Republican state legislator from California who spearheaded the campaign by Chuck Colsons Prison Fellowship and its criminal justice reform arm Justice Fellowship to sensitize evangelicals and other conservatives to the injustices of the law This outbreak of bipartisanship is unlikely to extend to other areas of drug policy and criminal justice reform Indeed Senator Tom Coburn who provided crucial support on the crackpowder bill is the principal obstacle to Jim Webbs proposal to create an independent commission on criminal justice policy But the Republicans support represents a tacit acknowledgment that the drug war has gone a bit overboard and that a brief moratorium on tough on crime rhetoric is warranted Whether it provides a precedent for future cooperation remains to be seen So whats next on the agenda The immediate priority is to make the crackpowder reform retroactive so that those already serving harsh sentences will be treated the same as those sentenced in the future The second priority will likely be broader reform of mandatory minimum drug laws The third priority I would argue has to be national reform of marijuana prohibition laws Arrests for marijuana possession typically of tiny amounts account for 44 percent of drug arrests nationwide and disproportionately affect AfricanAmericans Few are being sentenced to long prison terms but most are acquiring criminal records that will handicap them for life Forty percent of Americans possibly more now believe that marijuana should be legally regulated and taxed The same cannot be said of most other illicit drugs If California voters approve Prop 19 in November the country will quickly find itself in the midst of an intense debate on marijuana policy But even if they dont the issue will continue to pop up on ballot initiatives and in state legislatures and Congress As my colleague Jasmine Tyler said regarding the next frontier of drug policy reform and racial justice Its time to make marijuana the new crack Copyright 2014 The Nation,20100830,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129009629&ft=3&f=,Last of five parts Mexico is in the midst of its most violent confrontation with drug traffickers with an estimated 28000 people killed since President Felipe Calderon declared war on drug cartels soon after he took office in late 2006 But drug trafficking has long gone on in Mexico and for many decades operated under the eye of the government according to analysts Mexico changing politics has in effect changed the way drug cartels operate The Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI ruled Mexico for most of the 20th century After 71 years in power the party finally lost the presidency in 2000 From the 1960s through the 80s organized crime was intertwined with the government according to Diego Enrique Osorno a Mexican journalist and author of the recently published history The Sinaloa Cartel In this period you have to remember that the PRI had control of everything Osorno says The PRI controlled the press the oil fields politics and even the narcotics trade Osorno obtained the memoires of Miguel Felix Gallardo the founder of the Guadalajara cartel Gallardo viewed himself as essentially a soldier of the PRI Osorno says He worked for the system to maintain order Back then the PRI had a monopoly on power George Grayson a professor at the College of William and Mary says the PRI covertly cut deals with the criminals to allow a particular trafficker to operate in a particular part of Mexico The capos would pay bribes to local state and federal officials in return the government would turn a blind eye to their activities he says But Mexican drug gangs under the PRI had to follow strict rules They were supposed to act discreetly spurn kidnapping avoid killing civilians and not encroach on another cartels turf  If in fact the cartels broke the rules of the game the PRI had the capacity to come down on them like a ton of bricks Grayson says A major narcotics trafficker at the time was Pablo Acosta In the mid1980s Acosta controlled smuggling along a swath of the Texas border south of El Paso Terrence Poppa a reporter at the El Paso Herald Post wrote a  biography of Acosta titled Drug Lord to try to explain how the Mexican drug trafficking business worked What he discovered shocked him It was an organized type of protection that ran all the way to Mexico City and involved the top layers of government including the president of Mexico he says Poppa found that the governors office in Chihuahua state had sold Acosta the right to control drug smuggling around the border area adjacent to the Big Bend area of Texas Each month Poppa says Acosta paid the local police military and particular PRI officials a cut of his profits Those PRI officials in turn sent money each month to their bosses further up the governmental hierarchy It was a protection setup And this is what Pablo Acosta benefited from And that was how he was able to operate and all other traffickers in Mexico  it was like a universal system  Poppa says With so many people in government getting bribes there was little incentive to crack down on the narcotics trade The PRIs kickback system even encouraged the cartels to expand Poppa says The cartels ramped up their arms smuggling networks They diversified into legitimate businesses to launder their profits They recruited special forces soldiers to be their muscle Then the PRI lost the presidency in 2000 to Vicente Fox and his National Action Party or PAN and Mexico was left with a monster it couldnt control The PRI gave an enormous amount of space for organized crime to flourish Poppa says An enormous amount of space Calderon also of PAN won election in 2006 and succeeded Fox Calderons government is working to crack down on the cartels but organized crime is fighting back with heavy weapons grenades and even car bombs The offensive has destabilized parts of the country scared away foreign investment and left thousands dead And despite the deployment of thousands of federal forces some of the corrupt structures established under the PRI still exist analysts say Calderon has blamed the United States and its appetite for cocaine marijuana and other substances for stoking the conflict through drug consumption Its as if our neighbor were the biggest drug addict in the world he wrote in an editorial printed in Mexican newspapers in June In the Mexican Congress there have been calls for the country to give up the drug war entirely and legalize all narcotics Poppa says that if the United States were to decriminalize drugs it would help eliminate the huge profits garnered by the brutal cartels In my view the best reason for ending drug prohibition is to save Mexico to save the democracy of Mexico that the Mexican people have struggled so hard to gain he says Ironically one of the effects of the drug violence has been a resurgence in popularity for the PRI says Denise Dresser a political scientist in Mexico City  The PRI is seeking to shed its past image as corrupt and authoritarian The party has made gains in recent local elections and is seeking to regain the presidency in 2012 It has promised it can manage the cartels far better than Calderon Its as if the Communist Party were resurgent in Russia Were witnessing in many ways the return of an authoritarian party that governed Mexico for 71 years Dresser says  The drug war has dominated Calderons term in office but despite his declarations to the contrary there are few signs that hes winning Whoever wins the 2012 elections is expected to take a new approach toward the cartels Many voters may even hope for a return to the days when the PRI let organized crime run drugs unfettered up to the US border but kept the violence off the streets Copyright

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128929784&ft=3&f=,Second of five parts Mexico has become one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists So far this year eight reporters have been gunned down Last week five were reported kidnapped  four of them in Durango state and one in Zacatecas state Some 25000 people have been killed over the last 3 12 years in drugrelated violence Unbiased information has also been a casualty Journalists in some parts of the country have stopped covering the drug trade entirely after their colleagues have been kidnapped killed or threatened Others say they have limited reporting on crime to only what is in official government press releases Some even say they report whatever the local cartels order them to print This record level of violence is really unprecedented says Carlos Lauria head of the Americas program at the Committee to Protect Journalists By the organizations tally more than 30 Mexican reporters have been killed or have disappeared since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the drug cartels in December 2006 We only see these numbers of murdered journalists in conflict ridden countries like Iraq and Somalia Lauria says He adds that the Mexican drug cartels have intimidated or corrupted the media to the point where in some parts of the country crime coverage has disappeared entirely As an example he points to a wave of violence that occurred around the border city of Reynosa in late February  The Zetas were battling their former bosses the Gulf cartel for control of the northeastern state of Tamaulipas Running street battles between gunmen with heavy weapons went on for days causing hundreds of deaths Lauria says And there was not a single line about this wave of violence not a single report on the radio or television that accounted for all these execution style murders he adds One of the first media reports of the carnage appeared outside of Mexico in The Dallas Morning News  The Texas paper quoted sources saying more than 200 people had been killed in a 14day period An editor at a daily newspaper in Tamaulipas says the Zetas essentially are the editors of the press in the state They have a connection with the reporters who cover the police beat And through them the Zetas send word on what they want and dont want to be published says the editor who asked that her name not be used because of concern for her safety The Zetas have a chief of press and even a deputy chief of press who keep tabs on what the local media is reporting The Zetas are one of the most brutal drug gangs in Mexico They were founded in the late 1990s by a group of Mexican special forces soldiers who defected to work for the Gulf cartel They served as the enforcers for the Gulf organization until recently when they broke loose on their own We live in fear the editor says  Some very small thing can be misinterpreted by the Zetas You can have a strong story with a strong source where all the facts are verified but they dont care And in the end they go after the messengers after the media after the reporters And little things can anger the drug cartels  For instance she says they get very upset when the papers use the words organized crime At times the editor says you simply cant print the truth We are threatened Its sad she says All we can do is look after our family and the people we know and tell them to be careful Journalists in the border city of Juarez make a point of not being the first ones to show up at massacre sites in case the killing is not yet finished  Reporters in some parts of the country say the cartels let them know that they are being watched read and listened to A reporter in northern Mexico says he was told directly by members of one gang that he would be killed if he reported an incident he had been filming I have never been in a situation like we are living right now he says The reporter says he loves his job and he wants to write about what is happening with the drug war around him But he cant  He says the criminals made it very clear what would happen to him if he didnt play by their rules  They tried to intimidate and say to me You dont love your family  So think about your family when you are going to write this because we know where your family lives They know all about us  They told him that he had been warned and that there would be no second warning Many Mexican journalists havent been so lucky   Valentin Valdes Espinosa a newspaper reporter at Zocalo de Saltillo was found shot to death outside a motel in the state of Coahuila in January  A note dumped with his tortured body said This will happen to anybody who doesnt understand Other journalists have been killed this year in Acapulco Sinaloa Juarez Durango and Michoacan Never have we seen threats at such an extreme level from organized crime as weve seen in the last 2 or 3 years says Gerardo Albarran a reporter at the weekly national news magazine Proceso Albarran is also with the Center for Journalism and Public Ethics a media advocacy group in Mexico City that tracks threats and violence against reporters He says that the cartels have come to completely dominate the press in some areas of Mexico When crime stories do appear particularly in the north of the country they tend to stick to just the facts lifted from police reports and are routinely published without bylines Every day in Mexico Albarran says reporters and editors wrestle with what they can and cannot write In some parts of Mexico Albarran says residents have a war raging around them complete with grenades and cartel members setting up their own road blocks in the streets yet the local media are reporting on weddings quinceaneras and fender benders  There is no protection for journalists The immense majority of these killings are left unsolved he says  Like most murders in Mexico they go uninvestigated thus granting impunity to the killers Copyright 2014

violence in Mexico continues to escalate and 2010 is on track to be the deadliest year yet in a campaign that has already claimed some 25000 lives  Top politicians have been kidnapped and killed Massacres of more than a dozen people have become common And in July a car bomb exploded in Juarez The fallout from the drug war thats starting to be known as Calderons quagmire is being felt across Mexico among those of all walks of life And there is no end in sight to the violence The town of Taxco is a major tourist destination in the Western state of Guerrero Its known for its silver mines and fine jewelry Taxcos narrow cobblestone streets wind amid jewelry shops restaurants and small hotels But in June a gun battle there between the Mexican army and alleged drug cartel members left 15 people dead With the picturesque colonial architecture as backdrop the shooting went on for almost 40 minutes in the middle of the day and was captured by a local TV cameraman A few weeks earlier authorities had pulled 55 bodies out of one of Taxcos abandoned silver mines A local drug gang had been dumping its rivals  sometimes alive  down the 500foot ventilation shaft Early on in this drug war Calderon said that most of the dead were cartel members The implication was that the violence is only eliminating the bad people But as the war has spread so have the casualties No One Is Safe In May a former presidential candidate from Calderons own party Diego Fernandez de Cevallos was kidnapped and is still missing In June Rodolfo Torre Cantu the leading gubernatorial candidate in the northern state of Tamaulipas was assassinated just days before the election Ciudad Victoria the capital of Tamaulipas is a small city of about 300000 people Its markets overflow with vegetables Vendors sell mango and melon drinks from thick glass vats perched on pushcarts Music blares from a CD stand Old men in straw cowboy hats sit in the shade on the city square   At first glance Ciudad Victoria looks peaceful But the local Catholic bishop Antonio Gonzalez Sanchez says people are terrified Now the violence has invaded nearly all of the state the bishop says We dont have hardly anywhere where there isnt violence where there arent killings kidnappings Unfortunately its nearly everywhere     Gonzalez says Torres assassination sent a powerful message that no one in Tamaulipas is safe The people feel and I think with good reason that when the government says theyre going to overcome the violence its a lie no he says Violence In Every Corner Of Society And the violence stretches from the Gulf to the Pacific and from the Guatemalan border up to Tijuana In Nayarit just north of Puerto Vallarta the governor shut the public schools three weeks before the summer break after a series of bloody midday firefights In the industrial city of Monterrey schoolchildren are being trained in how to hit the ground if there is a shootout Along the US border local news reports indicate that hundreds of thousands of people have fled violenceplagued cities all along the frontier In Ciudad Juarez last month workers at a blanket shop picked through the remnants of their shattered plateglass windows after a car bomb exploded up the street The Juarez cartel claimed responsibility for the blast that killed three people  In a conflict in which bodies regularly get strung up from highway overpasses and severed human heads are used to send lessthansubtle warnings the July 15 car bomb represented an escalation of the violence Politicians and the press debated narcoterrorism and the Colombianization of Mexico After the car bombing the mayor of Juarez Jose Reyes Ferriz said We have to be on alert He ordered all municipal police to take their flak jackets and weapons home with them at the end of their shifts Juarez just across the border from El Paso Texas has been particularly hard hit by the drug war The fighting intensified in 2008 as the Sinaloan cartel invaded the Juarez cartels turf Since then more than 6000 people have been killed in this city alone Extortion and kidnappings have flourished   In early 2009 the Mexican military took control of security in Juarez Thousands of soldiers patrolled the streets When that didnt work the federal police took over but the violence just continues to worsen Confessions Of A Cartel Gunrunner At the Juarez municipal prison inmates are housed in separate wings according to their gang affiliation The Aztecas live in open cellblocks that are immaculately clean and look nicer than some of Mexicos housing projects The Aztecas are clearly wealthier than any of the other gangs in the institution The Aztecas are aligned with the Juarez cartel and have been fighting to try to drive the Sinaloans out of the city Francisco Garcia a gunrunner for the Aztecas says the violence isnt going to stop Theres a war going on Nobody could go in and say Hey thats it We cant do that  Because they already killed so many people with us and them he says Garcia is a US citizen He was born in El Paso but he says the Aztecas in Juarez are his people His hair is shaved close to his scalp A green tattooed tear drips from the corner of his left eye I came over here and I got caught on the bridge with two guns Garcia says The 24yearold says that was his job on the outside  shuttling weapons from Texas into Mexico Any kind of guns any kind of weapons that we could use I was bringing them from over there he says Garcia says the Aztecas had a wellorganized system in the US Other people obtained the guns and brought them to him in El Paso His task was to move them across the border and deliver them to a contact in Juarez The Aztecas have a wellorganized system inside the prison too In their portion of the compound they have vegetable gardens an automotive workshop and art studios Theres even an ice cream shop and their own pizza place which they call Dominos   Ranks Of Poor Serve As Recruiting Ground While the Juarez prison feels calm during a recent visit prison riots in Mexico between rival gangs have killed scores of inmates over the past two years Garcia says that as soon as he finishes his fouryear prison term he plans to go right back to working for the Aztecas on the outside This is my life This is what I chose to be  I cant just walk out he says Garcia grew up poor in El Paso As a kid he says his family lacked a lot of things  The Aztecas on the other hand offered him fast money He says he expects to either die young with the Aztecas or spend most of his life in prison  and he says hes OK with that In Mexico more than 4 million people live in what the government terms extreme poverty For the cartels this huge pool of the poor serves as a recruiting ground for foot soldiers in a war thats growing more deadly every month   Copyright 2014 NPR,20100802,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128461367&ft=3&f=,Lenny McAllister is a syndicated political commentator and the author of the book Diary of a Mad Black PYC Proud Young Conservative He is featured regularly on outlets including CNN Fox News and XM Radio How can a former constitutional law professor an attorney general and an iconic organization get it so wrong on civil rights When you look at it it is hard to tell if the White House the Department of Justice and the NAACP are merely a collective sign of the times or the reasons why the times are sadly changing Over the course of the past week all three iconic institutions have corrupted the legacy of civil rights activism in America using their efforts to support legal initiatives that pervert the legacy of black civil rights leaders with selfserving and misguided political efforts that if successful will corrupt the definitions of right and wrong in our nation President Barack Obamas initial criticism of Arizonas SB 1070 illegal immigration law has grown from publicly speaking out against the bill himself to allowing Mexicos President Felipe Caldern to rail against the bill from the floor of the US Congress Now President Obamas objection to the law has prompted a lawsuit from the Department of Justice against the Arizona statute The lawsuit alleges that this state law supersedes federal law on illegal immigration which by the way it does not  it merely enforces federal law and charges that the law will discriminate against Spanishspeaking people  including the illegal immigrants that the law targets under conditions Of late rumors have been swirling of presidential amnesty for illegal immigrants US Sen James Inhofe ROkla charged that the president is using the issue of border security as a ploy to win amnesty for undocumented workers currently residing in the United States In the midst of all this the Department of Justice lawsuit comes across to many political conservatives and moderates as a political maneuver to gain support for the Obama administration as it attempts to shape immigration reform in the partisan selfserving fashion that health care and stimulus bills were passed so far This effort has been supported by Obama supporters including Rev Al Sharpton activists who have promised to bring people to Arizona to protest  in the spirit of the Freedom Riders from the civil rights movement This is notably troubling considering that the civil rights of noncitizens of the United States have remained a driving factor in the move to file this lawsuit a move that says as much about the White Houses political motives as it does about the incorrectly fluid definitions of civil rights and human rights within the administration and its supporters on the left The political zeal for this lawsuit against Arizona contrasts suspiciously with the lack of Justice Department action against the New Black Panther Party over voter intimidation tactics used during the 2008 presidential election These acts of intimidation at the polls were documented repeatedly on film activity committed by individuals that had no shame in being recorded while spewing their hatred for white Americans Yet Attorney General Eric Holders department has repeatedly refused to file charges against principal actors from the 2008 events despite continued complaints for some sort of action in the spirit and defense of civil rights for all Americans particularly those in the process of practicing their civil right to vote The departments silence in this instance rings of hollow political expedience and whimsical preconditions of what constitutes civil rights violations in todays America  criteria defined by the powers that be not the power for equality entailed in the Constitution When the Department of Justice is capable of determining that the rights of noncitizens must be championed as it condones American citizens being intimidated and threatened while enacting their right to vote we are approaching a point in America where justice is too subjective to be counted on to provide stability and equality for our citizens on a regular basis Whereas the Obama administration can blame political allegiances on their willingness to blur the criteria needed to defend of civil rights the California chapter of the NAACP is doing so out of activism laziness Instead of taking on the growing issue of drug use and its destructive impact on black America the NAACP has instead called the legalization of marijuana in the Golden State a civil rights issue due to the high rates of arrests of young black men around the possession and distribution of cannabis in a workaround of the problem of black youth criminalization A onceproud organization that championed the rights of poor black people that needed a pathway out of deplorable conditions to a standard of equality now facilitates justice through changing a law that in essence will lower the standard for folks it claims to advocate for The civil rights issue with black criminalization around the drug trade is ultimately not centered on the amount of arrests made in the black community as changing the definition of crime does not change the conditions of these men Instead the civil rights issue missed by the NAACP is centered on the conditions that make the drug life more appealing and available to young black men than education family unity and career advancementall items that the NAACP used to be more focused on than legalizing crime and community decay All three instances exhibit a growing willingness of black leaders within America to leverage the legacy of successes of the civil rights movement and use the historical weight to guide the pursuit of American civil rights away from equality and justice and toward selfprescribed definitions of what is right and wrong based on pop politics and eroding social values The power driving the civil rights movement of the 20th century was its incorruptible view of justice a trait that allowed its leaders to appeal to the conscience of the world while leveraging the timelessness of the Constitution to forge past the injustices black people suffered Today the call to secure civil rights for people has been spread to political and social offshoots that would make our ancestors cringe should they witness the subjectivity of such contemporary mattersall while we miss grand opportunities before us to stand for civil rights and true justice even if the choices to do so are difficult as they were years ago These current decisions to advocate for civil rights only works to corrode the moral authority that black America garnered over the course of history with the abolition movement Reconstruction the Jim Crow Era and the civil rights movement of the 20th century We are in need of a new civil rights movement  in politics social activism and community redevelopment  but not one that pursues civil rights

plenty of cash That excludes junior wrestlers because they dont earn salaries So only the most talented the most popular wrestlers seen on TV are able to gamble on baseball Thats what has been so shocking Watanabe saysTopknots Wagers And The MobThe details of the scandal involve a hairdresser who served as courier between wrestlers and the Japanese mob known as the yakuza to place the bets Hairdressers who create the perfumed and oiled topknots that wrestlers wear are a constant presence at sumo stablesIn the past few years scandal has become as much a part of sumo as loincloths and bulkup diets The legendary sport seemed to start its tailspin back in 2007 when a teenage recruit was killed during a violent training session Later four wrestlers were fired for marijuana use And then this year one of the two reigning champions was forced to retire after a series of problems ending with a drunken brawl That onetime sumo star Asashoryu was Mongolian The episode seemed to reinforce perceptions that the globalization of sumo was bringing down the sport  Sumo has come to be dominated by men from developing countries those willing to endure the grueling regimen for a chance to become champions and multimillionaires Higher Standard Of Ethics For Sumo WrestlersSumo has always stood for more than just sport It dates back at least 1500 years and is part of the founding myth of Japan itself  legend holds that the Japanese won their islands in a sumo bout of the gods Jeff Kingston director of Asian studies at Temple University Tokyo says wrestlers are an impressive sight on Tokyo streetsI do think the public holds them to a higher standard Kingston says If you look at them around streets with their flowing yukata robes on their wooden geta footwear and topknots I mean they do look like throwbacks to the past and so they are sort of modern representations of traditional mores and virtues Kingston saysVeteran sumo commentator Doreen Simmons says she think this latest scandal represents a huge crisis for the sport This time she says there arent any foreign suspects to blame All the other problems that have surfaced recently were oneoffs that could be treated as individual problems This is the bedrock this is the whole sumo association Not everybody by any means but an awful lot of people including major stable masters some of the most successful men Simmons says  Scandal Involved Collaboration With ConvictsOne of the more outrageous allegations is that yakuza foot soldiers are able to get coveted frontrow seats to sumo tournaments and literally communicate with pals in prison thanks to national TV says Watanabe of Japans TBS TV networkConvicts are allowed to watch sumo live on TV The reason why mafioso want to sit close to the ring is to get on TV Then their boss in prison can see that theyre doing well and they can demonstrate their loyalty Watanabe says Simmons says sumo and the yakuza have a long and complicated historyAs long as Ive followed sumo which is 35 years or so theres been this fight against the yakuza the gangsters established crime Simmons says But of course the reason there is a fight is because theres a lot of money around And some of the oyakata the famous wrestlers are involved  always have been Simmons saysRumors of matchfixing have swirled around sumo for years The secretive and insular sumo association has never investigated these allegationsKingston of Temple University says the latest scandal is the most damning circumstantial evidence yet that organized crime members have the leverage to force wrestlers to throw matchesMoblinked gambling on baseball which is illegal is involving many people in the sumo world So the fact that the yakuza and the sumo sit uncomfortably close together in the media I think is raising suspicions Kingston says While next months tournament will proceed without some of its most talented wrestlers the audience may be drastically reducedJapans NHK state broadcasting network has been deluged with angry letters from citizens demanding that it pull the plug on sumo programming Copyright 2014 NPR,20100628,marijuana

of the motives of other people He was big and placid uniformly kind to strangers and friends and never went anywhere without whistling a little song I minored in philosophy He fell asleep watching television He fell asleep in movie theaters too and occasionally I suspected while driving He had been in the navy during World War II which taught him he said to sleep whenever he could I still troubled no doubt by perplexing questions of ontology and epistemology raised during my brief flirtation with logical positivism ten years earlier was an insomniac I was also a Jew of a sort he was when required an Episcopalian He was not a big man but his voice boomed and his hands were meaty and in repose there was something august about his heavy midwestern features pale blue eyes that in the absence of hopefulness might have looked severe prominent straight nose and heavy jowls that in the absence of mirth might have seemed imperious and disapproving Mirth and hopefulness however were never absent from his face Some people one imagines may be naturally dauntless and buoyant of heart but with him good spirits always seemed far more admirably to be the product of a strict program of selfimprovement in his youth  he believed like most truly modest men in the absolute virtue of selfimprovement  which had wrought deep essential changes in a nature inclined by birth to the darker view and gloominess that cropped up elsewhere in the family tree He didnt seem to be happy out of some secret knowledge of the essential goodness of the world or from having fought his way through grief and adversity to a hardwon sense of his place in it they were simple qualities his good humor and his optimism unexamined automatic stubborn I never failed to take comfort in his presence The meaning of divorce will elude us as long as we are blind to the meaning of marriage as I think at the start we must all be Marriage seems  at least it seemed to an absurdly young man in the summer of 1987 standing on the sundrenched patio of an elegant house on Lake Washington  to be an activity like chess or tennis or a rumba contest that we embark upon in tandem while everyone who loves us stands around and hopes for the best We have no inkling of the fervor of their hope nor of the ways in which our marriage that collective endeavor will be constructed from and burdened with their love When I look back  always an unreliable procedure I know  it seems to have been a case of love at first sight I met him his wife and their yellow beach house all on the same day It was a squarepillared bungalow clapboard and shake the color of yellow gingham with a steep pitched roof and a porch that looked out over a frigid but tranquil bay of brackish water His wife like him in the last years of a vigorous middle age had been coming to this stretch of beach since early in her girlhood and for both her and her daughter whom I was shortly to marry it was more heavily and richly layered with memories associations artifacts and stories than any place any member of my own family had lived since we had left Europe seventy years before Everything about this family was like that My future motherinlaw lived in the house in Seattle where she had been born My fatherinlaw had grown up down the road in Portland They had met at the University of Washington Everyone they knew they had known for longer than Id been alive All the restaurants they favored had been in business for years they were charter members of their country club and in some cases they did business with the sons of tradesmen they had dealt with in the early days of their marriage A journey through the drawers closets and cabinets of their house in town yielded a virtual commercial and social history of Seattle in the form of old matchboxes rulers pens memo pads napkins shot glasses candy tins golf tees coat hangers years and years worth of lagniappes giveaways souvenirs and mementos bearing the names in typefaces of four decades of plumbing supply companies fuel oil dealers newlyweds dry cleaners men and women celebrating birthdays and anniversaries God it was a seductive thing to a deracinated assimilated uncertain wandering young Jew whose own parents had not been married for years and no longer lived anywhere near the house in Maryland where for want of a truer candidate he had more or less grown up They were in many ways classic WASPs to be sure golfing khakiwearing gindrinking WASPs The appeal of such people and their kind of world to a young man such as I was has been welldocumented in film and literature perhaps enough to seem by now a bit outdated But it wasnt finally a matter of class or style though they had both I fell in love with their rootedness with the visible and palpable continuity of their history as a family in Seattle with their ability to bring a box of photographs taken thirty summers earlier and show me the room I was sitting in before it was painted white the madrone trees that screened the porch before two fell over the woman I was going to marry digging for geoduck clams on the beach where she had just lain sunbathing Of course they were more than a kind of attractive gift wrap for their photographs houses and the historical contents of their drawers They were ordinary problematical people my inlaws forty years into a complicated marriage and over the course of my own brief marriage to their daughter I came to love and appreciate them both as individuals on their merits and as my marriage began so quickly to sour for the endurance of their partnership They had that blind towering doggedness of the World War II generation I suppose its possible that with two daughters theyd always wanted a son my fatherinlaw especially I do know for certain that I have never been one to refuse the opportunity to add another father to my collection He offered himself completely without reservation though in his own particular not to say limited way it is this inherent limited quality of fathers and their love that motivates collectors like me to try to amass a complete set He took me down to Nordstrom the original store in downtown Seattle and introduced me to the man who sold him his suits I bought myself a few good squarecut sobercolored numbers in a style that would not have drawn a second glance on Yesler Way in 1954 He introduced me to the woman from whom he bought jewelry for his wife to the man who took care of his car to all of the golf buddies and cronies whose sons he had been admiring from afar for the last thirty years He was a bit barrel chested anyway but whenever we went anywhere together and as was all but inevitable ran into someone he knew his breast introducing me seemed to grow an inch broader the hand on my shoulder would administer a little fighttrainer massage and I would feel him  as first the wedding and later the putative grandchildren drew nearer  placing for that moment all his hopes in me He took me to football games basketball games baseball games He let me drive his Cadillac naturally he never drove anything else Most of all however  most important to both of us  he let me hang out in his den As the child of divorced parents myself divorced and a writer trained by five hundred years of European and American literary history always to search out the worm in the bud I have of necessity become a close observer of other peoples marriages I have noticed that in nearly all the longestlived ones if there is space enough in the house each partner will have a room to flee to If however there is only one room to spare it will always be the husbands My inlaws had plenty of room but while she had her office just off the bedroom where I would sometimes see her sitting at a Chinese desk writing a letter or searching for an article clipped from Town  Country about flavoring ice creams with edible flowers my motherinlaws appeared to serve a largely ceremonial function My fatherinlaw on the other hand sometimes seemed to live down in the basement His office like him was mostly about golf The carpet was Bermudagrass green the walls were hung with maps of St Andrews and framed New Yorker covers of duffers and the various hats ashtrays hassocks cigarette lighters plaques novelty telephones and trophies around the room were shaped like golf balls tees mashies mulligans and I dont know what In the midst of all this sat an enormous black Robber Baron desk with matching black Captain Nemo chair an old vaguely Japaneselooking coffee table on its last tour of duty in the house a cyclopean television and a reclining armchair and sofa both covered in wool patterned with the tartan of some unknown but no doubt staunch whiskeydrinking golfwild highland clan It is for just such circumstances in which two men with little in common may find themselves thrown together with no other recourse than to make friends that sports were invented When my wife and I visited I went downstairs flopped on the sofa and watched a game with my fatherinlaw He made himself a CC and soda and sometimes to complete the picture I let him mix one for me Like many men of my generation I found solace when unhappy in placing quotation marks around myself and everything I did There was I an unhappy husband drinking a cocktail and watching the game This was the only room in the house where I was permitted to smoke  I have long since quit  and I made the most of it a mans den often serves the same desublimating function in the household as Mardi Gras or Las Vegas in the world a different law obtains there We spent hours together cheering on Art Monk and Carlton Fisk and other men whose names when by chance they arise now can summon up that entire era of whiskey and football and the smell of new Coupe de Ville when the biggest mistake I ever made came home to roost and I briefly had one of the best fathers Ive ever found My exwife and I  I wont go into the details  had good times and bad times fought and were silent tried and gave up and tried some more before finally throwing in the towel focused with the special selfabsorption of the miserable on our minute drama and its reverberations in our own chests All the while the people who loved us were not sitting there whispering behind their hands like spectators at a chess match They were putting our photographs in frames on their walls They were uniting our names over and over on the outsides of envelopes that bore anniversary wishes and recipes clipped from newspapers They were putting our birthdays in their address books knitting us socks studying the fluctuating fortunes of our own favorite hitters every morning in the box scores They were working us into the fabric of their lives When at last we broke all those promises that we thought we had made only to each other in an act of faithlessness whose mutuality appeared somehow to make it all right we tore that fabric not irrecoverably but deeply We had no idea how quickly two families can work to weave themselves together When I saw him sometime later at his mothers funeral in Portland my fatherinlaw told me that the day my divorce from his daughter came through was the saddest one in his life Maybe that was when I started to understand what had happened What was I now to him How can it have felt to have been divorced by someone he treated like a son These are not considerations that comfort me or make me especially proud I try to remind myself that in the long course of his life I occupied only a tiny span of years toward the end when everything gleams with an unconvincing luster moving too quickly to be real And I try to forget that for a short while I formed a layer however thin in the deep stratigraphy of his family so that some later explorer rummaging through the drawers of his big old desk might brush aside a scorecard from the 1967 PGA Pacific Northwest Open signed by Arnold Palmer

Last month Presidents Obama and Calderon signed a joint statement pledging both countries interest in protecting crossborder wild lands But worries over border security overshadow the project When Big Bend National Park was established in 1944 in far West Texas President Franklin Roosevelt wrote to President Manuel Avila Camacho of Mexico I do not believe this undertaking in the Big Bend will be complete until the entire park area  on both sides of the Rio Grande forms one great international parkPresently this is as close as you can get On the US bank of the Rio Grande at the entrance to Boquillas Canyon a border busker from Mexico floats in a canoe on the river singing for tips His natural amphitheater is the great limestone canyon that interrupts the thorny expanse of the Chihuahuan Desert creating one of the most breathtaking landscapes in North America Mike Long who runs an outfitter called Desert Sports says the mountains are even more spectacular on the Mexican side Theyre every bit as beautiful as the Chisos Mountains in the BBNP Actually Mexico probably has an opportunity for a more spectacular park than what we have already here in the US Long saysVisitors to the Mexican side describe Douglas firs and ponderosa pines at 10000 feet crystal mountain streams black bears and bighorn sheep And its untouched far from paved roads visited by the occasional sheepherder and biologist A Model Park On The Canadian BorderAs of last year Mexico had set aside 25 million acres of wild lands on its side of the Rio Grande Together with Big Bend National Park and Big Bend Ranch State Park this could become the greatest protected desert ecosystem on the continent And there is a model says Suzanne Dixon Texas director of the National Parks Conservation AssociationWeve got one here in America  its the GlacierWaterton with Canada Thats been there its been working for many many years So this is not something new this is something that exists Dixon saysThe WatertonGlacier International Peace Park  on the MontanaAlberta border  has been in existence since 1932 There are three passportcontrolled ports of entry The two parks share visitors wildlife management and fire protectionIf they can do it on the Northern border they can do it on the Southern border says Rick Lobello a conservationist in El Paso who is a longtime promoter of a USMexico peace park Its just a matter of the two countries getting together and saying lets do this and come up with a plan and then well work on the security issues well work on the border crossing issues Lobello says And there will be issues Security DebateBrewster County Sheriff Ronnie Dodson whose vast county  bigger than Delaware and Rhode Island combined  includes the Big Bend says if there was a park in Mexico hed stay on his side of the river I definitely wouldnt go over there he says Hes leery of Mexican drug traffickers But international park supporters insist that the area is relatively safe They point out that the Big Bend region has less illegal activity than many other areas along the 2000mile border But Dodson disputes that ideaWithin a month between us and Border Patrol weve caught 6000 pounds of marijuana coming out of there and numerous illegal aliens The problem is when people say were the least its because were the biggest  and we miss a lot he saysSecurity is on the

says but I want to stress that the more communication we have with Mexico the better we will beNo Details Yet But Mood Is PositiveFor its part Mexico remains very supportive of the idea of a binational park says Carlos Sifuentes who manages Mexicos federal lands opposite Big Bend  which are nothing like the US national parkThe Mexican government has limited resources to develop its protected areas Sifuentes says Today across from Big Bend there are no roads no stores no electricity no water Its totally remote and wild There is not yet a detailed plan for a binational peace park In fact most lawmakers have not even heard of the idea Texas Republican Sen Kay Bailey Hutchison who has released a statement saying she would not support any such undertaking that could compromise border securityA National Park Service official in Washington DC speaking on background said senior levels of the Interior Department and Mexicos Environment and Natural Resources Secretariat have

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127773447&ft=3&f=,Fourteen states and the District of Columbia have launched a medical experiment that doesnt follow any of the rules of science By approving the use of marijuana as a medicine  with varying kinds of restrictions  these jurisdictions are bypassing the federal governments elaborate processes for approving medicines Thats highly unusual In fact its only happened once in recent memory In the late 1970s about half the states legalized the use of laetrile an extract of apricot pits as a cancer treatment At least 50000 cancer patients took it before it was exposed as totally useless Nobody argues that marijuana is the new laetrile For one thing nobodys claiming it cures any fatal diseases But it is a departure from the usual rules of evidence for drugs Struggling With Chronic Illness If you want to understand why its happening you should spend some time with Ellen Lenox Smith of suburban Rhode Island a lively petite 60yearold grandmother former schoolteacher and onetime master swimmer When you meet Smith you dont suspect anythings seriously wrong with her health But in fact she has two incurable diseases One called sarcoidosis is ravaging her lungs The other makes her tendons and ligaments loose and fragile My knee tore and two weeks later the other knee tore Smith says And the same thing with my shoulder It was one shoulder and then the other shoulder So I was tearing like tissue paper and no one knew why After years of misdiagnosis and surgical repairs Smith learned she has a rare genetic disease of connective tissue called EhlersDanlos syndrome My condition causes pain throughout the entire body Smith says Most people with EhlorsDanlos live on morphine and OxyContin she says but she has bad reactions to these and nearly all other painkillers I cant tolerate them An Unlikely Prescription Feeling desperate with pain and suffering sleepless nights Smith consulted pain specialist Dr Pradeep Chopra This was about four years ago just after Rhode Island became the 11th state to legalize medical marijuana Chopra had never recommended marijuana to a patient and he never imagined he would But in Smiths case he says she had absolutely no other option So very very hesitantly I said Listen why dont you try medicinal marijuana  Smith says I can remember laughing and thinking I wish my parents were alive to hear this conversation You spend your life being told to stay away from certain things and here I have a doctor suggesting it could help me Smith appealed to one of her adult sons who scrounged some pot from a friend Because of her lung condition she couldnt smoke it so she soaked it in oil and stirred the oil into applesauce I tried it that night  scared to death I mean I had no idea what to expect she says The only time Id ever tried marijuana was once in college and it was so horrible So I was really nervous about it But it was so amazing I took this oil went to bed and the next thing I know it was morning Smith says I had literally slept through the entire night for the first time in months Patient  Marijuana Saved My Life Shes used marijuana ever since  sometimes during the daytime too  and says shes never gotten high from it I wake up in the morning my head is clear I read the papers do my Sudoku puzzles and my mind is fine she says Somehow this drug attacks pain and I get pain relief but I dont get stoned This point is controversial Some researchers believe patients who use marijuana medically do have psychoactive effects but they have the effect of shifting patients attention away from their pain perhaps in addition to a direct painrelieving effect JoAnne Leppanen of the Rhode Island Patient Advocacy Coalition says What pain patients tell me is Cannabis does not get rid of my pain Its still there But I dont care so much So its affecting their mental attitude For Smith relief is far from total but she can deal with her pain now especially since she sleeps well Smith says marijuana has saved her life My husband says it too she says I dont think Id be here I think I probably would have passed away if I didnt have this drug There was nothing  nothing left to help me A Slippery Slope Smith is exactly the kind of patient legislators have in mind when they allow marijuana to be used as a medicine But some think legalization is dangerous Approving medical use of marijuana by political referendum is a slippery slope says Joseph Califano director of the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University Whats the next substance well approve by political referendum Califano was US Secretary of Health Education and Welfare during the laetrile period We have the best system in the world for clearing drugs in the Food and Drug Administration and thats the system we should follow he says There was a time when Califanos view was the prevailing opinion but that may not be the case any more It seems that many in the medical world who once were dead set against medical marijuana are now not so sure The FDA specifically opposes smoking marijuana for medical purposes But spokeswoman Karen Riley said in an email message that the FDA is willing to consider proposals by investigators to conduct clinical trials using marijuana We do have a number of open investigational new drug applications that study marijuana Riley writes Some of these study the ability of marijuana to treat disease or medical conditions Some use marijuana to assess treatments for addiction Some could study the physiological or pathological effects of marijuana in the body Problems With Researching Pot However scientists say doing research with marijuana requires the patience of Job largely because the federal government still classes marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance with no legitimate medical use That status requires researchers to get a license from the Drug Enforcement Administration part of the Justice Department The DEA relies on the National Institute on Drug Abuse or NIDA for advice on research proposals I know one research group who says it took a year to get feedback from NIDA says Dr John Halpern of Harvard Medical School and McLean Hospital Then when they resubmitted their proposal they got another set of criticisms The director of NIDA Dr Nora Volkow declined to be interviewed about medical marijuana Research Has Made Headway But other people in the field are openminded about the medical uses of marijuana Take Dr Glen Hanson for example Hes a former acting director of NIDA and still advises the agency He does drug research at the University of Utah and he heads the Utah Addiction Center Hanson is familiar with the scientific evidence on marijuana Running through a list of things some people claim marijuanas good for Hanson says there is legitimate support for many conditions Pain for instance Yes theres some significant evidence that its useful in some types of pain Hanson says  Multiple sclerosis Thats more controversial he replies There are clearly some individuals with multiple sclerosis who say that it helps them  Glaucoma There is some evidence but again controversial  Seizures Again some evidence that it may be useful in dealing with some seizures The list goes on Hanson says theres evidence for some other claims but not for others The thing scientists are really excited about Hanson says is the discovery that many organs in the human body and brain have receptors for the chemicals in cannabis That observation was first made in 1988 but over the past 10 years scientists have done a lot of work to figure out how these receptors work This area has exploded Hanson says If youre asking is this a system that can be targeted for therapeutic benefit I think everybody who knows the scientific pieces would acknowledge that potential Long Way To Go But much of the research is in test tubes and animals not in real patients with real diseases Human marijuana research is spotty studies are small and short and results are conflicting So theres a big gap between the testimonials  like Ellen Smiths  and the science Hanson has no doubt that cannabis research will lead to important new designer drugs for a number of maladies But he has no idea when We dont have a timeline he says Is it going to be five years 10 years 20 years That doesnt satisfy and meet the needs of people who are suffering today So for me I have no problem using what weve got  and today we have marijuana PatientDriven Movement Chopra Smiths physician agrees But hes not without misgivings With medicine we are used to prescribing a fixed dose with a fixed time interval so we can monitor the side effects or the efficacy of a drug Chopra says With medicinal marijuana its the other way around We have no control over the dose or how often its taken And so its really up to the patients to experiment on their own and figure out how much they need and how often At the same time Chopra believes marijuana should be available to patients with no other good options Its the patients who are driving this movement he says The people have spoken Chopra says Its basically the people who have come up and said It does help us look at us were doing well Theyre telling the establishment Youre wrong and the establishment has listened to them At least important parts of the establishment are listening President Obama has said his administration has no interest in prosecuting doctors and patients who use marijuana  as long as their state allows it Copyright 2014 NPR,20100614,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127754799&ft=3&f=,Medical marijuana is legal in 14 states and advocates would like to expand that or legalize pot altogether But the judges lawyers and therapists who work in drug courts say the criminal justice system has helped addicts turn their lives around  At the recent meeting of the National Association of Drug Court Professionals in Boston attendees discussed how new attitudes toward Marijuana affect what they do The fact that in a state the size of California you can get a doctors recommendation for marijuana for anything from cancer to a bad mood has changed the attitude toward pot nationwide says Rose Ewing a program director of drug courts in Tulsa Okla Ewing says it has made it harder to help some of her clients Theyre like If we lived in another state wed be able to use this medically for different conditions because they dont consider it a bad drug or a hardcore drug  she says They really feel like its in a different class of drugs Harder To Persuade Users Drug courts like Ewings work on a carrotandstick approach Defendants get therapy and regular drug testing and a judge monitors their progress The success rate is high but the defendants who fail to clean up their acts can go to jail Yet even with so much at stake it can be hard to convince marijuana users that they have a problem if few people around them see it that way says Andrew Cummings director of the drug court in Georgias DeKalb County It becomes an issue similar to alcohol where the communitys attitude toward marijuana becomes increasingly permissive and therefore it becomes more difficult for the participants to see it as a problem and to see it as a treatable problem Cummings says  These days its difficult for a lot of people to see marijuana as a problem even if they have never touched the stuff says Judge John Creuzot of Dallas who has presided over drug courts and regular felony courts When we get into guilt innocence and punishment you see a lot of pushback especially on marijuana from the citizens juries he says They dont think it should be a felony offense and  so its very difficult to get them to commit to sending someone to the penitentiary for possession of marijuana In Texas juries can assess punishment in felony cases Cruezot says he thinks the people who dont seem to care much about marijuana might become positively enthusiastic if California voters approve a measure on the November ballot to legalize and tax marijuana When a state like California a big state moves in that direction  lets say that becomes the law If taxes can be raised and collected if crime doesnt rise or doesnt change any if jails are less populated everybody else is going to look at it and see he says Legalization But Gil Kerlikowske the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy says dont even think about it Legalization is a nonstarter says Kerlikowske who addressed the drug courts meeting He says he doesnt buy any of the arguments in favor of legalizing pot that it will reduce violence police will be free to fight other crimes and that tax dollars will be raised None of that really holds up under any scrutiny he says  In the case of medical marijuana the Obama administration has told federal prosecutors not to go after dispensaries that are in compliance with local and state laws But Kerlikowske says thats just a matter of allocating scarce resources Medical marijuana he says is not only still illegal but also may not really be medical Medical marijuana is still one of those questions that science should decide and not popular vote he says Treating Dependency But voters dont seem inclined to wait for sciences stamp of approval on something that seems within their grasp  Cummings the director of the drug court in Georgia says he worries about what might happen if marijuana use becomes more acceptable People often think about marijuana and understandably so as one might think about having a drink at the end of the day and relaxing but it doesnt stop there for a lot of people he says And as the potency increases the likelihood of dependency increases Cummings wonders how those people would be able to find help if abusing marijuana no longer forced them to go to court  Copyright 2014 NPR,20100611,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127746216&ft=3&f=,Marijuana use is not on the rise At least thats the gist of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health done every year by the US Department of Health and Human Services In 2008  the most recent data available  61 percent of Americans 12 and older admitted using marijuana in the previous month   In absolute terms that number is probably low after all this survey asks people to admit to using illegal drugs  But the real significance of the number is that its steady  its been hovering right around 6 percent since 2002 Drug researchers say the real percentage may be higher but its probably holding steady too And yet during those same years marijuana has been edging toward legitimacy States with medical marijuana laws have made it possible for thousands of people to buy pot over the counter in actual stores Some police departments have started deemphasizing marijuana arrests Critics of liberalization believe this inevitably leads to greater consumption Its axiomatic says John Lovell a lobbyist for California police chiefs Hes also helping to organize the campaign against an initiative in California to make marijuana legal for adults Anytime you take a product  any product  from a less convenient sales forum to a more convenient sales forum use increases Lovell says But cities where marijuana have been liberalized have not seen a spike in consumption so far In 2003 voters in Seattle made marijuana the lowest law enforcement priority for city police Researchers tracked the results  Caleb BantaGreen studies drug use trends at the University of Washingtons Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute He says selfreported consumption and potrelated emergency room visits remained flat before during and after the initiative went into effect BantaGreen says he gets similar reports from drug researchers in other cities   Im not hearing stories on a regular basis that There was liberalization in marijuana policies and soon afterwards usage rates increased dramatically  he says   At the same time says BantaGreen places like Seattle already had high rates of pot consumption before enforcement was relaxed so its not surprising that there was no big increase Teenage Perspective And opponents of liberalization say even if overall consumption stays flat looser enforcement may increase pot smoking among minors They point to places such as Californias Bay Area where medical marijuana is commonplace and enforcement is lax  Teenagers rarely have trouble finding pot Some get it from dispensaries far more just buy it from a friend or classmate I could call 10 people right now and theyd all have a drug dealer says one teenager who declined to give his name As in Seattle Berkeley voters made pot arrests the lowest priority for police but they did it nearly 25 years earlier Still Berkeley school officials were shocked last year when they saw results from the statewide California Healthy Kids survey of student drug use Sixtythree percent of the districts 11th graders reported smoking pot in their lifetime  20 points higher than the state average Another high school boy a selfdescribed stoner who also spoke on the condition his name not be used isnt surprised by that number   You can definitely get it anywhere And that leads kids to smoke more and that leads kids to buy more and that leads other dealers to sell more and cannabis clubs to sell more  So its definitely growing a lot he says But even though the rate of teenage pot smoking in Berkeley is high its also been stable The survey shows it as does the experience of high school teacher Mark Harringer I havent seen a marked increase or decrease either way Harringer says He thinks kids just get the impression consumption is growing because as they grow older theyre more likely to encounter friends using drugs Ive even asked kids before as well What percentage of your class do you think uses marijuana or drinks alcohol or smokes cigarettes  Harringer says And more often than not they inflate the number almost triple than what the actual percentage is Some Statistics May Be Disturbing But even if overall consumption is stable other numbers are increasing At the University of Washington BantaGreen says the Seattle area has seen an increase in the number of people getting treatment for pot addiction That is of the people entering treatment an increasing percentage cite marijuana as their primary addiction Similar increases are being seen in San Francisco and Los Angeles where marijuana dispensaries have boomed in the past couple of years Its not clear what the increase means BantaGreen says it might have something to do with more probation violators being sent to treatment instead of jail when they test positive for pot   When it comes to illegal drugs he says its just hard to get reliable measurements of overall consumption  even in areas where the drug has been liberalized But its not impossible BantaGreen has been part of a project that measures the traces of illegal drugs in sewer water Hes been analyzing the wastewater in 20 cities to get a measure of overall consumption of certain hard drugs  And hed like to start testing that water for pot too if he can get the funding This story includes reporting by Sayre Quevedo of Youth Radio which trains young journalists Copyright 2014

model has emerged companies that will deliver pot directly to your doorstep At a oneroom packaging facility east of San Francisco a worker in latex gloves pulls four brilliant green pot buds from a vacuumsealed bag She delicately places them on a small scale as her boss looks on Hes a local real estate developer who publicly uses the assumed name of Matthew Lawrence for his marijuana business He says the pot will be shipped to customers around the state in unmarked packages During the business week any orders placed by 1 pm get there by midday the next day via courier Lawrence says This might seem like an illegal drug den  but so far Californias medical marijuana laws dont cover this type of operation And delivery is booming amid a backlash against storefront dispensaries This week hundreds of medical marijuana dispensaries in Los Angeles face a deadline to close or risk criminal charges And hundreds of other cities and towns in California have banned dispensaries altogether No ones gone as far as Lawrence in trying to build a legal statewide delivery network He says his company  named c420  has signed up 1000 patients since April some are seriously ill others are what he calls the suits They have families kids who know parents who know each other They see each other in the baseball field and they really dont want to be seen going into a dispensary just because they have migraines and they like to smoke a little marijuana once in a while in order to alleviate that condition or whatever the condition might be Lawrence says There are hundreds of potdelivery services now advertising on websites like BudTrader and WeedMaps And not just in California Delivery services are a growing alternative to brickandmortar storefronts in many of the states that have legalized medical marijuana Lawrence says Allen St Pierre with the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws says As these Main Street dispensaries raise the ire of law enforcement and local politicians delivering patienttopatient or businesstopatient would appear to be the trend that is emerging around the United States Lots Of Delivery Services But Few Rules Driving the trend in California is a growing abundance of medical marijuana and a lack of statewide regulations covering how it can be legally distributed So its not surprising that many new delivery services are flourishing in places that have restricted or banned storefront dispensaries like Los Angeles Take Dann Halem and the nonprofit delivery service he founded called Artists Collective Each week Halem logs hundreds of miles on LA freeways to fill phone and Internet orders He says he started Artists Collective because dispensaries were underserving seriously ill patients The people who medical marijuana is truly meant for are not well enough to go into a store to get it Halem says So its absolutely critical for there to be delivery services in some way shape or form He says most of his patients arent on deaths door  and the reality is that just about any adult in California can get a doctors recommendation for medical pot or for that matter go into the delivery business To start a delivery service whether your intentions are good or bad you need a car a cell phone and marijuana Thats not the way we operate but Id say the majority of delivery services at this point are essentially just that And they really are in a lot of respects glorified drug dealers because theres no oversight theres no accreditation theres nothing Halem says In fact for some underground dealers starting medical marijuana delivery services is a way to come out of the shadows Pot Parties For Patients On a recent afternoon at one former pot dealers home in an upscale section of Los Angeles guests nibbled on a buffet of fruit bagels and pastries while others crowded into a backyard studio These are bongs pipes whatever you want help yourself she tells her guests The woman agreed to show us her operation provided we not reveal her name or where she works in Los Angeles To comply with state law she formed a nonprofit patients collective last year  She then started throwing parties like this one to transform her former customers into medicalpot patients She had a physician on hand to evaluate the guests and then sign off on recommendations for medical marijuana  all for 100 each Later the woman made a round of deliveries to these customers turned patients She met up with a man waiting in his car in a Starbucks parking lot And she made another delivery in a nearby office building How much of this is legal is debatable Advocates argue that laws enacted after California voters passed the Compassionate Use Act in 1996 cover transportation and distribution of medical pot though not across state lines But Joseph Esposito of the Los Angeles District Attorneys Office says state law doesnt sanction largescale distribution I dont see anything that suggests that when voters passed the Compassionate Use Act that they envisioned storefronts delivery services Esposito says Dispensary Owners Worry About Safety Some longtime medical marijuana advocates worry that a legal freeforall in delivery services is allowing unsavory elements to enter the trade Weve had a lot of problems with I call it the wingnut crowd who look at this as a moneymaking operation says Lynette Shaw who runs one of the states oldest medical marijuana dispensaries in the Marin County town of Fairfax That town tightly controls Shaws operations but those rules dont cover delivery services based outside the area She says theyre trying to muscle in on her business So shes asking local authorities to allow her storefront to make home deliveries in order to compete I want to make sure my patients are safe  and when you call someone to your home that you have someone whose background is researched that theyre licensed and regulated Shaw says Thats one reason Halem of the Artists Collective in Los Angeles wants city officials to regulate the delivery trade He says hes asked but gotten no response We would welcome oversight because we know that we qualify and we know that we have nothing to be afraid of he says But at this point says Los Angeles City Councilman Dennis Zine the citys new medical marijuana regulations dont address delivery services This was never a factor in our debate Zine says Zine says that the move to restrict dispensaries was driven by complaints from community groups and law enforcement and that so far there havent been many complaints about delivery services Whos going to complain The person whos receiving the marijuana is not going to complain The person whos delivering is not going to complain The neighbor is not going to complain because they dont know whats going on Zine says That could be changing This week at least one Los Angeles City Council member called for an investigation and possible emergency measures against

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127538267&ft=3&f=,For decades marijuana growers in Northern California have received reports of pending police raids from a local community radio station and citizens wary of the drug war Now police  citing a boom in marijuana production and a possible influx of armed illegal drug traffickers  say the practice needs to stop As summer looms pot growers in the Northern California counties of Humboldt and Mendocino are preparing the ground for another growing season Meanwhile local state and federal agents are poised to deploy helicopters and trucks to raid illegal operations Tracking Law Enforcement  In a radio broadcast like many others in this areas pot war a female announcer recently issued this alert According to a citizens observation at 845 am three helicopters were seen heading from Laytonville to Bell Spring Road Reports like this one alert the stations listeners  which include both legal and illegal pot growers  to the movements of police and drug agents on the ground and in the air Ending the segment the host said To report sightings such as these you can call the civil liberties monitoring project at a local phone number These reports are a staple on KMUD a community radio station based in southern Humboldt County The broadcasts began after the Reagan administration ramped up drug raids in the region known as Californias pot capital KMUD program director Marianne Knorzer says the reports are part of the stations broader commitment to progressive politics government accountability and public safety Were not broadcasting their whole operations Knorzer says Were just giving the public an awareness that there are 10 trucks heading down a very narrow road with onelane portions of it with tight turns Again our reports are quite benign Who Would Have Blood On Their Hands Law enforcement officials have put up with the broadcasts for years  but times are changing As more pot is grown legally under Californias medical marijuana laws theres also been an influx of new marijuana growers to Northern California And some run huge illegal growing operations on federal land Mendocino County Sheriff Tom Allman worries that the radio reports could tip them off  and he wants the broadcasts to end I hope theyre not going to say This is my land dont come here  Allman says But what if that did happen you know And what if somebody did get hurt Either that citizen or a law enforcement officer Well who would have blood on their hands Recently in downtown Garberville Allman met with representatives from both KMUD and the local group that gathers the reports on police operations As a man with a matted beard and wizened face played a violin outside the meeting hall Allman tried to strike a conciliatory note Addressing the group he acknowledged past abuses by police and expressed a wariness at federal drug operations  I dont like Black Hawks in my county I really dont Allman said referring to the helicopters used by federal agents  But if we lost a local state or federal law enforcement officer when it was determined that a local radio station had broadcast they were coming up the driveway I believe were setting ourselves up for something bad Allmans appeal to rethink the broadcasts was met with polite skepticism from the audience which included activist Jared Rossman  I congratulate law enforcement for responding because there were a lot of years of intense fear Rossman said at the meeting He then asked Have any law enforcement  local state or federal  been hurt in these two counties over the past 25 years In response Allman said Last year was the first year in a decade that we actually took rounds during the execution of a search warrant It was a total Mexican grow theres no question about it Were finding notes were getting death threats in ways that we never got before Were seeing a resistance now that we havent seen ever Sheriff Vs Station A Standoff The KMUD office occupies a rambling onestory house just behind a gas station in the tiny hamlet of Redway In some ways the station reflects how the debate over marijuana has shifted with more people accepting the idea of legal medical pot  including Sheriff Allman whos a frequent guest on KMUD I hope I dont come across as a Cheech and Chong sheriff he says But I do say the same things over and over  that the days of cops going in and slashandburning are over And they will never come back The police officers respect for legal pot growers is a big reason KMUDs broadcasts on police operations are now  at least according to Allman  an anachronism Perhaps they were justified years ago he says but not today  Still his concern about the broadcasts doesnt mean the sheriff is threatening legal action Im not talking about going to the FCC and saying take away their license Allman says My intent is to figure out a solution where everybody is satisfied They dont have to be happy but theyre satisfied with the solution But KMUDs Marianne Knorzer says that suspicions about the drug war still run high  and that the station is unlikely to drop the reports I cant ever imagine that happening she says Both sides have agreed to continue the dialogue and assess the situation after major drug eradication operations wrap up this fall This story was produced as part of a

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127012745&ft=3&f=,Fourteen states and the District of Columbia allow people to use marijuana to treat a wide variety of ailments Each law is different  but if you look at them in chronological order a pattern emerges The laws are becoming stricter The states passing laws today include more regulation than the early adopters did  California voters approved the first law in 1996 The language in Proposition 215 was simple  essentially it said allow sick people to use pot  The broadly worded language successfully avoided conflict with federal law under which marijuana possession remains illegal But with almost no restrictions dispensaries flourished In Los Angeles County alone there are more than 100 places to legally buy pot And more than 40000 medical marijuana cards have been issued in California In November California voters will decide whether to go ahead and make this de facto legalization official A proposition on the ballot will ask voters if they want to make pot legal for adults After California passed the law 13 more states and DC also passed medical marijuana laws Some like Washington and Oregon dont allow dispensaries at all But so far none have gone to the lengths New Mexico has to regulate medical pot The Most Restrictive New Mexico New Mexico does allow dispensaries but only nonprofit ones And to date only five have been approved One of them NewMexiCann Natural Medicine is based in an office behind a restaurant in Santa Fe NM Getting a license to grow and distribute marijuana was a sevenmonth process according to Executive Director Len Goodman What there is is a long checklist a twopage singlespaced checklist he says The state wants to know things like Who will grow the plants What is their experience What will the distribution model look like And then there are more mundane matters like what the labeling and invoices will look like Goodman says New Mexico limits Goodman to 95 plants That means demand is always outpacing supply  and thats just how the state wants it If supply increases too much theres a risk legal medical marijuana could be diverted to the illegal recreational market  But that means patients like Dennis Garcia have to go without Hes a broadshouldered Iraq war veteran who uses marijuana to treat symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder  Cannabis was the only thing that was really helping me Garcia says   Just getting approved to use marijuana was difficult for Garcia Both a doctor and a psychiatrist had to sign a state form saying traditional treatments failed They also had to conclude that marijuana would do Garcia more good than harm  When he couldnt find marijuana through dispensaries Garcia started growing his own in his garage To get a license Garcia had to prove that he could keep his crop secure and promise to follow other regulations It cant be within a certain amount of distance from a school It cant be seen or visible from the street or any public property Garcia says  Getting Marijuana Only To The Sick All these restrictions are designed to ensure New Mexicos program is for medical use  not a backdoor way to legalize pot Its the result of the practical experiences of trying to get away from the California model says New Mexico State Sen Cisco McSorley  McSorley says New Mexico has shown that through strict regulation medical marijuana can be made available only to the sick But there is a risk in such active regulation Its possible a federal prosecutor could charge New Mexico regulators with helping people get access to marijuana  My very first goal was that I didnt go to jail and none of my doctors went to jail and nobody in the Department of Health went to jail says Dr Alfredo Vigil secretary of the New Mexico Department of Health  To date theres been no interest from federal prosecutors and New Mexicos law has avoided the California model of dispensaries popping up all over   So far theres really not the kind of money to be made that would underwrite proliferation of those kinds of businesses and Im hoping we can keep it that way says Vigil  The Power Of The States Now New Jersey appears ready to go beyond even New Mexico Under that states program virtually every marijuana bud thats harvested will have been closely monitored by a bureaucrat  In all of this theres an interesting civics lesson says Vanderbilt University law professor Rob Mikos Federal law  in this case the ban on marijuana possession  always is supreme but there are times states can choose to go their own way  What theyre doing is perfectly legitimate Mikos says Its just a passive form of resistance to federal authority  Mikos says states have traditionally prosecuted nearly all of the marijuana possession cases Now in response to their citizens theyre actually embracing medical marijuana and the feds arent doing much about it Mikos says when it comes to using marijuana for medical purposes our culture is changing and the states are leading the way  Copyright 2014 NPR,20100607,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127477038&ft=3&f=,In November California voters will decide whether to make all pot legal even for recreational use 14 years after medical marijuana was legalized  The measure would violate federal drug laws but that hasnt stopped Oakland Calif businessman Richard Lee from spending millions to get the issue passed In a revitalized neighborhood on the north side of downtown Oakland where medical marijuana is king an old storefront throbs with the pulse of rock music The unmistakable scent of ganja fills the air Some call the neighborhood Oaksterdam Amsterdam is our model city When I go there I see tourists and jobs and taxes being created from the cannabis industry and I think we can do that here Lee says  Lee owns a medical marijuana dispensary two coffee shops a gift shop and a cannabis nursery Hes created a multimilliondollar empire built largely on medicinal pot And now he wants to take it a step further by turning marijuana into a totally legal taxable commodity for any Californian 21 or older Were like other businesses you know he says Were here to pay taxes create jobs and improve the community Stephen Tate a computer security analyst says Lee has lots of supporters Everybody knows this guy no matter where you go everybody knows this guy Tate says Its good to have a champion for a social cause thats really good you know and its not just a bunch of potheads taking over No its not Theres legitimate purposes for this In fact I wish liberalization of marijuana laws would have been around when my grandmother was suffering from breast cancer How He Became The Force Behind The Ballot Measure Lee has a personal feeling for the power of marijuana Twenty years ago he was paralyzed in a workrelated fall Now he zips through the neighborhood in a wheelchair After he started having muscle spasms cannabis was his one reliable source of relief  And thats how Lee raised in a family of Goldwater Republicans became the force behind the California ballot measure that would make pot legal for fun and profit I am kind of a conservative and I do see marijuana prohibition as eroding respect for the laws and law enforcement he says I want good police law enforcement I want to work with the police Im the opposite of the guy who says F the police  And when it comes to cops Lee believes they should spend their time chasing bona fide crooks not marijuana smokers He came to that conclusion years ago with a gun pointed at his head Two thugs robbed him at the driveup window of a fast food restaurant What really made me as mad as the carjacking though was the police had a really slow response time he says So I started thinking about if there were less police out there looking for people like me and more going after real sociopaths and predators wed be better off Ulterior Motives Supporters say Lee is a visionary who put his money where his mouth is He bankrolled the expensive petition drive that got marijuana on Californias November ballot But others claim Lee has ulterior motives I think people are going to make a mistake if they vote for this says Dennis Peron known by many as the godfather of the medical marijuana movement If they think theyre voting for legalization theyre not They voted for restriction of marijuana Peron is against the ballot measure Lee is backing because he says the government would still have too much control over pot  and shouldnt be allowed to tax it Plus he thinks Lee is mostly interested in legalizing marijuana so he can get even richer selling it Hes doing this to make money Peron says All that money and power Lee doesnt give a lot of thought to his critics Hes too busy being the Johnny Appleseed of pot Lee teaches people how to grow marijuana and how to run their own medical marijuana dispensary at a small storefront school He calls it Oaksterdam University And on any given night hes the main instructor for a halfdozen attentive students You dont want seeds in your cannabis he says Generally youre going to get rid of the male plants that produce pollen that would fertilize the female plants and thats how you get sinsemilla  or seedless cannabis As many as 10000 students have matriculated through Oaksterdam University And Lee is still growing the business with two other schools like this one A Way To Fix Californias Ailing Budget Steve DeAngelo operator of another medical marijuana dispensary in Oakland calls the university a brilliant idea Hes a big Lee supporter but wonders if California is truly ready to take the next step and legalize cannabis I would have preferred to see the initiative wait for another two years until we went into a general election cycle when our voters are more likely to turn out he says It could come down to whether voters see marijuana as a cure for Californias ailing budget By some estimates making pot legal and taxing it could generate a billion dollars in new revenue I guess its a sign the time is right for laws to change and that society is maturing and looking at this subject in a new way Lee says But Lee is a pragmatist He knows changing decades of prohibition wont be easy So even if he fails this time he says hell keep trying Copyright 2014 NPR,20100607,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127209361&ft=3&f=,When Bruce Golding Jamaicas prime minister gave a nationally televised speech last week to announce his intention to capture Christopher Dudus Coke and send him to the United States where he is wanted on gun and drug charges Golding alluded to the heavy pressure he is under to extradite the powerful gang leader  What he didnt acknowledge was the deep and murky relationship between Cokes criminal organization and the prime ministers own Jamaica Labour Party JLP which for nine months hemmed and hawed over the US extradition request and even went so far as to hire lobbyists to press Washington to drop the charges  It was a glaring omission bordering on the farcical Indeed the symbiotic relationship between Jamaicas political parties and criminal gangs  reliably delivering votes to connected politicians and local social services to neighborhood residents  has deep roots going back more than 30 years Thats nothing new But Goldings obfuscation and decision to finally turn on his erstwhile ally is a dangerous break with the past The capitulation to domestic pressure and US authorities has pit a government with its back to the wall against a seething downtown population that tends to confer upon local gangs more legitimacy than it does a police force widely viewed as capricious and excessively violent  On Sunday Golding declared a monthlong state of emergency as Cokes supporters many reportedly members of sympathetic rival gangs attacked six police stations in Kingston As police and government troops massed armed gangsters streamed from the housing projects in the Tivoli Gardens area of West Kingston firing on the hundreds of security forces deployed to arrest Coke  who generally lives in a tony uptown neighborhood of Kingston but like the JLP considers Tivoli Gardens his base  Since independence from Britain in 1962 political power in Jamaica has seesawed between the liberalleaning Peoples National Party and the more conservative JLP In the early days of selfgovernance both parties used local youths to drum up votes but by the early 1980s politicians and the dons who rule Jamaicas powerful gangs were openly collaborating Case in point In 1992 Edward Seaga then the leader of the JLP walked at the front of the funeral procession of Cokes deceased father Lester Lloyd Jim Brown Coke who oversaw the transformation of the Shower Posse named for its penchant for raining bullets on its adversaries from a getoutthevote community organization to its current configuration as a multimilliondollar transnational drug and armsrunning operation In 1992 Brown was captured by Jamaican forces but was killed in a prison fire while awaiting extradition to the United States  The aptly named Coke stands accused of running a violent and sprawling cocaine and marijuana smuggling operation primarily centered in New York but active across the United States The indictment filed in a New York district court also alleges that Coke is a major importer of illegal firearms into Jamaica helping to fuel Kingstons spiraling street violence Since the violent antigovernment rebellion first erupted on Sunday two police officers one soldier and at least 26 civilians have been killed and scores more wounded  Although most outsiders think of Jamaica as a vacation paradise and the idyllic peaceful homeland of Bob Marley over the last two decades the island nation has become one of the most violent countries on earth  It dependably ranks in the top five  behind Colombia South Africa and a rotating list of Central American narcostates  in annual homicide indices Entire neighborhoods are nogo areas for police who often are not in the crimebusting business anyway Witnesses quietly speak of police colluding with drug lords summarily executing rival gang members on the street  But even for those locals inured to the violence the recent battles are a different breed  Ten miles away from the makeshift barricades and the gunfire in the Tivoli Gardens and the Denham Town neighborhoods where Coke is thought to be in hiding Sara Lawrence a Kingston medical student awakened Tuesday morning to the sounds of a national emergency sirens the distant tattattat of automatic gunfire and the rustle of helicopters overhead On the street however cars are few and far between Everyone I know is trying to stay safe keep travel to a minimum she told me Everyone is a little bit anxious but I would describe the mood now as somber  Its a mood shared broadly among many Jamaicans outside the densely populated impoverished garrison neighborhoods like Tivoli said Marlon James a wellknown Jamaican novelist Jamaicans horrified by the violence are beginning to think that maybe Tivoli should be cut off from the rest of the country he told me With not just Dudus but all the dons this week shows just how acute the cult of personality among the dons has become Politicians created these communities and these dons and theyve become monsters they can no longer control anymore because the money is no longer in politics  the money is in drugs  Jamaican public opinion of Coke generally cleaves along class lines For those living outside the impoverished garrisons Coke is a galling symbol of Jamaicas economic decay and governmental fecklessness But even some within Jamaicas middle and upper classes recognize that Coke has been a stabilizing presence in a part of Kingston set to a permanent rolling boil And many now say that the current push to capture Coke is merely an act of political expediency for Golding and that little will be gained by cutting the head of this hydra  I really dont know if this is a permanent severing of links or a really nasty breakup said James I think they are going to realize they still need each other There is always someone else to come up from where the last one left off The money is too good The actual business of drug dealing gunrunning is just too easy Its kind of ludicrous to think it will be over Politicians cant survive without West Kingston and I dont think West Kingston can survive without politicians Its such a unique case in so many ways A politician has never turned over a don but this is no ordinary don  Even if Coke is soon captured few in Jamaica expect that the prime ministers standing will recover With both major political parties stained by association with drug gangs the more significant damage is to the legitimacy of Jamaicas government overall  especially its police and armed services  which was never held in high regard but is now being reassessed by a much broader spectrum of Jamaican society  Copyright 2014 Foreign

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127038768&ft=3&f=,The 13th Floor Elevators recorded one of the great underground rock songs of the 1960s The scream in Youre Gonna Miss Me seemed to mark the bands lead singer Roky Erickson for fame and fortune But it didnt work out that way Instead Erickson is mostly famous as a cautionary tale a man who took too many psychedelic drugs then struggled with mental illness Now Erickson has released a new record he made with the help of an indierock band he inspired Okkervil RiverNo matter how far Erickson retreated from the world his fans never forgot about himYou know Id grown up in Texas filmmaker Keven McAlester says And in Texas if youre a music fan Roky Erickson is sort of like the Loch Ness monster There are all these myths about him Youre not sure which was true and which were apocryphalMcAlester spent six years filming Erickson and his family for his documentary Youre Gonna Miss Me By the time McAlester found him Erickson was living in seclusion his mental illness untreated In one scene from the documentary Erickson flips on half a dozen radios and televisions and a Casio keyboard before lying down to sleepWhen McAlester first met him he didnt think Erickson would ever record againHe seemed to have so little interest in even talking about his music or acknowledging that he had done it McAlester says The idea that he could perform again in public and get into a studio and record again  I wouldve said it was impossiblePleading InsanityRoky Ericksons problems date back to the 1960s The 13th Floor Elevators are sometimes credited with inventing the term psychedelic rock And to say that Erickson dabbled in LSD would be putting it lightly Ericksons mental health was already deteriorating in 1969 when he was arrested in Texas for possession of one joint of marijuana Rather than go to jail Erickson pleaded insanity as he told radio interviewer George Gimarc in 1981Erickson I just convinced them that I was insane so I could go to a mental home instead of a prisonGimarc This was on the marijuana charge I guess what was that 69Erickson Yeah I probably wouldve been in prison about four yearsInstead Erickson spent three years at Rusk State Hospital in Texas He started a band with other patients some of whom were incarcerated for rape or murder When he got out he started recording again But his music sounded differentErickson called it horror rock inspired by the scary films and comics hed loved since childhood Some fans read his songs about monsters and demons as metaphors for his mental state But if hed intended them that way he never said so Heres another excerpt from that 1981 interviewGimarc Do you consider yourself a demonic possessed evil personErickson YesGimarc You really doErickson Yes I do Its my religion Music is evil to meEricksons mental health continued to slip He was arrested and briefly institutionalized in 1990 for stealing his neighbors mailMeeting Okkervil RiverIn 2001 a court awarded legal custody of Erickson to his younger brother Now 63 Erickson is on medication for the first time in years Hes reunited with his first wife and son And hes willing to sit down for an interview along with his collaborator Will SheffSheff and Erickson first met two years ago when Sheffs band Okkervil River backed up Erickson at the Austin Music Awards The combination worked and Ericksons manager invited Sheff to produce a new recordI was interested but I didnt want to  I wanted to make sure that I felt like I could make a good record Sheff says It was when I heard those songs that I completely sort of lunged after the projectThe songs on True Love Cast Out All Evil are based on demo recordings Erickson made throughout his career Some were recorded on a reeltoreel tape machine inside Rusk State HospitalFor other songs on the album Sheff added instruments and found sounds Erickson was never one to spend a lot of time in the studio playing the same song over and over again so Sheff took a different approachTheres an aspect of recording thats kind of banging your head against a wall stressful Sheff saysOh I tell yeah Erickson says You have to be careful about that dont youYou do Sheff says And I think that Rokys sort of feeling about keeping things moving and about keeping things fun really kept us on our toesThats right Erickson says Well I appreciate being able to take it easy you know It was really fun It was fun I dont know how much money it cost you knowHeh You dont want to know how much money it cost Sheff says laughingFinding A Weathered VoiceDuring the course of recording Sheff says Erickson seemed to find a new singing voice  one thats a long way from the scream of his youthRoky would settle into this way of doing it that I think of as this very wise weathered voice Sheff says Like a priceless antique thats been passed down thats kind of got its texture to itErickson and Okkervil River are planning to perform songs from their new album on May 24 in Austin followed by shows in Los Angeles San Francisco and New York McAlester says Ericksons unlikely comeback gives the whole story a new twistNow with the release of this record whats completely ironic about his sort of stature as the great lost vocalist or the cautionary tale of the psychedelic era is that hes pretty much the last man standing from that era whos still making relevant records McAlester saysBut then McAlester says that shouldnt be so surprising Music was always Ericksons primary way of communicatingYou know Im really enjoying what I do Erickson says Theyre good songs and everything you know Copyright 2014 NPR,20100522,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126978142&ft=3&f=,About 24000 people have been killed in drugrelated violence in Mexico since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the cartels in December 2006  But Calderons war is not just about cocaine heroin and other hard drugs Mexican troops are also fighting gun battles to stop the trafficking of marijuana  the weed that might be legalized later this year across the border in California As Mexicos biggest agricultural export marijuana generates billions of dollars in revenues each year for the brutal narcotics cartels By some estimates it is the most profitable product for the Mexican drug gangs Mexico Troops Seek And Destroy Plants Mexico the worlds largest exporter of marijuana sends almost all of its crops to the US Cannabis also accounts for almost half the cartels revenues according to an estimate from the Mexican attorney generals office   And the Mexican gangs have also established sophisticated networks to grow marijuana in national parks inside the US thus avoiding the difficulty of smuggling it north across the border In the southwestern Mexican state of Michoacan heavily armed Mexican troops trudge across pastures streams and wheat fields on a marijuanaeradication mission Spotters in a Cessna flying overhead have radioed down GPS coordinates for a suspected pot patch   Even before the soldiers reach the plot the air is thick with the pungent smell of marijuana Many of the plants are more than 6 feet tall Workers had been in the midst of harvesting this crop moments before the soldiers arrived Their lunch of rice stew and tortillas sits abandoned along with a pile of freshly picked purplish buds  Capt Oscar Salas Cordoba orders his men to rip up the plants The soldiers build several fires with wood from the surrounding trees and then hurl the marijuana plants into the flames Pull them up Salas barks In order to completely destroy the plants he says you have to yank out the roots The green weeds dont burn very well and the field is soon filled with clouds of grayishwhite smoke The patch is in the foothills of the Sierra Madre Farmers grow small plots of corn wheat beans and vegetables There are also groves of peach and avocado trees Some skinny cattle wander amid the poorly fenced fields Salas says the soil is ideal for marijuana Normally from the moment the marijuana is planted until its harvested is about two or three months he says The marijuana plants are spread out in three different areas If they had been adjacent the plots might have covered a third of a football field The crop would be worth about 4000 to the local growers Salas estimates And says Salas the value of the marijuana obviously goes up the closer the product gets to its primary market the US Last year marijuana production in Mexico increased 35 percent according to a US State Department report The report said the country had nearly 30000 acres planted in cannabis The Real Problem Organized Crime Despite an allout war by President Calderon against the drug cartels marijuana eradication efforts are down as the Mexican government focuses more effort on dangerous methamphetamine labs Marijuana and cocaine are the two largest sources of revenue for the cartels generating billions of dollars in illicit profits each year But some analysts say marijuana may be the cartels greatest source of cash in part because the Mexican gangs control the production trafficking and distribution of the drug The cocaine they move has a higher street value but they initially have to buy it from the Colombians At the soldiers base in the state capital of Morelia Brig Gen Raul Guereca Valenzuela says his troops spend much of their time destroying pot plants  But he adds Marijuana cultivation isnt the problem organized crime is the problem The narcotics traffickers intimidate and threaten the population he says  They bribe politicians  A few months ago they gunned down a local mayor In April they ambushed the state security chiefs convoy and sprayed the vehicles with more than 2000 rounds of ammunition The security chief miraculously survived but four other people were killed in the attack Eduardo Guerrero a security analyst in Mexico City says the marijuana trade is incredibly violent In Mexico the cartels dont traffic in a single product instead they control territories and specific smuggling routes into the US The same organizations the Zetas or the Gulf cartel the most violent ones they deal with all drugs  not only marijuana Guerrero says And the heavily armed gangs dont limit their criminal activities just to narcotics Theyre also involved in the sale of pirated goods extortion and kidnapping   Recently in Nuevo Leon the Mexican army stormed a ranch and freed 16 people who were being held for ransom  Among the captives were a mother and her 3yearold son   Along with the terrified hostages the soldiers found assault rifles handguns a grenade launcher  and more than 2 tons of marijuana   Copyright 2014 NPR,20100519,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/2010/05/19/126906809/mexico-seems-to-favor-sinaloa-cartel-in-drug-war?ft=3&f=,Mexican President Felipe Calderon is in Washington on Wednesday for an official state visit His battle against the violent drug cartels is high on the agenda Calderon has deployed 45000 federal troops and police to combat the drug gangs Yet in the midst of this crackdown the Sinaloa cartel  the largest oldest and richest in Mexico  appears to be flourishing An NPR News investigation has found strong evidence of collusion between elements of the Mexican army and the Sinaloa cartel in the violent border city of Juarez Dozens of interviews with current and former law enforcement agents organized crime experts elected representatives and victims of violence suggest that the Sinaloans depend on bribes to top government officials to help their leader Joaquin El Chapo Guzman elude capture expand his empire and keep his operatives out of jail I work in the police and because of this I know the government is protecting Chapo Guzman Its hitting all the cartels but Chapo said Luis Arturo Perez Torres 25 until recently a federal police officer stationed in a suburb of Mexico City Guzman is the worlds most wanted drug lord His home base is the Pacific coastal state of Sinaloa known as Mexicos Sicily Its the premier narcostate with a long coastline for smuggling cocaine from South America and rugged mountains to hide cannabis crops Manuel Clouthier a congressman from Sinaloa state and a member of Calderons political party is deeply frustrated by his countrys drug war He says drugrelated murders average 200 a month in his state We Should Be Tearing It Out By The Roots The Calderon government has been fighting organized crime in many parts of the republic but has not touched Sinaloa said Clouthier I know this Im Sinaloan My family lives in Sinaloa It is like were trimming the branches of a tree when we should be tearing it out by the roots Asked if the government is going soft on the countrys biggest drug cartel Clouthier responds choosing his words carefully I believe that much of the problem of not combating a certain cartel in a certain state has much to do with corruption and lack of will he said On Tuesday reporters asked a senior White House official in light of Washingtons large package of security aid to Mexico if Calderons government is protecting Chapo Guzman The US is giving 13 billion in military and judicial aid to Mexico for its drug war as Mexican drug cartels are major suppliers to the illicit US narcotics trade The Obama administration official said the president has a longterm commitment to Calderons struggle against the cartels He mentioned that Mexico has arrested and extradited important cartel figures in recent months NPR Analysis Of Arrest Data In an effort to find out whether federal forces are favoring the Sinaloa cartel NPR analyzed thousands of news releases on the federal attorney generals website announcing arrests for organized crime weapons and drug offenses The information surveyed spanned from the day Calderon assumed the presidency in December 2006 until last week NPR created a database and screened the information for every person the government arrested prosecuted or sentenced who was associated with one of the seven major drug cartels The analysis showed that the Mexican government crackdown has not hit the Sinaloans as hard as it has other cartels Nationwide 44 percent of all cartel defendants are with the Zetas and Gulf cartels Only 12 percent of the defendants are with the Sinaloa cartel The numbers contradict the Mexican government which claims it has arrested twice the percentage of Sinaloa gang members US Rep Michael McCaul RTX a  former federal prosecutor who sits on the Homeland Security Committee was asked to review the NPR analysis I think youve identified an issue of concern he said And that is why is the Sinaloa doing so much better than the others and why is the Sinaloa cartel been the one that has escaped a lot of the prosecutions compared to the other cartel numbers In response to NPRs findings the Mexican Interior Secretariat on Tuesday said all drug cartels are being attacked proportional to their size A spokesman rereleased figures the agency put out three months ago 72000 persons have been arrested for drug crimes of those 24 percent are members of the Sinaloa cartel and 27 percent are Gulf cartel and Los Zetas A veteran Mexican crime journalist says this figure may include every drug arrest including streetcorner dealers NPR only counted federal arrest records of named cartel associates Calderon Denies Selectively Fighting The Cartels The growing criticism in Mexico that Calderon is selectively fighting the cartels prompted him to speak out at a press conference in February These accusations are totally unfounded false In most cases it reflects a misunderstanding of the facts the result of other interests I want to be clear he said The Mexican president went on to name several Sinaloa crime bosses the government has arrested  the biggest being Vicente El Mayito Zambada son of El Mayo Zambada a close ally of Guzmans NPRs analysis is supported by a Mexican law professor and organized crime expert Edgardo Buscaglia He teaches at ITAM a Mexico City university and at Columbia University in New York Buscaglia has done his own analysis of cartel arrests If you look at the main organized crime group in Mexico that is the Sinaloan confederation it has been left relatively untouched he said Senior US officials who declined to speak on the record for this report say they believe Calderon is sincere about rooting out corruption in his government and taking down all the drug mafias Extraordinarily Brazen Drug Cartels A senior DEA official speaking on background said certain cartels are so extraordinarily brazen theyve demanded the governments attention first Los Zetas for instance are involved in everything from drugs to extortion to stealing gasoline La Familia Michoacana beheads its rivals and has even threatened the president They are more of a public threat than the Sinaloans  who US law enforcement sources say stick to narcotics and money laundering and try to stay out of the spotlight A senior State Department official also speaking off the record concurred When you have limited capability theres no doubt that you set priorities and do triage and thats what were seeing she said A former US counterintelligence agent who analyzes drug mafia activity in Mexico agreed that Calderons government may be playing favorites with the Sinaloans but if thats true it could be a standard law enforcement strategy to attack organized crime syndicates The FBI has the long history of that in breaking the back of Italian crime groups here in the US If you need intel to go after these organizations you have to go to individuals who are involved in this to begin with Youre not going to get this info from choirboys said Fred Burton now an analyst with the Austinbased global intelligence firm Stratfor Sinaloa Cartel Excels At Bribing Officials But does the Sinaloa cartels reputation for wellplaced bribes help keep its members out of jail A cartel cannot flourish at their level without civil and military protection at the highest levels said Jorge Carrasco who covers organized crime for the respected Mexican newsmagazine Proceso The magazine recently put Guzman on the cover with the headline  The Untouchable The Sinaloans are widely regarded as the most sophisticated cartel in transportation intelligence gathering and bribery A few examples  Last year Proceso reported on how a Sinaloan faction controlled several airports around the country through a network of corrupt federal agents The faction even had its own hangar at the international airport in Mexico City  Last week the Mexican newspaper Reforma described how the Sinaloans had thoroughly infiltrated the federal police The drug gang knew where the cops were being sent next and how many buses would carry them The newspaper added that a navy investigation uncovered that the Sinaloans controlled eight seaports for cocaine smuggling from South America  A 2007 army intelligence report obtained by The Wall Street Journal and shared with NPR describes how Guzman would visit his marijuana ranch in Sinaloa in caravans of six vehicles with the protection of the Mexican army  Jose Gomez Llanos is on the US Treasurys list of foreign narcotics kingpins He is suspected of being a money launderer for Guzman He is currently the top federal prosecutor in the state of Tamaulipas  A 2008 corruption scandal implicated the chief of the nations organized crime unit Noe Ramirez Mandujano He was accused of taking 450000 to tip off the BeltranLeyva cartel at the time a powerful member of Guzmans socalled Sinaloa federation Mafia analysts note that federal law enforcement in December 2009 killed and captured two of the BeltranLeyva brothers Arturo and Carlos respectively which has weakened their crime syndicate to Guzmans advantage US Concern About Mexican Corruption Has the Sinaloa infiltrated the Mexican government Absolutely Has the Sinaloa infiltrated the Mexican military Absolutely Calderon has a very difficult job trying to root out corruption within his own ranks said McCaul the Texas congressman He added that he believes the Mexican president has been quick to rid his administration of corrupt officials A senior US government official involved in counterdrug policy in Latin America who asked that his name not be used acknowledged that corrupt officials in Calderons government are a real concern We have to gauge intelligence sharing with Mexican law enforcement against how high the cartels have penetrated Do we endanger our sources Right now theres great pushback from our intelligence community for greater intelligence sharing he said NPRs analysis found 400 public officials  from local cops to army officers  who have been arrested for working for the drug mafias in the past 3 12 years The pattern is clear All the cartels infiltrate local and state agencies but the Sinaloans and their former ally the BeltranLeyva organization were more likely to pay off the military and senior federal officials compared with other cartels according to the arrest data The Sinaloa has been clearly the winner of all that competition among organized crime groups And as a result of that they have gained more economic power they have been able to corrupt with more frequency and corrupt with more scope Now you see that Sinaloa is the most powerful criminal group not just in Mexico but all over Latin America said Buscaglia the law professor and organized crime expert How Vast Is The Governments Role Buscaglia stops short of saying he thinks it is Calderons policy to protect Guzman or that the government wants to help the drug baron defeat other cartels as a way to restore balance in the underworld and ultimately reduce violence Howard Campbell an anthropologist at the University of Texas El Paso who studies drug trafficking in Mexico agrees This isnt to say that the president of Mexico has deliberately made a deal with Chapo Guzman Campbell said But people below him may have and the outcome may be about the same Anabel Hernandez is an awardwinning investigative reporter who has spent five years researching a book on Guzman In an interview she said she is convinced that two successive administrations of the National Action Party have favored the 53yearold drug lord ever since he bribed his way out of a maximumsecurity Mexican federal prison in a laundry truck in 2001 When the Sinaloan cartel began to be protected by all the apparatus of the government after 2001 it felt the power for the first time in history to occupy plazas that for dozens of years belonged to other cartels So you saw them take on the Gulf cartel in Nuevo Laredo in 2005 and now the Juarez cartel in Juarez she said Hernandez concluded My hypothesis after five years of investigation is that Joaquin Guzman Loera is the best example of corruption in Mexico Forbes magazine recently named Guzman as the secondmostwanted fugitive in the world after Osama bin Laden They are both protected by mountains native cunning and legions of informers A former senior DEA official with experience in Mexico who asked to not be named said in an interview that Guzman has effectively penetrated every civilian and military force in

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126890893&ft=3&f=,Mexico is the main foreign supplier of marijuana and methamphetamines to the United States It is also a main transit point for cocaine heroin and other drugs coming to the US from other countries Mexican cartels have displaced Colombian groups as the dominant cocaine traffickers in the world Several drug cartels have operations in Mexico and much of the violence stems from struggles over territory The cartels control over specific regions of the country shifts as alliances change and government arrests disrupt the balance of power Mexican President Felipe Calderons administration has attempted to rid Mexico of the top narcotraffickers but cartel members have killed thousands in an effort to gain control of the lucrative drug trafficking routes The Gulf cartel based in Tamaulipas was considered the most powerful drug trafficking organization when President Calderon took office in December 2006 Much of its power came from Los Zetas their enforcement arm When the two groups split Los Zetas became dominant and the Gulf suffered from arrests as a result of targeted law enforcement efforts Increasing tensions have led to warfare between the two and the formation of a new faction called the New Federation made up of the Gulf cartel and two enemies of Los Zetas La Familia and Sinaloa Violence has increased along the TexasMexico border and in Monterrey Mexico in the struggle for control of territory The BeltranLeyva organizations network stretches over a large portion of Mexico from the Pacific Coast into the northeastern regions The group was a part of the Sinaloa cartel until 2008 After becoming independent it grew in power assisted by a sophisticated intelligence network and an active relationship with the powerful Los Zetas to broaden the control of territory But on Dec16 2009 their leader Arturo Jefe de Jefes BeltranLeyva was killed in a gunfight with Mexican troops His brother Carlos was arrested soon after Arturos death A rift over control of the group has formed between the remaining brother Hector and another powerful leader within the organization Edgar La Barbie Valdez Villarreal The fight has spread into the states of Guerrero Mexico Puebla and Hidalgo Los Zetas is one of the most powerful and violent cartels in Mexico Started by a group of former military commandos and led by Heriberto El Lazca Lazcano Lazcano Los Zetas gained a reputation as ruthless enforcers and forged relationships with other cartels It formed an alliance with the BeltranLeyva organization in part to fight their common enemy the Sinaloa cartel and also to extend their presence into Central America They now find themselves in a violent struggle with the New Federation a recent faction consisting of the Gulf La Familia and Sinaloa cartels The Sinaloa cartel like the Tijuana cartel was formed in 1989 when the head of the Guadalajara cartel was captured The groups leader Joaquin El Chapo Guzman Loera is on the Forbes list of richest people Despite losing the membership to the BeltranLeyva and Juarez cartels it remains the most dominant group in Mexico and Latin America The Sinaloa cartel is the leading cocaine trafficker from South America to the worldwide market with an economic presence in 47 countries The Sinaloa and Juarez cartels are battling a vicious war in an effort to take control over Ciudad Juarez in Chihuahua state  an area vital to running massive drug operations in the United States The Tijuana cartel run by the Arellano Felix family was formed when the head of the Guadalajara cartel was captured in 1989 Once considered one of the strongest and deadliest cartels the Tijuana cartel has been weakened by the arrests and deaths of its key leaders The last of the five Arellano Felix brothers Eduardo was arrested in 2008 and ensuing squabbles resulting from the leadership vacuum led the group to split into two  one run by Fernando El Ingeniero Sanchez Arellano and the other by Eduardo Teodoro El Teo Garcia Simental who was arrested in January 2010 The Vicente Carrillo Fuentes organization or Juarez cartel is headquartered in Ciudad Juarez The area is considered one of the most coveted trafficking routes in the Americas The cartels enforcement arm is a gang called La Linea The group was founded by Vicentes brother Amado who died in 1997 while undergoing plastic surgery The cartels influence has dropped because of the arrest in 2009 of its financier Vicente Carrillo Leyva and its ongoing battle with the Sinaloa cartel over control of the Juarez region The continuing conflict makes Juarez the most violent city in Mexico La Familia is based in the state of Michoacan but also has operations in the states of Guerrero Guanajuato Mexico Jalisco and Queretaro La Familia formed in the 1980s received a good deal of publicity in 2009 when the former Mexican attorney general called it the most violent criminal organization in Mexico Yet its influence compared with the other cartels is still fairly small Leadership of the organization is shared by Jose El Chango Mendez Vargas and Nazario Moreno Gonzalez

among the cartels  and between government forces and the cartels  has cost nearly 24000 Mexican lives since Calderon took office in late 2006 The US is giving 13 billion in military and judicial aid to Mexico to help Calderons battle against the drug mafias Mexicos drug cartels are the major foreign supplier of marijuana and methamphetamines to the United States and Mexico is a main conduit for cocaine coming mainly from Colombia An NPR News investigation in Ciudad Juarez  ground zero of Calderons cartel war  finds strong evidence that Mexicos drug fight is rigged according to court testimony current and former law enforcement officials and an NPR analysis of cartel arrests  In that border city federal forces appear to be favoring one cartel the Sinaloa named after the coastal state in northwestern Mexico which the US Justice Department calls one of the largest organized crime syndicates in the world El Chapo Seeks Control A woman in stretch pants and sneakers peddles music CDs of narcoballads in the streets of Juarez Her most popular inventory represents the two narcotics cartels battling for control of the city across the border from El Paso Texas The hometown favorite is La Linea or the Juarez cartel The newest gang in town is a group of freelance local traffickers backed by the Sinaloa cartel whose chief is Joaquin El Chapo Guzman Loera La Linea is from here Its the Juarez cartel the woman says Chapo wants to take over Juarez but those with La Linea dont want to give it up This is why theres so much killing With a 5 million bounty on his head Guzman is the worlds most wanted drug lord He is said to live deep in the state of Sinaloa  hundreds of miles from Juarez  protected by mountains an army of pistoleros loyal villagers and his own wolfish cunning  Everywhere in Juarez people whisper the story about how the Mexican army and federal police are helping Guzmans gangs of assassins capture the city Fear And Suspicion Most residents are afraid to talk about it openly Their suspicions are based on what they see and what they live Over the past two years the president has dispatched 10000 army troops and federal police to Juarez to quell the violence thats been killing six victims a day The presence of the army and the federal police has not resolved the problem says Manuel Espino former congressman from Juarez and former head of the National Action Party the presidents party On the contrary its gotten worse El Chapo comes to town to take over the territory It makes us believe theres a complicity with the federal government Veteran journalists in Juarez see it too Edgar Roman is news director of Channel 44 a Juarez television station  When youre out on the streets of Juarez and you hear constantly from people that are eyewitnesses relatives of victims theyre saying prior to the killings the army was here They left here and armed men came and killed somebody Roman says  The drug traffickers whose death squads cause much of the mayhem make the same accusation A Message On A Wall Last month gunmen killed six federal police officers and left a message painted on a public wall This is what happens to officers who ally with Chapo and all those mother       who support him Signed  La Linea  NPR spoke to a former Juarez city police commander who confirms the story The intention of the army is to try and get rid of the Juarez cartel so that Chapos cartel is the strongest says the excommander who asked that his name not be used because of death threats he says he received in Juarez  He was on the force when the Sinaloa cartel came to town and he says his entire police department worked for the local cartel He is now seeking asylum in El Paso  When the army arrived in March 2008 we thought damn now all this violence is going to end he says The number of deaths did drop for about three weeks But during those three weeks Chapos people contacted the army and figured out what they were doing and how much money they wanted They started to pay them off and the Sinaloans just kept working Testimony MilitarySinaloa Cartel Ties Collusion between the Mexican army and the Sinaloa mafia in Juarez is further corroborated by sworn testimony in US federal court where two top Sinaloa traffickers went on trial in El Paso in March  One of the governments main witnesses was a convicted former Juarez police captain Manuel FierroMendez who went on to work for the Sinaloans He testified that he regularly provided intelligence on La Linea to an army captain after which the military would go arrest people and seize weapons and vehicles In an exchange with lead prosecutor Russell Leachman FierroMendez described the need to have control over local state and federal agencies and have free rein to continue trafficking drugs without any problem Later in the day Leachman asked FierroMendez And was the influence with the military an important factor Very important he replied US Drug Enforcement Administration agent Matthew Sandberg testified at the trial confirming the contact between FierroMendez and a Mexican army officer codenamed Pantera the Panther  NPR Looks At Arrest Data In an effort to get a more precise picture of who the authorities are pursuing in Juarez an NPR News investigation analyzed thousands of news releases posted on the website of Mexicos federal attorney generals office the Procuraduria General de la Republica The news releases document every arrest of a cartel member charged with organized crime weapons or drug offenses  Juarez is the murder capital of Mexico and now the most patrolled and policed city in Mexico The NPR analysis found that since federal forces arrived in the state of Chihuahua in March 2008 there have been 104 arrests involving suspects identified as cartel members Of those arrests 88 were affiliated with the Juarez cartel and 16 with Sinaloa  But Enrique Torres spokesman for the military and police joint operation in Chihuahua says there is no way there is favoritism The work of the Mexican army in Chihuahua and here on the border is to damage the structures of criminal groups regardless of their origin Torres says Weve arrested many criminals for many crimes who belong to all the drug trafficking groups In February growing criticism that Calderons forces are selectively fighting the cartels prompted him to address the issue at a news conference These accusations are totally unfounded false In most cases it reflects a misunderstanding of the facts the result of other interests I want to be clear Calderon said  Roots Of Sinaloas Success Is the reason that fewer of Guzmans people are in jail that they are smarter traffickers Tony Payan a political scientist at the University of Texas El Paso and the Autonomous University of Juarez says the Sinaloans operate in apache raids in Juarez Chapo sends his people into the city and they clean out a number of people theyve already identified Payan explains But they do it in a very disciplined way theyre not sloppy he adds The Juarez cartel has proven to be very sloppy Theres a simple explanation why the authorities arrest more traffickers from the Juarez cartel says Joe Arabit special agent in charge of the El Paso office of the Drug Enforcement Administration The DEA is a strong supporter of Calderons crackdown on the cartels  La Linea has controlled the smuggling corridor so there are more Juarez cartel operators in this corridor than any other cartel Therefore youre going to see more people from that cartel being arrested he says Shifting Alliances Among Cartels But this explanation overlooks an important detail say local journalists who cover street crime As the Sinaloa cartel has muscled into the city La Linea gangsters switch sides and join the Sinaloans also known as la gente nueva the new people Theres even a name for them  chapulines or grasshoppers  The small number of arrests of Sinaloa operatives is striking to Howard Campbell an anthropologist at the University of Texas El Paso and an expert on Mexican drug trafficking He sees a larger strategy at work  It appears the cartel de Sinaloa is winning the battle over the cartel de Juarez and it doesnt seem possible for them to do that without some sort of backing from the Mexican military he says For the drugs to get to Ciudad Juarez and from there into the US they have to pass through militarycontrolled territory And so the military is either absolutely inept or theyre corrupted by the Chapo Guzman cartel Theres really no other explanation Campbell says Other Cartels Also Involved In Corruption This is not an exclusive arrangement  corrupt elements of the Mexican military are for hire for any cartel Two former Juarez police commanders  one interviewed by NPR and another who testified in federal court  said the Juarez cartel also pays off the army  Indeed in 1997 Mexicos thendrug czar Gen Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo was convicted and imprisoned for working for the Juarez cartel at the time the countrys top drug mafia Four years ago a detachment of soldiers was caught escorting a shipment of marijuana through Juarez cartelcontrolled territory Cartel Wars

Sheriff Arvin West and his deputy went to Washington DC to testify at a congressional hearing about the incident The dope was being smuggled into his county When the deputies arrived at the border where the drug loads were to cross the deputies were met with the Mexican military in a military Humvee The deputies reported seeing heavily armed soldiers in the Humvee The deputies took a defensive position while the Humvee and load vehicles crossed back into Mexico West testified    The paunchy nononsense lawman in a white hat is worried these days that the drug violence is about to spill over the Rio Grande into his county  Until one person is in charge of all the drugs theyre going to keep killing each other he says of the Mexican cartels And theyre going to use the Mexican government to help them do it he said in a recent interview in the town of Fort Hancock Hudspeth County is across the Rio Grande from the newest Sinaloacontrolled territory el Valle de Juarez The Juarez Valley is a region of cotton fields and farm towns east of that city  so close to Texas that you can watch the Walmart trucks creeping past on Interstate 10 For decades this has been a valuable smuggling area Thats why the Sinaloa cartel wants it  A Fight In The Valley Carlos Spector is an immigration attorney in El Paso whose family goes back three generations in the Juarez Valley The Valle de Juarez represents a model of how the cartel war is being fought and its relationship to the Mexican government Spector says He and other sources with direct knowledge of the Juarez Valley say it appears that the armys policy is to stand by and let the Sinaloa hit men do their work Nothing could happen without the military So it was by omission by refusing to act that they participate with the drug traffickers Spector says  In the past two years Sinaloans have used a scorchedearth strategy of murder torture and arson to take over the Juarez Valley under the direction of an assassin nicknamed

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126806429&ft=3&f=,For decades illegal marijuana cultivation has been an economic lifeblood for three counties in northern California known as the Emerald Triangle  The war on drugs and frequent raids by federal drug agents have helped support the local economy  keeping prices for street sales of pot high and keeping profits rich  But high times are changing Legal pot under the guise of the Californias medical marijuana laws has spurred a rush of new competition As a result the wholesale price of pot grown in these areas is plunging Demand Not Meeting Supply In 1983 the Reagan administration launched a massive air and ground campaign to eradicate pot and lock up growers in northern California Charley Custer a writer and community activist had just arrived to Humboldt County from Chicago With the Reagan crackdown Custer recalls wholesale prices shot up  to as high as 5000 a pound That sudden and ironic windfall for those growers willing to risk prison time transformed the community A lot of people were living on welfare and peanut butter and banana sandwiches for a long time before pot made it possible to be part of the middle class Custer says Nearly 30 years later Custer says that boom may be over Outdoor growers are having a hard time unloading their fall harvest Custer says And this is six months later and when some people do move it they dont get nearly the price they were hoping for That goes for both legal growers who cultivate limited quantities of pot under the medical marijuana laws and illegal operators who often grow larger amounts  Prices are now much less than 2000 a pound according to interviews with more than a dozen growers and dealers Mendocino County Sheriff Tom Allman says some growers cant get rid of their processed pot at any price We arrested a man who had  800 pounds of processed Allman says Eight hundred pounds of processed And we asked him What are you going to do with 800 pounds of processed And he said I dont know Only The Good Ones Make It As recently as last December things were still pretty upbeat At Area 101 an events and healing center near Laytonville local growers gathered to celebrate the Emerald Cup an annual competition for the seasons best pot buds But the events host Tim Blake says the mood has darkened since then Theres a tremendous amount of concern borderlining on fear says the former underground grower who now cultivates medical marijuana  He says the drop in pot prices is in part the result of more growers and a more tolerant legal landscape But he says another factor is quality Indoorgrown marijuana is increasingly favored by dispensaries and consumers for its looks consistence and potency It costs more to produce than pot grown under the sun but commands as much as double the price Thats one reason retail prices havent hit the skids Whats happening is the people that dont have quality product arent selling it Blake says So theyre the ones that are creating this panic So it really comes back down to that just like in every other agricultural industry When you get too many vineyards and too many people growing vines out there then only the good ones make it Matt Cohen is one of those growers who are making it On an organic farm near Ukiah Cohen raises chickens grows vegetables and cultivates highgrade medical pot He has avoided the downturn by distributing marijuana directly to patients But other growers who rely on middlemen and dealers for legal and illegal sales are in financial trouble And I know people and theyre living from credit card to credit card Cohen says Theyre not even making money Its just a lifestyle that theyre in and the alternative is to go do what Instability And Anxiety In recent weeks the upheaval has spurred a series of unprecedented public forums about where things are headed for the marijuana industry especially if Californians vote to legalize pot this fall The displacement of persons deriving supplemental income through clipping gardening and distribution of marijuana dwarfs the number of growers who will lose their income entirely says local activist Anna Hamilton who organized a gathering in Garberville She says the broader community is already feeling the ripple effects of falling pot prices There are business foreclosures storefronts closing Theres a lot of instability and anxiety she says Still amid the turmoil Custer says some locals havent lost their sense of humor He recalls a recent musical revue where three performers in miniskirts sunglasses and spiky heels mocked the plight of local pot growers all to the beat of the 60s hit My Boyfriends Back My dealers back and Im gonna get readyHey now hey now my dealers back Custer sings It was a song of hope in this hopeless situation Itll happen to you Your dealer will come back Or maybe not Californias pot economy is transforming and its starting to resemble a real commodities

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126825930&ft=3&f=,This week the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy the drug czar office unveiled its first National Drug Control Strategy The policys release has been repeatedly rescheduled and last week drug czar Gil Kerlikowske explained the delays to me with disarming candor Its just been hard to get it on the presidents calendar because of what he has had in front of himNow that the strategy is out Whats different  as a matter of both the strategy document and Obamas broader approach to drugs  and whats the sameThe Disappointments1 Were still too focused on fighting drug suppliers America will continue to spend billions on operations against drug suppliers which have little demonstrated value In the runup to this weeks release ONDCP tried to shift some of this money to a more balanced portfolio of evidencebased enforcement prevention and treatment efforts But the office lost that internal political fight with the supplyside enforcement community which favors an excessive emphasis on measures such as crop eradication border interdiction and lawenforcement operations against drug dealers despite the lack of evidence that these actions effectively disrupt drug markets2 Prevention is still underfunded In part because of entrenched political resistance from the supplyside enforcement community and in part because of general budgetary pressures the Obama administration is not providing sufficient funds to back up its own lofty prevention rhetoric The 151 million increase in federal funding will be helpful and ONDCP proposes more effective evidencebased approaches than the federal government has employed before Yet as ONDCP Deputy Director Thomas McLellan puts it thats not a lot of money compared with what we could really do given the state of the science We could do a lot more with one point five billion Given the amounts we know are required to make the best prevention programs work this is a missed opportunity3 Were not focusing on other addictive substances ONDCP would face a political firestorm in Congress and ironically perhaps from others on the same turf within the public health community if it addressed alcohol and tobacco in the same spirit as other addictive substances Thats too bad because these separate lanes continue to undermine efforts to reduce crime and promote public healthThe Improvements1 The attitude and orientation of drug policy is changing Despite these missed opportunities the new strategy is a major improvement On the level of principle Im heartened that the plan departs from the traditional blunderbuss rhetoric of American drug policy This change is matched by Kerlikowskes personal inclusiveness and civility traits that his Republican predecessor John Walters  who is known for alienating liberals and conservatives alike with his ecumenical disregard for opposing views  certainly did not possess2 The definition of success is changing During the past 20 years as street prices of drugs have declined underscoring the failure of enforcement efforts more than 150000 injectiondrug users have died of AIDS and the population of incarcerated drug offenders has climbed past 500000 Yet ONDCP has still pronounced drug policy a success as long as fewer Americans reported to national surveys that they had recently used some illicit substance In effect this yardstick elevated the prevention of casual marijuana use into the cornerstone of drug policyPreventing simple use particularly among young adults remains a stated policy goal Yet the new strategy focuses much more explicitly on harmful consequences deaths illness and injuries associated with substance use For the first time ONDCP will help public health authorities implement syringe exchange ONDCP also focuses on the surprisingly widespread problem of drug overdose which now surpasses firearms as a cause of death in the US3 Our health care and financing system is finally focusing on addiction The best aspects of the new strategy concern addiction services ONDCPs report acknowledges the uncomfortable reality that addiction treatment needs to improve Kerlikowske explained We have about 12000 treatment centers Yet most of those treatment programs dont employ physicians Some dont have computers Were not particularly sure that theyre using the besttested or evidencebased treatmentOn a daytoday basis the new strategys most important policy goal is to integrate addiction services within general medical care Only one in six Americans with drug or alcohol disorders will actually use specialty addiction services Improving services within primary care and mental health services is thus essential to halting or reducing individuals substance use McLellan describes these aspects of the new strategy as the biggest thing of my lifetime  Its the end of segregation separate but equalThe new plan pays special attention to improved diagnosis and screening The medical community has long recognized that many people with drug and alcohol problems pass through emergency departmtionStarting in 2014 anyone with an income below 133 percent of the poverty line will be eligible for Medicaid and will thus be entitled to a basic benefit package that includes addiction services This one simple change will finance care for hundreds of thousands of homeless individuals childless exoffenders and many others Medicaid eligibility also finances the medical and psychiatric services serious drug and alcohol users usually need Right now millions of drug users lack coverage for serious cooccurring conditions ranging from depression to chronic liver diseaseAlso in 2014 the new health insurance exchanges will require insurers to provide addiction and mental health benefits on similar terms to those provided for other medical and surgical benefits Altogether an estimated five million uninsured Americans with substance use disorders will gain insurance coverage4 Were dealing more effectively and diplomatically with drugs abroad ONDCP has resisted the temptation to scold other countries which has caused especially painful frictions with our Central and South American neighbors ONDCP also notes with greater candor the holdsonnomineeswhoappeartohavebeenconfirmedstalled by anonymous Senate hold Moreover McLellan is leaving His own deputy Keith Humphreys is leaving too These are real lossesThese efforts will ultimately stall unless Vice President Biden ONDCPs mercurial patron provides more vigorous and more public support Based on what Ive just seen and heard they deserve a serious chance  Copyright 2014 The New Republic,20100514,marijuana

online mapping services such as MapQuest and Google Maps GPSenabled gadgets and map apps for smart phones Could it be that as our reliance on digital navigation increases our sense of where we really are declinesMoving From Maps To AppsSomething is gained by digital innovation Our curiosity about where we are in the world may be improving  and our ability to navigate via various electronic devices is also improving says Victoria Lawson a geography professor at the University of WashingtonAnd something is lost In another sense Lawson says I get the impression that we are losing other abilities to navigate by the shape of the land the orientation of mountains and rivers as we stare at a tiny screenThe appetite for maps and road atlases in the United States is declining  annual sales were down more than 23 percent in 2008 and nearly 12 percent again in 2009 according to the Nielsen BookScan Travel Publishing Year Book 2010 by Stephen MesquitaIn fact Mesquita says sales of road maps and atlases are down worldwide because more people are using satnav and online mappingMeanwhile the sales of GPS devices and systems such as software for smart phones continue to grow Technoforecaster ABI Research predicts that shipments of worldwide global navigation systems including GPS and other countries satellitebased systems will increase from more than 500 million in 2010 to 11 billion in 2014 Everybody is doing itYou Cant Get There From HereThe problem By using uptospeed GPS instead of ageold foldout maps we may not really be getting a sense of where we are or where we are going If we are just responding to computergenerated  and sometimes mellifluously voiced  commands to turn left or go straight we are merely being told where to go and not figuring out routes and paths for ourselvesIn other words were becoming addicted to digital navigational systems and will be literally lost if theyre ever not at our side And the sense that we can navigate somewhere while doing other tasks can be dangerously distractingBrad Edmondson former editor of American Demographics magazine and founder of the ePodunk website says Getting directions from a computer is like having a conversation on Facebook It usually works but there is also a good chance that youll miss something important The computer doesnt give you the contextAnd it is that context that gives us a sense of where we are As well as where we want to be Among the digirati there is a growing belief that one way to provide context to the GPSreliant traveler may be social media In other words by using people as coordinates we can get a better understanding of where we areHiving swarming crowd sourcing call it what you will  using social media such as Twitter or Facebook to seek guidance in traveling is like asking a slew of different people for directionsProponents of digital navigation however are big on this idea They suggest that social networking can be added to GPS to enhance our ability to negotiate geography The maritime community is already experimenting with incorporating blogs such as Clay Maitlands shipping industry diary and forums such as gCaptain and Latitudes  Attitudes Seafaring into navigation on the high seas Storms rough seas pirate ships icebergs and other potential obstacles  reported through blogs or message boards  can be factored into a charted courseA recent post on The Future of Navigation blog sponsored by the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office predicts that the next generation of mariners and navigators in training colleges today will be as familiar with blogs as with the bridge and social medias role is set to grow and grow Similarly truckers have used citizens band radios for years for overland directional information And with the ubiquity of the Internet drivers of all kinds of vehicles  trucks cars motorcycles bicycles Segways  have the capability to use digital navigational innovations to guide them through a series of computerprovided twists and turns toward a destination Gadgets such as the Dash Express  which combines uptothe minute telemetry with realtime Internet information and social networking capabilities  continue to change the ways we negotiate this planet Using the next generation of navigational tools advocates say we will theoretically be able to not only ask directions to the nearest Chinese restaurant but also avoid a traffic jam find a parking place and get a recommendation for the dim sum all in one fell swoop But when it really comes down to getting from Point A to Point B are all of us really smarter than any one of us Other people are not necessarily fixed points in this confusing world They like we are constantly on the move  from place to place And opinion to opinionIn other words could it be that we find our way in this world not by being told how to get to our destination but by gaining a clear sense of where we are where we are going and where everything else is as wellRemapping The BrainIn the end the shift from hardcopy maps to computer apps may be changing the way we think Brain researchers tell us that most humans travel from known geography to unknown geography in two different ways  by using spatial strategy such as reading maps or by stimulusresponse methods such as trial end error or interacting with a GPS system When it comes to a preferred tack the population is split about in halfWriter Alex Hutchinson explores this phenomenon in a recent issue of the Canadian magazine The Walrus Neuroscientists are starting to uncover a twoway street our brains determine how we navigate but our navigational efforts also shape our brains Hutchinson writes The experts are picking up some worrying signs about the changes that will occur as we grow accustomed to the brainfree navigation of the GPS era Hutchinson explains that someone who prefers spatial navigation relies on the hippocampus a part of the brain that plays an important role in memory And someone who moves around by stimulusresponse methods tends to rely on a part of the brain called the caudate nucleus a center of motor control  He bases his work on research conducted by neuroscientist Veronique Bohbot of McGill University and othersExtrapolating from studies of mice in mazes Bohbot fears that over reliance on GPS which demands a hyperpure form of stimulusresponse behavior will result in our using the spatial capabilities of the hippocampus less and that it will in turn get smaller Hutchinson writes Other studies have tied atrophy of the hippocampus to increased risk of dementia  We can only draw an inference Bohbot tells Hutchinson But theres a logical conclusion that people could increase their risk of atrophy if they stop paying attention to where they are and where they goAnd for generations heading into old age that is alarming If forgetting how to read maps leads to forgetting everything else then that is where we  and our brains  may eventually end up in a culdesac of forgetfulness Copyright 2014 NPR,20100504,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126501269&ft=3&f=,THE HOUSE OF PUNK SLEEP When I was a little girl my grandfather taught me to sing O Sleep Why Dost Though Leave Me from Handels oratorio Semele Based on Greek mythology it tells the story of a beautiful mortal Semele who falls in love with Jupiter god of the sky One day after a postcoital nap Semele cant understand why Jupiter seems distracted she doesnt yet know that his vengeful wife Juno is plotting to send a thunderbolt her way Oblivious to the dangers of loving a married deity Semele sings of restoring her wandering love through the transformative power of sleep The Handel aria became my signature song I sang it at recitals school assemblies even after a practice air raid in second grade when some of my highstrung classmates were hyperventilating and Sister Margaret turned to me for something soothing to get our minds off a possible communist takeover I sang it for my parents friends for the neighbors and for my piano teacher who being a narcoleptic slept through it as she did through all twelve years of my piano lessons Yet in all the times I performed the song I never once thought it was weird that I was singing O Sleep Why Dost Thou Leave Me when sleep had already left certain members of my family and was with grinding relentlessness in the process of leaving me Sleep architecture along with sleep hygiene is one of those mysterious phrases that crop up regularly in sleep books It refers to the overall pattern of a persons sleep  how fast one falls asleep how long one stays asleep how often one wakes up and how that sleep is distributed across the multiple stages of sleep When I think of sleep architecture however I immediately picture my family home in Andover Massachusetts  the House of Punk Sleep It was named in honor of my mother who invariably upon rising each morning would dramatically announce that her sleep had been punk Punk was my mothers favorite synonym for anything weak dispiriting or well below par She was so protective of her fragile sleep that if any of us got up at night we were forbidden to run the water or flush the toilets or make even the slightest noise lest it wake her That she was probably wide awake was totally beside the point The inherent message was that sleep wasnt a natural process but a gift from fickle gods who at any moment could snatch it away The House of Punk Sleep had three incarnations the first a twobedroom apartment in a white Victorian near the center of town For the first two years of my life I shared a room with my Irish grandfather who lived with us on weekends The other part of the week he was in idyllic Manchesterbythe Sea where he worked as the majordomo for a socially prominent Boston Brahmin My grandfather whom Id nicknamed Bumpa was also a concert singer a voice teacher an opera aficionado a superb chef and a delightful storyteller Bumpa claimed that he inherited his poor sleep genes from his Irish mother who in turn inherited them from her Irish mother who inherited them from hers and on and on If you listened to my grandfather Ireland produced light sleepers the way it bred poets and priests but the Flynn family was particularly vulnerable for reasons he couldnt explain He referred to it halfjokingly as the Flynn curse but what exactly did that mean Did the Flynns carry a gene for fatal familial insomnia an inherited prion disease that kills through lack of sleep That was highly doubtful as Bumpa died at eightysix and my own sleepdeprived mother at eightynine is one of the most energetic people around Maybe the Flynns were short sleepers  people who only needed four or five hours a night Or maybe they were secret sleepers  people who got enough sleep but complained that they didnt Or maybe there was a curse While Bumpa may have been a poor sleeper he was a prolific dreamer and it wasnt uncommon for him to start a conversation with The weirdest thing happened last night The deceased might appear to him as real as life or he might interpret a dream as a warning such as the one foretelling the end of his career as a merchant marine As he told it and he did many times he dreamt that he was sailing past the Rock of Gibraltar when he saw a mermaid sunning herself on the limestone promontory With a nod to both Homer and the Starkist Tuna the mermaid whose blond hair cascaded down her shoulders called his name and cried Beware of drowning Beware He was docked in New York at the time and heeding the sirens warning he jumped ship And a good thing too he always said long after I knew the punch line A steward on White Stars Oceanic he was about to be reassigned to the companys newest luxury liner  the RMS Titanic In New York without a job or connections Bumpa was walking down Fifth Avenue when he literally bumped into the woman whod become his wife My English grandmother had recently moved to New York from a country estate in Leesburg Virginia where shed worked as a ladys maid for Mrs William Corcoran Eustis whose inlaws had started the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington DC Mrs Eustiss father Levi P Morton was Benjamin Harrisons vice president and so rich that Henry Adams the Washington chronicler referred to him as Money Bags Through Morton my grandmother secured Bumpa a job at the Metropolitan Club which had been designed by Stanford White for the railroad tycoon J P Morgan Morgan had helped finance Thomas Edison who in 1879 had invented the incandescent lightbulb which would forever change modern sleep habits Bumpa whose Zeliglike ability to insert himself in the popular culture never ceased to amaze claimed to have met Edison through the Irish tenor John McCormack who recorded some ballads for Edisons company The astoundingly prolific Edison  he held more than one thousand patents  was said to get by on only four hours of sleep a night Bumpa delighted in quoting Edisons dictum that extra sleep made people unhealthy and inefficient to which hed invariably add and dull too In theory Bumpas nightly routine should have encouraged good sleep He never drank tea after 4 pm and abstained from cigarettes and alcohol He ate early and lightly and rarely watched television After cleaning up after the puppy and putting him in his little wicker dog bed hed say his prayers and then do eye exercises from the book Sight Without Glasses He usually dropped off right away awakening around 2 am Instead of going downstairs which he couldnt do without inciting seismic tremors that would awaken my mother he stayed in bed copying bits of Shakespeare onto pieces of Kleenex that he kept for transcription purposes on his night table His favorite quotes were sleeprelated such as Hamlets To sleep perchance to dream or Romeo and Juliets Where care lodges sleep will never lie Bumpas Shakespearean Kleenex used to drive my mother crazy and one day she left his bedroom window open and all the tissues flew out Youd have thought they were part of the original folio edition for all the importance I attached to them Running outside I chased them around the neighborhood salvaging a scrap of The Tempest from our birdbath After plucking off a few stray feathers I pinned We are such stuff as dreams are made on to the clothesline and hung it out to dry From then on Bumpa always joked that my mother had murdered sleep by tossing Shakespeare out the window and disheartened he switched to Websters dictionary transcribing vocabulary words onto Kleenex I could always tell how badly hed slept by the number of new words foisted on me at breakfast You better eat your Cream of Wheat hed say so you will feel satiated Or May I offer you some delectable donuts Dont eat too many of them however or else it could prove deleterious to your burgeoning waistline Pockets bulging with words he had to be careful not to let my mother get near his plaid bathrobe in case Webster wound up in the wash Excerpted from Wide Awake

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2010/05/03/126386819/covering-tainted-justice-and-winning-a-pulitzer?ft=3&f=,Philadelphia Daily News reporters Barbara Laker and Wendy Ruderman received the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting for the 10month series Tainted Justice an expose of alleged corruption among members of an elite narcotics squad on the Philadelphia police forceDuring their reporting Laker and Ruderman uncovered allegations against officers that included committing sexual assaults disabling surveillance cameras during drug raids to hide their misdeeds and filing fraudulent warrants During several raids the police allegedly stole thousands of dollars in merchandise and money from small retailersAs a result of Laker and Rudermans investigation hundreds of drug cases in Philadelphia have been reexamined and in some cases thrown out In addition the Philadelphia police launched a task force which includes members of the FBI the forces Internal Affairs division and the city Inspector Generals Office to investigate the allegationsFive of the officers involved officers remain on desk duty more than 15 civil suits have been filed in federal court against members of the forceInterview HighlightsOn informant Ventura Martinez who alleged that he and narcoticsunit officer Jeffrey Cujdik fabricated evidence in at least two dozen casesWendy Ruderman He had come into our office looking for protection He was terrified that he was either going to be killed by a police officer or he was going to be killed by a drug dealer on the street  He alleged that  when he and Officer Cujdik couldnt make drug buys out of a house the officer told him to go buy drugs elsewhere On factchecking Martinezs storyRuderman We went to the homes  every single house  where he said he didnt really make the buy that Cujdik claimed he did in a warrant People had been locked up but we talked to relatives and we asked them what happened during the raidsOn how the victims of the false warrants feltRuderman They knew that something wasnt right They had told their attorney something wasnt right But whos going to believe them The system is entirely stacked  Its the police officers word against your word and you can get up there and say Yeah I sell drugs but I dont sell that kind of drug  and you know whos going to listen to you On finding out about the alleged sexual assaults that took place during some raidsRuderman Just by chance the wife of the man who was arrested told us that she was home alone at the time with her children and that this one officer took her to a back room off the kitchen  and none of the other officers were with her  and he fondled her breasts and lifted up her shirt She feared she was going to be raped He commented on her tattoos Asked her to pull down her jeans a little so he could see her tattoo She was petrified Absolutely petrifiedOn the victims of other alleged sexual assaults they foundRuderman Two went on the record The third we did grant anonymity to because the allegation was that the officer shoved his hand up her vagina And she was petrified and went to the hospital that night and they did a rape kit Because of that she was scared and we granted her anonymity The other two were courageous women and gave us their names and told us their story with their faces names and everything On the Philadelphia police knowing about the officers alleged sexual misconductRuderman It was like an open secret It was almost like Well this is just what that cop does And all of the women felt the police department wasnt hearing them because they couldnt identify the officer by name But when they went to Internal Affairs they were shown an array of 80 photographs of police officers and a lot of the photos dated back years  when the officers first joined the police department  so they didnt look like they looked nowOn alleged thefts during raids against mom and pop storesRuderman The police would record that they seized 1000 but actually the store owners were alleging that No I had 7000 in my store A lot of these store owners dealt in cash They paid their vendors in cash They didnt trust banks  So in addition to just having their stores left in shambles they allege that thousands of dollars were gone And when they told their attorneys about it their attorneys said Well everybody says that Everybody says that all the time How are you going to prove it Its your word against their word On how finding surveillance videos changed that storyBarbara Laker A lot of people who were skeptical at first with the first cashtheft story when they could see visually that these were officers disabling cameras in stores it was incredible They could see it and believe it Any kind of criticism we had gotten before from the police department went away On how they felt when known drug dealers were released from prisonLaker I definitely struggled with it And it helped when we found the mom and pop merchants who had been raided by the same squad Because they were not drug dealers It put my mind more at ease We were on to something that involved innocent people who had been victimized  So we did feel guilty about the drug dealers but once we found these merchants I think in my mind and Wendys mind it relieved our anxiety a little because we felt like wed found truly innocent people Copyright 2014

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/ablogsupreme/2010/04/treme_episode_three_playing_for_that_money.html?ft=3&f=,The most powerful scene in episode three of Treme takes place in the destroyed Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans Mardi Gras Indians from several tribes have gathered to commemorate the death of their comrade who literally died during Hurricane Katrina In the middle of the highly spiritual ceremony set amid grey destruction a Katrina Tour bus barrels through The hostility is searingTreme is about the residents of New Orleans but the real town depends economically on tourism and its cinematic depiction doesnt ignore this Antoine and the buskers make their livings playing music largely for tourists restaurants like Janettes do business with outoftowners Davis last paycheck came from working at a hotel And not just the debaucheryBourbon Street side of tourism but the marketing of culture of authentic experience of an eccentric city The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival as amazing and overwhelming as it is testifies to thisWith the Katrina Tour bus and the clueless Wisconsin tourists of episode two Tremes creators seem to be hinting at what they feel constitutes authentic experience It cant be voyeurism or passively observed its participated in lived every day by everyday people Its an argument that compelling cultural activity happens all the timeIn New Orleans where musicians are very much everyday people the shows soundtrack is more than just background music Speaking of that soundtrack WBGOs Josh Jackson and I having just soaked up three days of Jazz Fest emailed about episode three as we have for the first two as well HBOs full playlist is herePatrick Jarenwattananon Ok so lets look at the music performances which you and I recently learned were entirely recorded live to tape  no studio mixingin afterward Its an amazing engineering feat if I may say so The first is Annie and Sonnys performance with the accordion player doing La Vie En Rose Thats in the French Quarter I can recognize I know theres a lot of competent busking in that part of townJosh Jackson Thats Jackson Square in front of St Louis Cathedral Its a great spot for busking since so many tourists pass there A certain 43rd POTUS once executed some lovely stagecraft in that area the colonial seat of government called The Cabildo is there tooThe accordion player with them is a real one Bruce Sunpie Barnes Hes a zydeco player I use that term rather generally because he can play a lot of music thats not adherent to a singular wordPJ At that moment Tom McDermott approaches them  as in the actual musician Tom McDermott I know Ive heard that name before he played piano during Toast of the Nation 2009 and I know you saw him a few days ago backing up singer Lillian Boutte Who is this catJJ Tom McDermott is a very versatile pianist I think hes been in the talent deserving wider recognition category for most of his professional life Tom has an incredible knowledge of creole dance music that contributed in some way or another to the development of jazz or more broadly the identity of New Orleans music He can play contradanzas habaneras choro and ragtime He can also play the rumba style of Professor Longhair or the florid classical funk of pianist James Booker He can navigate the complexity of Jelly Roll Mortons Finger Buster with savoir faire When I saw him at Donnas he opened with Sousas Stars and Stripes Forever and he put many of these elements into the performance Hes also a great accompanist for a singer He brings a lot to the bandstandPJ Tom hires Annie to play a gig with him duo violin and piano Even though its her birthday she takes the gig  she could probably use the money Theyre shown jamming on an old standard King Porter Stomp Now I noticed when Tom was chatting up Annie he asked her if she played jazz if she read music stuff like that Which brings up this point if you want to make a living as a musician in New Orleans you have to be exceptionally good and exceptionally versatileJJ You have to be a very capable musician to survive in New Orleans Musicianship is an ageold craft here so it doesnt seem exceptional when you live in the city and hear so much of it Im thinking of one immediate example sousaphonist Matt Perrine who had seven different gigs this past Saturday alone during Jazz Fest Thats what it takes to raise a family on performing music alone Otherwise you better know a handy trade like so many of Creoles traditionally performed including plastering tinsmithing and other crafts that contribute to the preservation of New Orleans architectural heritagePJ Dr John makes a performing cameo in this episode being a bit gruff and rehearsing his take on My Indian Red for the Jazz At Lincoln Center New Orleans benefit show I hear him shouting out a lot of tribes and their leaders using the word jockamo etc Whats all this aboutJJ The specific meaning is a little cloudy but most folks agree that the origin is part of the Creole patois associated with the Mardi Gras Indian rituals Theres no academy guarding a precise definition A generally accepted belief is that it is some kind of call to awareness between two rival tribesPJ Thats an obvious contrast to the version of My Indian Red at the end chanted so chillingly by the Mardi Gras indians as a sort of funeral rite Hey Pocky AWay is in there too I believe In fact Dr John says something about how hes a bit tense about coopting the Indian chant for his own performance but ultimately we see that he goes about it with respect for the songs artistic value and the tradition behind it Or did you think otherwiseJJ Well I was glad to hear him mention Danny Barkers recorded version of it Notice also he mentions Wardell Quezergue a legendary arranger of New Orleans music also known as the Creole BeethovenOf course Dr John knows this history very well Read his autobiography Under a Hoodoo Moon Hes been one of the cats for a very long timeTheres a racial context underlying that qualification he makes No one worth a damn wants to trample on something so sacrosanct to the AfricanAmerican experience of New Orleans Being a cultural carpetbagger is a cardinal sin and you dont want to be excommunicated in such a small town Dr John exposed this music to a lot of people but hes been very upfront about the sources His music also has a life of its ownPJ Davis is becoming a more complex character rather than just the somewhat annoying hotheaded fellow he first appeared to be Hes obviously a total dork and apologist about New Orleans music I mean in giving piano lessons to the Bernettes girl Sophia he teaches not scales rudiments classical pieces  but the Professor Longhair signature tune Tipitina These sorts of people actually exist in New Orleans Ive learnedJJ Yeah They have and continue to exist especially at WWOZ Even though Davis the character isnt working there right now hell be back  thats according to show cocreator Eric OvermyerWhat can I say Music lovers everywhere are passionate people Recently two volunteer announcers let that emotion get the best of them Im not naming names but a small coterie of music freaks in New Orleans know who Im talking about I think I might want someone like that teaching my daughter about Professor Longhair Hopefully Ill get to her first thoughPJ Lets go back to the scene where a drunk Antoine joins the buskers in a roughhewn but effective take on Ghost Of A Chance As an aside Wendell Pierce plays an amazing drunk Its an ironic selection the police beat him up basically for being clumsy and he stands no chance against themJJ Yea that was a painful sequence to watchPJ In The Wire the police got to be complete human beings with motivations for good or evil like any other human beings Here theyre pretty much completely almost inhumanly terrible  and I get the sense that this is how most NOLA residents view their citys police department I mean they hassle Sonny and Annie nab Delmond for marijuana arrest Antoine for no apparent reason  theyre completely unredeeming I mean they and every single other government institution is portrayed as uncaringJJ Maybe a more nuanced view of the cops will come Some people have a strong position on justice in New Orleans and whether it has ever been applied equally since Reconstruction Thats no different from many places in the South especially Welcome to the advanced discussion on culture and memory Feel free to add your comments belowAnyway New Orleans did have a few more pressing issues three months after Katrina than possession of marijuana or bumping into a police cruiser with a trombone slide Im not an apologist for either side of the coin but to be fair everyone in Treme is living in a shattered image of a community even the fictional policePJ Related to that is Delmonds sentiment which he expresses to his fellow horn players including Trombone Shorty Delmond is now a New York resident  he feels like the best musicians have to leave New Orleans to get their due He cites Louis Armstrong and Louis Prima as examples There is of course disagreement with this but nobody will deny that New Orleans is certainly a very different scene especially for a modern jazz cat like Delmond in both size and character than New York isJJ Before Jazz Fest you and I were at the Louisiana Music Factory for trumpeter Maurice Browns instore He has left New Orleans too The pianist Jesse McBride who is still in the city was telling me he had only one other gig besides his performance at the Jazz and Heritage Festival He was very matter of fact when he said to me You know how this town is about modern jazz New Orleans is different from New York or anywhere That has positive and negative connotations for individualsPJ Youre a jazz radio producer You left New Orleans for New York You know something about thisJJ Well I had it in my mind to try New York for my own reasons I got a lucky break and I was brave enough to take a calculated risk So far so good Obviously I would love to be able to do my job from anywhere but that opportunity does not yet exist If you think prospects for modern jazz musicians are dim what does that say about whatever this is that I do Anyway what I wanted ten years ago was very different Now I simply will not tolerate anything less than world domination PinkyPJ All right Brain Finally what recorded music worked well for you I noticed that the end credits roll out on Donald Harrison Jrs beautiful modal take on Indian Red Davis listens to an Ernie KDoe song and blares the New Orleans Nightcrawlers to annoy the neighbors Any thoughts on this or anything else I neglectedJJ I love Donalds version of Indian Red  reminds me of Coltranes Dear Lord Its worth noting that his sister Cherise HarrisonNelson is in the final scene with the Indians Shes an amazing woman and it was overdue from someone to really recognize that Indians are not just anpther boys club Women sew and dress tooAlso Vernel Bagneris a very talented man is Bernard LaDonnas brotherinlaw His character introduces another complexity about race which is too big to address at the moment Im sure well get to it sometimeDavis is listening to A Certain Girl to great effect The Nightcrawlers are playing their take on Lil Liza Jane its called Funky Liza The Big Chief inspects feathers to Coleman Hawkins I love that record The Hawk Flies High though I wonder if they considered Lester Young Pres has the stronger connection to New Orleans Maybe theres a connection to the name of the song itself Think DeepI heard Huey Piano Smith and James Booker and Lil Queenie in the strip joint Longtime bluesrockers The Radiators are also represented with Ace in the Hole I need to get me one of thoseRelated At NPR Music All of our Treme discussions live here Copyright 2014 NPR,20100429,marijuana

largeLaDonnas bar is in disrepair and the repairman has priorities other than fixing it Tracking her brother through the Louisiana prison network  with all attendant fees and bribes  leads to a dead end And meanwhile her family is in Baton Rouge and their lives increasingly focused there too Albert Lambreaux carpenterMardi Gras Indian is dedicated to New Orleans but finds his tools stolen from a house hes working on He also passes through a housing project the government wants to shutter after the hurricane even though it sustained little to no damage Insurance companies are holding out on Janette and her ability to get her restaurant back in business Davis is fired twice Antoine has serious childcare issues and Delmond gets busted for marijuana use as if the police had no serious crime to fightIn other words Treme paints a New Orleans stifled by bureaucracy shifty insurers and contractors aggressive law enforcement that misapplies its resources and agencies who are milking the storm for all its worth in relief funds At the same time theres music everywhere  and you cant be unhappy about that Heres the full playlist from HBO While were at it Five New Orleans BrassBand Jams for accompanimentTo talk about that music Im joined again by New Orleans native and WBGOs finest Josh JacksonPatrick Jarenwattananon First off lets map out the live music scenes in this episode Coco Robichaux starts the episode by performing a voodoo ritual in the WWOZ studios complete with chicken sacrifice live on air What is that all aboutJosh Jackson Hes singing Walking With the Spirit Coco is from Ascension Parish where Cajun culture predominates Haitians were in the canefields there too Hes part French part Choctaw French traiteur healer meets voodoo meets Native American spirituality That creates some interesting mojo non He definitely embodies the medicine man psychedelia of NightTripperera Mac Rebennack aka Dr John who himself mentions Coco Robicheaux in Walk on Guilded Splinters For the record the real DJ Davis was booted from WWOZs airwaves frequently  never for allowing ritualistic live animal sacrifice on the air That doesnt necessarily make it implausible thoughPJ Then you see the buskers Annie and Sonny playing Careless Love its most grim verse by the way and When The Saints Go Marching In to a bunch of tourists on  is that Bourbon Street I dont know  like those tourists Im actually from Wisconsin And what do you make of that whole When The Saints Go Marching In boondoggle  is that an authentic New Orleans song as was debated in the showJJ Thats not Bourbon Street It looks like Royal or Chartres Ed its Royal And no song says I love you madly like telling your lady friend that youre gonna shoot her four or five times then stand over her while she dies Murder is nothing new to the ballad tradition in America As for When the Saints Go Marching In its an old spiritual that you could hear in an authentic funeral played as a dirge or as an uptempo march Naturally the song has been commodified to the hilt local musicians rarely want to be in that number anymore I think Preservation Hall actually charges people extra when they request it Most folks who visit arent requesting Whoopin BluesPJ The buskers then take in music themselves A tradjazz band The New Orleans Jazz Vipers plays I Hope Youre Coming Back To New Orleans at The Spotted Cat What do I need to know about thatJJ You need to know that a lot of people really felt like that Joe Braun the singer and saxophonist wrote that song He got it rightPJ Antoine keeps busy this episode he plays a gig which we dont see in Algiers at the Old Point Bar Tell me about Algiers And whos that guy Antoine meets there  his old instructor who lost all his instruments in the stormJJ Algiers is the part of New Orleans on the west bank of the Mississippi It was also home to the same traditions of Creole jazz musicians as the east bank notably bandleader Papa Celestin and trumpeter Red Allen The guy Antoine meets is supposed to be his trombone teacher guessing from the sad reference to a lost instrument that Edward Kid Ory also a trombonist gave him In the real world that guy is a marvelous bluesman named Deacon JohnPJ Antoine walks by a closed Preservation Hall yet to reopen For those who dont know what is Preservation HallJJ Preservation Hall is an establishment on St Peter Street in the French Quarter Originally it was The Society for the Preservation of Traditional New Orleans Jazz created in 1961 by Ken Mills and Barbara Reid two outsiders who saw the need to save the traditional music of New Orleans from being swept into the dustbin of music Allan and Sandra Jaffe took the helm shortly thereafter They kept many musicians from the mid1950s New Orleans Jazz Revival Billie and De De Pierce Punch Miller Sweet Emma the Bell Gal George Lewis afloat during the ascendance of rock and popular musicPJ And he plays funk in a strip club on Bourbon Street That would be Up For The Down Stroke with the JT KaNection Band if youre keeping score We keep hearing this line theres pride on Bourbon Street when Antoine expresses embarrassment at taking a gig there Can you explainJJ Before it was inhabited by places to get your drink on there were still a few real places to get your jazz on In fact trumpeter Irvin Mayfield currently operates a club in the Royal Sonesta Hotel But by and large the pride thats on Bourbon is from musicians swallowing their own to take gigs at strip clubs or tourist dives to pay the bills Being a musician anywhere is a challengePJ Later in the show Antoine gets called on stage midbarbequedinner at Bullets  Kermit Ruffins is there and hes joined by a female rapper by the name of Baby J Which brings up the point New Orleans has all sorts of indigenous dialects of hiphop tooJJ Indeed Im not as conversant in the many underground artists in the city but an early variant from New Orleans was called bounce music It was less about having a great lyrical flow and more of a callandresponse party music And then Master Ps No Limit Records was basically printing money for a while Cash Money Records still is Some of the bounce style has been translated into an overarching Southern style a la AtlantaPJ Is that story that Antoine tells about Bullets trueJJ I sure hope so It was funny as hell right Antoine is a bit of a raconteur I do know that Kermit Ruffins plays Tuesday night gigs there  cover freePJ So even my thick Wisconsin brain recognized Elvis Costello and Allen Toussaint working with a horn section The two made a real album together The River In Reverse we ought to mention They were playing at a place called Piety Street Studios and I know Ive heard that name before JJ Piety Street is a recording studio run by John Fishbach Stevie Wonders Songs in the Key of Life among others and producer Mark Bingham who taught me a lot about recording when I worked for WWOZ Mark also recorded the first national broadcast I ever worked on for NPR from the Showcase Lounge  but I digress Its relatively new maybe a decade old Allen Toussaint cut his most famous recordings and collaborations with Marshall Sehorn and the Meters at SeaSaint Piety is a great room Its on higher ground near the river so it did not flood Most studios did So Piety Street Studios became the place to make records in New OrleansPJ Afterward the musicians go hear Galactic at dba another real band and real venue They play Blackbird Special and Go Go the first tune with horns We see Stanton Moore the drummer get some lines in too The script goes out of its way to point out that Galactic is a white funkjam band  and that theres nothing wrong with that I presume you could write an essay on race in New Orleans music but  at least say somethingJJ Its like race everywhere in this country It matters to many Not so much for others I heard David Simon say something on Studio 360 this weekend about how he could care less about cultural primacy Im on his side for this I like Galactic Theyre for realPJ Finally Clarke Peters I dont know my Mardi Gras Indian lore almost at all but it strikes me that hes doing a remarkable job with an almost impossible role to learn Hes Albert Lambreaux Mardi Gras Indian Chief That duet he does at the end just two tambourines and voices  thats powerful stuff rebuilding his tribe from the bottomupJJ Im going to be sorely disappointed if he doesnt sweep every award show His performance in these two episodes demands it He totally owns this character That version of Shallow Water gave me chills More proof that David Simon knows how to open and close an episode Thats craft on all levels Just an aside  hes playing with this character named George Cottrell Look up that last name and you will be immediately connected to a very important lineage in the New Orleans jazz traditionPJ As you mentioned offline it seems like the show is going out of its way to make sure every single New Orleans musician is getting performance royalties or cameos in this show So much of the show was packed with background music too Which stood out to youJJ I heard Lee Dorsey singing Ya Ya an old New Orleans RB staple produced by Allen Toussaint Organist Joe Krown who used to play with Gatemouth Brown has a song playing in the background at Janettes restaurant Dr John sings When The Saints Go Marching In shortly after the buskers Annie and Sonny Creighton is listening to the Boswell Sisters a harmony vocal group that originated in New Orleans and sang during the swing era Finally some props are in order for Big Sam Williams the trombonist in the Crescent City Horns segment with Toussaint Hes been in the Dirty Dozen Brass Band and he leads his own group Big Sams Funky NationPJ For jazz boffos this relationship between the Mardi Gras Indian chief Albert Lambreaux and his son Delmond is becoming very telling very quickly Heres a choice bit of dialogueDelmond You dont think I can play straightup New Orleans RB in my sleepAlbert But can you swing Not all you modern jazz cats can you knowDelmond You sound like Wynton MarsalisAlbert I hope soYour thoughtsJJ Nothing more than a chuckle there I do know that Wynton and some of the older musicians in New Orleans wish the younger cats spent more time becoming complete musicians Many of the early players who contributed to jazz history were very welltrained Then again some werent This is a can of worms Id rather use to catch fishPJ After that exchange Delmond starts talking about a gig presumably at Jazz at Lincoln Center where New Orleans native Wynton Marsalis is the artistic directorDelmond Lincoln Center Lotta love for New Orleans right nowAlbert I know Everybody love New Orleans music New Orleans peoplegets upLike the lines above I feel like Treme is juxtaposing practical material rebuilding and spiritual cultural rebirth in a number of ways Albert himself is in the profession of carpentry but hes also a Mardi Gras Indian Then theres that scene where Creighton Bernette complains about Tulane cutting engineering programs and keeping liberal arts nonsense even though hes an English professor writing a novel about the 1927 flood Janettes restaurant elevates New Orleans food to an art but she needs a loan to stay in business Antoine the trombonist and Davis the exDJ are both told to get real jobs rather than uh contract labor in the music industry lets call itWhat do you think the message is behind all that It seems like the show is making a very complicated argument for the role of cultureJJ Culture is a messy thing Life is a messy thing Life and culture in New Orleans postKatrina was super completely and totally the messiest Yet these characters find a way to move forward Could be were simply talking about the power of the individual spirit that Coco Robicheaux was singing about in the openingSometimes I walk all by myselfDont wanna talk to no one elseClose my eyes and I feel my spirit riseSometimes Im down and it comes to meLifts me up gets me feelin freeIt takes me by my handTill I finally understandRelated At NPR Music Five New Orleans Brass Band Jams including the Treme Brass

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123075821&ft=3&f=,Justice John Paul Stevens who announced Friday that he will step down from the Supreme Court when the justices break for the summer started out his time on the nations mightiest bench as something of a maverick But during his 34 years of service which ranks him among the longestserving justices in US history Stevens became a brilliant tactician forging unexpected majorities that established new legal rules on issues ranging from the death penalty to national security  Appointed to the court by President Gerald Ford he became the leader of the courts liberal wing when the courts composition changed and moved increasingly to the right  Today with the court split 54 on many issues Stevens  who is the current courts oldest member  is most often in the minority so the nomination of another liberal in his place would not change the ideological makeup of the court  An Accident Of History Often called a judges judge Stevens was something of a throwback to a less rancorous era when as one writer put it law and politics were a noble pursuit not a blood sport  The quintessential Midwesterner Stevens was born in Chicago and educated at Northwestern and the University of Chicago In the Windy City he earned a reputation as a brilliant lawyer and later appeals court judge  In 1975 Ford appointed him to the US Supreme Court The nomination drew instant praise from Democrats and Republicans alike and Stevens was confirmed in a remarkable three weeks Given Stevens lack of political ties his rise was to some extent a fluke according to his onetime law clerk Clifford Sloan  It was an accident of history Sloan says The stars lined up in a way that could not have been possible before that precise moment and probably could not have been possible after that precise moment A brand new president Gerald Ford suddenly had a Supreme Court vacancy to fill and with the country still reeling from the Watergate scandal the name of the game was to pick someone of unassailable credentials and no political connections Ford assigned his attorney general Edward Levi a man also picked for his lack of political ties to do the screening And Levi the onetime dean of the University of Chicago Law School quickly fixed his eye on Stevens a lifelong Republican with no record of political or judicial activism  Once on the court Stevens quickly earned a reputation for quality work and for independence Unlike other justices he even declined to attend State of the Union addresses In his first decade he was seen as a centerright justice but as the composition of the court grew more and more conservative he found himself referred to as the courts most liberal member a moniker he has never liked according to fellow Chicagoan Abner Mikva who served 15 years as a federal judge himself It bothers him a great deal whenever he hears himself portrayed as a liberal Mikva says When were together he looks at me playfully and says Now Ab you know Im not a liberal And I do No Person Is Above The Law Over the years Stevens authored some 400 majority opinions for the court on almost every issue imaginable from property rights to immigration from abortion to the death penalty from school prayer to campaign finance from term limits to the relationship between the federal and state governments   As former Solicitor General Ted Olson put it the crafty and genial hand of Justice Stevens was everywhere evident The decisions Stevens is likely to be remembered for most though are those he authored on national security and presidential power Stevens wrote the courts 53 decision repudiating President Bushs assertion of unilateral executive power in setting up war crimes tribunals at Guantanamo Bay Cuba   And in 2004 he authorized the courts 63 decision allowing the Guantanamo detainees to challenge their detentions in the US courts Both had profound implications for the limits of presidential power   Bush was not the first president to feel Stevens sting  Stevens also wrote the opinion for a unanimous court in Clinton v Jones the decision refusing to postpone Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton  In summarizing the decision from the bench in 1997 Stevens dismissed the notion that the suit would burden the presidency In the entire history of the republic he said only three sitting presidents have been subjected to suits for their private actions  And as for Clintons case theres nothing in the record to identify any potential harm that might ensue from scheduling the trial promptly  As a former Stevens law clerk put it the justice just thought if the president had time to play golf he had time to defend a lawsuit Critics thought Stevens view naive  the view of a man who knew nothing of the venality of politics or political enemies And indeed as it turned out the Paula Jones case led directly to Clintons impeachment But defenders of the decision see it as an example of the highest value in the American legal system  that no person is above the law Frequent Dissenter Stevens authored some of the courts most complex and important decisions often bringing together under one legal tent justices one might not expect to agree But he also dissented from the courts rulings more frequently than any other justice  When the court struck down a Texas law that punished burning the American flag Stevens the Navy veteran and winner of the Bronze Star objected A countrys flag is a symbol of more than nationhood and national unity  Stevens wrote It also signifies the ideas that characterize the society that has chosen that emblem as well as the special history that has animated the growth and power of those ideas When the court revived the doctrine of states rights he dissented  In 1997 he took the unusual step of announcing his dissent from the bench when the court struck down a key section of the Brady gun control law that imposed a short waiting period on gun buyers to allow local law enforcement officials to run a criminal records check  The basic question is whether Congress acting on behalf of the people of the entire nation has the power to require local law enforcement officers to perform certain duties he said  Since the ultimate issue is one of power we have to consider its implications in times of national emergency as well as the ramifications of preventing national action on matters such as the need for mass inoculation to forestall an epidemic or the threat of terrorism  Stevens ultimate revenge came eight years later when he managed to eke out a 54 majority upholding a federal regulatory scheme under which the federal law making marijuana illegal trumped state laws legalizing it for medical purposes Our case law firmly establishes that Congress has the power to regulate purely local activities when necessary to implement a comprehensive national regulatory program he said   Court Maverick This year though Stevens victories were few as the court grew more and more conservative In January when a fivejustice majority struck down a 100yearold ban on corporate spending in candidate elections Stevens blasted the conservative majority in a 90page dissent   The rule announced today that Congress must treat corporations like human speakers in the political realm represents a radical change in the law he said in a dissent from the bench  The courts decision is at war with the views of generations of Americans It was a dissent as angry as the one he wrote in Bush v Gore Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this years presidential election he wrote in 2000 the identity of the loser is clear It is the nations confidence in the judge as impartial guardian of the rule of law Sloan the onetime law clerk sees the Bush v Gore and Clinton v Jones opinions as flip sides of the same coin He has a very deep respect for the crucible of litigation says Sloan And in both cases what he was strongly objecting to was the suggestion that there be some kind of arbitrary shortcut In the Clinton case the shortcut would have been to delay a trial and the court unanimously rejected that In Bush v Gore the shortcut was to remove the case from the Florida state courts where votecount cases are traditionally resolved and Stevens bitterly objected   Not A Go Along Judge Stevens frequent dissents as well as the separate opinions he often filed to note that his views differed from fellow justices earned him a reputation as a maverick   But as he explained recently his insistence on stating his views stemmed directly from his experience as in effect a special prosecutor more than 30 years ago when he was appointed to investigate charges of misconduct against two sitting Illinois Supreme Court justices  What Stevens found was that the court opinion that had been improperly influenced was not as the public record indicated unanimous  Two justices had in fact dissented but in the name of collegiality had not publicly noted their dissents Its because of this incident Stevens said that when he became a justice on the US Supreme Court he did not go along with colleagues in some cases  The fact that a justice disagrees with his colleagues is a matter of sufficient importance that the public is entitled to know Stevens said  The judicial scandal investigation influenced Stevens in other ways The man who made the initial charges against the two state Supreme Court justices was well known in Chicago as a less than reliable gadfly And yet on the cover of Kenneth Manasters book about the probe there is a picture of the gadfly Sherman Skolnick in his wheelchair with Stevens at his side  Stevens is standing with his head bowed listening very carefully to what this fellow who many consider to be a kook has to say Manaster says  And I really love that picture because it says to me that this is a man who wants to hear even a person who by that time was known to have close to zero credibility but you never know And this was an instance in which Skolnick got it right It is for that reason that Stevens refused to join his Supreme Court colleagues in imposing penalties on people who repeatedly file frivolous appeals with the US Supreme Court  because you never know sometime someone might have a legitimate complaint Influencing The Majority In that way and so many others Stevens for decades marched to the tune of his own drummer The question now is what tune his replacement will march to  Whomever the president chooses it is doubtful that he or she will wield the kind of influence that Stevens did At least not for some time During his more than three decades on the court Stevens became increasingly skilled at molding opinion to reach the magic number of five majority justices  One of his leastknown efforts involved the machine that became ubiquitous in American homes the TV video recorder In the early 1980s Hollywood tried to ban the devices and punish both the manufacturer and the home user with fines for copyright infringement A majority of the court initially agreed with the filmmakers but Stevens proposed dissent turned the court around and he ended up writing the courts 54 opinion declaring that VCRs did not violate copyright laws when used in the home to make a single copy for personal use  A decade later Stevens would play a similarly pivotal role in the courts reconsideration of its abortion ruling Roe v Wade  With the court closely divided three justices  Sandra Day OConnor now retired Anthony Kennedy and David Souter also now retired  circulated an opinion upholding what they called the core of Roe but making it easier for states to regulate abortions The opinion split the court into three separate factions four justices to reverse Roe three to uphold its core and two to uphold it entirely Stevens and Justice Harry Blackmun were the two  But upon receiving the draft of the three middleground justices Stevens suggested a reorganization of their opinion so that he and Blackmun could join most of it and there would be a single opinion that was supported by a court majority  OConnor Kennedy and Souter quickly agreed and the opinion became the law of the land  These are just two examples of how Stevens with the power of his intellect and the firm respectful approach he took toward colleagues moved the court in his direction  Putting together such victories became increasingly difficult after OConnors retirement when the court moved dramatically to the right But Stevens continued to score the occasional unexpected win  using his knowledge of the law his powers of persuasion and logic and the wisdom of a man who will turn 90 on

country must be told by their lawyers whether pleading guilty to a crime could lead to deportation  Jose Padilla a native of Honduras and a decorated Vietnam War veteran has lived in the United States legally for 40 years A truck driver he was stopped at a weigh station in Kentucky in 2001 and gave a law enforcement officer permission to search his truck  Stowed among his registered cargo were 23 Styrofoam boxes containing a halfton of marijuana Although he was a legal permanent resident he was held erroneously in prison without bond as an illegal alien He refused to plead guilty until the eve of trial and says he only agreed because his lawyer assured him that his guilty plea and a fiveyear prison sentence would not affect his immigration status The lawyer was wrong The guilty plea triggered a mandatory deportation to take effect after the prison term was served  Padilla upon learning that tried to withdraw the plea contending that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel The Kentucky Supreme Court ruled against him concluding that the constitutional right to counsel does not extend to matters that fall outside the criminal case at hand On Wednesday the US Supreme Court disagreed by a 72 vote Majority Opinion Writing for the court majority Justice John Paul Stevens noted that because Congress over the past two decades has made deportation mandatory for a wide variety of crimes the stakes have been dramatically raised for an immigrant noncitizen pleading guilty Although staying in the United States may be more important than any potential jail sentence he said defendants are often not advised that a guilty plea may result in their deportation In a case like this Stevens added where a simple reading of the statute would have told the lawyer her client would face certain deportation failing to provide that information denies the defendant the effective assistance of counsel It is our responsibility said the court to ensure that no criminal defendant is left to the mercies of incompetent counsel and we now hold that counsel must inform her client whether a plea carries the risk of deportation The courts decision sent the Padilla case back to the Kentucky courts for further action Although the justices said they did not believe their decision would result in opening the floodgates for reconsideration of previous guilty pleas immigrantrights advocates clearly saw an opening They said the ruling could affect tens of thousands of both old and new cases I think historic is not an understatement said Benita Jain codirector of the New Yorkbased Immigrants Rights Project Decision Welcomed This is really a watershed decision in the immigration rights area said Stephen Kinnaird who represented Padilla in the Supreme Court Kinnaird noted that with nearly 13 million foreigners living legally in the United States some of whom came here as toddlers it is axiomatic that tens of thousands will have some sort of runin with the law each year And just as US citizens who face similar charges do most agree to plead guilty in exchange for a lighter sentence or no jail time at all That is where the similarity ends said Kinnaird For immigrants when it turns out that the crime results in automatic deportation theyre shocked by it because they had no idea The examples of such cases are legion from the woman who stole a bottle of medicine for her sick child to the Georgia business owner with no criminal record pulled over by police one night and charged with a drug violation after a dollar bill in his pocket was found to have trace amounts of cocaine His guilty plea in exchange for no jail time and a promise to expunge his record did not protect him from deportation proceedings Immigrantrights advocates say that the more minor the crime and the lighter the sentence the greater the shock at the nearcertain deportation that may follow Jain of the Immigrants Rights Project notes that deportation for an immigrant whos been here since childhood can mean being deported to a country where the individual has no family left where he or she may not speak the language and may not know how to get a job a house or even order a meal And for some immigrants granted asylum here deportation may return them to a country where they risk persecution Lawyers Obligation For the most part the Supreme Courts ruling will only help legal residents in the US But for those here illegally there are situations in which a pending application for legal status could be jeopardized by a guilty plea Whatever the situation the Supreme Court has now declared that lawyers cannot remain silent on the effect a guilty plea may have on a defendants immigration status In clear cases a lawyer must advise his or her client that the guilty plea triggers automatic deportation In less clear cases the lawyer must still advise that an immigrants status could be in jeopardy Dissenting from Wednesdays ruling were Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas  Said Scalia In the best of all possible worlds criminal defendants contemplating a guilty plea ought to be advised of all serious collateral consequences of conviction and surely ought not to be misadvised The Constitution however is not an allpurpose tool for judicial construction of a perfect world Copyright 2014 NPR,20100401,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124731385&ft=3&f=,Thousands of Mexican troops and hundreds of millions of dollars in US aid have failed to stem the drug wars plaguing Mexicos northern border region Now the killing of Americans last weekend in Ciudad Juarez is likely to escalate the conflict and Washingtons already substantial involvement in the fight analysts say Americans are being targeted which was not the case before That makes it more possible for the Obama administration to get the support to provide more resources says Mauricio Cardenas director of the Latin American initiative at the Brookings Institution Almost 18000 people have been killed across Mexico since President Felipe Calderon launched the military offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006  According to the government most of those dead are rival smugglers But the Security Commission of the Mexican Senate also reports that the dead include at least 620 women 1500 police officers and 87 soldiers Last weekend there were some 50 victims of drug gangrelated violence in Mexico  including an American consular employee and her husband gunned down in their car Their baby was found unharmed in the back seat of the car  Analysts say the deaths of the Americans may put more pressure on the Obama administration to act The tragedy of this weekend just underscores how severe and significant a danger this represents to Mexico to the United States to the hemisphere State Department spokesman PJ Crowley told reporters on Monday In 2007 the Bush administration and its Mexican counterpart signed the Merida Initiative a threeyear 15 billion plan to fight the narcotics trade While the money has been appropriated the spending of it is still in the works  So far US assistance has come in the form of bigticket items like helicopters and speedboats They arrived only late last year though The lag time is substantial because a lot of the equipment is custom built  And the enemy is formidable says Crowley Youre talking about violence fueled by drug use that produces vast sums of money that produces significant capabilities that could rival  the strength of any army US Drug Enforcement Administration officials and the FBI are already helping elite Mexican forces in intelligence gathering collecting evidence for trials and providing training on how to lead investigations that will eventually stand up in court  But Mexican officials say the US must do more to help in the battle against the drug cartels For years Mexican leaders have urged the US to stop the flow of guns south across the border The US Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms reported last year that more than 7700 guns sold in America were traced to Mexico  But experts believe that is just a small fraction of the total More than 2000 guns  from 9 mm handguns to automatic assault rifles  are trafficked from US border states to Mexico every day according research by the Brookings Institution  During the State Department briefing Crowley said there were things the US could do to help in terms of money guns to try to diminish and ultimately defeat these cartels but he didnt say whether authorities would step up security at border crossings While US financial aid is impressive it is a trickle compared with the massive assistance Washington gave Colombia  about 700 million a year for five years    to help fight its drug war Cardenas says About 90 percent of the cocaine and much of the marijuana that enters the US comes through Mexico That is another reason the US government needs to be more involved in Mexicos fight says Shannon ONeil a fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations Our security is intricately tied with Mexicos security and so we should be investing in our relationship with Mexico Its in our own self interest to do so she says O Neil says the US aid to Mexico should focus on strengthening law enforcement institutions cleaning up the court system and providing telephone hot lines and other ways for citizens to get involved  Mexicos police force has long been corrupt and its courts lacking transparency  But that is now changing ONeil says with background checks for police officers and police recruits and reforms in the legal system They do a background check on police recruits to make sure you dont have a lot of money and then they do periodic lie detector tests once youre in since so many are approached years into the job by drug cartels looking to bribe them ONeil says The court system is also changing with an increase in public trials with oral presentations rather than the traditional Mexican system of having a judge review written arguments and make a ruling from his chambers ONeil says that should make the whole system much more open and transparent and make people witness to the judicial system But all of this will take time The fundamental problems that Mexico has are issues of institutional effectiveness and capacity  weeding out corruption ONeil says None of those issues are things that can be solved overnight no matter how much money you throw at them Copyright 2014

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124687663&ft=3&f=,Ever since Barack Obama lifted his right hand and took his oath of office pledging to serve the United States as its fortyfourth president ordinary people and their leaders around the globe have been celebrating our nations triumph over race Obamas election has been touted as the final nail in the coffin of Jim Crow the bookend placed on the history of racial caste in America  Obamas mere presence in the Oval Office is offered as proof that the land of the free has finally made good on its promise of equality Theres an implicit yet undeniable message embedded in his appearance on the world stage this is what freedom looks like this is what democracy can do for you If you are poor marginalized or relegated to an inferior caste there is hope for you Trust us Trust our rules laws customs and wars You too can get to the promised land  Perhaps greater lies have been told in the past century but they can be counted on one hand Racial caste is alive and well in America  Most people dont like it when I say this It makes them angry In the era of colorblindness theres a nearly fanatical desire to cling to the myth that we as a nation have moved beyond race Here are a few facts that run counter to that triumphant racial narrative   There are more AfricanAmericans under correctional control today  in prison or jail on probation or parole  than were enslaved in 1850 a decade before the Civil War began   As of 2004 more AfricanAmerican men were disenfranchised due to felon disenfranchisement laws than in 1870 the year the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified prohibiting laws that explicitly deny the right to vote on the basis of race   A black child born today is less likely to be raised by both parents than a black child born during slavery The recent disintegration of the AfricanAmerican family is due in large part to the mass imprisonment of black fathers   If you take into account prisoners a large majority of AfricanAmerican men in some urban areas have been labeled felons for life In the Chicago area the figure is nearly 80 percent These men are part of a growing undercaste  not class caste  permanently relegated by law to a secondclass status They can be denied the right to vote automatically excluded from juries and legally discriminated against in employment housing access to education and public benefits much as their grandparents and greatgrandparents were during the Jim Crow era  Excuses for the Lockdown  There is of course a colorblind explanation for all this crime rates Our prison population has exploded from about 300000 to more than 2 million in a few short decades it is said because of rampant crime Were told that the reason so many black and brown men find themselves behind bars and ushered into a permanent secondclass status is because they happen to be the bad guys  The uncomfortable truth however is that crime rates do not explain the sudden and dramatic mass incarceration of AfricanAmericans during the past thirty years Crime rates have fluctuated over the last few decades  they are currently at historical lows but imprisonment rates have consistently soared Quintupled in fact And the vast majority of that increase is due to the War on Drugs Drug offenses alone account for about twothirds of the increase in the federal inmate population and more than half of the increase in the state prison population  The drug war has been brutal  complete with SWAT teams tanks bazookas grenade launchers and sweeps of entire neighborhoods  but those who live in white communities have little clue to the devastation wrought This war has been waged almost exclusively in poor communities of color even though studies consistently show that people of all colors use and sell illegal drugs at remarkably similar rates In fact some studies indicate that white youth are significantly more likely to engage in illegal drug dealing than black youth Any notion that drug use among AfricanAmericans is more severe or dangerous is belied by the data White youth for example have about three times the number of drugrelated visits to the emergency room as their AfricanAmerican counterparts  That is not what you would guess though when entering our nations prisons and jails overflowing as they are with black and brown drug offenders In some states AfricanAmericans comprise 80 percent90 percent of all drug offenders sent to prison  This is the point at which I am typically interrupted and reminded that black men have higher rates of violent crime Thats why the drug war is waged in poor communities of color and not middleclass suburbs Drug warriors are trying to get rid of those drug kingpins and violent offenders who make ghetto communities a living hell It has nothing to do with race its all about violent crime  Again not so President Ronald Reagan officially declared the current drug war in 1982 when drug crime was declining not rising From the outset the war had little to do with drug crime and nearly everything to do with racial politics The drug war was part of a grand and highly successful Republican Party strategy of using racially coded political appeals on issues of crime and welfare to attract poor and working class white voters who were resentful of and threatened by desegregation busing and affirmative action In the words of HR Haldeman President Richard Nixons White House chief of staff The whole problem is really the blacks The key is to devise a system that recognizes this while not appearing to  A few years after the drug war was announced crack cocaine hit the streets of innercity communities The Reagan administration seized on this development with glee hiring staff who were to be responsible for publicizing innercity crack babies crack mothers crack whores and drugrelated violence The goal was to make innercity crack abuse and violence a media sensation bolstering public support for the drug war which it was hoped would lead Congress to devote millions of dollars in additional funding to it  The plan worked like a charm For more than a decade black drug dealers and users would be regulars in newspaper stories and would saturate the evening TV news Congress and state legislatures nationwide would devote billions of dollars to the drug war and pass harsh mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes  sentences longer than murderers receive in many countries  Democrats began competing with Republicans to prove that they could be even tougher on the darkskinned pariahs In President Bill Clintons boastful words I can be nicked a lot but no one can say Im soft on crime The facts bear him out Clintons tough on crime policies resulted in the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history But Clinton was not satisfied with exploding prison populations He and the New Democrats championed legislation banning drug felons from public housing no matter how minor the offense and denying them basic public benefits including food stamps for life Discrimination in virtually every aspect of political economic and social life is now perfectly legal if youve been labeled a felon  Facing Facts  But what about all those violent criminals and drug kingpins Isnt the drug war waged in ghetto communities because thats where the violent offenders can be found The answer is yes in madeforTV movies In real life the answer is no  The drug war has never been focused on rooting out drug kingpins or violent offenders Federal funding flows to those agencies that increase dramatically the volume of drug arrests not the agencies most successful in bringing down the bosses What gets rewarded in this war is sheer numbers of drug arrests To make matters worse federal drug forfeiture laws allow state and local law enforcement agencies to keep for their own use 80 percent of the cash cars and homes seized from drug suspects thus granting law enforcement a direct monetary interest in the profitability of the drug market  The results have been predictable people of color rounded up en masse for relatively minor nonviolent drug offenses In 2005 four out of five drug arrests were for possession only one out of five for sales Most people in state prison have no history of violence or even of significant selling activity In fact during the 1990sthe period of the most dramatic expansion of the drug warnearly 80 percent of the increase in drug arrests was for marijuana possession a drug generally considered less harmful than alcohol or tobacco and at least as prevalent in middleclass white communities as in the inner city  In this way a new racial undercaste has been created in an astonishingly short period of time  a new Jim Crow system Millions of people of color are now saddled with criminal records and legally denied the very rights that their parents and grandparents fought for and in some cases died for  Affirmative action though has put a happy face on this racial reality Seeing black people graduate from Harvard and Yale and become CEOs or corporate lawyers  not to mention president of the United States  causes us all to marvel at what a long way weve come  Recent data shows though that much of black progress is a myth In many respects AfricanAmericans are doing no better than they were when Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated and uprisings swept inner cities across America Nearly a quarter of AfricanAmericans live below the poverty line today approximately the same percentage as in 1968 The black child poverty rate is actually higher now than it was then Unemployment rates in black communities rival those in Third World countries And thats with affirmative action  When we pull back the curtain and take a look at what our colorblind society creates without affirmative action we see a familiar social political and economic structurethe structure of racial caste The entrance into this new caste system can be found at the prison gate  This is not Martin Luther King Jrs dream This is not the promised land The cyclical rebirth of caste in America is a recurring racial nightmare Copyright 2014 The Nation,20100315,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2010/03/the_shusher_and_the_shushed_wh.html?ft=3&f=,I very rarely shush at the movies I hate the confrontation I hate the sense that Im intruding and I hate the feeling of being a hated killjoyNevertheless I shushed twice this weekend Well not shushed exactly  I find shushing moderately passiveaggressive and often inefficient But twice this weekend I asked people to shut up and stop talkingThe first time was at a Friday afternoon showing of Crazy Heart There was a group of women there who were loud in the lobby loud in the restroom and then to my eyerolling dismay they walked into the same theater I was in Gales of laughter at nothing preposterously loud carryingon in a way that simply serves to broadcast that youre having a better time than anyone else  its nothing particularly malicious but it didnt seem like a good sign I suspected they might have been drinking  a sort of Girls Night Out on a Friday afternoon  but I reserve judgment because I honestly dont know whether they were  whatever just high on life Nevertheless trying to be optimistic as I sat there I thought Surely they will stop when the movie actually startsWe sat through the previews they were still at it Loudly carrying on like they were in their own living room Okay some people dont apply the rules of etiquette to the previews thats a gray area I waited But when the movie started  the actual movie  and they were still at it I leaned down the row Naturally they had chosen to sit a few seats down from me thats how these things go so I leaned over and said Okay the movies starting soYou would think from the look that was shot at me that I had leaned over and said I just stole your purse so Or possibly Women really shouldnt wear pants in public so For some reason the shushed often believe they can shame the shusher which I suppose plays on those same feelings I talked about at the beginning  you are a killjoy you nerd  but honestly once Im at the point where you need shushing Im not susceptible to shaming Because Im not shushing unless youre being so rude that I cannot take it and I am not a stickler There was an older couple talking beside me during A Single Man when I saw that later the same day but they were at least making an effort to talk quietly so they were spared shushingThe second time was at the Best Picture Showcase on Saturday where a young woman and her friends sat down in front of me They fancied themselves the Greek chorus of the room and wanted all their punch lines heard by everyone Everyone tolerated it pretty patiently  they were clearly popculture enthusiasts talking between movies about Battlestar Galactica their rooms for I believe ComicCon and the shirt Wil Wheaton wore on The Guild They were trying to have fun They were having an event making a day of it But heres where it went wrongOh so wrong After the jumpIn A Serious Man  and I think I can do this without spoiling too much  there is a moment when a character is faced with a highpressure situation and finds that he freezes because hes been enjoying some marijuana and is addled He stops The tension builds Its not clear that he has any way out Its not clear what will happen if he doesnt pull it together Its comedic tension but its tension nevertheless The screw is being turned on the character and on the audienceSuddenly Battlestar Wheaton Shirt yells out Dont do drugs kidsReallyI know exactly how she feels She feels as you might when in a large group of people at a latenight showing of Fighting or Step Up 2 The Streets or something else very frivolous where the entire crowd is yelling at the screen because its that kind of show There are shows where you can do that There are shows you cant ruinBut this was not that kind of show This was an audience of people who had chosen to spend all day watching Best Picture nominees Nobody else was talking Nobody in the entire theater was providing commentary with the exception of Battlestar Wheaton ShirtIt ruined the entire sequence utterly When this happens all of a sudden the string of tension that has been tightening and tightening just goes slack because youre reminded of your surroundings  the theater the people around you the double reality of physical you in the theater and invisible you eavesdropping on the scene Now distractions happen off and on You shift in your seat the person beside you coughs you cant stay in suspended animation all day in a sensory deprivation tank except for whats on the screenBut those things are not demands for attention Dont do drugs kids in that setting is a demand for attention She is asking you to stop thinking about the movie you are watching and pause to congratulate her on the wit of of all things Dont do drugs kids Putting aside the fact that this as a sarcastic joke is older than Carl in Up it breaks the contract with everyone else in the theaterDont act like you dont know the contract There are rules You dont get mad at kids making kidnoises in the middle of The Princess And The Frog but you do in the middle of Inglourious Basterds Everybodys got expectations and in some movies in some theaters in some moments youre not going to bother anybody by pulling focus from the movie because youre at a crowdparticipation movieBut you must must must know your moments and if you dont then you cant go to the moviesIf Im remembering the sequence correctly I still didnt say anything to her after Dont do drugs kids I believe it wasnt until she started talking during The Hurt Locker  yes chatting to one of her friends during one of the painful agonizing nerveknotting silences in The Hurt Locker  that I leaned down and said Could you not talk She didnt stop immediately so I cant remember which was the time I finally asked her to be quietHeres the thing If Im at the movies Im not there to think about you You are there to think about you apparently and the difference in our level of absorption in the film is a little like the difference between deep sleep and light sleep  by the time you talk youve already pulled away from the movie youre prepared to hear yourself talk only your light sleep is disturbed But for me you talk out of nowhere you yank on my attention like youve suddenly got a fishhook in my mouth And once you do it I know you might do it again and in reality I can never get back into that deep sleep again You know when youre about to talk I dontI dont want to be a bad sport Ive talked back to the screen at Honey Youre not a bad person for wanting to goof around with your friends But please seriously choose your moments Because when you pick the wrong one you take something away from everybody else in the room This isnt a stodgy etiquette rule run amok its got a purpose And if youre there to sit through Best Picture nominees and Best Actor nominees take a moment and think about what that purpose isAnd if youre headed to Crazy Heart on a Friday afternoon with your girlfriends Drink water with lunch Copyright 2014 NPR,20100308,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123964512&ft=3&f=,Whats worse declaring war against a social problem or calling for a Marshall Plan to solve it Both are enduring and popular metaphors Unfortunately both lead to bad government decisions Public policies shaped by such thinking more often than not result in waste blind spots and Manichaean mindsets that limit the search for more effective approaches Think of the longrunning wars on drugs terrorism and cancer The results all too predictably have been more confusing than the problems  In fact no imitation of the Marshall Plan has ever worked and no war on a big social problem has ever ended in defeat for the enemy save perhaps cigarettes But the allure of these spurious comparisons remains as strong as ever Without any apparent effect Marshall Plans have been proposed to help Africa the Middle East New Orleans Iraq and even Wallonia Belgiums least prosperous region Bill Gates wants a Marshall Plan to broaden access to technology French President Nicolas Sarkozy urges one for his countrys poor suburbs and the AFLCIO thinks the US auto industry deserves its own Marshall Plan  Advocates of war against big problems are just as plentiful We have been asked to go to war against poverty drunk driving email spam and teen pregnancy just to name a few In the United States liberals denounce the Bushera war on science while conservatives each year mobilize against the war on Christmas And of course theres the favorite war of the global chattering class  the war against global warming This is World War III Barbara Young then head of Britains Environment Agency declared in 2007 This is the biggest challenge to face the globe for many many years We need the sorts of concerted fast integrated and above all huge efforts that went into many actions in times of war  There are many good reasons why declaring war on a social problem or launching a Marshall Plan to help a country or region are such attractive metaphors for politicians Wars unite countries and stifle internal dissent Wag the Dog is not just the title of a movie in which a war is manufactured to rally support for a government but also an ageold political tactic The war metaphor is also attractive because real wars  those between nationstates as opposed to those against concepts or bad socioeconomic trends  are finite University of Notre Dame scholar Daniel Lindley has found that the average length of a war is 308 days when the country that starts it wins and 660 days when initiators lose No surprise then that the war metaphor keeps getting deployed It boosts expectations that in a few years a major scourge  cancer terrorism poverty  will be eliminated War also holds the seductive promise of an open checkbook for the politicians who so liberally apply the term after all budgetary constraints tend to disappear during war along with all those pesky rules Wars are for heroes not for accountants who limit the resources needed for victory  The Marshall Plan metaphor has been similarly irresistible with its implications of massive funding and unquestioning public support But the original Marshall Plan launched by the United States to help Europe after World War II was neither as financially sizable nor as uncontroversial as proponents commonly assume Economist Tyler Cowen estimated US aid which peaked at around 90 billion in todays dollars was no more than 5 percent of the gross national product of the recipient nations Still the plan has come to epitomize a bold massive  and successful  governmental mobilization  Alas these good metaphors yield bad policies The war on drugs for example has been more successful in spawning immense bureaucracies and winning big budgets and partisan political fights than in ending drug use Decriminalizing marijuana for medical purposes is becoming a popular reform in the United States and 14 states have already adopted it with more sure to follow But do we know if marijuana does indeed have the medical benefits claimed by reformers No As a result of the mindset  and the policies  nurtured by the war on drugs medical researchers have been blocked from access to marijuana and unable to scientifically test the claims Only now after four painful and futile decades is the war on drugs losing support  The same perils apply to the war on terror As former US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski famously noted The damage these three words have done  a classic selfinflicted wound  is infinitely greater than any wild dreams entertained by the fanatical perpetrators of the 911 attacks when they were plotting against us in distant Afghan caves The phrase itself is meaningless It defines neither a geographic context nor our presumed enemies Terrorism is not an enemy but a technique of warfare Indeed the war on terror was even more spectacularly successful than the war on drugs in securing political legal military and financial blank checks for those waging it But that too is changing as antiterrorism efforts are now more carefully scrutinized checks are written with more strings attached and alternative approaches are tested Recognizing that language is power US President Barack Obama took a key first step in banning the bad metaphor At his insistence the Pentagon was forced to lose its precious GWOT global war on terror acronym and the GWOT mentality that went with it But as many of his predecessors learned Obama is finding that wars are hard to exit Once a war against poverty crime or terrorism is launched announcing a unilateral truce is usually political suicide Instead presidents get boxed into absolutist policies in which compromise is impossible and victory is the only acceptable outcome  But no matter the complications these wars arent going away  theyre just too politically convenient It took only a few hours after Haitis terrible Jan 12 earthquake for pundits to call for a Marshall Plan One thing by now is certain however Although aid will materialize a Marshall Plan will not As we all know but the metaphor users routinely and conveniently ignore the Marshall Plans success was driven by the hardtoreplicate conditions in Europe after World War II with its highly educated populations welldeveloped private sector and relatively efficient public bureaucracies  So Beware the metaphor All these wars and Marshall Plans are getting the world nowhere But their frequent use does have a silver lining At least youll know that whenever they are proposed bad policies will soon follow

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123385312&ft=3&f=,Confidential informants  people who pose as criminals so they can provide information to the police or some government agency  have helped crack some major US casesThey are part of the shadowy side of law enforcement and operate in a secret and largely unregulated world And sometimes things go terribly wrong I Was Doing Something GoodA decade ago at 2 am a Mexican drug runner walked over the international bridge that links El Paso Texas with Ciudad Juarez Mexico and asked to speak with a US agent Raul Bencomo then an agent with US Customs assigned code No 913 to the runner Guillermo Eduardo Ramirez Peyro who went by the nickname Lalo Bencomo says Lalo was different from other informants He was well dressed and always respectful  and anxious to talk about the Mexican drug lords he worked for He had a lot of information and the type of information that he started providing was at a high level Bencomo says  Lalos information was on the mark He tipped Bencomo to a corrupt US immigration agent who was taking bribes from drug gangs He also helped crack a major international cigarette smuggling ring  He kept us so busy  we were so behind on reports that we told him to go take a vacation just to let us catch up on reports Bencomo says Lalo wasnt looking to make a deal And he didnt need the money  he was already making plenty in Juarezs drug trade But he had his reasons for informing on the drug gang  I was doing something good something positive Lalo said to an attorney during an interview that was videotaped four years ago During several phone conversations with NPR last fall Lalo insisted on speaking only Spanish But in either language his story is the same I believe in some kind of justice and I think I was doing something good he said On the tape Lalo looks more like a victim than a drug thug Hes cleancut and clearly educatedI really was doing something good he said The ICE Target Heriberto SantillanThe feds paid Lalo well nearly 250000 over four years His handlers did well too  The El Paso Customs office Customs later became Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE had never gotten much recognition Now with Lalo on board agents set their sights on a Juarez kingpin known as the Engineer Heriberto Santillan Tabares  Bencomo says the agents were told that Santillan was the No 3 man in the Juarez cartelBut as that investigation started ICEs prized snitch came under suspicion At a Border Patrol checkpoint Lalo got caught smuggling more than 100 pounds of marijuana stuffed into the wheels of his pickup The Drug Enforcement Administration blacklisted him ICE kept Lalo on its payroll and even worked with a federal prosecutor to get his drug charges dropped In hindsight Bencomo says the pot in the pickup should have been a warning sign    That was the first incident that I ever came across that he was working both sides Bencomo saysDrug smuggling turned out to be the least of Lalos exploits He was climbing the ranks of the drug cartel and was becoming a trusted ally to Juarezs third in command   Killings Caught On Tape In the fall of 2003 Santillan and a band of crooked Mexican police officers went on an eightmonth crime spree  killing kidnapping and torturing drug rivals in Juarez And Lalo was with themAccording to documents obtained by NPR Lalo kept his ICE handlers informed of the murders piling up in Juarez  In fact Lalo secretly recorded the first murder  and admitted that he held the victims legs while the man was being brutally strangled suffocated and beaten with a shovel Former agent Bencomo remembers listening to the tape It just made me sick he says I had to go to the restroom and throw up I took the recording and I told my supervisor that I didnt wish to be part of the caseBut Bencomo stayed on and so did Lalo Bencomo says his supervisors told him just to make sure Lalo didnt participate in any more killings  Today Lalo insists he never killed anyone though court documents show he admitted being present during several murders he even acknowledged driving two victims to a Juarez house where he knew theyd be killed Lalo said his actions were necessary to maintain his cover When you infiltrate a cartel everyone knows you have to go like what  like a criminal he said And you have to act like a criminalEvery Federal Rule Was BrokenBut former DEA Special Agent Phil Jordan says in Lalos case every federal rule and regulation was broken Even if the man was John Gotti in his prime you do not allow an informant to run the investigation you do not let the informant commit felonies to commit murder he says In my mind he was given a license to killJordan says on top of all that ICE knew who was doing the killing and where the bodies were buried but didnt share any of that information with Mexican authorities Jordan was an expert witness in a civil suit filed against ICE by relatives of people killed by the Mexican drug cartel Among the victims were two US residents Attorney Raul Loya who represented them said the federal agents handling Lalo were a joke Are you kidding me These guys are El Pasos version of the Keystone Kops Loya says They are poorly trained they have limited education which is fine but they had no business being involved in a crossborder covert operation involving drugs and murderThe killings in Juarez took place more than six years ago Until now ICE has always refused to talk on the record about what happened there and why Lalo was kept on the US governments payroll while he was involved in torture and murder In an interview with NPR Kumar Kibble a top ICE official and a former director of criminal investigations for the agency says I want to emphasize that our primary obligation is to protect life and limb He says that the agencys guidelines for using confidential informants are sound But in Lalos case he says rogue agents didnt properly follow them Had management been fully informed we could have implemented strategies and taken a different tack that would have ultimately safeguarded more lives he says This is not an appropriate case to comment on because the procedures that we implemented werent followedThe House Of DeathBut those familiar with the case wonder how ICE could not have known about Lalos exploits in Mexico  the majority of which took place at a house in a middleclass neighborhood in Juarez  It has been dubbed the House of Death Today no one goes to the metal gate at the house where cartel murderers brought their victims and ultimately buried them in the tiny backyard NPR went there with veteran Juarez crime reporter Carlos Huerta He says Lalo was the keeper of the keys There were these code words that the bosses would say to Lalo Huerta says He would say Were going to have a barbecue That meant Lalo was to go and get the house ready because someone was going to be brought there and be killedAccording to a document obtained by NPR Lalo admitted to Mexican authorities in Dallas that on his way to the house he stopped at a local hardware store and bought duct tape and quicklime  essential items for binding murder victims and dissolving their remains Eventually US officials told Mexican authorities about the bodies buried at the House of Death Lorenza Magana who works with victims of violence in Juarez sat vigil with relatives of missing family members outside the house the night that Mexican authorities began unearthing the remains We stayed there all night and watched as they pulled out bodies Magana says It was so horrible With every new body the smell would hit us  it was horrible We came back night after night to see how many they dug up  In all there were 12 victims Magana says she couldnt believe it when she found out that Lalo the gatekeeper of the death house was a US government informant It hit me like cold water in the face it just feels terrible Here in Mexico there is no justice only impunity Magana says So where are we going to find any help if we cant trust the USBut it wasnt just the people of Juarez who were outraged When the El Paso DEA office got wind of what was happening the agent in charge was stunned I was shocked I couldnt believe it says the DEAs Sandalio Gonzalez He got involved after two DEA operatives in Mexico were targeted by the Juarez drug gang that Lalo worked for Gonzalez says when he tried to question the informant ICE circled its wagons around LaloWe have threats against the lives of DEA agents we have dead bodies and you dont want to let us talk to this guy he says What is wrong with this pictureThis Is An Isolated IncidentGonzalez lodged a complaint against ICE He also tried to get Congress to investigate but that went nowhereICEs Kumar Kibble insists that his agency has already thoroughly investigated the matter We have thousands of informants that are active that we are managing on a daily basis he says This is an isolated incident where in fact the person was held accountable when they didnt follow our proceduresICE says the fault lies with former agent Bencomo Lalos handler Specifically ICE officials say Bencomo was terminated because he didnt tell supervisors that Lalo was still involved with murder and torture in Juarez Bencomo was the only one fired as a result of the Lalo fiasco Two ICE employees were forced to take early retirement but others received light reprimands and are still on the job This is the first time that Bencomo has talked publicly He views himself as a scapegoat and says his bosses at ICE and their bosses in Washington knew all along what Lalo was doing He would report a murder and either we heard it on a phone nobody told us to stop doing the case Bencomo says We were told to continue so for them to say that they didnt know about it that is a total lieIm Just Fighting For My LifeWhether or not the top brass knew about all of Lalos exploits there is no denying they used him to nab a Juarez drug lord and lock him away Once the case was done ICE was also done with Lalo The agency began deportation proceedings with the intention of sending him back to Mexico      Lalo has been in solitary confinement for more than five years Hes in jail not for any of the crimes he allegedly committed in Mexico but because ICE says he no longer has a legal right to be in the US  Right now Im just fighting for my life Lalo said For now he said jail is better than the fate he faces in MexicoI dont know if they are going to keep me here for the rest of my life he said Right now Im just trying to say Dont put me in the hands of the people who are going to try and kill me Thats all Im doing right nowICE says it learned some lessons dealing with Lalo NPR obtained an internal agency memo written in May 2004 that clearly prohibits using informants who commit crimes The memo stated that those rules would be part of a new policy handbook But during our interview ICE said that handbook still isnt finished This story was produced for broadcast by Marisa Penaloza Copyright 2014 NPR,20100225,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121056866&ft=3&f=,Note The footnotes from this excerpt have been removed Prologue On a raised dais at Washingtons luxurious Mayflower Hotel the Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia is in high performance mode His comic timing is precise Laughter and applause ripple on cue from the five hundred lawyers packed into the ballroom Gone in an eyeblink is most of his scheduled hour The moderator announces that there will be one final question Make it easy Scalia jokes standing at the lectern in especially fine spirits on this blustery November afternoon You can make it like Senator Strom Thurmonds first question to me when I was up for my confirmation The South Carolina Republican had presided over the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings for Scalia in 1986 when he was nominated by President Reagan for elevation from a federal appeals court Thurmond had opened with a question that played right into Scalias view that judges were wrongly going beyond the letter of the law to solve societys larger problems whether they related to school busing prison crowding or environmental catastrophes These were conflicts Scalia believed should be left in the domain of elected lawmakers  Now Judge Scalia  Scalia says mimicking the slow patois of Senator Thurmond  what do you think of judicial activism  Scalia turns sideways at the lectern and puts his hands together as if at the plate and ready to swing a baseball bat The sleeves of his dark suit yank up flashing his thick white shirt cuffs Im ready for that pitch he says The Scalia illuminated by camera lights at this closing session of the 2008 annual conference of the Federalist Society is heavier than the man America first saw at the witness table in 1986 on nationwide television His jowls are thicker his waist wider His dark black hair has thinned Yet his eyes are lit as always Into his seventies Scalia still exudes energy and passion His gestures are operatic He points his fingers and waves his arms for emphasis His audiences at these public occasions irrespective of whether they are conservative or liberal continue to be large and are nearly always captivated When Scalia enters a room cameras still flash This afternoon at the conservative legal societys convention his audience is standing room only and hanging on his every word and gesture With his biting humor Scalia has been advancing the legal theory known as originalism  insisting that judges should render constitutional decisions based on the eighteenthcentury understanding of the text Its a fight worth making he says in remarks that are part battle cry part assertion of victory I used to be able to say with a good deal of truth that you could fire a cannon loaded with grapeshot into the faculty lounge of any law school in the country and not strike an originalist Scalia says referring to those of the view that the Constitution has a constant meaning one that does not change to fit the needs of a changing society That no longer is true Originalism  which once was orthodoxy  at least now has been returned to the status of respectability He says that until contemporary times  the last fifty years or so  judges interpreted the Constitution to mean what it meant when it was adopted Whether the originalist view remained orthodoxy into the twentieth century is debatable but it was barely in evidence by the late 1950s as such judges as Chief Justice Earl Warren interpreted the Constitution to contain broad principles that could be applied to modern circumstances These judges did not feel constrained by the framers understanding of what they had forbidden or allowed Gripping the sides of the lectern with his large square hands Scalia has been recounting how his view of a static Constitution has been faring better among federal judges these days He refers with satisfaction to a recent landmark of his own Supreme Court that declared that the Second Amendment protects an individuals right to bear arms The ruling the previous June written by Scalia overturned decades of decisions by lower court judges who had held that the Second Amendment applied only to state militias such as state national guards It was the first time the Supreme Court found that any law violated the Second Amendment and it was a significant reversal of settled lower court law Especially striking was Scalias authorship of the opinion His nocompromise style had made him a hero on law school campuses but usually cost him votes among the justices On the incendiary subject of gun rights however he was able to gain and keep the majority helped by the youthful new chief justice John Roberts and the newest associate justice Samuel Alito The case requiring interpretation of the Second Amendments text and history was the perfect match for Scalias focus on the original intention of the men who drafted and ratified the Constitution Maybe the original meaning of the Constitution is back Scalia tells the Federalist Society Were not all back there yet but maybe were on the way A quarter century into his judicial odyssey Scalia may be at the apex of his influence Roberts and Alito who had both worked in the Reagan administration have long admired Scalia and the way he wages the good conservative fight On the Court since 2005 and 2006 respectively they have been voting with Scalia more than did William Rehnquist the previous chief justice and Sandra Day OConnor Alitos predecessor whose moderate consensusseeking approach constantly thwarted Scalia Liberals such as Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg regard Scalias ideas as perilous They fear that if they were ever fully accepted by the nations judges the emphasis on individual rights established in the last half century  for the poor the disenfranchised  would be lost Today in the chandeliered ballroom however Scalia is among the faithful with his own In 1982 when the Federalist Society was founded by students at Yale University and the University of Chicago to counter the liberalism of academia Scalia was present He was teaching at Chicago and became the faculty adviser to the founding students there He helped the group raise money and attract prominent speakers As the Federalist Society began to flourish gaining wealth and adding members Scalia was an Alist invitee for annual conferences Now the society boasts up to forty thousand members and a record of influence with three Republican presidents and their lifetenured appointments to federal courts Two years before this occasion at the Mayflower the Federalist Society celebrated Scalia at a blacktie dinner for his twenty years on the Supreme Court Over the last twenty years Justice Scalia has done for the Court what President Reagan did for the presidency and the country declared the Northwestern University law professor Steven Calabresi one of the founding students at Yale He has by the force and clarity of his opinions become a defining figure in American constitutional law of the last two decades Scalia had marched up to the stage joined by his wife Maureen and all nine of their children They smiled brightly all grownups yet jostling one another goodnaturedly like children who had just emerged from a long trip in the family van I really do much better at responding to criticism than at responding to praise the man of the hour had said If you accept it as though its really due youre being conceited If you reject it you are being supposedly insincere or at least ungrateful My favorite response has been one Lyndon Johnson used  I wish my parents could have been here My father would have been proud and my mother would have believed it  Scalia grew up an only child the son of Salvatore Eugene Scalia and the former Catherine Panaro Remarkably he was also the only offspring of his generation from the entire Scalia and Panaro families None of his mothers six siblings had a child Neither did his fathers only sibling a sister So Nino as he was called became the center of attention for two tightknit striving Italian immigrant families His father had come to America knowing little English had earned a PhD at Columbia University and had spent three decades teaching Romance languages at Brooklyn College The son did not let him down He was valedictorian at New Yorks Xavier High School first in his class at Georgetown University and a magna cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School A man of pride and ambition Scalia advanced quickly through jobs in the Nixon and Ford administrations before ending up at the University of Chicago and then on the federal appeals court in Washington DC Onstage that night in 2006 Scalia saluted the next generation of his family He motioned to his nine children  one a priest wearing his collar another an army officer in uniform  and his wife Maureen the Radcliffe coed whom he had met while at Harvard and married in 1960 The justice called her the product of the best decision I ever made the mother of the nine children you see the woman responsible for raising them with very little assistance from me  And theres not a dullard in the bunch That was his moment in 2006 Now in 2008 the jurist who is a combination of Felix Frankfurter and Luciano Pavarotti entering the third act of his judicial career is enjoying an encore The Federalist Society is celebrating him as it does nearly every year in some way this late Saturday afternoon theres less glitter than at the societys famously sumptuous dinners but no less gusto Scalias visage bigger than life is projected on a large screen to his right as he speaks at the Mayflower Hotel lectern The moderator Leonard Leo the executive vice president of the Federalist Society and an old Scalia friend has been reading questions for the justice that have been penciled on small white cards and handed up from the audience Someone asks whether the originalism approach has any theoretical flaws Scalia pauses at first seemingly struggling to find any shortcomings Then in response he says that it is difficult for todays judges to know how the Constitutions drafters would respond to contemporary phenomena such as the Internet He cautions that originalism is not perfect yet adds But whatever our problems are they pale next to the problems of the idea of the Living Constitution  Another questioner notes that Scalia has called himself a fainthearted originalist Oh that was so long ago the justice responds referring to a 1989 law review article he wrote Scalia explains that he had used fainthearted because he did not see how he or any other judge could vote to uphold say ear notching of criminals as was allowed in the eighteenth century If he were a true originalist Scalia says he would have to find ear notching today perfectly constitutional despite the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment Then he quips to the Federalist Society home crowd that maybe he could be a complete originalist these days Ive gotten older and crankier The audience laughs heartily A law student sends up a question asking what a Federalist Society member should do in the face of militant or intolerant law professors or peers Although the conservative legal group has developed legions of members across campuses in law firms and at government institutions liberalism still dominates in law schools Equally significant national politics has shifted dramatically away from conservatism Just three weeks before the conference on November 4 2008 Barack Obama was elected president of the United States This was a milestone foremost because Obama became the first African American president but also because his election was widely seen as the end of an era of conservatism In spite of that this Federalist Society occasion is not solemn or melancholy It is a celebration of the judicial victories that still can be claimed Supreme Court justices reside in their own realm At the taproot of the American legal system the conservative legacy of three Republican presidents is still dominant and Scalia is its central figure It could be years before President Obamas judicial appointees are able to change the tenor of the law Scalia also knows how to make headway against prevailing winds He boasts that one of my charms is that I tell people what they dont like to hear Comfortable with tension and relishing debate his rhetorical style is combative But he does not enter every fight He rebuffs criticism that his decisions are inconsistent or driven by a desire to achieve conservative goals I often come to decisions I dont like he insists He mentions that as a policy matter he has endorsed deregulation of markets but as a judge he has voted to uphold regulation when federal law required it Scalia often reminds audiences that he voted to strike down laws banning flag burning as political protest although personally I dont like scruffy bearded sandalwearing people who go around burning the United States flag In response to the question about how to fight a disapproving professor Scalia a Roman Catholic first jokes My mother used to say Offer it up  Then he tells the audience Most of the professors I know  would welcome someone from the other side  who can serve as a foil  because they think they can beat you Thats why they publish my dissents in their casebooks The harder question is What do I do when it comes to writing the exam Do I give him the answer he taught me to be the right answer  Scalia pauses for effect Yeah he said As his audience chortles Scalia adds that it is best to save real protest for another day Wily as a serpent he advises with a sly smile Now Scalia takes that final question the one he is waiting to knock out of the park Reading from a white card Leonard Leo asks Scalia how he reconciles his differing opinions in two wellknown disputes the 1995 United States v Lopez and 2005 Gonzales v Raich cases Scalia voted in 1995 to overturn a federal law that regulated guns near schools because it trampled on state authority Ten years later he voted to uphold a federal drug law that voided a California policy allowing marijuana use for medical purposes over dissenting justices protests that the federal policy infringed on the states The 2005 case had been brought by two seriously ill women who had cultivated marijuana under Californias Compassionate Use Act For the three years since legal analysts had been buzzing over whether Scalia abandoned his abhorrence of federal intervention simply because he opposed the legalization of marijuana At the Court in 2005 Justice OConnor had declared the two Scalia positions  forbidding the federal government to displace state choices about handgun regulation but letting it override state choices about drug laws  irreconcilable Justice Clarence Thomas Scalias usual soul mate on the law had been equally critical of the notion that Congress could interfere with a carefully restricted marijuana law providing relief to the seriously ill He had scoffed The federal government may now regulate quilting bees clothes drives and potluck suppers throughout the 50 states The question on the little white card goes to the heart of Scalias legacy Is his brand of originalism simply a way to achieve conservative results Does he talk a good game until his method fails to get him what he wants as a policy matter This afternoon Scalia is not going to engage such inquiry Oh no he says grimacing Get another question It has the ring of Get over it That is Scalias stock answer when someone in an audience wants him to address Bush v Gore the decision that stopped the presidential ballot recounts in Florida and gave George W Bush the White House over Vice President Al Gore in 2000 The decision remained a political thorn in the side of the nation through Bushs two terms and particularly for Scalias critics offered evidence of his willingness to abandon principle when it does not get him the outcome he desires At the Mayflower the audience laughs when he says get another question It is a friendly laugh To them there is nothing wrong with his ducking a hardball Leonard Leo sets aside the offending card and asks Scalia Whats your favorite opera Oh says Scalia there are so many works all so different He throws out some personal favorites Strausss comic opera Der Rosenkavalier Puccinis tragic Madama Butterfly Verdis popular La Traviata Then Scalia adds And I like country music too As people leap to their feet and clap he waves big and strides off Excerpted from American Original by Joan Biskupic Copyright  2009 by Joan Biskupic Published this month by Sarah Crichton Books  Farrar Straus and Giroux LLC All

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122019275&ft=3&f=,Biographer Robin DG Kelley wants to clear the air about Thelonious Monk His story challenges a very tired idea of the tortured artist  committed to making an art by any means necessary Kelley says Kelley teaches history and American studies at the University of Southern California He says Monk wanted people to enjoy his music  and purchase it too He was someone who thought of music as a vocation to keep his family afloat his wife Nellie his two kids Kelley says And so he took his work seriously Monk died more than 25 years ago but his music is still played and heard around the world Monks work was often discounted by critics and the general public during the better part of his first two decades as a performer When critical attention came his way myths were spun around him many of which remain to this day Among them that he was difficult a recluse an untrained genius But in his new book Thelonious Monk The Life and Times of an American Original Kelley tackles those enduring myths He argues that Monk was not an isolated genius He was connected to his New York City community and he played benefits for the social causes of the day And his talent was not some mysterious Godgiven gift Monk studied Well I always did want to play the piano  the first piano I saw I tried to play it Monk said on a 1963 public television broadcast on New Yorks Channel 13 I learned how to read before I took lessons you know watching my sister practice her lessons over her shoulder That recording is but one of Kelleys discoveries over the 14 years he spent researching his book In scouring roughly 300 interviews he says he learned that Monk may have started reading music when he was 10 By the time he was 11 he began studying with a classically trained pianist named Simon Wolf The kinds of exercises he gave Thelonious came out of the books of Liszt Chopin Rachmaninoff Kelley says These were the composers Monk was drawn to Bach Beethoven to a lesser degree In addition Kelley notes that Monk studied with the stride pianist Alberta Simmons a contemporary of Fats Waller Thelonious Monk Dad  Drummer TS Monk is the son of the famed musician For me he was a father first and then he was this Thelonious guy second TS Monk says In spite of his fathers daily rehearsals at home  and a constant parade of musicians through the apartment including Charlie Parker Miles Davis and John Coltrane  in the most important ways the Monks had a fairly normal household with a mom who worked a day job It would be me my father and my sister TS Monk says He had on a wifebeater shirt and he was changing diapers  there was no such thing as Pampers back then so these were funky diapers that you put in a bucket And people dont think of Thelonious as Mr Mom but I clearly saw him do the Mr Mom thing bigtime TS Monk helped Kelley gain access to the pianists personal effects  and to his widow Nellie Monk She played a central role in the musicians life and career and she functioned to a great degree as his manager She also gave her son rare recordings of Monk playing that had not been heard outside the family Kelley calls them just incredible gems And what I heard particularly in this wonderful recording of him dealing with the song Im Getting Sentimental Over You  Kelley says you hear him first try to assimilate the song understand its dimensions And hes playing a passage over and over again And it sounds like somebody who doesnt know the song though you know he does  And he works through it And after about really 45 minutes of working through this as if hes struggling he suddenly gets his stride And he obtains a kind of mastery of the song And if theres any lesson in those tapes its that it was hard for Monk to play Monk Thinking Differently  Kelley says it may also have been hard for Monk to be Monk He was known to drink heavily and to smoke marijuana and his struggles with what was initially described and treated as manic depression were ongoing It took two decades before he got proper help for his bipolar disorder TS Monk remembers a cold New York day with 3 inches of snow on the ground My father put on his slippers his silk pajamas his sealskin hat  period he says And were walking down West End Avenue And I knew I had to put on all my winter stuff and I had to follow him to make sure that nothing happened to him In spite of his challenges Monk could also be wryly funny in his own way In that 1963 public television appearance he was interviewed by Hall Overton a composer and arranger with whom hed worked Overton asked Monk to talk about his intended audience Id like to reach everybody the public plus the musicians thats the standard I set for my songs Monk said Something that will get to the peoples ear plus  no criticism from the musicians What he reminds the audience is that Yes I have a technical mastery of what I want to do  but I also have humor And the humor is actually in the music Part of what I want you to do is make you laugh make you think differently  Kelley says To think differently Thats part of Kelleys intention for his readers But he says his motivation was to craft a portrait that both Thelonious Monk and his wife Nellie would have appreciated Monk died in 1982 and his widow died in 2002 before Kelley completed the book I think that if they can see the truth in their own lives then Ive succeeded Kelley says And its up to us to try to figure out and engage that truth Copyright 2014 NPR,20121212,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121751626&ft=3&f=,The number of businesses that sell marijuana has increased greatly in Colorado where use of pot for medical reasons has been allowed since 2000 A mix of confusing regulations and court rulings had kept its distribution in check  until earlier this year Now pot stores are showing up in many neighborhoods  and there are calls for more regulation  A Lack Of Regulations Just outside downtown Denver in a neighborhood that has become known as Little Amsterdam theres a cluster of three marijuana dispensaries Pierre Werner moved there from Las Vegas to open one called DrReefercom The laws here in Colorado are a lot more liberal than in conservative Nevada Werner says The state of Colorado gave me a business license and told me to pay my taxes The state of Nevada put me in prison Werner says he has three felony convictions for selling marijuana But in Colorado there is no regulation against felons opening a dispensary  There was one problem for Werner though His store in Little Amsterdam was near a church and a school There are no rules against that either but he didnt want to upset the neighbors So he moved his business to a spot that could be even more lucrative  right across the street from the University of Colorado in Boulder Werner says the lack of regulations encouraged him to open shop And he says the White House helped move things along  Thanks to President Obama and US Attorney General Eric Holder for getting the feds off our back and allowing the states to implement their laws Werner says The Obama administration has said that busting medical marijuana operations will be low on its priority list  Status Quo Gives Way To Heated Debate Nobody knows how many dispensaries there are in Colorado the best guess is about 150 In the past nine years there have been efforts to regulate Colorados medical marijuana industry The state health department wanted to limit the number of patients using medical pot that a vendor could supply And it planned to adopt a rule stating that a vendor must do more than just sell pot The rule imagined them also performing caregiving services like accompanying patients to the doctor But nearly all of those efforts have been unsuccessful Its not surprising at all that the socalled dispensaries are popping up everywhere says Colorado Attorney General John Suthers As the states top Republican elected official and a law enforcer Suthers was never fond of the medical marijuana concept When folks complain to him about the number of dispensaries he tells them there is almost nothing prosecutors can do  That may be about to change because there is strong interest among some state lawmakers to regulate this fastgrowing industry But the next legislative session doesnt begin until January I think the combination of whats going on right now and this  if youll excuse the expression  legal haze that were in I think its going to cause things to be somewhat status quo until the legislature convenes Suthers says Then I think youre going to have some very heated debate  Stricter Limits Coming Already law enforcement officials and district attorneys are lobbying for stricter limits on dispensaries And the marijuana businesses have formed their own lobbying group which is growing larger all the time as more dispensaries open   In Little Amsterdam Nicholas Paul runs a marijuana dispensary called Walking Raven He says the new competition doesnt worry him much I believe theres enough people out there that need the medicine Paul says Were only going to have 500 patients that we take care off Were almost full and ready to close our doors which will leave room for another dispensary Paul says his business expects to pay about 80000 in sales taxes each year He hopes lawmakers will consider that as they debate tighter regulations on marijuana businesses Copyright 2014 NPR,20091228,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121970182&ft=3&f=,In 2008 the offBroadway musical Fela became one of the most talkedabout shows in New York Telling the life story of Nigerian musician and political activist Fela Kuti the show made the move to Broadway last month and opened to ecstatic reviews But will this unconventional theater piece speak to a larger audience  Ben Brantley chief drama critic for The New York Times says he was worried about the transition When I heard Fela was moving to Broadway I thought Thats a mistake  Brantley liked Fela offBroadway but when it moved to Broadway he changed his mind  He gave the show an allout rave I think its pretty much irresistible on Broadway he says And I think what makes it singular is not only that youre talking about a culture based in Yoruban religion and a form of music  Afrobeat  which Broadway has never heard before but even the way the performers relate to the audience  They dont sell themselves Theres great energy to them but theres also a great selfcontainment Its like You come meet me You want to come meet me   Its a good bet that most American audiences have never met the music of Fela Kuti let alone know about his life or the politics of Nigeria So it falls on the shoulders of director choreographer and coauthor Bill T Jones to turn this complicated story into compelling theater Jones says it starts with the music Fela was at one point the most famous musician in Africa Jones says He created this thing called Afrobeat which was a kind of a recombination of classic jazz He loved jazz traditional African music and American funk and rhythm and blues all tied together Jones says Fela Kuti used that music to protest injustice in his native Nigeria where the murderous regime arrested him more than 200 times But Kuti was no saint He lived the hedonistic life of a rock star He smoked marijuana he lived in a compound with 27 women  his queens  whom he symbolically married one day I dont know if I wouldve liked him as a man Jones says But I certainly respect him as a cultural force and an artist More Than A Rebel Jones says Kuti was more than just a bad boy he also played an important role in the fight for justice in Nigeria I call him a sacred monster  Jones says that any democratically leaning society cannot afford to be without because he is the one maybe imperfectly but he puts his finger on that sore spot He points at it in impolitic terms He sets things moving Thats why Im a fan of his To make this artist who died of AIDS in 1997 live for contemporary audiences Jones and his design team have turned the Eugene ONeill Theater into The Shrine  Felas nightclub in Lagos  complete with colored lights and mirror balls the Afrobeat band Antibalas onstage and scantily clad performers dancing in the aisles Brantley says it works You really do feel as if youre in a nightclub and a very particular nightclub in a particular place he says You dont feel youve just walked in off Times Square Theater at its best is always supposed to transport us but this seems to take us to another continent Politics And Candy Audience members at Fela arent allowed to be passive They sing along with songs by following lyrics projected on the set  and at one point they get up on their feet and shake their booty  or as Kuti would call it their nyansh Sahr Ngaujah who plays Kuti encourages the audience to dance Lets just get everybody to participate in moving their nyansh he says And in this way they can look at the nyansh of these women and appreciate it  not just from a voyeuristic you know pornographic standpoint but really appreciate the craftsmanship Jones says this kind of participation is a deliberate way to bring audiences into the story They have to participate which is what I think is brilliant about using music in the way Fela did Music is the weapon he says So now we all become connected through the music and we become connected on a primal level When the show gets more political and goes to darker personal places the audience is ready Ngaujah says Why not give people candy if thats what you want he asks They dont have to know its full of vitamins and minerals you know what I mean  If its sweet theyre gonna eat it anyway Candy or not producer Stephen Hendel knows that developing audiences for Fela isnt going to be easy He needs to sell three times as many seats a week as he did offBroadway So hes enlisted rapper JayZ and superstars Will Smith and Jada PinkettSmith to lend their names as producers He hopes Fela will become a hot ticket like it was offBroadway Suddenly we were just sold out he says Celebrities calling every day worldfamous musicians We had no tickets Wed squeeze them in Jones says hes already hearing good word of mouth when he stands at the back of the theater Its a fun evening he says Even with all the things that go down in that second act I heard some people describing it as uplifting the other day Uplifting Well it ends with people bringing coffins into the theater but I guess thats  Ive also heard people say It made me want to go out and be an activist Well thats good Fela is currently playing at the Eugene ONeill Theater on Broadway   Copyright 2014 NPR,20121212,marijuana

any more 711s Nice slippers yo says the cellphone banger when I come outside with my milk Hes twenty or so in a sagging sharkcolored tracksuit black hair combed straight over his ears elaborate tattoo rising out of his shirt at the base of his neck And right out in the open in front of this convenience store he conveniently offers me a hit on a glass blunt a little marijuana pipe shaped like a cigarette I wave it off but sort of wish I hadnt  its been at least fifteen years but I didnt just spring from some relaxedwaisted suburbia with a Stoli martini in hand I had my moments In college they used to call me Weedeater because I devoured those Acapulco Gold joints incense burning black light on the walls Pink Floyd thrumming down the dorm floor  Oh and theyre not technically slippers but a casual loafer I got at the Nordstrom Rack with a gift certificate when I returned a cardigan that made me look like my grandfather Of course I dont tell the stoned kid that I just smile and say No thanks but then I pause to get a closer look instead of continuing on to my car Maybe Im just curious about this clever pipe or maybe its the smell of the weed or maybe its just this swiveling looseness Im feeling but Im still in midpause when the fatter white gangster joins us flatbrimmed ball cap worn sidesaddle and now there are three of us standing in a little semicircle as if waiting for a tee time Hey says the one with the neck tattoo and the blunt dude here can give us a ride to the party And Im about to say I cant give them a ride because Ive got to get home and they look mildly dangerous when fatinthehat says Thanks man like hes surprised Id be so cool and suddenly I want to be that cool And then the fat kid looks down at my hands and laughs Damn man Why you buy your milk here Shits like nine dollars a gallon The clouds are low like a drop ceiling suffused with light from the city They slide silently overhead And two dopesmoking bangers in tracksuits climb into my car I read once that we can only fear what were already afraid of that our deepest fears are the memory of some earlier unbearable fear If thats true then maybe its a good thing my mother never lived

housing collapse just as my senile father moved in how I scrambled back to my old newspaper job only to get laid off eight weeks ago How I got fourteen weeks of severance from the paper and have six

NTSA And a security clearance I shit you not Dudes got someone who warns him about random tests and he keeps that catheter full of someone elses whiz right there in his locker And when he hears about

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121620492&ft=3&f=,The confessional interview has become an almost unavoidable ritual for disgraced figures who seek to emerge once again in public And for several weeks specialized television news producers have been fanning out across the country  even across the globe  in the effort to land the most highly soughtafter interview in years

years ago says Jessica Stuart a former producer for NBCs Today Show The Oprah Winfrey Show and ABC NewsSince the first accusations surfaced of Woods marital infidelity ABC News has had a Swedishspeaking producer camped out in Sweden to seek out relatives of his wife Elin NordegrenThe countrys most dominant and once most prominent athlete is now kept from view by an invisible army of security guards agents and handlers But in media circles it is a truism that at some point somewhere Woods will have to come out of seclusion and sit down for a televised interview In network parlance such interviews are called gets and they arent scheduled theyre bookedBooking is the game says Today Show executive producer Jim Bell That is the gameNot For The Faint Of HeartIts more than just bragging rights Exclusive interviews help generate publicity for big moneymaking shows like Today and ABCs Good Morning America and The Oprah Winfrey Show along with their celebrity hosts  There are two kinds of gets which lead to two different kinds of inducements to encourage people to agree to the interviews The first involves normal people who are caught up in extraordinary situations  say the survivors of a natural disaster or the spouses of soldiers held captive abroadProducers will often go to great lengths to ingratiate themselves with those people and their families Sometimes they end up staying in small towns for days and weeks breaking bread even babysitting children as they hope to convince their harried parents they will be treated with respect Shows find that paying for a trip to tape the interview at their studios in Manhattan with airfare and a room at a nice hotel will often do the trickBut the competition can be fierce And it can hinge on unexpected personal quirks Laurye Blackford was a top booker for Good Morning America when she was trying to win over Tillie Tooter an 83yearold grandmother who had survived in her car for three days after it went upside down into a snakeinfested swamp She loved Good Morning America Blackford recalls GMA thought that interview was locked up Turns out that the doctor who saved her life was a Today Show viewer ABC didnt get Tudor on its showThen theres the hunt for the famous people with more clout and sophistication at handling the press They can often call their own shots Networks will still send junior producers out

television production consulting company Long Story Short in Washington DC  But she says she learned the booking business wasnt for the fainthearted a decade ago  back when she worked for NBCs Today During the Monica Lewinsky scandal my competition had gotten the first interview with her attorney William Ginsberg and I physically threw myself in front of his car while it was moving to try to stop it to get an interview Stuart says now with a laugh I was 21 and really hungry No one told me to do it I just wanted that get  Striking The DealIn fact several television news executives said the last comparable big televised interview was Lewinsky herself in 1999 right after the US Senate acquitted President Clinton Barbara Walters conducted that interview for ABC News And special interview subjects sometimes get special inducements Networks say they never pay for interviews But ABC gave Lewinsky the foreign broadcasting rights for the interview tapes She made hundreds of thousands of dollars selling them to broadcasters outside the US Similarly two years ago the British Princes William and Harry sat down with Matt Lauer of the Today Show NBC paid 25 million to the princes foundation named for their mother the late Princess Diana Officially the payment gave the network the rights to broadcast a benefit concert in the United States The Today Shows Jim Bell acknowledges the juxtapositionThere are things that have gone on with interviews that make people a little queasy says Bell I feel like for the most part though we meet our standard Were going to ask anything No one comes in here and gets a cakewalk If viewers feel comfortable with it  we feel comfortable with it  thats fineBut he says that Woods has strong enough incentive at some point to do it without anyone having to strike special deals I think theres a lot in it for him Bell says He has to get past this and part of that is answering questions people haveFormer network booker Laurye Blackford isnt so sure The media thinks they have a right to hear from him  that he has to come out to speak to them says Blackford who left TV in 2008 to be a media consultant for the McCain presidential campaign and specifically worked with Cindy McCain If I were advising him I would say You dont owe them anything But he has a bigger careerWill Tiger Come ForwardThe Today Show has been aggressive in broadcasting interviews with at least two women who have come forward to say they had extramarital affairs with Woods  Blackford says she has a high regard for her former competitors at NBC But she says she was surprised by its choices Wanting that big interview you really have to weigh is it worth talking to these women  and possibly losing Tiger because of that Bell says that consideration never came up at the perennially toprated Today When you can simply say to people more people are going to watch you on our show thats a very powerful card that wins a lot Bell says In many cases people will come to us you know before weve even reached out to themBookers say you can tell a lot about Woods intentions by whom he selects to talk to assuming he does If he submits to Oprah or the Today Show hell want to retain the women fans who have made up a surprisingly strong component of his audience If he appears on ESPN or HBOs Real Sports hell be going after the hardcore sports fanNews producers say theyre told to do most anything short of lying to or bribing the people they want on the air But Jessica Stuart says there are tougher things to do than chase celebrities She once talked a married couple into appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss their failure to have sex for more than a year Copyright 2014 NPR,20091221,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121164499&ft=3&f=,Chapter One I have a farm on a deadend street in the ghetto My back stairs are dotted with chicken turds Bales of straw come undone in the parking area next to my apartment I harvest lettuce in an abandoned lot I awake in the mornings to the sounds of farm animals mingled with my neighbors blaring car alarm I didnt always call this place a farm That didnt happen until the spring of 2005 when a very special package was delivered to my apartment and changed everything I remember standing on my deck waiting for it While scanning the horizon for the postal jeep I checked the health of my bee colony Honeybees buzzed in and out of the hive their hind legs loaded down with yellow pollen I caught a whiff of their honeymaking on the breeze mixed with the exhaust from the nearby freeway I could see the highway heavy with traffic from the deck I noticed that three bees had fallen into a watering can As their wings sent out desperate ripples along the water I broke off a twig from a potted star jasmine and offered it to the drowning insects One bee clambered onto the stick and clung to it as I transported her to the top of the hive The next bee did the same  she held fast to the twig like a passenger gone overboard clutching a lifesaver Safe atop the hive the two soggy bees opened their wings to the morning sunlight Once dry and warm they would be able to fly again Just to see what would happen I lifted the final rescuee to the entrance of the hive instead of the top A guard bee stomped out from the dark recesses of the brood box Theres always one on vigil for disturbances armed and ready to sting As the guard bee got closer to the wet one I braced myself for a brutal natural history lesson The waterlogged bee started to right herself as she waved a soggy antenna Another guard bee joined the first and together they probed the wet bee She couldnt have smelled of their hive anymore which is how most bees recognize one another Nonetheless the guards began to lick her dry Hey Hey a voice yelled I peered down to the end of our deadend street A new car a silver Toyota Corolla had arrived on 28th Street the night before probably the victim of a joyride  Corollas are notoriously easy to start without a key Local teenagers steal them and drive around until they run out of gas Already the car had lost one wheel By nightfall I predicted it would be stripped completely Amid the jumble of abandoned cars and trash and the shiny Toyota Corolla I made out the figure of the man who was yelling He waved vigorously Bobby Morning sir I called and saluted him He saluted back Bobby lived in an immobilized car He switched on his television which was mounted on top of one of the other abandoned cars An orange extension cord snaked from a tealcolored house at the end of the block The perky noise of Regis and Kathie Lee joined the sound of the nearby traffic and the clattering trundle of the San Francisco Bay Areas subway BART which runs aboveground next to the highway Just then a monk came out of the Buddhist monastery across the street from my house and brought Bobby a snack The monks will feed anyone who is hungry Next to the fountain in their courtyard theres a giant alabaster statue of a placidfaced lady riding a dragon Kuan Yin the goddess of compassion My bees loved to drink from the lotusflowerfilled fountain I often watched their golden bodies zoom across 28th Street at the same height as the power lines then swoop down behind the temples red iron gates The monk who handed Bobby a container of rice and vegetables was female dressed in pale purple robes her head shaved Bobby took the food and shoved it into a microwave plugged in next to the television set Nuked his breakfast I heard the clattering sound of a shopping cart A can scrounger Wearing a giant Chinese wicker hat and rubber gloves and carrying a pair of tongs she opened our recycling bin and started fishing around for cans She muttered to herself in Chinese Ayya I watched as Bobby jogged over to her I had never seen him run before Get out of here he growled His territory She shook her head as if to say she didnt understand and continued fishing Bobby butted her with his belly I said get he yelled She scurried away pulling her cart after her Bobby watched her retreat Then when she was almost around the corner as if he felt bad Bobby put his hands to his mouth and yelled Ill see you at the recycling center Just a few blocks away the center paid cash by the pound for metal Chuckling to himself Bobby glanced up at me on the deck and flashed me a mostly toothless smile This place this ghetto of Oakland California brings out the best and the worst in us Bored of waiting around outside I headed back inside my apartment A fly strip dangled from the ceiling and ripped feed bags piled up near the door A black velour couch my boyfriend and I found in the street sagged in the corner I guess the neighborhood brings out the best and worst in me too Sure my chickens lay eggs  but the flock has spawned an occasional rooster that crowed loudly and often starting at 4 am Bees do result in honey and wax and better pollination  but they have also stung people from time to time The garden verdant cornucopia on one hand rodentattracting breeding ground on the other I flopped onto the couch and read the chalkboard tally that hung near the door 4 chickens 30000 bees approximately 59 flies 2 monkeys me and my boyfriend Bill That tally was about to change  A longdebunked scientific theory states that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny Basically that means that the order of development in an embryo indicates its evolutionary development  for example a human embryo first looks like a fish because we evolved from fish When Bill and I first moved from Seattle to Oakland I was reminded of that theory because somehow we ended up recreating our old life in the exact same order as we had created it in Seattle The first year in Oakland we built the garden the second year we got the honeybees and then the chickens In this our third year of development it was time to evolve to the next level Out of the corner of my eye I watched through the window as the postal jeep turned down our street and pulled to a stop in front of our house A man dressed in wool shorts hopped out holding an airholeriddled box in his arms I bounded downstairs My neighbor Mr Nguyen who lived one floor below me was sitting outside on the porch smoke and steam from his morning cigarette and Vietnamese coffee wafting up together in the crisp spring air In his sixties Mr Nguyen dyed his graying hair black wore buttondown dress shirts and was surprisingly sprightly He set down his coffee stubbed out his cigarette and walked into the street with me to receive the package The postal worker made me sign an officiallooking piece of paper before he would hand me the box It peeped when I opened it It was filled with puff balls Fuzzy yellow ducklings called out desperately with their orange bills Longnecked goslings squawked and fluffy multicolored chicks peeped Three oddlooking chicks with an unattractive pimple of skin atop their heads gazed up quietly from the box The delivery guy shook his head in disbelief I could tell he had questions Were we not in the city Wasnt downtown Oakland only ten blocks away Who is this insane woman Is this even legal But years of working for the government had perhaps deadened his curiosity He didnt look me in the eye He didnt make a sound He just jumped back into his postal jeep and drove away Mr Nguyen giggled For the last few years he had happily observed  and participated in  my ruralurban experiments He knew poultry when he saw it he had been a farmer in Vietnam before enlisting to help the Americans during the war Oh yes baby chicks he said Ducks He pointed a cigarettestained finger at each species Goose His finger paused at the pimpled heads He looked at me for a hint Baby turkeys I guessed I had never seen a baby turkey either Mr Nguyen raised his eyebrows Gobblegobble Thanksgiving Oh yes he said remembering with a smile Then he grimaced My wife make one time Was it good I asked I knew that his wife Lee was a vegetarian she must have made an exception for Thanksgiving Mr Nguyen shook his head vigorously No tough Too tough Very bad I thought he might spit I closed the lid and the peeping stopped Mr Nguyen went back into his apartment returning to the blare of a Vietnameselanguage television show In the middle of 28th Street I held the box of poultry and waterfowl The abandoned ghetto where we lived had a distinct Wild West vibe  gunfights in the middle of the day a general state of lawlessness and now this livestock I glanced at the invoice connected to the box Murray McMurray Hatchery it read 1 Homesteaders Delight I didnt think about it at the time but looking back on it I realize that Homesteaders Delight does have a rather ominous ring to it  Every secondrate city has an identity complex Oakland is no different Its always trying to be more arty more hightech more clean than it is able OTown is surrounded by overachievers The famously liberal and plush Berkeley lies to the north The hightech mecca of Silicon Valley glimmers to the south Just eight miles west via the Bay Bridge is San Francisco  so close but the polar opposite of Oakland SF is filled with successful polished people Oakland is scruffy loud unkempt Ive always chosen uncool places to live I guess its because I was born in Idaho rivaling only Ohio as the most disregarded state in the union Then I lived in a logging town in Washington State whose big claim to fame was a satanic cult By the time I moved to Seattle living in the boring Beacon Hill neighborhood the uncool the unsavory had become my niche When I went traveling and someone warned me  speaking in low tones a snarl to her lips  not to go to Croatia or Chiapas or Brooklyn I tended to add the place to my itinerary immediately Whatever you do dont go to Oakland a stockingcapclad guy at a Seattle barbecue told me when I confessed that I was going to check out the Bay Area on a long road tripquest to find a new place to live I made a mental note to check it out Bill and I took three months to explore the candidates At his insistence we brought our cat Bills a toughlooking guy with shaggy hair and a strut like hes got two watermelons under his arms His voice is Tom Waits gravel from years of smoking He might resemble a Hells Angel but hes really just a love sponge who spends a great deal of time cuddling with our cat We hit all the cities we thought we might like to live in Portland too perfect Austin too in the middle of Texas New Orleans too hot Brooklyn too little recycling Philly and Chicago too cold But Oakland  Oakland was just right The weather was lovely a neverending spring There was recycling and a music scene But what really drove me and Bill away from the clean and orderly Seattle and into the arms of Oakland was its downandout qualities The faded art deco buildings The dive bars Its citizenry who drove cars as old and beatup as ours Because of  inexperience and a housing shortage Bill and I wound up sharing a ramshackle house in the Oakland hills with a pack of straightedge vegan anarchists They wore brownblack clothes had earth names like Rotten and liked to play violent computer games in large groups in the common room Sober At first I thought it was cute that anarchists had rules No alcohol No dairy products No meat Then the paradox started to chafe Forced by the strict house regulations Bill and I would have to rendezvous in our travelworn van in order to take nips off a contraband bottle of wine gorge ourselves on banned cheese products and remember the good old days when we oppressed chickens in our backyard in Seattle And we plotted our uprising One night I unearthed an apartment listing on Craigslist that would set us free I found it during video game night at the house surrounded by a pack of anarchists in our living room While they fired imaginary guns on their computer screens I clandestinely scanned the ad for the apartment It was reasonably priced and in downtown Oakland Feeling subversive we went for a tour the next day The first thing we noticed when we came down from the verdant hills into the flatlands  also known as the lower bottoms  was the dearth of trees Gray predominated Bill drove his coffee brown eyes nervously scanning the scene We passed one green space huddled under a network of connecting onramps A basketball court some shrubs It was called Marcus Garvey Park No one was there even on an early summer day What was happening was liquor stores Captain Liquor Brothers Market S and N One after another The surrounding restaurants were mostly fastfood chains a Taco Bell Carls Jr Churchs Chicken One variety store caught my eye Its handmade sign used no words just images a pair of dice socks eggs toilet paper Lifes necessities It reminded me of the little roadside tiendas in Mexico It was the third world embedded in the first The houses though dilapidated had clearly once been lovely homes elaborate Victorians next to Spanish Mission bungalows Craftsman cottages and vintage brick apartment buildings They were chipped charred unpainted crumbling Beautiful neglect As we cruised the neighborhood we took stock of our potential neighbors A man wearing a head scarf was singing as he swept garbage out of the gutter in front of his liquor store A group of old men sat in lawn chairs in front of their apartment building A blond woman with scabs on her face limped along the street pausing to ask for spare change from the young black kids on the corner The kids wore enormous white Tshirts and saggy pants they counted their bills and stood in the middle of traffic waving small plastic bags at prospective customers Clearly a rough crowd All these people out on the street  they were characters I had never met in Seattle or in our more suburban house in the Oakland hills I was curious and yet I had to admit it they scared me Could I really live here Walk around the streets without worrying about getting mugged The place was a postcard of urban decay I thought as we turned down 28th Street Cheetos bags somersaulted across the road An eightstory brick building on the corner was entirely abandoned and tattooed with graffiti Living here would definitely mean getting out of my comfort zone We came to a stop in front of a gray 1905 Queen Anne Like almost every other house in the Bay Area it had been divided into apartments The place for rent was the upstairs portion of the duplex Bill and I surveyed the house The paint was peeling a bougainvillea sagged in the side yard It was a deadend street stopping at what was once the grass playground of an elementary school Bill pointed out that a deadend street is a quiet street He had once lived on one in Orlando and got to know all his neighbors It made things intimate he said Just then a dazzling woman with cropped platinum hair and platform boots peeked out of her metal warehouse door and beckoned us over to her end of the street My names Lana she said Anal spelled backward Bill and I exchanged looks She stood behind her chainlink fence a 155pound mastiff at her side A robed Buddhist monk emerged from the house next door He and Lana waved He disarmed his car alarm  the danger of the hood trumps even karma  and drove away Lana gazed at the retreating car and said The old monk used to make me bittermelon soup when I was sick Lana told us in her high funny voice that she had lived on the 28 for fifteen years Its not bad now she assured us A few years ago though I had people running over my roof firing machine guns Now its like Sesame Street She shook her head Lana then pointed at each of the houses and described its inhabitants a white family she called the Hillbillies in the teal house a black mom with two kids in the stucco duplex an apartment house filled with Vietnamese families who wanted to live near the temple An abandoned building with a sometime squatter An empty warehouse that no one knew much about As we took leave of Lana she invited us to Blue Wednesday a salon for artists and performers she held every week She seems interesting I said as we walked back to get our tour of the apartment Our landlords had arrived in their gold BMW We should move in Bill said running his fingers through his shaggy dark hair He didnt even need to see the apartment Our soontobe landlords were an African couple with socialist tendencies They led us upstairs for a tour of the bright little apartment Hardwood floors A tilelined fireplace A backyard A living room with a view of a 4500squarefoot lot filled with fourfoottall weeds The landlords didnt know who owned the lot but they guessed that whoever they were they wouldnt mind if we gardened there We gaped at the enormous space It had an aspect that would guarantee full sun all day In Seattle we tended what we thought was a big backyard vegetable garden but this lot  it was massive by our standards It sealed the deal Bill and I grinned on our way back to our hovel in the hills with the vegan anarchists still giddy from too much California sunshine and the prospect of a new home A few weeks later when we moved into our new apartment we discovered that our neighborhood was called GhostTown for all its longabandoned businesses condemned houses and overgrown lots The empty lot next to our house was not rare there was one sometimes two on every block And through the vacant streets rolled GhostTown tumbleweeds the lost hairpieces of prostitutes Tumbleweaves The day we moved into GhostTown a man was shot and killed outside a Carls Jr restaurant a few blocks away We drove past the crime scene  yellow caution tape a white sheet with a pair of bare feet poking out We heard on the radio that Oakland had been named number one  it had the highest murder rate in the country When we drove by later the body was gone and the business of selling hamburgers and soda had resumed That night the notsodistant crack of gunfire kept me up Because of the violence the neighborhood had a whiff of anarchy  real anarchy not the theoretical world of my former roommates In the flatlands whole neighborhoods were left with the task of sorting out their problems Except in the case of murder the Oakland police rarely got involved In this laissezfaire environment I would discover as I spent more time in GhostTown anything went Spanishspeaking soccer players hosted ad hoc tournaments in the abandoned playfield Teenagers sold bags of marijuana on the corners The Buddhist monks made enormous vats of rice on the city sidewalk Bill eventually began to convert our friends cars to run on vegetable oil And I started squat gardening on land I didnt own  As I fiddled with the door to our apartment the new box of fowl tucked under my arm I recognized that I was descending deeper into the realm of the underground economy Now that I had been in California for a few years I felt ready for what seemed like the next logical progression something I had never dared in the soggy Northwest Meat birds I felt a bit nuts yes but I also felt great People move to California to reinvent themselves They give themselves new names They go to yoga Pretty soon they take up surfing Or Thai kickboxing Or astral healing Or witch camp Its true what they say California the land of fruits and nuts In Northern California one is encouraged to raise his freak flag proudly and often In Seattle my mostly hidden freak flag had been being a backyard chicken owner beekeeper and vegetable gardener I got off on raising my own food Not only was it more delicious and fresh it was also essentially free Now I was taking it to the next level Some might say I had been swept up by the Bay Areas mantra repeated ad nauseam to eat fresh local freerange critters At farmers markets here  and there is one every day  it isnt uncommon to overhear farmers chatting with consumers about how the steer from which their steaks were harvested had been fed where their stewing hens ranged and the view from the sheep pen that housed the lamb that was now ground up and laid out on a table decorated with nasturtium blossoms Prices correspond with the quality of the meat and Alice Waters assures us that only the best ingredients will make the best meals But as a poor scrounger with three lowpaying jobs and no health insurance I usually couldnt afford the good stuff Since I liked eating quality meat and have always had more skill than money I decided to take matters into my own hands One night after living in our GhostTown apartment for a few years I clicked my mouse over various meatbird packages offered by the Murray McMurray Hatchery Web site Murray McMurray sold dayold ducks quail pheasants turkeys and geese through the mail They also sold bargainpriced combinations the Barnyard Combo the Fancy Duck Package the Turkey Assortment These packages I had thought might offer a way to eat quality meat without breaking the bank But I had never killed anything before Blithely ignoring this minor detail I settled on the Homesteaders Delight two turkeys ten chickens two geese and two ducks for 42 I bought my poultry package with a click of the mouse and paid for it with a credit card It was only after the post office delivered the box that I realized one cant just buy a farm animal like a book or CD What I now held in my hands was going to involve a hell of a lot of hard work My first task was to install the birds in a brooder a warm place where they could live without fear of catching cold or encountering predators I carried the box o birds upstairs and set it next to the brooder I had hastily built the night before Built might be a strong word  my brooder was a cardboard box lined with shredded paper with a heat lamp suspended above it and a homemade waterer inside The hatchery advised that the chicks would be thirsty from their twentyfourhour journey in a box So the first order of the day was to dip the birds beaks into a dish of water and teach them to drink on their own I picked up my first victim a little yellow chick covered in a soft downy fuzz and held her tiny pink beak up to the homemade waterer It consisted of a mason jar with tiny holes drilled into the lid when the jar was turned upside down into a shallow dish capillary action allowed only a bit of water to dribble out and pool in the dish Amazingly the chick knew just what to do She sipped up a beakful of water then tilted her head back to swallow The masonjar waterer glugged and more water seeped out I released her into the cardboardbox brooder and she wandered over for another sip of water Then she realized she was alone She peeped and stumbled around the shredded newspaper looking for her companions The fowl still in the postal box strangely silent since Id placed it on the living room floor suddenly went wild when they heard her peeps So I reached into the box for another chick and worked quickly Without fail each victim peeped in distress The others then chirped in solidarity All ten finally installed the chicks quieted down Exhausted from their journey and my manhandling they mounded into a fluffy pile under the circle of warm light and took a nap Bill stumbled out of our bedroom wearing his boxer shorts his hair mussed Not a morning person he glanced at the baby birds like they were a dream then headed for the bathroom While the chicks slept I had to educate the dim little turkey poults They looked like the chicks but with bigger bones and that strange pucker of skin on top of their heads which I later learned would develop into a turkey part called the snood Their demeanor was reminiscent of chicks that had done too much acid It took the first turkey poult three firm dunkings before it got the hang of drinking water The poult resisted when I put its beak into the dish craning its head away struggling in my hand like a hellcat Finally exhausted from struggling its head went lax and drooped until it dropped into the water dish where it discovered  surprise  water and drank greedily The other two the hatchery had sent me an extra poult and an extra duckling probably as insurance against death by mail were no different After I released them the poults poked around the brooder gentle and cautious Eventually they waddled over and joined the puff pile of chicks The downy almost weightless ducklings and goslings drank deeply using their bills to slurp up large amounts of water When I set them into the brooder they waded their big orange feet into the water dish and splashed around Water hit the side of the box and splattered the sleeping chicks who awoke and began to peep in protest Sensing that this might be a disastrous species intersection I lugged out an aluminum washtub and set up a separate brooder with extra water a towel and a bright warm light for the waterfowl The baby birds were home warm and safe The chicks scratched at their yellow feed just like our big chickens out back did Sometimes they would stop midscratch and feeling the warmth of the brooder light fall asleep standing up The puffy gray goslings curled their necks around the yellow sleeping ducklings A Hallmark card had exploded in my living room I called my mom A brooder box full of fowl was something that woman could appreciate She had once been a hippie homesteader in Idaho Listen to this I said and held the phone near the brooder box A hundred little peeps Oh my god she said Three turkeys three ducks two geese and ten chickens I crowed I watched the chicks and poults moving around the brooder  pooping scratching pooping pecking pooping Turkeys Do you remember Tommy Turkey she said I didnt but the photo in our family album had stuck with me my older sister Riana in a saggy cloth diaper being chased by the advancing figure of a giant white turkey Tommy My mom told us about Tommy every time we got out the old photo album from the ranch days Well he was mean as hell and he would chase you guys   I looked out the window while my mom described the smokehouse she and my dad had built Bill had made it downstairs where he was out front tinkering with our car His legs peeked out from underneath our dilapidated Mercedes as he rolled around amid the streets numerous Swisher Sweet cigar butts I had warned him about my meatbird purchase and he had been excited about the prospect of homegrown meat but now that he saw the baby birds  fragile tiny  he seemed a bit skeptical N Tommy grew to be an enormous size my mom said and as backtotheland hippies she and my dad had been very pleased They didnt encounter any predator problems that year and butchering him was a cinch But disaster did hit the smokehouse burned to the ground while they were smoking the turkey Oh no I groaned Life was like that she said glumly I felt sorry for her My moms stories usually involve some heroic hippie farm action I hadnt heard this part of the story before but I knew bad things had happened My parents marriage had dissolved on the ranch in Idaho after all  my dad too much the mountain man an uncompromising nonconformist my mom isolated and bored Her voice brightened Even though the smokehouse burned down we did manage to salvage the turkey What do you mean I asked We dug through the charred wood and there it was a perfectly cooked turkey I brushed off all the cinders and served him for dinner She paused and smacked her lips a noise that was repellent to me as a teenager but now filled me with hope It was the best turkey Ive ever had she declared We said our goodbyes and I hung up the phone I glanced into the cozy chick brooder The chicks slept on their mattress of shredded pages from the New York Times Their fuzzy bodies slumbered on snatches of color ads for watches a stern oped about pollution in China the eyebrows of a politician I had to remind myself that though they were cute these baby birds would eventually become my dinner Thanksgiving in particular was going to be intense I imagined the killing scene a butcher block an ax three giant Tommy turkeys I had known since poulthood I wasnt sure if I could bring myself to do it But the conversation with my mom left me emboldened for my foray into killing and eating animals I had raised myself  this urge was clearly part of my cultural DNA I wondered if this would prove that I could have it both ways to sop up the cultural delights of the city while simultaneously raising my own food In retrospect though I wonder why I thought my experience would be any less disastrous than my parents  The next day following the suggestions of a homesteading book from the 1970s I swabbed the baby birds butts with Qtips The long flight in a box can cause digestion problems for the chicks  namely pasted vents Which is a fancy way of saying blocked buttholes So I dutifully wetted them down plucked dried matter from their bottoms and felt terrible when I had to tug off whole chunks of downy feathers I wasnt satisfied until all their parts looked pink and healthy After morning chickenbutt detail I sat in my kitchen and surveyed our squat garden All the eastfacing windows of our apartment overlook the lot which after the past few years had been transformed into a vegetable and fruittree garden I could see that the collards were getting large and that the springs lettuce harvest promised to be a good one Even from inside I could see some mildew forming on the pea vines It was going to be a remarkable year I could sense it If my life in Oakland was a developing embryo with this meatbird addition it was as if a fishlike creature had suddenly sprouted wings From Farm City The

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120785416&ft=3&f=,Introduction We can never know what to want because living only one life we can neither compare it with our previous lives nor perfect it in our lives to come epigraph to Raymond Carvers Where Im Calling From quoted from Milan Kunderas The Unbearable Lightness of Being Few American short story writers have been celebrated as Raymond Carver was in the 1980s Because his spare colloquial prose hints at something absent and mysterious critics called him the father of minimalist fiction Writers and writing teachers revered and imitated his style Readers loved his grim often funny sometimes transcendent stories about the lives of the working poor He wrote about their money problems alcoholism embittered marriages and disaffected children about muted interior crises brought on by bad luck or neglect rather than intent Carver knew that territory because he lived in it for much of his life  Carver paid a high price for the experiences that served his art When printers galleys arrived for his first book of short stories Will You Please Be Quiet Please Carver and his wife who was a schoolteacher had just been released from their debts by a federal bankruptcy court Carver drank vodka while he corrected the pages at his dining room table in Cupertino California  On the day after the books publication in March 1976 two of Carvers friends arrived at his house early in the morning They didnt come to celebrate the book that would become a National Book Award finalist They came to drive him and his wife to his trial at the county courthouse hehad been charged with lying to obtain unemployment payments As they all departed Maryann Carver took a shiny white book from a stack on their table The book was dedicated to her a fruit of their nineteen married years She would show it to the judge as evidence that her husband was still a man with prospects She hoped to be able to keep him out of jail She would explain that he was the victim of unfulfilled dreams and alcoholism  Indeed Will You Please Be Quiet Please was a careerlaunching book Carver then thirtyeight had published in literary magazines  plus two stories in Esquire  but this first book had been a long time coming  It came almost too late Alcohol had ruled Carvers life for longer than he cared to admit Lying to the state of California was hardly the worst offense Carver had committed as he capitulated to latestage alcoholism Everything he wrote later that he and Maryann held sacred every spiritual value had crumbled away  Carvers fate had closed in on him when he suffered an alcoholic withdrawal seizure in the lobby of a clinic where hed just been detoxified A doctor told him then that hed risk irreversible brain damage if he drank again that first book could be his last Despite the dire warning Carver continued to drink detox and relapse for another two years As he became sicker and sicker he hid the severity of his problem more cunningly from everyone but his family and close friends These people worried but they couldnt influence him  Yet Carver finally turned his life around becoming one of the rare exceptions in a long line of hopelessly alcoholic American authors When he finally quit drinking he made the decision alone That day of his last drink was the natal day of his new life the beginning of the decade he described as gravy  the sauce that enriches an ordinary meal  In his eleven sober years Carver made difficult decisions that changed his work and his circumstances He relished the rewards affection and freedom that came his way When he died in 1988 Where Im Calling From a selection of his short stories that the New York Times named a favorite book of the late twentieth century had just been published he had just completed his third collection of poetry in five years His work appeared in twentytwo languages and the Times of London called him the American Chekhov He was a fulltime writer acclaimed by the press and supported by royalties from his books and a generous fiveyear grant from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters  In the end though Carver measured his own success by what hed come through and by the work that he believed would survive him He wasnt a saint and his sobriety wasnt perfect  he remained a nervous obsessive and lovably boyish man addicted to cigarettes and reliant on marijuana But he credited his productive final years to not drinking Im prouder of that that Ive quit drinking than I am of anything in my life  Carver liked to say he had two lives and sometimes he spoke of two people Bad Ray and Good Ray viewing himself with the bemused kindly detachment he held for his fictional characters Of course he was one man with one life Bad Ray and Good Ray together were messier and more human than his dichotomy supposed  Carver acknowledged the irrevocable singleness of his life when he selected as an epigraph to his final volume of stories a quotation from Milan Kundera that speaks of the impossibility of knowing what to want or of perfecting oneself within one lifetime Carver became a more confident and luckier man when he stopped drinking but he didnt become a different man In recovery he accepted himself and marveled at his own achievements His intention to write well remained his true north Excerpted from Raymond

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120983848&ft=3&f=,These days medical marijuana clinics are popping up like weeds in California Los Angeles alone has nearly 1000 places where with a doctors note you can legally buy potBut the illegal side of marijuana is also thriving Authorities say its partly because all those pot clinics have boosted the demand That means the state spends millions of dollars trying to wipe out a plant thats already sanctionedThe Eyes Are WatchingFor decades a task force of lawmen has been parachuting into some of the most rugged sections of California For a week at a time they search for and destroy as much pot as they can find They call it the Campaign Against Marijuana Planting or CAMP On a recent day NPR joined CAMP in a helicopter to hunt for cannabis in Humboldt County in Northern CaliforniaIt takes a trained eye to see the plants because theyre hidden in the trees Circling over a dense stand of redwood trees we spot some Then we head for the landing zoneRetired Humboldt County Sheriffs Lt Steve Cobine says cultivating cannabis is now a big business in state forests and private timberlands It has a distinctive color  emerald green says Cobine You cant miss itWe hike to one of the places we spotted from the air clearing a path along the way with machetes Every few feet theres a marijuana plant There are rat traps set and poison to keep away any rodents from eating the plants And there are long drip lines  irrigation lines that water these plantsCobine says pot growers will camp out at illegal sites like this for months to secretly cultivate and harvest marijuana Sometimes they try to scare people away with mannequins or scarecrows wearing clothing It wakes you up says Cobine You never think youre alone At least I know I dontEyes could be watching at all times he says The growers run off and hide in the brush  though they cant get far But Cobine says CAMP rarely catches anyone in the act The growers are often armed and have been known to shoot at anyone who comes near Were always finding guns he says We found three last week in a garden One was a Beretta 9mm one was a government 45 automatic pistolAll Races Creeds ColorsMany of these illegal marijuana fields are the work of major drug cartels says Jack Nelsen a special agent with Californias Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement Its all races creeds colors he says Everyones growing Weve got it all going onNelsen says Asian drug trafficking organizations grow marijuana in national forests and Hispanic operations grow mostly on private lands Others grow marijuana in illegal indoor greenhousesWe used to call them guerrilla grows the white boy grows Nelsen says Those are generally smaller very highquality large plants  not thousands of plants like the Hispanic drug operationsAccording to Nelsen the socalled Hispanic drug cartels have upward of 100000 plants at any given grow Hispanic grows sometimes look like cornfields he says But the Asian drug trafficking organizations tend to plant on very very steep areasNelsen says the marijuana business exploded after California voters passed Proposition 215 The state now allows people to use medical marijuana with a doctors recommendation known as a 215 card Everyones got a medical recommendation in Humboldt County he says half joking Its the Humboldt County insurance policy You can carry 3 pounds in your car with a recommendation They thinkThe local and state legalities are quite confusing Nelsen says Because of the loopholes and especially in this county how liberal the view is on how many plants you can have and how much marijuana you can have in your house weve become an area many outofstaters flock to I call it the green rushLimited Police ResourcesLocal police say they dont have time or resources to arrest every smalltime marijuana grower in Humboldt District Attorney Paul Gallegos says hed rather go after the bigger growersOur priority is business people he says from his office in Eureka Calif If youre growing for yourself really thats against the law But why am I interested in that I still have to enforce the laws but youre low priority for meHumboldt County Sheriff Gary Philp says its difficult to track down the larger growers the cartels What are we gonna do if we arrest two or three people that are out there tending a garden that really arent the kingpins of it he asks Theyre just stuck there They dont know whose garden it really isDespite Humboldt being one of the biggest marijuana suppliers in the country Philp says he can only afford to assign one fulltime deputy in charge of drug enforcement With the limited resources were doing the best we can Philp says But a county such as ours were 3500 square miles  some very remote rugged areas  and were not under any misconception that were just out there getting all that stuff  I mean were making a dent but yeah its difficultPart Of Me Wants Marijuana LegalizedAs authorities try to crack down on illegal marijuana growers the demand for pot continues especially since medical marijuana is now legal in California But buying and selling is still illegal even at the pot dispensariesAnd the federally funded eradication continues This year CAMP hauled in 45 million plants from around California But Cobine admits thats a tiny percentage of whats really out thereWere just keeping a lid on it so it doesnt go crazy Cobine saysInstead of burning the confiscated plants like they used to do Sheriffs Sgt Wayne Hanson says they bury them in undisclosed locations Basically a marijuana plants 90 percent water he says So we dig a hole 10 feet down throw a bunch of soil on it and its basically destroyed then just by the compression of the earth As they haul off a truckload of confiscated plants Hanson makes a somewhat surprising admission Part of me wants marijuana legalized he says cause it would take away the wealth and the greed and the violenceBut he says it would have to be legalized in all of the US not just California Cause if it gets legalized in California youd have all the riffraff coming to California to make money to sell to the other 49 states he says Napa Valley Of PotBack in town some envision the day when Humboldt County becomes the center for weed connoisseurs a sort of Napa Valley of pot  College student Lydia Katz says he looks at the yearly CAMP eradication and thinks What a wasteWhen I see people that are just chopping it down and destroying marijuana I cry deep down inside Katz says outside a pot dispensary in Humboldt County I wish they understood exactly how much of a benefit this plant could bring to them to their loved ones and to the rest of the world Legalization would fix our economy in a secondKatz and others say its high time to decriminalize regulate and tax marijuana By some estimates its already the biggest cash crop in California Copyright 2014 NPR,20091201,marijuana

throughout the country including some of the many medical marijuana dispensaries in Los Angeles Decades after backtotheland hippies first moved to the rural area it remains a mecca for marijuana  At the plaza in downtown Arcata there are still wandering tiedyed souls playing guitar and bartering for handmade bongs They openly buy sell and trade small bags of primo weed Nick Larson and his buddy hitchhiked to town to see if the streets truly are paved with pot Weve heard stories all the way down Dude get down to Humboldt You gotta try their weed its amazing  he says So we get down here and people are like tossing handouts and were just like Oh my god Like whether it be trim or just straight buds its just amazing In Eureka the town next door a long line stretches outside the Humboldt Patient Resource Center  The pot dispensary is marked with the familiar green leaf logo and a Tibetan prayer flag Truth is that Humboldt County is one of the best growers and distributors of marijuana in the world says Lydia Katz whos 22 He came to stock up on what he calls his medicine People here understand how much a part of the lifes blood it is Truly without weed this county would go belly up Our economy depends on it Retired Sheriffs Lt Steve Cobine recalls that when logging and fishing jobs dried up in the late 1960s hippies moved in and bought the cheap leftover land  Youd see people living in tepees and tents and dead school buses and whatnot he says  Today he says the local counterculture pastime of growing marijuana has become a thriving business And now those people that were living in school buses own a nice big house and ski in Telluride every year GetRichQuick Economy Marijuana is now infused in almost every aspect of the regions economy In Humboldt County you see a glut of hydroponics stores selling fertilizer and grow lights for cultivating cannabis At the food coop you can order hemp milk and hemp butter Cafe Brio owner Serge Scherbatskoy says many transactions in town are made in cash We see a lot of hundreddollar bills in the cash register he says Theres a lot of money around so its good for a lot of businesses Scherbatskoy cant say that all the money comes from the marijuana trade  But he claims its the only job here that anyone really wants cause its real easy for somebody to make thousands and thousands of dollars and why would they want to work for 10 or 12 or 14 an hour College student Tara Devlin earns money to help pay her tuition She trims marijuana buds for medical marijuana collectives and illegal growers Ill work a couple months for a good amount of money she says Its always cash Humboldt County has lots of pot entrepreneurs One of them calls himself Bucky Buck He gets paid to convert homes into indoor marijuana operations or grows  It used to be like the Grateful Deadstyle hippie thing everyones peace and chill he says But now its more like these aggressive just transient kind of lifestyles Its not like the whole peace love and granola thing anymore Bucky Buck says Proposition 215 Californias medical marijuana law spawned a flurry of getrichquick businesses here And now he says its like you get people who arent here for the beauty and the love in the area Theyre just here to reap the profit  Our Neighborhoods Are Being Taken Over Walking down her street in Arcata Robin Hashem points out all the homes on her block that are now outfitted to grow marijuana  Theres a lot of electrical energy being used by grow houses she says So if you go by and look at the meter it will be spinning rapidly There are other telltale signs she says Windows covered with plastic people coming and going at all hours the smell of marijuana  If you look at this house theres mildew on the curtains she says pointing across the street Youre not gonna be having a house full of mildew and be there all the time You know theyre just not there on a regular basis They have the kids bikes out there all the time Its just making it really Oh were normal Nothing going on here Hashem says she believes in the compassionate use of marijuana She voted for Proposition 215 But shes had it with the grow houses that surround her Shes been lobbying the city to curb the spread a campaign she calls Nip It in the Bud Our neighborhoods are being taken over by illegal grows she says and we need to do something to stop it Mark Wheetley the mayor of Arcata says the grow houses are a menace With juryrigged electrical wires and toxic chemicals they sometimes catch fire And theyre easy targets for robbers Theyre either drug deals gone wrong or people trying to come in and either steal cash or marijuana from people Wheetley says A lot of it has been people from outside the community that have come in and see this as a quick way to make money So its kind of a Wild West mentality that we had to get out in front of and rope back in So why doesnt somebody pull the plug on the pot business That wouldnt be so easy in a place where marijuana is such an accepted part of life Authorities admit that the county has a lenient interpretation of whats legal under the states medical marijuana law          Anyone with a doctors order for marijuana  called a recommendation  can grow as much pot as they want in a 100squarefoot area But California narcotics special agent Jack Nelsen says some of the locals have gotten carried away They have anywhere from 10 to 100 to 200 plants and they think thats OK he says Because weve got 15 recommendations around the house for my dog my cat my cousin and my brother I Grow As Much As I Can Consume Surrounded by his pet ducks and boa constrictors a pot grower introduces himself as Mr Green He shows off the house he shares with his teenage daughter Past bouquets of marijuana drying like a canopy over the guest bed he enters his garage     Over there I fold my laundry he says Theres my washerdryer and over here I have my pot plants The garage is a jungle of marijuana plants growing yearround under emerald green grow lights  Its unlimited plants unlimited number of lights Its as much as you can cram into a 10by10 room or 100squarefeet of canopy says Mr Green If you stand above it and look down it looks like a sea of green Mr Green has a California 215 card which he says lets him grow his own medicinal marijuana The 46yearold carpenter claims he uses pot to relieve back pain But he hints that he also has buyers in Southern California   And Mr Green has plenty of marijuana  He has two other grow houses just like this He claims with more than a few chuckles that the three houses provide him with a years supply of medical marijuana I grow as much as I can consume in a year he says smiling Thats my story and Im sticking to it But even in Humboldt

NPR reporters have been following the Marines of Americas Battalion since they left North Carolinas Camp Lejeune in MayAt first they were eager to get into the fight against the Taliban chafing at the boredom of camp life in the desertNow after numerous firefights roadside bombs and the loss of more than a dozen comrades the Marines of Americas Battalion see warfare in a different lightOn a July morning Pfc Donald Vincent grabbed a pen and picked up his new journal He opened to the first page and wrote down these words in small neat scriptI have a patrol in a couple of hours I still havent had an opportunity to fire my weapon but Im sure its coming I have to say that its quite amazing out here We have pretty much gone from oasis to oasis Green fields of corn okra grapes and even marijuana And in the distance you can see the desert surrounding us Theres lots of life out here Some beautiful birds different lizards cats dogs and Ive even seen a couple of camels Well Im going to go for now Ill write more after the patrol Vincent never wrote another wordHe was shot and killed on that patrol The 26yearold from Gainesville Fla was the first Marine from Fox Company to die in AfghanistanLance Cpl Brad Stys was one of Vincents friends Sitting among other Marines from Fox Company in their tent Stys says he has not forgotten his friendI still look over there and still think I see his rack you know He should still be here Stys saysIn another tent across the patrol base 1st Sgt Derrick Mays sits on a cot under some camouflage netting He is the top enlisted man in Fox Company  an 18year Marine veteran   and he promised the parents back at Camp Lejeune that he would bring their sons home Now Mays grapples with what hell say to themThats one of the things that will probably forever haunt me he says looking awayWhat can you tell a parent of someone thats deceased he asks What I can do is give them my well wishes and always be there for themVincent wasnt the first loss for these MarinesJust days before one of the Marines Afghan interpreters  known as terps  was killed by a roadside bomb His nickname was JasonHe cooked Afghan meals for the Marines He always ran toward the head of the patrol ready to helpSgt Richard Lacey was blown forward by the blast that killed Jason The interpreter had stepped on a pressure plate a triggering device for a homemade bombThe terp got blown over the compound wall into a compound We had to go in and get him  He was basically JellO from the waist down Lacey saysThe interpreter left his parents a brother and a young sister in KabulLacey remembers how that night back at their base the Marines ate their rations in silenceNobody really talked It was just quiet he recallsThose first deaths changed everythingOnce that went off we were like yup this is not going to be all fun and games how we thought it was going to be at Leatherneck This is real Peoples lives are on the line Lacey says referring to the large desert base where the Marines were stationed for two months at the beginning of the summerAt Camp Leatherneck the Marines were bored living inside a large white tent that they called the circus tent They talked of Semper Kill getting some actionBack in June the Marines were just about to mount a massive operation to try to take back the Helmand River valley from the Taliban They couldnt wait Lt James Wende said at the timeMarines they want to go and they want to get into the fight so everyone was pretty much hoping for Afghanistan So well see  they say be careful what you wish for said Wende of San Antonio TexasLt Sam Oliver wanted to get into the fight tooI dont think youre ever in a hurry to get shot at But you want to get out and do what youve been trained to do You want to do your job Its like the firefighter who waits to get to go to a fire You dont necessarily want it but you want to see what all your training is for Oliver said at LeatherneckMore than four months later Wende and Oliver are different menWende is physically changed He was already tall and slim Yet hes shed about 30 pounds from the heat and constant foot patrols And theres almost a wistful smile as he thinks of his old self just a few months backI think you come into it expecting what you see on TV or in the movies And then the first time you take a casualty it really hits home how real this is You almost feel lost for a few moments until you regain yourself and regain control over whats happening around you Wende says nowThen theres Oliver the Marine who didnt want to get shot atNot only did he get shot at he stepped on a homemade bomb and was blown against a wall and lost consciousnessYou just kind of realize the whole thing like wow probably shouldve been dead on that one because the dude buried it 6 inches too deep because you were one foot in the wrong direction Theres been a lot of guys this deployment that it didnt work out for them he saysNow Oliver is at a small patrol base a mud compound that looks like a cross between a ruined castle and a giant anthill He is surrounded by cases of rounds and rocketsHe also remembers the boasting back at Camp Leatherneck in the early summerSome of it was more of the glory of it  For myself and a majority of the guys in my platoon it was that naive thing  This is going to be awesome  he saysIt was awesome  but not in the way they expectedPvt Joseph Salesky 23 of Yonkers NY describes it this wayI got the experience but its not how I wanted it to be  I didnt want any of us to get hit and I wanted to actually kill them But theyve been blowing us up They shot Vincent In Fox Company thats the only person that got hurt from a gunshot wound and died from it The squad mates of Pfc Donald Vincent one of the first of the Marines in Americas Battalion to have been killed on this deployment will give his journal  the one with the single entry  to his parentsThey all plan to write a few lines about him  how Vincent arrived at the

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2009/10/limbaugh_unloads_on_those_who.html?ft=3&f=,In nonBalloon Boy news conservative radio superstar Rush Limbaugh on Thursday took after his adversaries who killed his chances to be a minority owner of the National Football Leagues St Louis RamsAnd he doesnt leave unscorched Dave Checketts the leader of the investment group seeking to buy the NFL team who invited Limbaugh to come along for the ride only to throw him under the bus when the controversy eruptedAt the start of Thursdays show Limbaugh said Checketts came to his house and offered him an ownership stake earlier this year Limbaugh recalls asking Checketts at their second meeting if he and the other investors were ready to take the heat sure to come once it became public knowledge that Limbaugh was part of the group Checketts assured him they wereAnd adding to the sense that he was doublecrossed by Checketts Limbaugh says he was never told noted liberal philanthropist George Soros was one of Checketts partnersAn excerpt from the shows transcriptAre you aware of the firestorm this  Oh yes totally aware Rush and believe me I wouldnt have approached you if I hadnt taken care of that I would not have even come and asked you to be part of the group if I had not cleared your involvement with people at the highest levels of the National Football LeagueAnd my mistake at that point was not asking him All right do you really mean it and who did you speak to He gave me a couple of names that are pretty high up and led me to believe that it was all handled and that he was fully prepared for what was going to happen When the whole thing started to unravel last week whenever this thing leaked  and by the way I learned yesterday that George Soros might be in this group Reuters had a story that George Soros is one of Dave Checkettss partners I did not know that I wasnt told that Mr Checketts is not the primary partner here The NFL has a rule that the primary owner has to have 30 equity in the team and our group lost our 30 equity guy and we had to scramble and find a new one and I was told who it was but now Im wondering if it was Soros and I wasnt told Soros and Checketts did I have learned partner together previously to try to buy the Los Angeles Dodgers Mr Soros of course is well known politically for his leftwing slants his politics fit in perfectly apparently with what the National Football League is becoming But I wonder if they know that he is also involved in the movement to legalize marijuana and how that will play as the owners decide whether or not hes fit This is all speculative because I dont know that hes in the group Reuters reported it yesterdayBut Limbaugh was only working up to his crescendo That came when he started took after the highprofile African Americans who publicly spoke against his possible ownershipSo when this all started to unravel with the leaking of my being part of the group the predictable firestorm started and I said Are you guys prepared here Do you understand whats going on Oh yeah we want you to be a partner dont worry Rush I would not have gone this far if I hadnt wired this before I even spoke to you Now remember I did not seek them out they sought me out They came here to my home So eventually when DeMaurice Smith  and he may pronounce it DeMaurice Im not sure  DeMaurice Smith is the new executive director of the National Football League Players Association he sent a letter to the Commissioner Roger Goodell strongly objecting to my being anywhere near the National Football League on the basis that I dont unify Im a divider and divisive and this sort of thingThen of course the two race hustlers the Reverend Jackson and Reverend Sharpton got involved and I got a call on Tuesday night from Dave Checketts Im sorry I have to ask you to withdraw And I said I thought you had this wired I thought  Well Rush obviously Im sorry I feel terrible about this but we cant go forward with you in the group And I said Well Im not going to withdraw If you want me out you go public and fire me which he did He sent me a letter yesterday afternoon right after the program and told me that the announcement would come this morning and he wanted me to know that it was a very tough personal decision for him to make he had a lot of respect for me blah blah blah blah blah but when I got to the airport  Kathryn and I flew to Missouri last night for a family dinner in Cape Girardeau and I had to go to St Louis first to pick up some of the family then back down to Cape GirardeauBut Limbaugh wanted it known he was aware of who really was behind the whole debacle  President Barack ObamaAnd the real reason the real reason  and there are many many reasons that are valid but the real reason  that pressure was brought upon me by Sharpton and Jackson and DeMaurice Smith and the commissioner is that the Players Association is using my involvement in the Rams and this whole episode as a bit of leverage in their negotiations the upcoming negotiations with the league and with the owners on a new collective bargaining agreement That is whats really going on and the Players Association I dont know how many players know this but Mr Smith has let it be known that if he has to hell bring the White House into this Hell bring the Congressional Black Caucus into thisSo Obamas America is quite possibly going to include the National Football League and pressure from Obama the Congressional Black Caucus and other places might be brought to bear on the owners I cant imagine that thats anything they want You know as all businesses are theyre regulated to a certain extent by the federal government but this would be a huge expansion of that And that threat is being bandied about And I dont expect anyone to admit it The owners are not going to admit that They dont want to Im sure that the reaction to this today will be Ah Limbaugh doesnt know what hes talking about It will be another one of these things but that is one of the things that I do know is going on behind the scenes Copyright 2014 NPR,20091015,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/2009/10/10/113664067/narcocorridos-ballads-of-the-mexican-cartels?ft=3&f=,The news of Mexicos bloody cartel war is reflected in a controversial folkmusic genre called narcocorridos or drug ballads Theyre like journalism put to song  telling stories of drug lords arrests shootouts daring operations and betrayals Its a slow night on Calle del Taco in the border town of Reynosa Mexico Lovers sit in their vehicles eating tacos and sipping bottles of cold beer while the trios warm up musicians with scarred instruments wearing cowboy shirts buttoned tight across paunches and open at the top machismostyle In San Jose Costa Rica they took him prisoner now the whole world knows how the ballad begins of Rafael Caro Quintero the musicians croon in harmony Theyre singing an older narcocorrido about the 1985 arrest of a Mexican druglord who is also under indictment in the US for the torture and murder of DEA agent Enrique Kiki Camarena in Mexico The composer of The Ballad of Caro Quintero is one of Mexicos most prolific corridistas Reynaldo El Gallero Martinez  a 71yearold fightingcock breeder with a pencil mustache and a gamblers grin Hes with us tonight listening approvingly to this rendition of one of his most famous corridos The kids of Reynosa and Matamoros and many parts of Mexico learn the words to a corrido before they learn the National Anthem Martinez says He may be overstating it but its undeniable that the popularity of narcocorridos has tracked the spiraling cartel violence in Mexico More than 13500 people have been killed in drugrelated violence since President Felipe Calderon took office in 2006 Standing nearby guitarist Agustin Llamas says that if they dont sing narcocorridos out here on the Calle del Taco they wont make any money The people say Sing me a corrido about narcos with bullets and marijuana  Llamas says They dont want a bolero They want a narcocorrido Thats how it is here on the border Corridos have chronicled life and death in Mexico since the time of the Mexican Revolution Narcocorridos first came into vogue in the 1970s then exploded in the 1990s The more the cartels make news it seems the more songs there are about them To make his point Reynaldo Martinez took us to a music store on a busy downtown street in Reynosa The manager pointed out her bestselling CDs Lucrative Business On the covers are musicians in cowboy attire gripping AK47s  mimicking the traffickers they sing about Afterwards Martinez tries to explain Mexicans enduring fascination with stories about smugglers He compares the popularity of the narcocorridos with that of bullfights They always want to see the bull gore the matador Martinez says We always want the weak one to win And thats how we see the narcotraffickers But now that drug mafias like the Sinaloans La Familia and the Zetas have grown more powerful than the police or even the army theyre not the underdogs anymore The romanticizing of traffickers and the glorification of the drug trade has irritated the Mexican government to the point that narcocorridos are banned from the Mexican airwaves Theyre considered a bad influence on young people And so a curious flipflop has occurred Border Blasters The program Killer Corridos airs each afternoon on Radio Papalote in Edinburg Texas about 20 miles north of the Rio Grande Its one of the stations along the US side of the border that broadcasts prohibited corridos deep into Mexico Its the flip side of the famous border blasters that thrived in Mexican border towns from the 1930s through the 80s Highpowered transmitters broadcast preachers hucksters and rock n roll into the American heartland Disc jockey Jose Jaime Zavala says its dicey playing certain types of corridos  for example those that mention the name of a cartel or a particular trafficker A rival cartel might take offense Theres one called Suicide Bodyguards that tells of the Zetas Zavala says This is very dangerous to play on the radio because you dont know if someone is going to hear it and there will be reprisals The station owner told me to try to avoid strong corridos and so as a disc jockey I try to avoid them Occupational Hazards Though narcocorridos have created hits for dozens of bands throughout Mexico they create something of an occupational hazard More than a dozen Mexican musicians were murdered between 2006 and 2008 motives are shadowy but its suspected that some were killed for what they sang One was a 25yearold banda star from Sinaloa named Valentin Elizalde He was machinegunned in his car as he left a concert in Reynosa three years ago people suspect that one of his songs somehow offended the Gulf Cartel which controls this territory The murder of Elizalde sent a chill through the narcocorrido music business Martin Gamboa an upandcoming singer who lives in Matamoros says musicians have to be careful these days Many times you cant put certain words in a corrido he says What you have to do is use nuance so that you dont offend anybody Gamboa pauses And if any of my corridos has offended anyone I ask their pardon If you do put the name of a powerful drug lord in your song youd better be somebody like Chuy Quintanilla Hes a blustery 58yearold songster from Reynosa whose brother is the late narcocorrido superstar Beto Quintanilla Perhaps Chuys musical bravado has something to do with the fact that he used to be a federal judicial police commander a position in Mexico that is ascribed godlike powers In the current climate of caution Chuy belts out corridos other artists wouldnt whisper For instance his Corrido of Tony Tormenta tells the story of Antonio Tony Tormenta Cardenas  the current chief of the murderous Gulf Cartel Yet Chuy doesnt like calling them narcocorridos Lets do away with the term narcocorrido its vulgar he says A narco is a person whos guilty of a crime that you or I cant ascertain Only a judge can say No Chuy Quintanilla writes corridos about current events Time will tell Tony Tormenta is currently on Mexicos most wanted list and under indictment by the DEA Copyright 2014 NPR,20120731,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113350636&ft=3&f=,In Mexico the governments threeyear war against drug cartels has claimed more than 11000 lives snared thousands of alleged criminals and brought down scores of politicians One of the newer drug cartels being pursued by President Felipe Calderons administration is La Familia  a group that mixes politics spiritualism and violence in ways never before seen in Mexico La Familia was born in the rugged impoverished hills of Michoacan a southern state that stretches from the Pacific Ocean through the Sierra Madre almost to the capital Mexico City In the port of Lazaro Cardenas vendors sell pirated movies and CDs at makeshift stalls along the main street Further inland methamphetamine labs and marijuana patches are tucked into the densely forested mountains Michoacan has become a flash point in Calderons battle against organized crime Recently Mexican authorities paraded Miguel Angel Beraza Villa known as The Truck before the media Beraza is accused of being one of the top leaders of La Familia Mexican prosecutors say he moved a halfton of methamphetamine into the United States each month  To arrest Beraza heavily armed federal commandos stormed a church in a small city in central Michoacan in the middle of Mass Two Blackhawk helicopters hovered overhead The Family Unlike some of the Mexican cartels that have existed for decades La Familia burst into the headlines in 2006 when one of its members threw five severed heads onto a dance floor in Morelia the capital of Michoacan Tensions between the Mexican authorities and La Familia escalated this summer when the government arrested dozens of local politicians accusing them of working for the cartel Then in July cartel gunmen abducted 12 federal police officers and dumped their tortured bodies in a pile by the side of a highway La Familia originally claimed to be a local defense force protecting Michoacan from neighboring drug traffickers But it has since grown into one of the most extensive criminal enterprises in the country This cartel is trying to capture the hearts and minds of the population says Jorge Chabat a security expert at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Mexico City He says La Familia is unique in that it claims to be working for the good of the local people The group runs ads in newspapers and leaves messages particularly at murder scenes declaring that it is cleaning up Michoacan It combines some selfhelp techniques with spiritualism and some apparently family values and moral values  which is a kind of contradiction because these guys are very violent Chabat says The cartel takes drug addicts rehabilitates them and turns them into drug dealers The name La Familia  The Family  suggests that these guys are presenting themselves as some sort of moral order criticizing the disorder that prevails in Mexican society Chabat says He says theyre trying to act like a government  even imposing taxes And this is part of the reason Calderons administration has gone after them so aggressively A Shadow Over The City Michoacan has what every drugtrafficking organization in the world covets  a major transportation corridor linking the supplier of its product directly to its primary market The port of Lazaro Cardenas is one of the largest on the Pacific Coast and a rail line operated by Kansas City Southern runs from its modern docks all the way to Laredo Texas But this isnt a normal port town Tension is in the air here Federal police patrol the streets in dark blue pickups The mayor is in prison accused of working for La Familia The citys congressman  who happens to be the governors brother  is a fugitive from justice The afternoon edition of the newspaper La Noticia de Michoacan spins through the presses in a small garage just off the main street But you wont find investigative articles in this or any of the other local papers about organized crime Francisco Rivera Cruz the editor of La Noticia de Michoacan inherited the job last year when his predecessor was gunned down and dumped in a ditch Rivera says they dont investigate issues around crime or security And they only report information that is released by the police The whispered explanation for the previous editors murder is that he moved too aggressively to cover a grenade attack on a crowd of Independence Day revelers last year Authorities pointed fingers at La Familia but the cartel hung up banners blaming its rival the Zetas for the grenades that killed eight people and injured more than 100 others Manuel Gutierrez a pastor at a Pentecostal church in Lazaro Cardenas says life in the city is difficult right now I dont think this is the only city but maybe one of the most important cities because of the port he says Its a really big door to the country  to Mexico People are afraid to go out after dark he says and the drug trade hangs like a shadow over the city Beyond Drugs Federal prosecutors say La Familias influence goes far beyond narcotics The cartel dominates the sale of pirated DVDs which are for sale everywhere in Mexico They move migrants hoping to get into the United States And like many other criminal groups facing cashflow problems in the midst of the current drug war they run kidnapping and extortion rackets A man who sells tamales on the street from a large stainless steel pot says he was held for four days in a house in Lazaro Cardenas He doesnt want his name disclosed for fear of retaliation   He says about a dozen other people were being held in the house and his captors regularly beat them You could hear the screaming of all the people he says and there were two people whod been shot dead there Eventually his family came up with the 100000 peso ransom his captors were demanding Thats about 7500  a small fortune for a tamale vendor   He says comerciantes  people selling things on the streets  have to pay rent to the local gangs Vendors and shopkeepers

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111783991&ft=3&f=,Its been more than a dozen years since California became the first state in the nation to legalize marijuana for medical use In some California cities cannabis dispensaries are springing up like well weeds But in more conservative communities patients have a harder time finding legal marijuana That difficulty has led a group of senior citizens in Orange County to start setting up a pot collective in their luxury retirement community Identifying A New Need For decades Leisure Worlds resort lifestyle has attracted retirees to its swimming pools and golf greens tennis courts and dance halls Resident Margo Bouers passion is synchronized swimming  The waters magnificent Bouer said Im me in the water This is what keeps me alive Bouer 73 is one of the younger members of the Aquadettes a synchronized swimming group in Laguna Woods Calif A retired nurse she moved to Leisure World  also known as Laguna Woods Village  16 years ago For Bouer water is more than fun  it means relief from multiple sclerosis In the water she doesnt shake or lose her balance need a walker or worry about a new symptom that began last year Suddenly Id have a wave of nausea she said And from that wave Id vomit and Id vomit from the tip of my toes all the way up And I had no clue as to what was going on In April a physician neighbor encouraged Bouer to go to a meeting about medical marijuana She says it was a stretch for her  a former psychiatric nurse whose generation considered cannabis little more than a gateway to harder drugs But she went and then she experimented  That night Im sitting out on my balcony she recalled That wave of nausea came I lit that pipe and I just held it in my mouth afraid to even inhale But I held it in my mouth blew it out like that she said inhaling and exhaling I was so preoccupied Now whats happened she remembers thinking Well what happened is that nothing happened except that I wasnt nauseated Medical Background Dr Bill Schwied 88 is the neighbor who encouraged Bouer to find out about cannabis The only risk involved is the legal risk which is very frightening to many doctors and patients Schwied said There have not been enough studies conducted to evaluate the full medical risks of marijuana especially on the elderly There is risk of developing dependence on the drug Both the American Medical Association and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society say there is a need for more research in the field Meanwhile 13 states now approve the medical use of marijuana But the federal government still classifies the plant as an illegal Schedule I controlled substance with no accepted medical use  a category it shares with cocaine and heroin  But Schwied sees that marijuana has obvious benefits  I dont think it cures everything but its one approach in medicine that the medical profession has kind of ignored he says The retired doctor and nurse have become vocal advocates for elderly use of medical marijuana Since the spring theyve appeared publicly at community meetings Spreading The Word Speaking at a recent forum Margo described her own experience For the first time the nausea dissipated she said I sat there and waited for it and I felt relaxed and I thought Well itll probably return during the night But guess what I slept like a log More than 200 seniors turned out for the panel discussion on medical marijuana at the retirement community this past June No one spoke against it  These days getting a doctors recommendation for medial marijuana is easy Its getting the cannabis that can be a problem for the seniors Laguna Woods passed an ordinance allowing dispensaries a year ago but so far retail property owners have refused to lease to any marijuana businesses  So the retirees are forming their own nonprofit medical marijuana collective A small group of them has been meeting to study their options under the law  At a recent session one man suggested that the group distribute not merely doses of medical marijuana but the plants themselves We could give them these little plants that they could put on their balcony that wont take much room at all he said and they would be able to have medicine available in like 60 days The Question How Legal Is Legal While some dispensaries charge 20 a gram or 600 an ounce the seniors say they want their collective to charge only enough to cover their costs The Orange County District Attorneys office wouldnt comment on the legality of marijuana collectives  The Laguna Woods collective is getting legal advice But even if they follow the letter of Californias law  which permits doctorrecommended use of cannabis and allows patients to legally buy it or grow their own  the retirees are still taking a risk according to Don Duncan California director for Americans for Safe Access  The federal government typically doesnt target medical cannabis patients Duncan said But if one or more of these patients want to join together into a collective or cooperative there is a substantial legal risk in providing that service to the community Duncan said that although he sees the risk as being lower under the Obama administration until the federal law changes theres always a chance that somebody could be arrested or indicted That possibility doesnt deter Margo Bouer Ill be a test case she said What are they going to do throw me in jail A 73yearold person with MS If that happens Bouer is likely to have a lot of elderly supporters Her group recently held a community meeting to announce

the chance Keanu Reeves has had a much more interesting career than youd think In fact if you look at his resume hes bounced around from genre to genre as much as almost any actor youre going to encounterHes done action movies Point Break Speed obviously The Matrix hes done overwrought dramas The Devils Advocate hes done romantic melodrama Sweet November The Lake House A Walk In The Clouds hes done highly respectable awardwinners Dangerous Liaisons My Own Private Idaho hes done Shakespeare Much Ado About Nothing hes done goofball farce Bill  Teds Excellent Adventure hes done light romantic comedy The Replacements and hes done middlebrow crowdpleasing comedy Parenthood Somethings Gotta GiveHes actually kind of a fascinating guy even if Im as fond as anyone of yelling Cans There was no baby It was full of cans Thank you thank you See here starting at about the 620 mark for the originalAnd the first movie where people really talked about him was Rivers Edge which won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Film in 1987 beating out not only The Big Easy starring Dennis Quaid but also John Sayles MatewanHow does it look more than 20 years later Wellit looks for lack of a more precise word very very weirdIn fact its appropriate that this is the movie Crispin Glover was promoting when he made his famous apparently unhinged appearance on what was then Late Night With David Letterman on NBC because unhinged doesnt even begin to describe itA kick in the head advice from a fashion genius why Dennis Hopper didnt need a blowup doll and more after the jumpThe basic idea of the movie is an interesting if horrifying one Several high school friends learn that their buddy John Daniel Roebuck who played Arzt on Lost has killed his girlfriend and left her nude body on a riverbank In fact they all go down there and have a look But at first nobody calls the police Paralyzed by an odd combination of fear loyalty and a lack of interest in getting mixed up in it they look at her body and then walk away and leave it thereTheres certainly an interesting thought here and the potential to look at the odd social dynamics of high school the panicky way people react to situations for which they are completely unprepared desensitization to violence and so forthButwell do you know the Coco Chanel rule about how a woman should get dressed look in the mirror and take off one accessory before she leaves the house The idea is that you will almost always overdo it on your first try and that second passes are there partly to force you to do a little lessMovies would often be wise to take exactly the same step except that in the case of Rivers Edge they would have had to take off not one thing but about ten or fifteen affectations that only serve to distract from that interesting little nut of a storyThe most obvious is Glovers performance as the groups leader Layne which is best understood as a mashup of the way he played George McFly in Back To The Future and the way he behaved with David Letterman Yes hes supposed to be a speed addict but every line reading is so hyper and hes chewing on every word so hard that the theater fills with giggles The performance is a perfect example of the difference between the best acting and the most acting hes certainly working hard enough but it looks ridiculousYou can see for yourself in this clip caution language Its tempting to say the acting is terrible except that hes clearly doing it on purpose He means it to be exactly like that and whether you like it or not thats the characterization hes chosen for Layne who  I would stress  is in a movie not meant to be a comedy much as that clip may lead you to believe otherwise So its not inept acting so much as a huge miscalculation on everyones partThe second problem is the character of Feck played by Dennis Hopper Feck is the local pot supplier and Laynes pal and here are his notable qualities 1 He socializes with a blowup doll 2 He has only one leg 3 He plays the saxophone 4 He once killed a woman It is way way too much even for Dennis Hopper Either the blowup doll or the artificial leg on the reclusive drug source not both To return to Chanel thats not merely a shiny brooch and a shiny pendant thats stacking two hats on your headAs if that isnt enough Reeves character Matt has a twelveyearold brother who appears to be possibly the most disturbed person in the movie and at one point winds up stalking Matt with a gun for reasons only tangentially related to the rest of the story but of course designed to drive home even harder the theme of misdirected violent coldhearted youthAnd so from this tiny promising idea of how its possible that a bunch of kids might view a body without telling anyone  an idea inspired by a true though very different story  the movie turns into an overproduced and selfimportant parade of grotesque tics Hopper trembles Glover spaces out the twelveyearold narrows his eyesand at the center of the movie Reeves and a 15yearold Ione Skye making her screen debut play the two relatively normal kids who obviously arent going to be able to live forever with the knowledge they now haveTheres an effort here to say something serious about violence and alienation and perhaps the smoking a lot of marijuana but its all so excessive and there are so many diversions of the audiences attention that the basic horror of the situation  which shouldnt need adornment unless youre inadequately horrified by the simple fact of a body remaining on a riverbank while no one does anything  is undermined

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104399569&ft=3&f=,Along with an escort guard Thomas and Amanda Flynn walked out of the building towards the gatehouse Thomas in front of Amanda his heavy steps indenting the mud beneath his feet  Inmates between classes and lunch were moving from unit to unit their arms behind their backs one hand holding the wrist of the other accompanied by a guard carrying a twoway radio  All of the boys were black  Flynn had seen one Hispanic kid waxyeyed and wired on meds on his last visit so maybe there were a few Spanish here too but that was immaterial to him  What weighed on him was that Chris was the sole white inmate of the facility My son here with all these Flynn stopped himself before ugly words spelled themselves out in his head    He rang the bell on the door at the rear of the gatehouse looking through bars and Plexiglas to get the attention of one of two uniformed women behind the counter  Like most of the female guard staff Flynn had seen here these women were wide and generously weighted in the legs and hips  He and his wife were buzzed in and passed through the same security aisle similar to those used in airports theyd entered  Neither of the guards looked at the couple nor spoke to them as Flynn and Amanda collected their keys and cells They exited the gatehouse and walked along the chain link and razor wire fence to Amandas SUV parked in the staff and visitors lot  They did not talk  Amanda was thinking of going to early mass on Sunday and lighting a candle for Chris  Flynn as he often did was thinking of what had gone wrong By Flynns reckoning he had begun to lose his son somewhere in Chriss freshman year of high school  At the time Chris was playing football and CYO basketball getting decent grades attending Sunday school and mass  He was also smoking marijuana shoplifting fighting other boys and breaking into cars and lockers  This was all happening at the same time when Chris was about fifteen  Flynn began to refer to his son as if he were two people Good Chris and Bad Chris  By the age of sixteen only Bad Chris remained As a teenager and into his twenties Flynn had blown his share of marijuana so he detected Chriss use right away  Flynn could see the high in Chriss eyes the way he would laugh inappropriately at violent images on the television screen or his sudden interest in their lab mix Darby playing tug of war or wrestling him to the ground something he would never do while straight  Of course there was the smell that always hung in Chriss clothing and when he had copped that unmistakable skunky odor of fresh bud in his bedroom  It didnt bother Flynn horribly that his son smoked marijuana  In fact he told Chris that he had no moral objection to it but felt that it was basically a waste of time  That for an already marginal student like Chris it could impede his progress  What bothered Flynn what had become alarming was that Chris began to smoke marijuana at the exclusion of everything else  He stopped playing sports  He stopped going to mass and hanging out with his church friends  He quit his job at the coffee shop in Friendship Heights  His grades edged towards failure  He seemed not to care about the loss or what his degeneration was doing to his parents  Amanda still thought of Chris as her little boy and couldnt bring herself to discipline him like a young man  Plus she was certain that the Lord would step in and when He deemed it appropriate blow the black clouds away and give Chris the wisdom to get back on the righteous path  Flynns response was elemental and not carefully considered  He believed in Darwin over fairy tales and aimed to reinforce his position as the alpha dog of the house  He put Chris up against the wall more than once raised his closed fist and walked away before punching him  So Chris knew that his father was willing to cross the line and kick his ass but the knowledge did nothing to alter his behavior  He didnt care Chris was charged with possession of marijuana  The arresting officer did not show up for court and the charge was dropped  Chris got in a fight at school and was suspended  He strongarmed a fellow student for his Walkman on school property and was expelled for the remainder of the year  He received community service time  Chris and his friend Jason were caught on camera looting the lockers of their high school basketball team while the players were at practice and were arrested and charged  An adjudicatory hearing was pending  Chris was videotaped vandalizing and stealing from cars in the back lot of a Mexican restaurant  His father paid off the owners of the restaurant and the owners of the vehicles thereby avoiding the involvement of police  And then there were the final charges and conviction that led to his incarceration assault possession with intent to distribute leaving the scene of an accident reckless driving driving on the sidewalk fleeing and eluding police  With each succeeding incident with each visit to the Second District station on Idaho Avenue to pick up his son Flynn grew more angry and distant From the book THE WAY HOME by George

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103866520&ft=3&f=,Its common knowledge that marijuana is one of Americas biggest cash crops  In 2008 law enforcement confiscated more than 5 million plants in California alone   Whats less known is that much of that pot is grown on public lands  And increasingly the covert pot farms are moving into pristine lands  even parks   Marijuana cultivation has been found in more than a halfdozen national parks on the West Coast the latest to join the list is North Cascades National Park in northern Washington state where a farm was raided last summer  In Yosemite one of the crown jewels of the national park system park rangers are constantly searching for new pot farms  Just a few miles from El Capitan and other popular tourist spots Special Agent Steve Yu and Park Ranger Chris Kuvlesky are sneaking through the ponderosa pine  Theyre on what they call a creep a stealthy hike through an area thats been used in the past by pot growers  They step carefully because even the snapping of a dry branch could be enough to telegraph their presence to growers who might be hiding in these woods   Pot farms tend to follow the same rough design terraces cut into a remote hillside with some trees and bushes left standing to provide cover from the air  An irrigation hose taps the nearest creek at one Yosemite pot farm raided in 2007 the hose ran for nearly a mile  buried and camouflaged the whole way  Yu admits he has a grudging respect for the effort that goes into these gardens I dont know how these guys do it he says referring to the growers who live out in these woods all summer carrying in hundreds of pounds of food fertilizer and chemicals and living under tarps  When we get the handcuffs on them when we get our hands on them it feels like these guys are carved out of oak A Major Drug Enterprise Relatively few of the marijuanatenders are caught  At the first sign of trouble they usually slip away through the brush  Thats the main reason these pot farms are on public land Its easy to cut and run But law enforcement agencies are learning more about these marijuana gardens  For one thing theyre not standalone projects  Investigators say pot farms in parks and national forests are often part of larger networks   A recent Drug Enforcement Administration investigation of a Mexican crime familys alleged crystal methamphetamine ring led agents to discover that the family also had a marijuanagrowing operation on the side  They call it a major enterprise a Seattlebased DEA agent anonymous here because he works undercover says it stretched across several Western states They had a plan in place they had stash houses they had living places for people and they had people whose role was just to provide food  Each person had their little skill set that they applied to the job and the leaders never got their hands dirty the agent says The agent says family members  most of them Mexican citizens  drove in from around the country to help with the farms  They moved up the West Coast in a wave following the spring planting season as it moved north   The DEA says the family  known as the Barragans  has been known to drug enforcement for decades both in Los Angeles and in Mexico  Some of the Barragans are now in federal custody near Seattle awaiting federal trial  Their lawyer would not make them available for comment Middle Managers In The Marijuana Ring Arnold Moorin the DEAs special agent in charge in Seattle says the people running these pot farms are just middle managers Its all controlled by the Mexican cartels in Mexico where the command and control sits he says But other DEA officials are reluctant to use the word cartel Gordon Taylor is the DEAs assistant special agent in charge in Sacramento and he has years of experience investigating pot farms in California  He says the largescale farms on public land are run by networks Most of these groups are headed by Mexican nationals that live in the United States illegally he says   But he stops short of calling them cartels   When I hear somebody use the term drug cartels what that means is the identified drug cartels that are operating down in Mexico Taylor says  We have not seen direct evidence tying the marijuana gardens on public lands to the cartels down in Mexico Those who have experience with the pot farms also draw a distinction between the bosses and the workers   Most of them are poor people from large families in Michoacan says Tim Zindel a federal public defender in Sacramento who has represented many of the garden tenders caught by federal law enforcement  He calls them disposable workers  campesinos who sometimes barely know where they are A FastMoving Threat Still their growing presence in the backcountry intimidates people who spend a lot of time there people like Chris a graduate student who asked not to share his last name  In 2007 while doing fieldwork in Californias Plumas National Forest he accidentally uncovered a hidden irrigation hose  He looked up and saw an armed man heading his way He held the gun at his side and he said Come here  Chris said   Chris tried to tell the man he didnt care what the hose was for but it became clear the man didnt understand much English  Chris remembers him having an air of malice The fact that he was hiding the gun from me like he wasnt trying to scare me like he was trying to get me to go there I would have preferred if hed pointed the gun at me Chris says Chris ran and caught a lucky break when the man lost his footing  Even before his close call Chris was concerned about the presence of hidden pot farms in the Sierra foothills  He says it even influences where he decides to do fieldwork That level of insecurity has not taken hold yet in the national parks  The chief ranger in Yosemite Steve Shackelton says he believes his staff is holding the line People coming to Yosemite shouldnt fear this problem  Our job is to ensure that their visit is a safe visit and we will ensure that  We do ensure that he says At the same time hes worried  In the national forest next to Yosemite the pot farms have become almost commonplace  He has seen the effects over there  erosion pesticides garbage dumps  and he considers the pot farms a fastmoving threat to one of Americas most beloved national parks

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104019056&ft=3&f=,The Flight and Plight of the Monarch From Chapter 5 INDEPENDENCE DAY IN MEXICO SEPTEMBER 2008 Grenades were lobbed into the celebrating crowd in Morelias downtown capital of Michoacan hometown of Mexican president Felipe Calderon On this national holiday there are cowards hidden in the crowds of patriotic people that have converted joy into sadness and the happiness of Mexican families into sorrow Calderon said after the attack explosions that killed maimed and emptied Morelia of its tourists It was a shattering blow to Morelia a city that celebrates the Monarch because it is a staging ground for butterfly tours into the mountains a few hours distance  The next month Im in Morelia en route to the nearby Monarch overwintering grounds high in the Michoacan mountains Taxi drivers and restaurant waiters hotel desk clerks and passersby I encounter in the streets all express despair about the attacks The shock to the citys economy is secondary the targeting of innocents in their usually peaceful city has them dumbfounded Across the street from my hotel in the charming Spanish Colonial downtown is the eighteenthcentury cathedral with its wedding cake steeples and the park where two of the grenades exploded Its a perfect autumn day the sky clear and blue accented with puffy white clouds kissing the nearby mountains Bloody tragedy seems far distant An ad hoc memorial and scars on the sidewalks are the only physical reminders of the blasts otherwise life goes on families stroll lovers embrace the shoeshine men wait for customers The memorial is a circle of dried stalks along with flowers arranged on the paving stones along with two wreaths of flowers on easels Candles and a card showing an image of Jesus with Mary are set amid the flowers A handwritten note is amongst the offerings It is weathered and torn covered with candle wax but a few words are still legible Viviremos siempre en los corazones de la gente que nos amo en vida We will live forever in the hearts of the people who loved us when they were alive  Passersby slow as they walk past the memorial and say a few hushed words to each other before continuing on Periodic army patrols pass the square an armored personnel carrier equipped with a machine gun and a pickup truck  the bed of the truck filled with heavily armed soldiers and a machine gun mounted on the roof of the cab manned by a gunner There is a war going on in Mexico under the still placid facade of Morelias sidewalk cafes and their guacamole and huchepos hot chocolate and cerveza The attack on the zocalo the massacres in border cities of police prosecutors and soldiers  along with alleged drug traffickers  are manifestations of the illegal drug business But the same type of terror plagues the Monarch grounds where the currency is valuable trees illegally logged instead of marijuana and cocaine methamphetamine and heroin Before heading into the mountains I stop at the Palacio del Gobierno for a meeting at which the Michoacan governor Leonel Godoy gives the introductory remarks There is a cup of coffee on the dais in front of him its traditional local pottery adorned with a delicate painted butterfly Its official state tableware After the meeting I walk out of the building and think for a moment I see an early Monarch only its late October and their scheduled arrival date is El Dia de los Muertes November 1 It is lively fluttering around the governors grounds but it is yellow not Monarch orange and the only Monarchs I see in Morelia are pictures decorating the states license plates and illustrating the sign in my hotel that suggests I save water by sleeping in yesterdays sheets and drying myself with this mornings wet towel The strangebuttrue story of the Monarch lures and mystifies butterfly aficionados from grammar school children to wizened entomological specialists The North American Monarch living east of the Continental Divide doesnt only magically change from a clowncolored caterpillar to a majestic butterfly it defies logic with a multigenerational ultralongdistance commute that transits Canada the United States and Mexico The navigational details remain a mystery  no one knows for sure how they plan their route from the northeast of North America to the few specific mountaintops where they winter in one central Mexico neighborhood Tropical Monarchs live their summers as far north as Canada As winter approaches they migrate south to Mexico where they hibernate en masse  millions jammed per acre  in Michoacan and the state of Mexico in an isolated range of the Sierra Madre the mountains made famous in the 1948 film The Treasure of the Sierra Madre starring Humphrey Bogart It was Bogart who asked a Mexican bandit posing as a Federale for his badge eliciting the classic line Badges We aint got no badges We dont need no badges I dont have to show you any stinkin badges That lawlessness is a reality that unfortunately plagues the Monarch overwintering grounds to this day In spring the warming weather rouses the Monarchs They mate as they head back north an activity that quickly kills off the male But unlike the direct trip south the journey north takes a few generations The Monarchs that made the long trip south and spent the winter in Mexico only make it as far as Texas and Louisiana The gravid eggbearing females stay alive long enough to find a suitable locale for their eggs whatever milkweed they can find  this being the plant food that both nourishes their larvae and fills the caterpillars and the butterflies they eventually become with the poison that makes them unpalatable for most potential predators This next generation ecloses in short order and continues the trek north toward the Great Lakes where they lay their eggs Soon their offspring head toward the East Coast and it is their progeny who make the long haul  as far as three thousand miles  back to Mexico This is an annual event it takes four or five shortlived generations for the broods to make it north and then before winter sets in the Mexicobound generation  which lives several months  makes the epic journey south  How do these butterflies  greatgrandchildren of the Monarchs who flew to Mexico the year before  know where to go and how to get there That is still a fascinating and delightful mystery theories include a role played by the position of the sun and another by the Earths magnetic force The excellent eyesight of the Monarch is a navigation factor the visual cues interpreted by the butterflys pinheadsized brain Favorable winds and air currents help make for a successful trip along with plenty of luck Those are theories of how they fix their route How they know  generations separated from the ancestors who last were in Mexico  where their destinations are located remains a phenomenal mystery  There are Monarchs elsewhere making similar but not quite so epic journeys Those west of the North American Continental Divide for example head down the California coast and find a comfortable staging place for the winter Some of them cluster near my home in Sonoma County hanging together on imported Australian eucalyptus and local Monterey cypress trees in the Bodega Dunes park Others go farther south Pacific Grove calls itself Butterfly Town USA and threatens fines of up to 1000 for harassing any of the thousands of Monarchs that overwinter in the Monterey Bay city  Reprinted with permission of The Lyons PressGPP Guilford Conn Copyright 2014

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103928878&ft=3&f=,As Supreme Court Justice David Souter fades into the sunset of quirkily Hawthorneesque New England character types the Obama administration must gear itself up for what is likely to be its first significant fight Yes those of us on the left have cause for relief that this lifetenure opportunity bestows after a long drought the gift of a justice with wisdom and mercy But the Supreme Court decides issues that will shape the course of American law for generations all the favorite hotbutton litmus test issues of the foreseeable future will be negotiated by the judiciary sooner or later immigration reproductive rights surveillance and wiretapping equal pay the power of unions the right to privacy particularly in stillnascent technological fields like genetic snooping and discrimination not just on the basis of race ethnicity or religion but also in the fields of disability access lending laws and health insurance If there is any unanimity in the Republican Party the Supreme Court is the one area where its fiercest passion will be manifest  As of this writing the names circulated as Souters most likely replacement are all thoughtful wellinformed spectacularly wellqualified women Solicitor General Elena Kagan Second Circuit Judge Sonia Sotomayor and Seventh Circuit Judge Diane Wood This is good news but still no one should underestimate the contest that the choice will engender  On one side of the ring is the chair of the Judiciary Committee Senator Patrick Leahy As an oldstyle Kennedytype Vermont liberal he voted against President George W Bushs ultimately successful nomination of Alabama Attorney General William Pryor to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in 2004 Pryor an avid proponent of states rights actively opposed almost every major piece of civil rights legislation of the 1960s and beyondfrom voting rights to disability rights to reproductive rights including the Supreme Courts decision in Roe v Wade  Nevertheless Leahys opposition to Pryor somehow converted him and other Democrats into the convenient target of a Republican campaign characterizing opposition to Pryor as antiCatholic Culmination That infamous confrontation on the Senate floor when Leahy expressed outrage at being called a bad Catholic and Cheney hurled a retort that is multifariously remembered as to its grammatical embellishment but unanimously agreed to have included at least two crucial words to wit fuck and yourself  On to the other side of the ring stands Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III the distinguished senator from Alabama Pryor replaced Sessions as Alabamas attorney general when Sessions was elected to the Senate in 1996 That one could stand in for the other is not a surprise Pryor and Sessions share a certain sensibility although Sessions has been even more colorfully intrepid than anyone in our narrative thus far For example Sessions is alleged to have called the NAACP unAmerican and to have said that he didnt think the Ku Klux Klan was so badat least not until it was revealed that some of that august membership might have smoked marijuana  To make a long story short Senator Sessions is now the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee and so will lead the partys packattack upon whichever candidate President Obama puts forward Sessions achieved that heady status only days ago when Arlen Specter renounced his Republican Party membership and became a bornagain Democrat losing his committee seniority Serving as secondranking members on the Democratic and Republican sides respectively are Herbert Kohl of Wisconsin and Orrin Hatch of Utah who along with Leahy and Specter were members of the committee when Anita Hill testified at the Clarence Thomas hearings  Recently Senator Specter said that not a day goes by that Republican colleagues dont take him to task for voting against Robert Borks nomination in 1987 The residual bitterness from that battle has lived on to such a degree that the word Borking has worked its way into the Oxford English Dictionary with a decidedly partisan cast meaning to savage to vilify to defame This definition reflects Borks fury about the opposition he faced from every major civil rights and womens group The grounds for that opposition were summarized in a briefing book that Bork called world classscurrility That brief was known as The Biden Reportso named because Joe Biden was chair of the Judiciary Committee at the time  All this is to say that there is history among these players and axes to grind Appointing a Supreme Court justice is one of the most important powers of the presidency and given the delicate balance of its current makeup there is much at stake My choice would be Elena Kagan She is a graduate of Princeton and Harvard Law School and also holds a masters degree in philosophy from Oxford Kagan is a superlative administrative law scholar and extremely well respected by a wide constituency of viewpoints She began her academic career as a tenured professor at the University of Chicago Law School hardly a bastion of liberal thought From there she moved on to Harvard where she became its first female deanand a highly effective one to boot which is even more of an accomplishment considering the famously fractious nature of that faculty Recently Obama named her solicitor general of the United Statesand again she became the first woman to hold that post Most important I believe that Kagan has the intellect the toughness and the fairmindedness to be a great justice She also has the dignity commanding knowledge and quickwittedness to rise above or duck below whatever recombinant ugliness the assembled partisans are likely to lob her way during the confirmation process  Copyright 2014 The Nation,20090508,marijuana

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103276152&ft=3&f=,Theres a surge of public interest in legalizing marijuana as a partial answer to a host of problems Last week Mexicos congress debated legalizing cannabis as a way to undermine cartel income And when President Obama held his online town hall last month he was swamped with the question Why not legalize pot as a way to help the economy NPR came up with a hypothetical scenario and asked experts to play along commenting on their imagined outcomes The scenario Marijuana has been legal for two years throughout the US It is treated in the eyes of the law similar to alcohol It is taxed and regulated and users must be 21 or older Pot smokers can buy it by the gram at licensed dispensaries Predictably the law change would make some people very happy  and others deeply concerned    Imagine if you turned on the radio and heard this From NPR News in Washington Im Carl Kasell After 70 years of prohibition marijuana becomes legal today for personal consumption throughout the United States for persons 21 and older  How would the world change if cannabis finally came out of the closet if it were fully legal to possess sell and cultivate Willie Nelson the 76yearold iconic balladeer and cannabis connoisseur says there are pros and cons  We dont worry about going to jail anymore for smoking it he says But a lot of our old friends who dealt it are out of work In Austin Texas the legal cannabis created a surge in business at head shops such as Oat Willies  Theres the most popular one the Volcano says Doug Brown the stores longtime general manager pointing to a conical device that is supposed to provide a milder smoking experience Its very expensive  575  and theyre hard to get hold of  In the two years since legalization Brown has noticed new customers many of whom are older  More affluent people more fun people  people that have never done it before but have decided to try it since its now legalized he says   One of the new marijuana epicures is Sarah Bird a middleaged novelist in Austin and columnist for Texas Monthly Magazine She says she hadnt smoked marijuana much since her college days  Its been a godsend for the temperamentally tense such as myself Bird says And its really been a boon to getting me off my addiction to Ambien and Yellowtail Merlot  Whats not to like Bird asks Its lowcalorie she doesnt wake up hung over its great for the libido and its popular at dinner parties baked into Belgian chocolate brownies  But most of all she adds You know youre not contributing to the Sinaloa Cartel and youre not destabilizing Mexico And in my case as a parent Im not modeling criminal behavior for my child  Recreational And Medicinal Uses At the University of Texas at Austin Kevin Prince coordinator of UTs alcohol and drug program says hes seen a spike in pot smoking since it became legal This is troubling to him because national studies show that sustained marijuana use directly affects academic achievement One of the main issues is theres still a mystique when it comes to marijuana use Prince says A lot of people still dont know that marijuana use is addictive If youre spending more time smoking weed than going to class or going to work thats a problem  Not everyone uses it recreationally The end of cannabis prohibition has been a blessing for Marsha a medical marijuana user with multiple sclerosis Sitting in a wheelchair in a friends backyard in Houston Marsha says she smokes weed to escape from my body and the chronic pain caused by nerve damage  Oh what a relief it is not to be home alone wondering if this minorleague marijuana user if the cops were gonna come bust me down she says Its nice to feel free  The Cartels Stay Strong Free at last to smoke marijuana Since the prohibition on cannabis ended has it delivered the results its supporters claimed it would  With the spiraling drug mayhem in Mexico some Latin American leaders looked at legalizing marijuana as a way to deny the murderous cartels a portion of their profits When it was banned marijuana was the greatest source of income for Mexican traffickers Now that its cultivated domestically and sold legally surely that has crippled the cartels These are crooks Youre not gonna take em out of the criminal activity business says Robert Almonte who worked narcotics for 25 years with the El Paso Police Department just across the river from the ruthless Juarez Cartel Because drugs are legalized theyre not gonna say Lets go back to school and get an honest job   Almonte director of the Texas Narcotic Officers Association says all cannabis legalization has done is force the drug mafias to improvise  As far as marijuana is concerned they have been selling it less expensive than what it can sell for here in the United States Almonte says But more importantly were seeing a more potent marijuana And with that were seeing  an increase in the emergency room admissions  A similar observation comes from William Martin a drug policy expert and senior fellow at the James A Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston  Just as after the repeal of prohibition organized crime got into many other kinds of activities  protection money control of the laundry business  so the drug cartels are quite flexible Martin says Theyve diversified into kidnapping human trafficking protection other crime And theyre still selling cocaine heroin and meth which are highly profitable So unfortunately it has not hurt them as much as wed hoped  Fewer Criminal Cases Records Supporters of legalization say one of the undeniable benefits has been the reduction in criminal cases that have clogged courts  I used to represent a lot of marijuana smokers and dope dealers says Gerry Goldstein a prominent criminal defense lawyer in San Antonio  Though he is not billing as many hourly fees these days he believes thats a good thing for the criminal justice system  Back in  2006 to 2008 45 percent of all drug arrests in this country for the most part were marijuana offenses Goldstein says Thats a staggering waste of resources of our law enforcement   And it left young people scarred with criminal records for something that is arguably less dangerous than alcohol Bill Martin says If they were convicted they could lose employment child custody student aid voting privileges some welfare benefits They could even forfeit assets like cars or houses The new regime has eliminated that Problem users are now being treated as a public health matter and not as a criminal issue and thats appropriate he says  It Wouldnt Fill Government Coffers  Since marijuana became legal farmers around the country  illicit and formerly illicit  have scrambled to put Cannabis sativa seeds into the ground Under the law they pay 1000 for a state license whether their crop is hydroponic or soilgrown The marijuana crops been going really good  Just wait till the last frost just start puttin the plants in the ground and add a little nitrogen fertilizer to give you a lotta leaf and after that it just grows like a weed which is what it is says Larry Butler He stands among the crop rows at his Boggy Creek Farm a 5acre certified organic urban farm in Austin Texas His wife Carol Ann Sayle says theyve been a bit disappointed by their newest cash crop and are nervous about losing the farms family ambiance The retailer takes a big hit off the bong so to speak and then the government comes in with their taxes Sayle says So whats left for the farmer After all that work and  trying to ease peoples fears that were gonna be giving it to children So whats left for the farmer Stems and seeds is about all thats left      Jeffrey Miron a Harvard economist who has modeled and written on the economics of the marijuana market figures state and federal taxes on cannabis sales add up to 67 billion annually  And he calculates the savings from not having to enforce state and federal marijuana laws  in arrests prosecution and incarceration  at 129 billion a year Excluding additional expenses such as the public health cost of marijuana or the cost of administering the new law Miron figures that legal pot creates almost a 20 billion bonus Miron adds however that the people who thought the taxation of marijuana would create a windfall for government coffers will be disappointed Compared to the size of most federal government agencies compared to the tax revenue from things like alcohol and tobacco and certainly compared to the size of deficits that we have this is just not a major issue it is not a panacea it is not curing any of our significant ills he says There may be good reasons to do it but the budgetary part is not a crucial reason to do it  There Are More People Smoking It Now that marijuana is legal to possess use process transfer transport retail wholesale and cultivate has the United States become a nation of potheads The Dutch experiment offers an interesting case study After marijuana was decriminalized there in 1976 pot smoking didnt jump in Holland and it remained well below US levels But it rose sharply after coffee shops opened in the 1980s and began openly selling cannabis The US already has a huge appetite for drugs Its the largest illegal narcotics market in the world Half of all highschool seniors have used pot  Drug policy analysts interviewed for this report believe that now that marijuana is legal and socially acceptable in the US there are more people smoking it And some of them are kids Theyll start using it sooner now because it looks like its more OK seems less harmful because they see their parents doing it says Rosalie Pacula codirector of the Drug Policy Research Center at the RAND Corp Do we know how to keep kids from drinking alcohol No we dont So why would we expect wed be any better at it with marijuana   And the reason we should care is because of the effect that marijuana can have on the development of adolescent brains says Dr Vicki Nejtek a research doctor who works on drug abuse at the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth  We know that marijuana use and chronic use as it is now in an adolescent population can cause extreme developmental delay Nejtek says We know the myelin sheath around our brain cells acts like an insulator to an electric cord When thats stripped away it can cause memory loss it reduces our ability to concentrate and a reduction in brain cell activity In 2007 144 million Americans ages 12 and older admitted to surveytakers that they had used pot in the past month Rice Universitys Bill Martin believes now that its legal about onethird more people are using marijuana  maybe 19 million Americans Martin believes legal pot  which is after all an intoxicant  has been good for society but bad for young people I have nine grandchildren he says I would prefer that none of them use marijuana to any significant extent I have seen students Ive seen friends become less interesting  NPRs fictitious scenario of legalized marijuana is not likely to come true anytime soon Most states are still fighting to legalize medical marijuana and decriminalize marijuana penalties much less seriously considering legalization President Obama is on record opposing legalizing pot as a way to boost the economy For now whether legal cannabis would cause an outbreak of reefer madness or make more people just mellow out makes for an interesting parlor game But its only a pipe dream Copyright

fashion whim As a toddler she was obsessed with a standard pink leotard with a prickly tulle tutu and she insisted on wearing it everywhere I mean everywhere But I was so enamored of her independent style that I even helped her accessorize it with a cotton turtleneck so she could move seamlessly from fall to winter when the temperature dropped Eventually her beloved ensemble morphed into a series of Spice Girlsinspired outfits  flared leggings and rhinestonefestooned shirts several riding high above her midriff  It seemed adorable until it wasnt And it wasnt when one day I looked up at her and thought Oh my God my little girl looks like a stripper My emotions were a jumble I had created this monster Id given in to the whining at the store and purchased clingy glittery items despite my better judgment and fashion sense I admit it she wasnt the only one attracted to these musthave pieces at the time I actually thought a pintsized version of a sexy starlet was cute But now Id come to my senses My daughters belly was soft and round and to me irresistible but it certainly didnt need to be paraded around the playground swaddled in sparkles and spandex Desperate times required desperate measures Given that there was no way my daughter was going to give up her glitzy uniforms without a fi ght and also given the fact that I wasnt up to fighting I brought in an element which would take things out of our hands red nail polish I splattered an entire bottle across her favorite items leaving an army of angry red blotches everywhere When she discovered the stained clothing in her closet I shared her shock and disbelief and then we had a somber brief ceremony when they were disposed of in the trash It wasnt until recently as we packed up her room to send her off to college that I came clean about my dirty trick Thankfully we both had a good laugh As mothers we become crafty and resourceful and resort to thoughts and actions we never thought possible Who knew I could stoop so low as to actively deface my kids clothing Not me But at the time it seemed like the only option and a clever one at that As seen in the confessional we moms are brilliant at conjuring shortcuts cleaning up that spill with our pant legs and coping mechanisms a little vodka in the thermos at a neverending baseball game to get through our days and to tackle situations in our harried lives for which there are no how to lists Sometimes our creativity is worthy of sharing Yet often it might be worth sharing but certainly not with anyone we live with or could bump into at the next birthday party The confessional offers an alternative  a chance to unload the embarrassing and the shameful the creative and the crass In this chapter its clear that there are some things we cant wont or shouldnt tell our kids our partners or our friends But its my belief that everything can be shared anonymously in cyberspace because you never know when one moms secret might be another moms solace or even a solution  something that can help her get through a long day or even longer night and even if only briefly let her know that shes not alone From TrueMomConfessionscom  We held a PTA meeting at my house last week All the moms marveled at my clean home Thank God they didnt look too closely Id put all the dirty dishes in the oven and stuffed the overflowing piles of dirty clothes and the stinky dog bed in the hall closet  Often when Im trying to figure out what to do with regard to my little girl I think of my parents and what they would do And then I do the exact opposite Sometimes when I spill something on my kitchen floor I just mop it up with the bottom of my pant leg as I walk by  Have you ever seen the show Weeds Thats me We live in suburbia have a very happy albeit semidysfunctional little family I am a fourthyear university student my husband owns a successful business  but we happen to sell marijuana out of the little house that my grandmother left us several years ago We make a lot of money and its hard to stop Wed be pretty well off without that income but with it we have it made  I went back to work so that I would yell at my coworkers instead of my son  I joined Weight Watchers just so that I would have a place to go by myself once a week  I havent taught my kids how to tell time yet That way I can say its bedtime whenever I want  I got pregnant so I could get a break from working every day  I lean over my babies beds at night when theyre asleep and whisper I promise Ill be a better mommy tomorrow There are just too many days I wish Id done better  Sometimes when Im holding my beautiful baby in my arms and were gazing lovingly at each other I secretly wish that she would fall asleep so that I could check my e mail  I eat all the

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102249839&ft=3&f=,The epicenter of violence in Mexico remains Ciudad Juarez where nearly 2000 people have been murdered in a mafia war in the past 14 months  many of them just boys  There are so many murders that the new morgue is planning to double its size and so many threats that the mayor recently moved his family across the river to El Paso      Some 80 percent of the victims are younger than 25  Social workers say the violence is fueled by a disturbing trend The cartels have begun seeking younger and younger recruits  Soto Daniel Hector and Gerardo are just the kind of young men the cartels are looking for Theyre residents  or inmates  at the School of Social Betterment for Minors on the outskirts of Juarez This is where the city sends its bad boys  the young killers robbers thugs and drug dealers  Sicaritos are children who are assassins 13 or 14 years old says Soto The cartels give them a weapon to use Its easier for a boy If hes older he thinks too much  he may think about the consequences But when youre young you think you can take on the world   Soto 18 sits at a picnic table at the school Like the others he wears a hoodie and sneakers and grins selfconsciously All four teenagers insist they never joined the cartels Nonetheless they all seem to have a thorough knowledge of their workings Like every other young person in this story they wont give their last names  To be an assassin you cant think says Daniel 16 You just do it grab a pistol and go kill somebody or whatever It doesnt matter if you die or not  Soto adds If you dont have a mother or a father no one to believe in you then its easy to fall into this to be a delinquent   Recruiting Juveniles  Mexican drug cartels recruit children under 18 for the same reasons that armed forces conscript boy soldiers in Sierra Leone and Somalia  their immaturity produces fearlessness And for a young boy at the margin of society cartel membership brings instant respect  You go with the guys who have the most power money connections and influence Soto says  Gerardo 15 and pimply chimes in When you run with those people nobody says anything especially not the police because theyre working for your patron too Teresa Almada is the longtime director of the youth development center in Juarez called CASA  There are thousands of candidates in this city for recruitment because of their level of social exclusion she says Theyre young and poor and disposable  The growing number of lawless youth in Juarez is intimately connected to the proliferation of narcotics Juarez has now replaced Tijuana as Mexicos most drugaddicted city A crackdown by US and Mexican authorities has choked traditional smuggling routes Consequently the cartels have flooded the local market with marijuana cocaine and heroin More young people are selling and using than ever before  Carlos is a frecklefaced heroin addict  18 years old though he looks much older He hangs out with other junkies near the market in central Juarez With a slurred voice and glassy eyes Carlos says he came to Juarez last year from Guadalajara with the intention of sneaking into the United States and looking for work but he couldnt get past the Border Patrol So he stayed in Juarez where he lives in a grim abandoned building reeking of human waste He squeegees car windows and steals to get the money to buy the fixes he needs to shoot up every six hours    See Potential In Young Gang Members  The citys noblesounding colonias named for Mexican presidents  Gustavo Diaz Ordaz Plutarco Elias Calles Adolfo Lopez Mateos  are the incubators of gangs whose members have become what Almada calls cannon fodder for cartel franchises like La Linea Los Aztecas and Los Mexicles  This prosperous industrial city was supposed to be the economic model of a stable middle class Migrants from throughout Mexico flocked here to work in the foreignowned assembly plants But the city cant accommodate its 13 million residents There arent nearly enough public schools parks or youth programs Children of the barrio are raised by siblings or in the streets and theyre illsuited to repetitive work in the factories or classroom study In Juarez 1 out of 3 kids doesnt go to middle school and attendance in high school is half the national average Into the void have stepped the cartels   Organized crime figured out the potential of young gang members and started recruiting says Tony a 26yearold former gang member They realized that these boys could easily be channeled to do bad things like homicides and assaults The governments lack of commitment to young people in Juarez is to blame These boys wouldnt end up like this if the system provided healthy activities for them  Tony works with a youth group called Alta Tropa or the High Crew that uses creativity such as graffiti art break dancing and hiphop as an alternative to gangbanging Ciudad Juarez finds itself in a perfect storm for the conversion of young men into criminal psychopaths poverty insufficient schools broken homes a pervasive culture of violence and the seductive omnipresent pull of the narcomafias  On this night a dozen motley members of Alta Tropa have gathered in a ramshackle house as a full moon rises over the desert metropolis A big boy named Javier in baggy shorts and a backward baseball cap raps while his homies smile approvingly Others are silkscreening their designs on Tshirts   At least the kids of Alta Tropa are trying to save themselves  Radio piece produced by Marisa Penaloza  Copyright 2014

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102256207&ft=3&f=,President Obama is mulling a request to put troops on the Texas border to stop violence in Mexico from spilling over But officials in Texas border cities say the mayhem hasnt spread and that bringing in the military puts lawabiding citizens in jeopardy  From Texas southern tip to the westernmost city of El Paso municipal officials said their communities have not been infected by the epidemic of drugrelated murders plaguing Mexico Officials in Texas largest border cities  El Paso Laredo McAllen and Brownsville  said their cities are among the safest in the state with some reporting decreases in violent crime The sky is not falling said McAllen Police Chief Victor Rodriguez who disagrees with Gov Rick Perrys decision to ask for troops Whats happening right now is weve got rhetoric thats driving the policy Some police chiefs of border cities are planning to share their concerns about having troops on the border with Perry at the Texas Homeland Security Conference on Tuesday The conference includes law enforcement representatives from around the state and across the border   In Brownsville which lies across the border from the Mexican city of Matamoros there has been a significant decrease in violence over the past decade  Brownsville a birdwatching paradise and spring break destination because of Matamoros party image had three murders in 2008 and has averaged four or five a year for the past 10 years This year weve had one murder said Brownsville Police Chief Carlos Garcia None of the recent homicides has been linked to Mexicos drug cartels he said Garcia said there are some Americans who live in the US and cross into Mexico to work for the cartels but he said he doesnt believe the violence will spread because traffickers have extensive networks to keep them safe if they are caught south of the border There they have money safe houses if a member is captured he can escape or buy his way out he said Despite spurts of violence between the Gulf cartel and the Mexican army in Nuevo Laredo US twin city Laredo Texas has also seen its crime rate fall said Laredo spokeswoman Xochitl Mora But Garcia said the situation on the US side of the border has not always been calm When Juan Garcia Abrego headed the Gulf cartel in the 1980s Brownsville averaged 25 murders a year as the convicted drug lord trucked tons of cocaine and marijuana into southern Texas by greasing the palms of officials on both sides of the border said the veteran Texas lawman In those days drugrelated violence got little media attention because the Mexican government hadnt declared war on drug traffickers Garcia said But in 2000 thenPresident Vicente Fox brought his battle against the cartels to the front pages Mexicos current president Felipe Calderon brought in the military Now the violence is in the news daily  They Fox and Calderon have stirred the hornets nest and people in the cartels and the military are getting killed Garcia said Last year more than 6000 people died in drugrelated violence in Mexico and the situation has intensified as Mexican police and soldiers battle drug cartels for control of Mexicos border cities This year more than 1000 people have been killed  primarily police soldiers and traffickers Nowhere has the violence been worse than in Ciudad Juarez which lies across the border from El Paso  As many as 2000 people have been killed in the past year Earlier this year security was so bad that Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz and his family fled to El Paso for safety Calderon has sent 7000 troops to the desert city this year according to the El Paso Times newspaper But on the US side of the border calm has prevailed said El Paso Mayor John Cook   Cook boasted that El Paso has consistently been among the countrys safest large cities according to annual analyses of FBI crime statistics by Congressional Quarterly Press formerly Morgan Quinto Press He said the large number of law enforcement officers  police and sheriffs departments customs immigration border patrol  give El Paso and other border cities an extra layer of protection The perception is the border is dangerous The reality is that it is not Cook said  But Cook said recent Texas history has shown that putting troops on the border could endanger the public  especially in a rural area where civilians carry guns to protect themselves and their livestock from predators In 1997 teenager Ezequiel Hernandez was herding goats in rural western Texas when he was killed by US Marines on a counternarcotics detail The Marines thought the boy who carried a rifle in the rough terrain was a drug smuggler Soldiers are trained to be weapons of war said Cook a former military service member Im all for putting more boots on the ground but they need to be the right kind of boots  Cook said he favors adding border patrol agents or other federal agents trained to work with civilian populations Rodriguez the McAllen police chief said he believes Perry and other politicians are calling for troops because they dont want to be seen as not doing enough to keep the US safe  Although every car coming into the United States is stopped at the US border it is rare for Mexican officials to stop vehicles coming into Mexico   Rodriquez said putting Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives agents at the border crossings to search southbound traffic would keep Mexicans and Americans safe by keeping guns and ammunition out of the hands of drug traffickers  Earlier this month federal agents seized 997 guns headed for Mexico More than 90 percent of the guns used by drug traffickers in Mexico are smuggled into the country from the US according to the ATF The agency has stepped up investigations of gun smuggling as a part of its Operation Gunrunner and plans to add more agents  The Obama administration announced Tuesday that it plans to send more agents and equipment to the border including 100 more agents within the next month and a half to fight gun trafficking16 Drug Enforcement Administration positions in the border area and doubling the border enforcement security teams that combine local state and federal officers  But Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said she hasnt decided if she will send the 1000 National Guard members requested by Perry The two are scheduled to discuss the issue on Thursday  Congress has also approved 700 million to help Calderon in his fight against the cartels Homeland security starts in our home

drug war that threatens to destabilize parts of the USMexico border The drug war killed more than 6000 people last year and has prompted some security analysts to warn that Mexico is in danger of becoming a failed state The drug war is affecting communities on both sides of the border  Tourist Havens Dark Side  Zihuatanejo markets itself as a tropical paradise on Mexicos west coast Fivestar hotels line a crescentmoonshaped cove Lean coconut trees sway over clean soft sand The currents of the Pacific keep the bay pleasantly warm attracting Canadians and New Yorkers throughout North Americas coldest winter months But this small resort also has a dark side It sits on one of Mexicos primary cocainetrafficking corridors In the past month heavily armed commandos have attacked the local police with assault rifles and grenades Five officers have been killed After repeated attacks the entire police force went on strike Herman Ramirez Vasillo who has been with the force for 11 years says the killings of his coworkers were frightening And he says a lot of officers quit Roughly 20 officers quit out of fear for their lives he says Now the Zihuatanejo police station looks like a military garrison in a war zone  The complex is surrounded with sandbags and officers with highcaliber rifles are stationed in pillboxes out front  Violence Across The Country  Whats happening in Zihuatanejo is also unfolding all across the country In December 2006 when President Felipe Calderon took office he sent tens of thousands of soldiers and federal police to confront Mexicos powerful drug cartels The cartels responded brutally A few months ago the heads of eight soldiers and a former police chief were found in plastic bags just north of Zihuatanejo Major gun battles at times lasting for hours have erupted from the Guatemalan border to the interior highlands to the Chihuahua desert Jorge Chabat a security expert at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Mexico City says Calderons strategy is to try to pulverize the Mexican drug cartels To transform these four or five big organizations criminal organizations into dozens of small cartels  Similar to what happened in Colombia he says The Mexican cartels have come to dominate global cocaine trafficking Mexico also has become the worlds largest exporter of marijuana Estimates of the revenue generated by the Mexican drug cartels range from 18 billion to 40 billion a year They use their cash to bribe local public officials and purchase arsenals of militarystyle weapons  They fund minor league baseball teams and church construction projects Chabat says shutting down the drug trafficking business entirely is impossible You are trying to fight the invisible hand of the market with the long arm of the law he says And historically the invisible hand wins He says the best Calderon can hope for is to diminish the immense power of the nations largest cartels Mexicos top representative to Interpol the police chief of Cancun the current holder of the Miss Sinaloa beauty pageant title the mayor of Ixtapaluca and Calderons former drug czar have all been arrested recently on suspicion of ties to organized crime Calderons former drug czar is accused of being on a 450000 a month retainer to pass information to the Sinaloa cartel  Many Mexicans Blame The US  In Mexico the drug war is viewed as a problem caused by the United States Carlos Rico the head of North American affairs at the Mexican Foreign Ministry says Mexico cannot resolve the problem of drug trafficking when such a huge demand exists for these drugs in the United States The best we can do he says of Mexico is to try to make the passage through Mexico difficult for these criminal groups In addition the weapons with which the cartels are killing cops prosecutors and each other come primarily from the US As two of the nations most powerful gangs the Juarez and the Sinaloa cartels battled in Juarez the local police lost control of the border city Over the course of last year every type of crime from petty theft to robbery to extortion to murder mushroomed We were closing the door and these individuals arrived with guns drawn says Miguel Navar who runs a small convenience store in downtown Juarez They hit me and my wife and took all our money This shop has been in Navars family all his life He said that in the past they had never been robbed  Then last year they were robbed four times at gunpoint in six months  He says hes lost so much money that hes now on the verge of bankruptcy Last month when the drug cartels ordered the Juarez police chief to quit the federal government sent in the army to take over control of Juarez Eventually more than 8000 soldiers and federal police will patrol the citys streets But Navar says some of the soldiers are as bad as the criminals There are some who are extorting money from merchants Navar says In a place where theyre supposed to be giving protection theyre bringing more fear Recently Navar installed thick metal bars across his front counter He jokes that now hes living in a cage while all the delinquents are running around free  Assessing Calderons Efforts  But the arrival of the first wave of soldiers has reduced the number of drugrelated killings in Juarez In February the city was averaging roughly 10 assassinations a day Most Juarenses today are simply happy says Tony Payan an associate professor of political science at the University of Texas at El Paso He also teaches at the university in Juarez  He says most people in Juarez are desperate for the government to find a way to control the bad guys Theyre saying Take them away Give us our city back The situation had gotten out of control and we dont care what happens to these guys  he says  If they die if you disappear them if you throw them out in the desert we dont care so long as you recover law and order  Calderon has found himself on the political defensive  With more than 6000 people killed last year in drugrelated violence and no end to the war in sight the president has been in the odd position of having to publicly justify why hes battling organized crime Calderon says the surge of violence is a sign that his forces are seriously disrupting the workings of the cartels And the list of accomplishments in his drug war is quite long Last year alone Mexico seized thousands of tons of marijuana 200000 kilos of cocaine and hundreds of weapons Several key leaders from several cartels were arrested Theyve seized trucks cars and jets used by the drug runners In July the Mexican marines even snagged a submarine puttering off the Pacific Coast carrying more than five tons of cocaine What Calderons administration has been unable to do is bring an end to the drug violence across Mexico Copyright 2014 NPR,20090625,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102128241&ft=3&f=,For years the lawyers who represent poor people have complained that their offices are overworked and underfunded Now some states are starting to believe that the solution is not to throw more money at the system  Instead theyre talking about putting fewer people in jail  Theres this long New Hampshire tradition of tough on crime but theres a huge New Hampshire tradition of being pretty darn stingy says Chris Keating executive director of New Hampshires public defender program  But being tough on crime can be expensive and Keating says in New Hampshire the tradition of stinginess is starting to win out  The insider term is decriminalization New Hampshires state Legislature is considering measures that would take away the threat of jail time for some offenses and in the US the government only has to pay for a defense lawyer when poor defendants face incarceration So taking away the threat of jail saves money and Keating believes New Hampshire is trying to distinguish between people society is mad at and people society is afraid of I think they want to reserve the resources and the court time and their attention for the people were afraid of he says  And the people were just sort of temporarily mad at  I dont think the court system wants these people to get appointed counsel and show up for two or three preliminary hearings and then a trial and then a sentencing hearing I think they want to move these people and cases through the system because they realize theyve got finite resources and these cases are just bogging them down The movement has support from some unexpected places  William Wren the commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Corrections says tough budget prospects are forcing him to look at closing a whole prison and laying off 97 positions  For that reason Wren wants fewer people sent to prison and he is asking lawmakers to examine which crimes really deserve time behind bars  Ill give you a good example  our theft statutes the threshold dollar amount for going from a misdemeanor to a felony crime is 500 That was set 31 years ago What 500 was 31 years ago is a lot different from what it would equate to today he says   These kinds of conversations are happening across the country  In Washington and in many other states suspendeddriverlicense crimes constitute as much as one third of the total misdemeanor caseload says Bob Boruchowitz a visiting law professor at Seattle University  More than 100000 people are prosecuted every year for driving with a suspended license in Washington and a broad justice coalition in Seattle has recommended changing the law Now its before the Washington Legislature  If you were able to remove from the system the suspended driver license cases for instance you would reduce dramatically the burden on everybody from police to prosecutors to courts to defenders to jails Boruchowitz says adding that people were never motivated to address these problems before and the bad economy has provided the opportunity  But there are dissenters  If you start to save money at the expense of public safety you might as well close down your government says David Capeless president of the Massachusetts District Attorneys Association  Last fall voters in his state passed a law decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana  Now Massachusetts is considering further decriminalization measures  They can wash with too broad a stroke Capeless says  Even what might be a seemingly minor crime in the context of a particular case is not so minor depending on the prior record specific circumstances whether its the underpinning for other charges  so thats something that needs to be dealt with on a casebycase basis But the chief public defender for Massachusetts Bill Leahy says cuts have to come from somewhere  Weve got a 3 12 billiondollar deficiency in Massachusetts this year all kinds of worthy programs are being cut and were continuing to waste money on prosecuting crimes that are criminal only by statute Leahy says   And for people who have spent their lives advocating for public defenders this is a new chapter  I think its a major shift says David Carroll the director of research for the National Legal Aid and Defender Association  Weve had a hangover on the toughoncrime movement and realize that to keep going down that path were only escalating costs at ever greater rates and so we need to stop and think of new ways to produce efficiencies at the same time as guaranteeing public safety Liberals are often pigeonholed as being soft on crime with conservatives portrayed as tough on crime so it might also come as a surprise to hear that one of the strongest voices for decriminalization at the federal level comes from someone who works at a conservative think tank  Criminal punishment is the greatest power that government regularly uses against its own citizens So from a conservative standpoint any great power needs to have very clear limitations on it says Brian Walsh a senior legal research fellow at the Heritage Foundation  Walsh recently wrote a paper called Enacting Principled Nonpartisan Criminal Law Reform The idea that more criminal law is always better harsher sentences are always better  thats not a conservative principle he says Walsh wants a bipartisan group to reevaluate the federal criminal code and look at what doesnt need to be there and he already has supporters from both parties on Capitol Hill  And he says hes gotten good signals from the Obama administration too Copyright 2014 NPR,20090319,marijuana

callsOver sleepy garden wallsAnd the wireless wombat wanders on the wingsAnd the wireless wombat wanders on the wings The Holy Modal Rounders Random Canyon In the early 1960s the Greenwich Village folk scene took a left turn away from the cleancut sounds of say The Kingston Trio Bob Dylan was singing Masters of War Phil Ochs had Power and the Glory That didnt sit well with Peter Stampfel I really hated the seriousness of the people on the folk music scene Stampfel says I thought it was stupid I mean it was beautiful stuff but it was goofy too At least some of it was and I thought the goofiness was one of the great things about it Stampfel admits that his own band the Holy Modal Rounders was silly But it wasnt doing parodies of old folk songs Its members knew the music inside and out I got the idea in 1963 What if Charlie Poole and Charley Patton and Uncle Dave Macon and all those guys were magically transported from the late 1920s to 1963 Stampfel says And then they were exposed to contemporary rock n roll What did they do  And that sounded way way way more interesting than trying to be Mr Note Perfect 1929 The Holy Modal Rounders filled out an odd profile in the thick of the 1960s folk movement It was challenging tradition by taking it into weird and psychedelic realms The Rounders had a small but intensely devoted following and one of the groups songs was even included in a major motion picture The duos influence has grown steadily over the intervening decades inspiring a younger generation of innovative folk musicians  and filmmakers The Rounders are now the subject of the new documentary Bound to Lose  Seriously Free Spirits Peter Stampfel grew up in Wisconsin during the 1940s and discovered folk music and the fivestring banjo at the University of Wisconsin His partner in musical crime was Steve Weber a countryblues guitar player who grew up in Philadelphia Weber dropped out of high school and lived on the streets of New York City for a number of years before teaming up with Stampfel Even today Weber is a free spirit Even if you aint got one yourself you can break into a party and make it your own he says in Bound to Lose And thats what Ive been doing all my life Aint that right The films codirector Paul Lovelace was less than prepared for Webers antics Ive never met anyone that just completely lives by his own rules Lovelace says You can ask him Where are you playing tomorrow night And he would have no idea and no interest But at the same time he does take the music part of it seriously His abilities as a musician his abilities as a singer and a guitar player  he really has a lot of pride in that Webers seriousness was evident from The Holy Modal Rounders very first gig together Stampfel says We were on stage at some little club on Bleecker Street and all of a sudden I hit a bad note Stampfel says And Weber winced as if he had been kicked in the gut and played an excruciatingly dissonant chord on the beat following my bad note followed by four more chords  each one more dissonant than the one prior to that  and then he screamed and leaped off the stage And I thought Wow This is great  The Punishment Brothers Both on and offstage Weber and Stampfel were like oil and water Much of their relationship was built on bickering Paul Lovelace saw a lot of this during the making of the documentary Peter and Steve would bicker very very often he says They really are like an old married couple  They love each other to death at times but they also just cant stand being around each other at times  Bassist Dave Reisch noticed the tension the minute he joined the band in 1971 Peter and Steve had a strange relationship Reisch says They bounce off each other They also had a little shtick  they were The Punishment Brothers They said Im cruel and hes unusual  Their odd behavior may have been fueled by drug use which Stampfel does not deny Our first album was recorded on speed and pot he says All our early albums were recorded on well I was on amphetamine and marijuana and beer How the substances affected it was what you hear when you hear the records Wins And Losses Despite the Rounders selfdestructive behavior their song If You Want to Be a Bird wound up in the movie Easy Rider But the musicians couldnt capitalize and the group split up in 1971 Weber and the rest of the band moved to Portland Ore where the guitarist succumbed to heroin addiction Stampfel stayed in New York Years later the two would reunite for the occasional album and gig But Weber was a noshow for the bands 40thanniversary tour in 2004 He refuses to talk to Stampfel and has disappeared somewhere in West Virginia  Yeah he wont speak to me Stampfel says His girlfriend convinced him that I have stolen the Rounder millions I mean theres occasional Rounders hundreds but as far as Rounders millions goes that would be nice but no While The Holy Modal Rounders never reached a mass level of popularity the bands cult status continues to grow Its influenced a new generation of musicians including bands like Yo La Tengo and Espers But Stampfel says he wanted that influence to be broader I felt that something big and amazing was going to happen to popular music that would change everything he says And of course I was right about that and it was The Beatles The delusional part was that I thought it was going to be The Holy Modal Rounders Even though the title of the documentary says the Rounders were Bound to Lose in the end they won in a way showing purists a thing or two about letting go

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100790535&ft=3&f=,When Eric Holder was the US attorney for Washington DC he started a program that sent prosecutors into communities to get to know the residents and local law enforcement  ties that prove helpful when putting together criminal cases  Fifteen years later as Holder takes the helm of the Justice Department his innovative program is still thriving  The community prosecutions program assigns federal prosecutors to specific neighborhoods They get out of the office and build relationships with members of the community They get to know police neighbors hoodlums witnesses  everyone And hopefully their cases benefit as a result Today Holder says the program is one of his proudest accomplishments from his time as DCs chief federal prosecutor More than half of the state and local law enforcement offices in the country do community prosecution And in DC the initiative is as strong as ever When the members of the community see me playing with their kids they feel a lot more comfortable about our office as a whole rather than just the big bad prosecutor coming to lock them up says Jelahn Stewart an assistant US attorney and the 4th District community prosecutor But then when it comes to intelligence the citizens are very willing to give us all kinds of information that really will prevent crime  Giving The Community A Voice For example she says when she was in the homicide section she had a case that was pretty much dead in the water There were no witnesses and she didnt think she could successfully prosecute anyone  While she was interviewing a witness in a different case she realized  because of her work in the community  that the witness lived on the same block as the homicide victim Stewart recounts the story  So I just randomly asked her I said Do you know a person named Larry Larry was my decedent And she said Yeah I know Larry And I said Do you know where he is how hes doing And she said Well hes dead I said Really What happened to him She said he got shot I said Who killed him She said Pierre shot him I said Really How do you know Pierre told me and he told me what he did with the gun And she also gave me a whole host of witnesses and based on that one question I asked her because she lived in that block I was able to successfully prosecute that case and we actually got a conviction And it isnt just highprofile crimes like homicides At a community meeting prosecutors might learn that drug dealers are keeping kids out of a park If the police catch someone with marijuana in that park prosecutors will go after the case more aggressively because they know its part of a bigger problem Then when it comes time for sentencing the prosecutor might show up at another community meeting And Stewart will tell the neighbors to fill out a form explaining why they cant take their children to the park Then Ill take the community impact statement and submit it to the judge at sentencing Stewart says and the judge will actually take that into consideration when sentencing the defendant so it gives the community a voice they wouldnt otherwise have if we werent at the meetings  Soft Power And Hard Power One of the first people Holder tapped to be a community prosecutor was Albert Herring who now oversees the community prosecutions program While visiting a DC police station to talk with a group of students recently Herring ran into one police officer after another whom he had befriended through the community prosecution program including Officer Charles Robinson Theyve known each other for about 18 years Robinson says Herrings role helps bridge the gap between the police department the prosecutor and the community Hes more or less a peoples person prosecutor Robinson says You know he gets down to the source he wants to know He gets in a neighborhood he sees whats going on he sees the ups and the downs in a neighborhood Herring tells the students at the police station that he wasnt always a convert to this way of thinking I used to think that if we just arrested enough people and put enough people in jail the kinds of problems weve been talking about would eventually go away he says But I dont think that way anymore because now I understand that we cannot arrest our way out of the problem The current US attorney for Washington DC Jeff Taylor who was appointed by President Bush is a huge believer in the community prosecution program that Holder created We have soft power and we have hard power as prosecutors Taylor explains Hard power is what people traditionally think prosecutors do  we prosecute cases we put people in jail But we can also make a difference in our communities by exercising this soft power Its a way of building relationships with the community they serve so that the next time they need a witness or need to connect with the local detectives and officers they can do so he says The community prosecution effort reflects a profound understanding that prosecutors are servants of the community he says and that were only effective in our job if we have the support of the community we serve Know The People Know The Job Roscoe Howard who served as DCs US attorney earlier in the Bush administration and is now a lawyer in private practice says he expects his friend Holder to apply these principles to his new job I think that youll see that Eric attacks a lot of problems from angles that we wont be used to Howard says I think Eric comes from  I dont want to put too fine a point on it but he comes from a different background than a lot of attorney generals would have come from in the past Being a minority Holder is used to seeing issues in a different light compared with a nonminority Howard says Hes a New York City kid He understands the urban life he says And Howard says Holder has the philosophy that in order to know his job he needs to know the people he serves

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99252417&ft=3&f=,Dog Days at Jackrabbits The corner of Pleasant and Kercheval is a little less than a mile to the east of Indian Village roughly in between its edge and the disappearance of Kercheval into the Chrysler plant Characteristic of the lower East Side of Detroit its qualities conform to an advanced phase of urban decay described elsewhere as the green ghetto Most of the many vacant lots in the area have been cleared for over a decade allowing thick foliage trees and shrubbery to grow unimpeded During the warm and humid Detroit summers the contiguous parcels overflow with tall prairie grass and wildflowers and would look like woodland meadows if not for the sidewalks circumscribing them and for the evenly spaced fire hydrants that line the parameters of city blocks The ruins of slatsided houses jutting groaning and leaning away from their foundations are strewn with accidental awkwardness amid the fields and weeds On the hazy heavyaired day when I returned to visit Dude at the corner of Pleasant and Kercheval the urban prairie extended up both sides of Pleasant for around 150 yards and came to a stop on either side of the street at a pair of old rectangular twofamily houses On the east side of the street was the yellow house where Dude had been working A couple of days before he had called me out of the blue from his friend Trebs cell phone and said I could meet him at the house on Pleasant He had given me precise parking instructions and when I got there I did just as he said pulling my car to the side of the road about 25 yards past the house To my right across a trashcovered field I could see the back porch of city councilor TinsleyTalabis house Right under her nose I thought to myself Typical of twofamily flats in the area the house had two doors on the first floor one that led upstairs and another that led into the downstairs apartment The doors were sheltered by a dark porch roof which had a balustrade around the top for the rectangular upstairs balcony The yellow houses porch steps were twisted and cracked from exposure and rang like taut drums as I climbed them The door leading to the upstairs was on the right It was old and heavy reinforced with gray weathered plywood over which a rusted steel mesh had been nailed There was a oneinchsquare opening in the middle of the upper panel against which one could press ones face and look through the mesh into the stairwell or shout up toward whomever might be in the secondfloor apartment I leaned into it and yelled Hey through the screen Who is it came Dudes familiar voice Its Luke I shouted trying to be both cool and audible Dude thundered down the stairs and pulled up the weathered fourbyfour beam that had been braced between the stairwell and the door and stomped back up to the second floor I pushed open the door which squeaked off the jamb falling into the stairwell and walked into the foyer After the first four steps there was a landing and the staircase made a sharp left turn and led up to the front room of the secondstory flat Most of the boards for the landing were gone leaving a gaping opening There was also an oversize mirror approximately four feet squared propped on its edge against the landings rough framing so that people on the second floor could see around the bend in the stairs to the front door I had to negotiate the stairs carefully with the missing boards at the landing and the frameless mirror leaning gingerly in the corner At the top was a gate of black steel bars secured with a keyed padlock leading to the front room of the apartment And poking through the bars were the black twitching wet muzzles of three pit bulls that Dude and Treb had been raising in the house The dogs spent most of their time in this front room and consequently the pale hardwood floor was covered with a sprawling archipelago of dog shit steaming in the stifling Michigan heat From the dog room there was a pair of French doors leading to the main living room where there were two plush white couches at right angles to one another facing a nineteeninch television Dude who had rushed up the stairs in front of me opened the French doors and plopped himself on one of the couches Sit down man he said with an impish grin suggesting that he sensed I might be uncomfortable He told me that he had just been to the weed house on Holcomb around a block away They got the dros right now he said as he dumped a dime bag of weed on to the coffee table in front of him Man you got a television Playstation You all are set up here I said I told you dog said Dude with a proprietary smile This aint no spot nigga This a motherfucking home Dude pointed me toward the rooms in the back of the apartment each furnished with a narrow bare mattress We got bedrooms up in this piece Luke At twenty years old Treb was both Dudes elder and had been something of a mentor for him Tall light skinned and muscular with broad and handsome features Treb was quiet when Dude introduced me to him hardly looking up Chewie who was sinking into the corner of the couches with his arms extended at his sides was more talkative He reassured me in a cloggednose whine that he was one of Dudes oldest friends and that if I was Dudes man it was cool with him if I hung around at the house The three of them had known and looked after one another for years they had gone to the same elementary school and had been playmates friends and rivals ever since When I showed up there was the usual midmorning lull in customer traffic at the house Treb went into one of the back rooms where the dogs also spent a lot of their time to chop up an eight ball of crack into the nickel and dime rocks that they would sell over the course of the afternoon Dude Chewie and I sat in the living room not saying much the two of them were dazed from the marijuana and stared passively at the television where Dr Phil

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98596425&ft=3&f=,El Flaco as we call him here was member of Mara Salvatrucha for 18 years before quitting two years ago Hes 26 was born in El Salvador  and claims to have killed 22 people Following are excerpts from an interview with NPRs John Burnett I was part of the Mara Salvatrucha a gang which started in the United States and then went to El Salvador The truth is I want to leave because I was tired of harming the people Theres a certain limit to where you get tired of doing bad things to people Im tired of living this life I havent found the love of a mother or a father I looked for it but it was difficult to find Also I left the gang for the benefit of my daughter Sandra whos three years old Our slogan was Vivo por mi madre muero por mi barrio  I live for my mother and I die for my barrio What sorts of crimes did I commit Various Honestly I considered crime my salary We had a satanic cult in which we killed people For example wed take out the heart and eat it Then wed cut up the body leave it in bags on the corner Thats what we did Its no joke In MS13 we sold our souls to the devil practically so that hell give us everything we need We sacrificed everybody including innocent women and children Every month or two we had to do a ritual So we looked for somebody grabbed them at midnight killed them and took out their heart  We fried the heart on the griddle We used a little salt The flavor is soso like a stew but without much flavor We had a saying if you dont pay we wont hurt the father Sadly its the children who will pay Thats what we told the father And we fulfilled our threat and killed children We demanded extortion from stores buses and people Wed surveil their kids then we sent them a letter demanding 40000 50000 or 100000 quetzales from 500 to 13000 depending on what kind of business it was and how much they made If he didnt pay wed kidnap his wife or kids and kill them Wed send body parts to him to show him we meant business and then wed keep kidnapping his family members until he paid  How did it feel to kill kids On the one hand I felt bad On the other hand if we didnt do it they gang leaders would kill us  We spent our money on arms drugs we sent money to our brothers in jail The type of drugs we used was marijuana heroin cocaine hashish and prescription drugs            We lived in a house of homies We built our own house To hide from the cops whatever           There were lots of rumbles between gangs with Uzis and all kinds of guns Their territory was only three blocks away from ours They couldnt come onto our territory and we couldnt go onto theirs          We also extorted members of our own barrio  40000 quetzales a month 5200 from families We offered protection we didnt bother them and they wouldnt tell on us If they didnt pay wed kill them Most of them paid          We werent afraid of the police We made sure the police didnt bother us but if they came wed meet them with bullets The police dont like gang members and we dont like them either The police wanted to kill all of us and we wanted to kill all of them The police didnt like us because we f up the people We bother them we extort kill anyone in front of us So with the police we had a rivalry They didnt like us and we didnt like them  Los Angeles de la Noche the Angels of the Night is a group of police agents who travel in armored cars at night They kill our homies The people ask them to because the people get really tired of us fing them over so they talk with the police and they send Los Angeles and they kidnap you and kill you            Some police are involved with maras gangs assaulting armored cars robbing trailers and everything But the majority are not involved They try to kidnap us stop our work But theyll never succeed because the delinquency will only grow   Maras are growing all the time because most young people today what theyre looking for is the love of a father and a mother and they dont get that in their homes so they look for that in a gang But if youre looking for a family youll be deceived All you get from a gang is income brutality and scars I think we all deserve a chance in this life Sadly many of those who join gangs dont have the love of a father or a mother in our home we were mistreated I think what they police do instead of helping theyre destroying our lives They should be opening factories for work Were looking for society to accept us not reject us I think we deserve a second chance No one has the right to take anothers life Well have to pay I have various friends whove been killed by sicarios private hired guns They killed a companero in El Mesquital Zona 2 named Blodi He was 22 The sicarios cut off his head and hands They left his body in a gulley He was a gang member but hed left the gang             The sicarios travel at night and kidnap people Theyre expolice who loan their services to the community They kill people for pay They get 15000 to 300000 quetzales 2000 to 4000 per victim Sometimes they cut out the eyes the tongue the hands            On the one hand Im afraid of the sicarios but all in all I know what Ive done to people and the same could happen to me But I dont go out alone Theyll have to get me  The civilian security patrols that formed to rid provincial towns of gangs are effective We dont mix up with those people because we know theyll catch us and set us on fire alive In Quiche theyve done this  We dont go to the provinces for example   San Juan Xela San Lucas we dont mess with those people Theyre unified Theyll catch you throw on gasoline and thats it              They killed my brother this way He was in our gang and he died this way in Santa Cruz del Quiche Juan Carlos was my younger brother 14 years old We had sent 10 gang members to Santa Cruz to work that barrio Of the 10 we sent only two returned We sent them there to organize Mara Salvatrucha in Santa Cruz What we look for is to extend our reach into every barrio so we can grow They dont lynch us here in Guatemala City People are afraid of us here Theyre intimidated Copyright 2014

NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98135986&ft=3&f=,Across the border from El Paso Texas the city of Juarez is being torn apart by a drug war   The number of murders in Juarez has jumped from 300 in 2007 to roughly 1500 this year   Amid the drug war robbery kidnapping and extortion in Juarez have mushroomed unchecked and US residents are also getting killed in the violence  A Familiar Scene  A call comes over the police radio that three decapitated bodies have turned up at a used car lot  Federal police in ski masks and black stormtrooper uniforms surround the scene  They clutch M15 assault rifles as they scan the gathering crowd   Across the expanse of yellow police tape a woman wails and pounds on a mans chest  This has become an all too common scene in Juarez where on average seven people are being gunned down every day At almost the same time that the coroner was poring over this murder scene gunmen across town were ripping apart a Crown Victoria with automatic weapons fire When they stop I show my face in the window says Rudy Garcia who starts to shake as he describes the shooting in front of his house  I saw this brown car fleeing the scene  There was a car that was all shot at  This guy came out of the car with blood all over the head Nationwide the number of killings attributed to organized crime doubled in 2008 to more than 5000 and no city has been harder hit than Juarez The murder rate here is five times higher than in 2007 but Garcia says all types of crimes are skyrocketing   The criminals got into the schools and robbed all the teachers he says Told the teachers that they were going to come back for the Christmas bonuses of the teachers If they dont do it theyre going to take hostages of the children and kill the children and kill them  So these teachers didnt come back to school  Their schools are closed Two of the nations most powerful criminal groups the Juarez and the Sinaloa cartels are fighting for control of Juarez  Both groups move billions of dollars worth of drugs into the US each year and their hit men carry highpowered assault rifles machine guns and even grenades This Things Out Of Control President Felipe Calderon has sent thousands of federal police and soldiers to confront the gangs but as the federal authorities focus on organized crime Juarezs municipal police force has collapsed Hundreds of local officers have been fired for corruption  And in this vacuum crime has been allowed to flourish They were like I already shot you once  Im going to kill you right here if you dont give me the keys to your truck  says Julio who runs a small onehour photo studio in a row of shops on the south side of Juarez  Hes been robbed at gunpoint twice in the past three months and he doesnt want to give his full name because he says hes terrified The first robbers shot his coworker in the leg and demanded the keys to a flashy fourdoor pickup truck that was parked out front  The vehicle actually belonged to a customer at the hair salon next door   They went next door and put the gun on the little girl so the owner of the truck could give the keys Julio says   He says the police took statements after both robberies but nothing ever happened He says the authorities in Juarez dont do anything If you want to defend yourself you have to have a gun in your business so you can kill whoever comes here he says  And thats what people are doing  getting guns  This things out of control Despite the fact that guns are illegal in Mexico Julio says the only reason he hasnt gotten one is that he cant afford it Cartels Wield Enormous Power The drug trade affects almost every part of the country  According to the UN Mexico has become the worlds largest producer of marijuana and Mexican cartels control most of the cocaine thats sold in the US  In recent weeks at least half a dozen top law enforcement officials have been arrested and accused of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from the cartels Oscar Maines who teaches criminology at the Autonomous University of Ciudad Juarez says this is also an American problem The power that the drug cartels have is fueled by the consumption of drugs in the United States he says   He points out that the cartels also get their arsenals of highpowered weapons north of the border The quantity of weapons that the criminals have at their disposition is enormous Maines says  I understand the difficulty of the federal government to fight these  It can be done because I dont think that the cartels are more powerful than the state at this moment But the situation continues to get worse in Juarez and the violence continues to rise  November was one of the deadliest months ever in the city with 184 people executed CrossBorder Connections Juarez pushes right up against El Paso Texas  The two cities are tightly linked economically and many people have family members on both sides of the border   Since September at least seven US residents have been gunned down in Juarez including one womans uncle and cousin My family is naturally living here in the border says the woman who does not want to be identified for security reasons  Its naturally that half of the family used to live in El Paso half in Juarez Sitting in a cafe in El Paso she recounts how her uncle was shot at his Juarez hotel in October Then in late November gunmen in Suburbans strafed the hotel again killing his daughter her cousin Finally heavily armed men in SUVs attacked her cousins funeral procession killing another cousin that cousins boyfriend and wounding a 10yearold boy  She says the dispute started when her uncle refused to pay for protection from the Juarez cartel And these people interrupt the house and kill him in front of the  grandchildren she says   Referring to Juarez as my city she says the place has been kidnapped by organized crime They act with impunity  They dont care the woman says  They have connections with the government Everyone knows that  Thats why journalists anyone who starts to open their mouths  theyve been killed  This is a war Her uncle and the cousin killed in the funeral procession were both US citizens and law enforcement officials in Texas at both the local and the federal level say they dont and cant get involved when Americans are killed across the border  They have no jurisdiction in Mexico Amid all the killings a pair of lost camels wandered into downtown Juarez at the beginning of December  Men were building lifesize nativity scenes in several city parks and the two camels looking like lost members of the Wise Mens entourage wandered in out of the desert Theyd escaped from an amusement park  For several days the fuzzy pack animals displaced the decapitated bodies and gunshot victims from the front pages of the newspapers  Even when a federal prosecutor was gunned down at a stoplight the camels led the local TV news  in part because this city is exhausted by the relentless violence Copyright 2014 NPR,20081211,marijuana
NPR,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97674896&ft=3&f=,Hundreds of miles of fence are being erected along the frontier with Mexico and over the past four years the number of Border Patrol agents on the boundary has nearly doubled as the Department of Homeland Security attempts to lock down the southern border These measures have helped sharply reduce the number of illegal immigrants crossing into the United States Border Patrol agents are busy all along the border including in Nogales Ariz The arid khakicolored hills surrounding this town look soft and rolling from a distance but up close the terrain is menacing  Dry waisthigh grasses grab at clothes thorny bushes scratch at the skin and the dusty soil gives way under the ankles Just after sunrise one day Border Patrol agent Benny Rosario leads three Mexican men in handcuffs out of the brush to a dirt road  Rosario says agents on a nearby hill with a night vision telescope spotted several groups of migrants moving through the area in the predawn darkness Well its mainly infrared traffic so they pick up the heat spots Rosario says  You can see the terrain out here  its pretty rough  Its all hill over dale  For the most part theyre able to put the agents in on where the group may be going so its been working out for us tonight The night was a busy one in the US Border Patrols busiest stomping ground  The Tucson sector covers 262 linear miles of the Arizona border from the Yuma County line to New Mexico  Last year agents arrested more than 300000 illegal migrants  The Border Patrol agents use walkietalkies remote cameras ground sensors radar systems dogs floodlights night vision goggles  and just about anything else they can think of to catch people sneaking over the border   In the end Rosario says his job often comes down to a footrace  Many of the migrants scatter when the Border Patrol descends on them Tonight fortunately that hasnt been the case he says  There was one group  Actually this group  ran from us initially up further north  But the scope trucks were able to stay on them and we were able to pick them up further south here   The men Rosario just caught had been in the desert for three days  The first thing they asked for as they were being loaded into the back of the Border Patrol truck was water Testing The Agents We have about 22 cameras that we use and they are all equipped also to see in the dark says Esmeralda Marroquin a supervisor with the Border Patrol at Nogales Station  She is standing in what looks like a war room as two radio dispatchers sit in front of a bank of video monitors  The cameras are trained on various parts of the Nogales border   Some of the screens show the rusty old fence that cuts a swath between residential neighborhoods in Nogales Ariz and Nogales Sonora in Mexico  Other screens show the new fence on the outskirts of town and vehicle barriers in the desert Across the border hundreds maybe even thousands of people get ready to test the Tucson sector agents  Carlos Gonzales is one of them  He was recently deported and is preparing to head right back in Me and my friend  we are going to come back tonight Gonzales says  We going to start walking around 1100 when immigration moves That time immigration moves  We get the chance to walk we going to walk about two nights in the desert Gonzales 28 has lived half his life in the United States  He says he expects to die in New York City  But if hes not careful he could die here in the desert  Last year at least 183 migrants lost their lives trying to cross this part of the Arizona border Gonzales says he is not worried about all the Border Patrols fancy new technology  If he gets caught he says hell just try again The terrain between Nogales Sonora and Nogales Ariz is such that rainwater flows north  One problem for the Border Patrol is that a massive flood control system runs from the Mexican side into the US Marroquin is standing in a tunnel thats big enough to drive a truck through Unfortunately people do cross and a lot of people dont understand the dangers of these tunnels and how quickly they can flood and how quickly they can lose their life she says  Once it starts raining its a matter of minutes to get someone out of there before it flash floods and then rescue efforts begin further north The Border Patrol has installed cameras in the tunnel and nozzles that can fill the cavern with pepper spray if anyone tries to sneak through   You Name It Weve Seen It In addition to the drainage tunnels the Border Patrol also discovered last year alone 14 homemade tunnels crossing under the boundary  The tunnels are used for both migrants and drugs   Agents also seized more than 400 tons of marijuana last year as well as huge shipments of cocaine methamphetamines and heroin that smugglers were trying to get into the US Weve seen it inside baby diapers  Weve seen it inside prosthetic limbs  You name it weve seen it says Brian Levin with US Customs and Border Protection from the Nogales port of entry Levin says some 45000 people enter the US through this port every day and his officers process 18 billion worth of cargo each year We are the busiest port of entry for winter produce coming in from Mexico heading to North America he says Under the reorganized Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection is in charge of securing the legal ports of entry  the customs and immigration checkpoints to enter the US   Border Patrol administers the parts of the border that arent at official crossings and Levin says at the port of entry agents have to search for illegal migrants narcotics and other contraband while still allowing legitimate traffic to flow We have to be able to balance our enforcement mission with our facilitation mission Levin says  We cannot sacrifice the safety and security of the United States for facilitation but we are not going to ignore that  And it comes down to balancing the two Levin says new technology is helping to speed traffic and secure the border  Scanners can read chips in passports and IDs even before the drivers gets to the customs booth radiation detectors can screen for a dirty bomb and computers link his agents to criminal databases in Washington DC   Crossing The Open Desert Yet despite all this technology at the port smugglers still regularly cross the border in the open desert About three miles outside of Nogales Marroquin has just found a spot where vehicles have been driving over a small ridge to get around a new Border Patrol fence This is a drive through Marroquin says  Theyve actually brought a car up and over and are getting around the fencing here As soon as areas like this are discovered theyre immediately addressed and more fencing is put up to control it Marroquin describes her work as a Border Patrol agent as an art that mixes tracking with technology and intuition  Agents regularly pursue groups of migrants just following footprints in the sand   The awkward hand gesture of a driver she says can tip you off that the trunk is full of drugs or illegal immigrants The additional personnel the new fences and the added technology are all making the Arizona border a lot harder to cross but ultimately she says its the agents  who are out there every day chasing people through the thorns and the rugged grasslands  who have changed this frontier Copyright 2014 NPR,20081204,marijuana
