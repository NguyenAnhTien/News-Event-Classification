Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/21/ohio-diocese-discourages-ice-bucket-challenge-cites-funding-stem-cell-research/,CINNCINNATI  A Roman Catholic diocese in Ohio is discouraging its 113 schools from participating in the ice bucket challenge to benefit the ALS Association saying the groups funding of embryonic stem cell research is in direct conflict with Catholic teaching Jim Rigg superintendent of Catholic schools for the Archdiocese of Cincinnati told the schools in a letter Tuesday to immediately cease any plans to raise funds for the association or to instead direct donations to another organization that combats ALS a progressive neurodegenerative disease also known as Lou Gehrigs disease that causes paralysis and almost certain death     The Catholic Church relates the use of embryonic stem cells in research to abortion and says it violates the sanctity of human life The use of adult stem cells in research is not forbidden by Catholic teaching We certainly appreciate the compassion that has caused people all over the country certainly including many Catholics to be interacting and engaging in a fun way to support ALS research diocese spokesman Dan Adriacco said Thursday But its a wellestablished moral principle that not only the ends be good but the means must be good too The diocese said schools could participate in the ice bucket challenge but any money raised should be directed to groups like the John Paul II Medical Research Institute in Iowa City Iowa which conducts prolife driven research according to its website Carrie Munk a spokeswoman for the ALS Association said her group largely funds adult stemcell research but does fund one study involving embryonic stem cells using money from one specific donor She said all donors to the ALS Association can stipulate where their money goes and can ask that it not pay for embryonic stem cell research The group hasnt heard of any other Catholic dioceses in the country recommending against donating to the group Munk said Adriacco said the Cincinnati dioceses superintendent wrote his directive to the schools after consulting with the Catholic Conference of Ohio The Philadelphiabased National Catholic Bioethics Center affirmed the decision Thursday he said Spokespeople for both groups didnt immediately return calls for comment Thursday Don Clemmer a spokesman for the US Conference of Catholic Bishops said that the group views the Cincinnati dioceses actions as a local matter and that his organization has not issued any directives to its bishops discouraging donations to the ALS Association Since the ice bucket challenge took over the Internet the ALS Association received 418 million in donations from July 29 to Thursday Thats compared to 21 million in the same time period last year Munk said the association is amazed by the wave of donations I guess the most remarkable thing about this ice bucket challenge is the level of visibility it has brought to this disease she said The dollars are incredible but people are talking about ALS now theyre talking about research theyre talking about patients and their families Its really so incredibly valuable,2014-08-21T13:29-04:00,abortion
Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/11/04/exit-polls-show-voters-unhappy-with-both-obama-and-gop/,"WASHINGTON AP  Most of the Americans voting Tuesday were unhappy or even angry with the Obama administration exit polls show But most werent pleased with Republican congressional leaders either Just 1 in 5 voters say they trust the government to do what is right most or all of the time even fewer than in the 1994 midterms when Republicans seized control of the House and Senate and the last time the exit poll asked that question Republicans were getting some of the blame however About a quarter of voters say they are dissatisfied or angry with both Obama and GOP leaders in Congress Another 6 in 10 are unhappy with one or the other of them The surveys of voters leaving their polling places offered encouragement for Republicans hoping to benefit from voters glum mood Most think the government is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals They feel the nation is seriously off on the wrong track And they think the US economy is stagnating or getting worse Theyre more than twice as likely to say that life will be worse for the next generation than to say things will get better At the same time on many issues voters take positions that seem to align more with the Democratic Party Majorities favor a way for those who are in the country illegally to stay They approve of Obamas military action against the Islamic State group They think abortion ought to be legal in most cases consider climate change a serious problem and say the economic system favors the wealthy The survey of 11522 voters nationwide was conducted for AP and the television networks by Edison Research This includes preliminary results from interviews conducted as voters left a random sample of 281 precincts Tuesday as well as 3113 who voted early or absentee and were interviewed by landline or cellular telephone from Oct 24 through Nov 2 Results for the full sample were subject to sampling error of plus or minus 2 percentage points it is higher for subgroups Follow us on twittercomfoxnewslatino

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/08/19/here-why-democrats-phony-war-on-women-wont-work-in-2014/," So heres my prediction The Democrats war on women rhetoric will continue to get uglier and nastier and less credible as they continue to sink in the polls 2014 is our year to expose this deceptive campaign tactic for what it is

Its already begun in Colorado where Republican Rep Cory Gardner is in a very close race to defeat liberal incumbent Sen Mark Udall Violent and chaotic conflicts continue in Ukraine Syria and Iraq we have a crisis along the southern border of the US our economy continues to underperform and too many people are unemployed or underemployed and weve got halfadozen unresolved scandals in Washington especially the shame of the Veterans Administration which have eroded Americans confidence in their own government But hey this is politics so Mark Udall wants to talk about  abortion and contraception Those are the subjects of his latest attack ad against Cory Gardner

Missing from the ad of course is that Colorado women are losing access to their health care because Mark Udall cast the deciding vote for ObamaCare Thousands have had their coverage cancelled Many women lost their doctors and have to drive further from home or work for treatments and hospital visits If Sen Udalls lame tactics make you shake your head it might be best to just look away from the race for Texas Governor between Attorney General Greg Abbott R and State Sen Wendy Davis D     Abbott is well ahead of Davis in the polls and Texans broadly support his conservative agenda As a result Daviss rhetoric has become so shrill she has begun airing an ad that accuses Abbott of siding with a corporation over a rape victim The ad  which I will not link to here  is a classic political attack ad with a scary voiceover and zero regard for context and legal complexity Daviss overthetop antics will be tough to beat But its only August

Tactics like these are motivated by a world view that sees women as easily manipulated single issue voters But thats not what I see as I travel the country as Chairwoman of the American Conservative Union Foundation and most recently as the Chairwoman of the Unlocking Potential UP Project

I founded the UP Project because everywhere I go I meet strong intelligent women who are tired of being taken for granted and are sick of current political environment belittling them From career women to dedicated public servants to stayathome moms they are thirsty for a genuine debate about real issues impacting their lives

The flood of bad news concerns them greatly Women age 55 to 64 will carry the bulk of ObamaCares premium hikes Poverty among women is at a record high Roughly 553 million women have left the workforce since the Great Recession over a quarter million have dropped out since May alone

But heres some good news The Democrats war on women wont work this year Those of us who demand more from our politics are organizing like never before Conservative women are going to force the nations politicians to talk about real issues Were going to hold Democrats to account for their failed policies And were going to spearhead a conservative victory in 2014  Carly Fiorina a former CEO of HewlettPackard is chairman of the Unlocking Potential Projectand also serves as chairman of the American Conservative Union Foundation   FollowFoxNewsOpinion on Facebook",2014-08-19T12:29-04:00,abortion

Dont believe the hype The Nebraska Senate primary today is being cast as another installment in the battle between the Republican Senate leadership and the teaparty coalition trying to brush back Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell And thats true but only up to a point Insurgent candidate Ben Sasse a former Bush administration health policy wonk who helped turn around a struggling Nebraska college after leaving Washington headed into todays voting with what scanty polling suggests is the lead and the momentum Those who plunder the corpses left by Republican civil wars for fun and profit are already casting Sasses potential victory as revenge for an establishment candidates victory last week in North Carolina But Sasse has been quite good at running for Senate His teaparty backed counterpart in North Carolina however was not Much the same can be said of conservative crusaders in Mississippi Georgia Kansas and certainly in McConnells own Kentucky Conversely basebuoying candidates are doing just fine in places like Oklahoma Iowa and Michigan The last polls will close in Nebraska at 9 pm ET Chickens counted not hatched  So who cares which very conservative candidate wins a Nebraska primary in which fewer than 200000 votes may be cast The seat is safely Republican and either Sasse or the frontrunner he supplanted former state Treasurer Shane Osborn would have a nearly identical voting record in the Senate The only ones who really care are those who are already counting votes for leadership posts in an imagined Republican majority next year McConnell is all but certain to retain his position atop the heap if he survives a stiff Democratic challenge this fall but when it comes to other posts in the leadership team and more importantly deciding which strategies the party would pursue loyalties count Sasse supported by Sen Ted Cruz RTexas and Sen Mike Lee RUtah would not go along to get along Osborn who has paid his dues in the party and is backed by McConnell loyalists would likely be a reliable vote for Team Mitch This jockeying for future Senate scrimmages has no doubt made the race uglier and far more expensive than necessary but hey politics is a tough business Sometimes you husk sometimes you get husked Remember Cruz has also made an endorsement in Nebraskas crowded tossup gubernatorial contest backing Pete Ricketts to win Discerning  All this effort for drafting fantasy teams for the 114th Congress is fine for the political junkie set and for those looking to lobby or otherwise pull the strings of the Senate But what about the decent people What seems to be happening is that Republicans are embracing the old William F Buckley rule of backing the most conservative candidate who can win The longrunning feud between McConnell and his foe former South Carolina Sen Jim DeMint who now leads the Heritage Foundation is great for Beltway smacktalkers but not of much consequence to regular folks The mistakes Republicans made in 2010 and 2012 related to placing these kinds of allegiances ahead of practical considerations like you know actually getting into the Senate Some establishmentarians will win this year some may lose The same goes for the outsiders But in the end these races will all come down to Republican voters taking the measure of their options Sasse has run well and made few mistakes Osborns campaign faltered on a couple of occasions Voters may have concluded that Sasse is the steadier choice Making overbroad interpretations about national trends from that would be dangerous But one thing is showing through so far this year Republican voters are showing a degree of discernment we didnt see from them in the previous two cycles Campaign Carl wants to know if all the outside money and negative attacks in Nebraskas Republican US Senate primary couldbackfire on the two frontrunners Midland University President Ben Sasse with support from tea party groups and outside super PACs had inched into a slight lead in the polls over former state treasurer and establishment favorite Shane OsbornBut heading into the final stretch three national super PACs backing Sasse unleashed attacks on a third candidatebanker Sid Dinsdale who ran no attack ads in his campaign and won the endorsement of the states largest newspaper  all of which suggests Dinsdale is worth very much watching tonight too WEST VIRGINIA GOP UNITES BEHIND CAPITO

 Sorry bro     OBAMA PROVES PANETTAS POINT
A note to all those right and left who heralded the arrival of a new wartime era in the Obama presidency on Sept 10 with the presidents aboutface on bombing Syria No chance Lance President Obama Thursday was back to his old self A pivot to the economy was really a turn back to trolling Fox News and leading chants of Yes we can and promising bold executive action to allow illegal immigrants to remain in the country at a fundraiser for Hispanic Democrats The war effort in Syria and Iraq looks increasingly like the regimechange mission Obama undertook in Libya Arrived at under political pressure and departed from as quickly as possible  regardless of outcome Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta cant be surprised While his predecessor Robert Gates wondered whether politics outranked policies on national security at the Obama White House Panetta is certain writing in his new book Those on our side viewed the White House as so eager to rid itself of Iraq that it was willing to withdraw rather than lock in arrangements that would preserve our influence and interests

On The Kelly File last night State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked to answer Panettas charges She did not Watch here

Same game higher stakes  By side Panetta is referring to those in his Clintonite faction urging the president to be more aggressive with dealing with Islamists We will never know exactly what happened But with little public confidence that Obamas strategy for dealing with the fastmetastasizing radicalism across the region will actually work this is a good time to draw some bright lines between Obama foreign policy and Clinton foreign policy If things go as poorly in Obamas latest effort as they have in the ones he has held up as examples of success Yemen and Somalia Hillary will need lots of distance indeed While the president may like the fact that he can carry out occasional assassinations by drone of Islamists in those two countries with little fanfare or attention the stakes in Iraq Syria and Libya are much much higher Rubbing out a Jihadi in the Puntland with a drone is one thing but when we talk about a fight for control of oilrich and populationdense territories in the crossroads of the Middle East its quite another

Panetta on Obamas Syria red line flinch  The result I felt was a blow to American credibility When the president as commander in chief draws a red line it is critical that act if the line is crossed The power of the United States rests on its word Assads action clearly defied President Obamas warning by failing to respond it sent the wrong message to the world

Pivot and divot  So the presidents past actions certainly reinforce that this latest crisis even though his role in creating it is undeniable has not changed him into some Bushlike resolute warrior But his current conduct proves Panettas point about politics over policy It only took three weeks for Obama to revert to the same kind of basebeating conservativetrolling antics that helped him win in 2012 If Obama saw the threat from Islamists in any way like George W Bush does he wouldnt be trying to start a flame war with the right which happens to be the only base of support for his actions in Syria and Iraq Taken to its logical if absurd conclusion a Democratic Senate would make it harder not easier for Obama to prosecute this new war Whatever the election outcome a wartime president would need a wartime coalition But war doesnt seem to be much on the presidents mind these days

Make no mistake these policies are on the ballot Every single one of themPresident Obama discussing the need to protect his health law and other domestic policies in a campaign speech in Chicago

Neo Campbellites  Yahoos Olivier Knox reminds us of how a lone lawmaker forced Congress to debate and decide on thenPresident Bill Clintons Balkan war in 1999 Just as now neither partys leadership wanted to deal with the issue Whats changed since then though is that members of both parties are more sensitive to executive overreach on the power to make war

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/23/senate-hopeful-ernst-enters-final-stretch-with-edge-over-dem-in-polls/, Joni Ernst is back to hogging Iowa airwaves as she barrels into Election Day with another pigthemed ad a slight edge over her Democratic rival in the polls and a significant fundraising advantage Whether thats enough to carry the Republican nominee to victory in the hardfought Iowa Senate race remains to be seen But GOP operatives some of whom have flocked to her campaign after she emerged from a crowded field to snag the nomination earlier this year are touting her chances in the final days of the race     The latest good omen for Republicans was in early voting and absentee ballots where the party says more registered Republicans than Democrats are voting early for the first time in modernIowa election history The Democrats can spin all they want but they are in trouble in a blue state Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement late Wednesday Democrats downplayed the news noting that early ballot returns are in flux and claiming a surge of Democratic ballots is expected soon But one thing is for certain Iowa is a major battleground and perhaps far more competitive than anyone thought it would be early this year When Ernst won the GOP nomination in June polls showed Democratic candidate Rep Bruce Braley with the upper hand A preprimary March Quinnipiac poll found voters preferred Braley to Ernst by 13 points A new Quinnipiac poll out Thursday though showed Ernst leading 4846 percent Ernst led by 6 points among crucial independents though despite the GOP claims about early turnout Braley was leading among those who already voted Several other polls show Ernst leading as well Ernst also is back up with another pigthemed ad  after the candidate drew widespread attention in the primary for running an ad in which she talked about castrating hogs This time the ad shows her in a muddy messy pig pen Its a mess Dirty noisy and it stinks she says Not this lot Im talking about the one in Washington Amid the fun farm analogies though Braley has continued to hit Ernst on social issues like abortion and birth control coverage In many polls female voters break for Braley whereas male voters are more likely to support Ernst David Yepsen director of the Southern Illinois Paul Simon Public Policy Institute and former chief political reporter for the Des Moines Register said Ernst would be wise to campaign on issues like President Obama foreign policy the economy and jobs and stay away from social issues She needs to stay on a soft conservative message said Yepsen adding he thinks the Ernst campaign will stay fairly quiet on them for the remainder of the race Social issues arent a winning issue for Republicans as they used to be so dont talk about it To that end Republicans have been hitting Braley on foreign policy especially on the Islamic State threat Ernst a member of the Iowa National Guard who has served in Iraq said in a press release that Braley is disengaged and he doesnt even know what hes voted on when it came to airstrikes in Syria Ernst also called Braley wishywashy on the issue of ISIS during a campaign stop Braleys campaign has fought back on these claims The Iowa Senate race is one of the crucial pickup seats the Republican Party wants to take the majority in the Senate Bigname politicos and donors have poured time and millions of dollars into the race Ernst a state senator is now dominating in fundraising  The Ernst campaign reported in a press release raising 6 million in the third quarter twice what the Braley campaign raised Ernsts campaign had more than 3 million cashonhand in the beginning of October The release stated the Ernst campaign had set an alltime Iowa record for the amount raised by a statewide candidate in one quarter Braley had 12 million on hand Anyone who has watched television in Iowa over the last few months knows much of those dollars are being spent on campaign attack ads Yepsen though said theres a law of diminishing return in terms of whats on the air and Internet He said ground operations more than ads are turning votes at this point I think most people in Iowa would actually enjoy seeing a farm chemical ad at this point he joked  Even the candidates themselves are tuning out whats being played on TV During the third Iowa Senate debate Braley and Ernst admitted to a surprised moderator that they and their families had stopped watching TV If ads arent registering with voters its all up to the ground game to motivate people to cast their ballots early or show up on election Tuesday While the president has been absent from Braleys campaign trail first lady Michelle Obama has made two stops in October to stump for him On her initial visit the first lady repeatedly mispronounced Braleys last name referring to him as Bruce Bailey However on her second appearance she poked fun at herself and made up for the mistake  though a White House transcript initially described Braley incorrectly as candidate for governor Vice President Biden also is scheduled to stump for Braley on Monday in Iowa according to the campaign While Democrats typically win the game when it comes to early voting and absentee ballots Republicans in Iowa are working to make up that difference and tout that for now they appear to have closed that gap  We have evened the plane Jeff Kaufmann chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa said recently  Yepsen said early voting is a key component of a Democratic victory here  The Democrats have to pile up a huge lead among absentee ballots to win he said A GOP memo released late Wednesday said the number of registered Republican early and absentee voting returns has surpassed those of the Democrats by 305 ballots Hurting the Democratic candidate perhaps the most though is a clip that has been played repeatedly in attack ads and is referenced in almost every speech by Ernst supports It shows Braley caught on camera asking donors if they wanted a farmer like Iowa Sen Chuck Grassley or a lawyer like Braley leading a Senate committee That didnt sit well in a state known for farming Ernst meanwhile has touted her farm background telling supporters at a dinner Tuesday she was proud to be a farm girl from a muddy dirt road running against a trial lawyer for the US Senate Though the Ernst campaign has been enjoying a huge stockpile of cash on hand and a lead in the polls Braleys campaign is hitting Republicans on specialinterest donors My question for Senator Ernst is why dont you inflict a little pain on the secret donors who are helping the Koch brothers and their billionaire friends attack me Braley said at a campaign rally They think their secret money matters more than your vote and I say thats wrong While Ernst has been pushing her image as a mother solider and farmer Braley is pushing the message that he is a bridge

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/03/31/judge-refuses-to-block-arizona-abortion-drug-rules/,PHOENIX  A federal judge on Monday refused to block new Arizona rules limiting the use of the most common abortion drugs handing a victory to conservatives in a lawsuit over restrictions that are the most stringent in the nation The ruling by US District Judge David C Bury means the new restrictions will take effect Tuesday     The rules ban pillinduced abortions after seven weeks of pregnancy compared with the current nineweek restriction Bury made his ruling in response to a lawsuit by Planned Parenthood Arizona and the private abortion clinic Tucson Womens Center who say the rules severely infringe on a womans ability to have an abortion He was asked to grant an injunction that would have blocked the rules from taking effect The rules were released in January by the Arizona Department of Health Services They ban women from taking the most common abortioninducing drug  RU486  after the seventh week of pregnancy Existing rules allow women to take the abortion pill through nine weeks of pregnancy Planned Parenthood estimates that 800 women would have had to get surgical abortions in 2012 if the rules were in effect then An attorney for the organization also told the judge Wednesday that the new rules could force its Flagstaff abortion clinic to suspend operations In his ruling the judge acknowledged that the new rules will make it more difficult for some women in Arizona especially those in the northern part of the state to get abortions as they have to travel farther and make more trips to clinics But he said they arent obstacles big enough to show that the rules should be blocked The court finds that the injunction is not in the public interest he said Attorney Mike Tyron arguing the case for the state described the rules as a simple shift in abortion regulations that amount to a minor inconvenience for women  and are not the heavyhanded change that opponents make them out to be The Arizona Legislature in the past few years has approved a number of aggressive antiabortion measures A House of Representativesapproved bill that is being considered by the Senate would allow for surprise warrantless inspections of abortion clinics Proponents of the bill say it protects women from clinics that are not up to health standards Opponents say it puts women at risk and violates their privacy The Arizona rules limit RU486 to use under the Food and Drug Administration drug label approved in 2000 which uses a much higher dosage That dosage is no longer routinely followed because doctors have found much lower dosages are just as effective when combined with a second drug The rules require that the drug be administered only at the FDAapproved dosage no later than seven weeks into a pregnancy instead of nine weeks and that both doses be taken at the clinic The usual dose is lower and now usually taken at home decreasing the cost and chance of complications Ohio and Texas have similar laws requiring the use of only FDAapproved protocols for drugabortions that have been upheld by federal courts although those states have exemptions for women whose life is endangered who have severe health problems or for whom surgical abortion would not be appropriate Arizonas law doesnt allow for exemptions making them the most stringent in the country State courts in Oklahoma and North Dakota have blocked similar rules The Center for Arizona Policy a powerful antiabortion group that pushed the 2012 law has pushed a series of antiabortion bills Two of those a ban on Medicaid money for any of Planned Parenthood nonabortion services and a ban on abortion after 20 weeks have been blocked by federal courts When Planned Parenthood loses women win said Cathi Herrod president of the Center for Arizona Policy Its commonsense regulations protecting the health and safety of women considering an abortion The Center for Reproductive Rights which filed the lawsuit on behalf of Planned Parenthood says it will continue to challenge the rules in court This law serves no purpose other than to prevent Arizona women from using a safe alternative to surgical abortion and force their doctors to follow and outdated riskier and less effective method This is what happens when politicians not doctors practice medicine said attorney David Brown,2014-03-31T19:13-04:00,abortion

companions at Gwanghwamun Door in Seoul South Korea Saturday Aug 16 2014 Paul Yun JiChung born in 1759  was among the earliest Catholics on the Korean Peninsula AP PhotoGregorio BorgiaThe Associated Press SEOUL South Korea  Pope Francis beatified 124 Korean martyrs on Saturday telling hundreds of thousands of people who turned out for his openair Mass that their ancestors willingness to die rather than renounce their faith two centuries ago was a model for Asian missionaries today The streets leading up to Seouls iconic Gwanghwamun Gate were packed with Koreans honoring the lay Catholics who founded the church here in the 18th century Koreas church is unique in that it was founded not by foreign missionary priests   as occurred in most of the world    but by members of Koreas own noble classes who learned of Christianity by reading books about it     These early Catholics were killed in the 18th and 19th centuries by the Joseon Dynasty which tried to shut the Korean Peninsula off from Western influence Police in Seoul declined to give an estimate of the crowd size but the Vatican said about 800000 people had turned out The number was significant given that Catholics represent only about 10 percent of South Koreas 50 million people The Mass kicked off a busy day for Francis as he passed the halfway mark of his fiveday South Korea visit In the afternoon he traveled to a religious community that cares for severely disabled Koreans and prayed briefly at a monument to aborted babies    a strong albeit silent gesture from a pope who prefers to stress other aspects of church teaching rather than emphasize hotbutton culture war issues like abortion The Mass in Seoul though was one of the highlights of his trip providing Francis with an opportunity to stress how the lessons of Koreas early martyrs were relevant today for Koreas church which is small but growing and is seen as a model for the rest of the world They were willing to make great sacrifices and let themselves be stripped of whatever kept them from Christ    possessions and land prestige and honor    for they knew that Christ alone was their true treasure he said They challenge us to think about what if anything we ourselves would be willing to die for Francis praised in particular the fact that laypeople were so crucial to the churchs foundation and growth in Korea    a theme he stressed later in the day when he met with leaders of Korean lay movements The church is counting on such laymen and laywomen to spread the faith in Asia which the Vatican considers the future of the church The main reason for Francis visit to South Korea in fact was to attend an Asian Catholic youth festival the church sees such rallies as a crucial way of inspiring the next generation of Catholics to evangelize Today as ever the church needs credible lay witnesses to the saving truth of the Gospel Francis said stressing in particular the need for their outreach to focus on the poor and most marginalized A collective cheer erupted from the masses when Francis declared the 124 blessed    the first step toward possible sainthood Many of the women in the crowd wore lace veils others sported paper sun visors with Papa Francesco written across them protecting them from the overcast hazy skies The scene was impressive with thousands of people neatly packed into fencedin sections leading away from the altar which was set up in front of Gwanghwamun the south gate to Gyeongbokgung palace with mountains looming above and the presidential Blue House on the lower slope Police in green vests stood guard along the barricades and volunteers handed out water to guard against the warm humid temperatures Im so thankful that the pope visited South Korea said 75yearold Yu Pilsang a Catholic who was trying to get a glimpse of Francis just outside the police barricades But Im so sorry that all the ways to see the pope are blocked I came to hear at least his voice En route to the altar before Mass Francis stopped his opentopped car so he could get out and bless a group of families who lost loved ones in the sinking of the Sewol ferry in April in which more than 300 people most of them high school students were killed On his white cassock Francis wore a yellow ribbon given to him by the families a day earlier when he met with them privately to try to console them We want the truth read a yellow banner a reference to the families demands for an independent inquiry into the sinking Officials said 400 families had been invited to the Mass The main figure in the group that was beatified is Paul Yun JiChung who was born in 1759 and was among the earliest Catholics on the peninsula He was beheaded in 1791    the first Korean martyr    after he violated the traditional Confucian funeral rites for his mother In all the Joseon Dynasty killed about 10000 Catholics for refusing to renounce their faith Historians say Koreas early believers were struck by the idea of a religion that preached universal equality in divine eyes at a time when the nobilitys discriminatory hierarchical system brutally exploited ordinary people St John Paul II canonized another 103 martyrs during a visit to South Korea in 1984 Francis began his day by praying at a monument in Seoul commemorating the martyrs on the site where many of them were killed Even nonCatholics turned out for the Mass impressed by Francis humble gestures and call for South Koreans to pay more attention to the poor than their own material gain I do not know much about Catholics and South Koreas Catholic history but it seems that the pope is making sure to reach out equally to everyone said Eom Yaesung 49 a Protestant who said Francis had inspired her to make changes in her own life I plan to do volunteering and a lot of sharing so that when I look back at my life 10 years from now I will think that the popes visit motivated me to change Eom said ___ Associated Press writers Youkyung Lee and

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/08/19/why-is-new-york-times-pushing-pot/," The legalizepot bandwagon has a new conductor With the singlemindedness of Hillary Clinton seeking the Oval Office the New York Times is pushing for legalization of marijuana The paper has published no fewer than eight editorials or opeds approving speedy decriminalization of pot in just the past few weeks Whats it all about

Let us dismiss conjecture that the Times is gunning for a Public Service Pulitzer which they have not won for a decade Instead two thoughts occur  First the Times may view decriminalizing marijuana as the next great progressive wave following on the heels of samesex marriage and in earlier years abortion rights A smaller wave to be sure but one that liberals and libertarians can ride with enthusiasm     A second reason may be more compelling  the Times needs to build its online circulation to survive What better way than to embrace a cause especially popular with Millenials the prime readers of news online and not a group especially excited about the Grey Lady The Times enthusiasm for legal pot knows no bounds and entertains few doubts Except in their own organization which reportedly drugtests job applicants and rejects those testing positive for pot Which is remarkable since most people well versed in the subject acknowledge serious risks associated with habitual ingestion of marijuana In fact a coalition of groups opposed to legalization  including The American Society of Addiction Medicine The National Association of Drug Court Professionals and the National Families in Action  ran a fullpage ad in the Times countering the papers position That might give them pause but no The Times has trampled most objections with breezy assertions unbecoming a serious news organization For instance We believe that the evidence is overwhelming that addiction and dependence are relatively minor problems And yet the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health reports that of the 73 million persons aged 12 or older classified with illicit drug dependence or abuse in 2012 43 million persons had marijuana dependence or abuse So not so minor after all Claims that marijuana is a gateway to more dangerous drugs are as fanciful as the Reefer Madness images of murder rape and suicide The Foundation for a Drugfree World notes on their website The vast majority of cocaine users 999 began by first using a gateway drug like marijuana cigarettes or alcohol Larry Kudlow who has successfully battled drug addiction for over a decade reports that I hear time and again from young people coming into the rooms to get sober how pot smoking led to harder drugs such as cocaine and heroin There are legitimate concerns about marijuana on the development of adolescent brains For that reason we advocate the prohibition of sales to people under 21 Yes there are now numerous studies indicating that regular ingestion of marijuana by young people leads to an irreversible reduction in IQ as well as memory problems and possible serious brain disorders like schizophrenia According to the American Medical Association Heavy cannabis use in adolescence causes persistent impairments in neurocognitive performance and IQ and use is associated with increased rates of anxiety mood and psychotic thought disorders Even proweed zealots would have a hard time arguing that legalizing pot will not increase its use by young people even if it is still illegal for minors The National Survey of Drug Use and Health the source of most druguse data in the US notes One factor that can influence whether youths will use tobacco alcohol or illicit drugs is the extent to which they believe these substances might cause them harm If Mom is smoking a joint while watching TV after dinner what kind of message does that send For the Times pot legalization is also worthy since enforcement of our laws is racist falling disproportionately on young black men ruining their lives and creating new generations of career criminals  The paper maintains leaning on a report prepared by the ACLU that blacks and whites use pot at the same rate but that blacks are 37 times more likely than whites to be arrested for possession But the Times admits that only about one percent of the people behind bars in our country are there for charges relating to possessing or selling marijuana  As other have noted if todays sentencing guidelines need to be changed lets do so Altering how we enforce the laws is a different debate than whether the law should be eliminated Why is the New York Times putting themselves in the midst of this debate Because like many other newspapers the Times is in trouble  Recent results have been depressed by large investments in strategic initiatives like its struggle to build its online presence CEO Mark Thompson commenting on the last quarter said We also know that longterm digital revenue growth depends on the reach and depth of engagement of our digital audience Who is that audience Certainly not Boomers who still read papers Its the 77 million Millenials about the same number as Boomers who catch up on current events via iPhone or iPad  and not typically from the New York Times They migrate to sites like Vice Mashable and BuzzFeed or explainer sites like Vox and FiveThirtyEight There are also aggregators attempting to make news more fun to read  like theSkimm and those offering a crowdsourced component like Mic Some of these specifically target Millenials and have upended conventional thinking about news gathering The Grey Lady a nickname they may want to ditch is struggling to compete BuzzFeed for instance is now valued at 850 million or about half the market cap of the New York Times has 550 employees is expanding overseas and has been adding aggressively to their news staff No one can know who the winners will be in the tumultuous media shakeup thats underway but the Times for sure needs to broaden its readership and needs Millenials Jumping into the middle of an issue this group cares about  like pot  makes sense According to Pew 69 of Millenials support legalizing weed  more than any other age group Another reason the Times may be positioning themselves to curry favor with Millenials is this those age 18 to 33 tend liberal on social issues but are fiscally conservative and not wedded to the Democrat brand Some 50 of that group considers themselves independents while only 39 of GenX 3449 and 37 of Boomers describe themselves that way  In other words they think for themselves Thats a serious challenge for the New York Times   Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNewscom She is a financial columnist who also writes for The Fiscal Times For more visit LizPeekcom

NEW POLL DEMS FARING WORSE THAN 2010
Whats the point of generic ballot poll questions After all there are no generic candidates And thats precisely how candidates win in difficult environments in this age of nationalized elections They define their opponents as out of the mainstream and themselves as independent of their own parties But in the closing days of an election such as this one there may be no metric more valuable since it is one of the only insights we have into how latebreaking voters will cast their ballots in close contests If candidates havent succeeded in defining those terms by now especially given the surge in early voting it is unlikely they will be able to And if the late breakers go as the new WaPoABC News poll suggests Democrats will be headed to bed early on Nov 4 while Republicans are uncorking the celebratory champagne The 6point advantage for the GOP among likely voters would be enough to flip several tossup races to Republican candidates and might even be enough to shoo a couple of more elephants into the barn including Scott Brown in New Hampshire

WaPo With multiple crises confronting the country  a majority now says the governments ability to deal with big problems has declined in the past few years Among those who say this more  by 3 to 1  blame President Obama and the Democrats rather than Republicans in Congress

Double double toil and trouble  Struggling with female voters and young voters Democrats fare worse in the latest WaPoABC poll than they did at the same point ahead of the disastrous 2010 election and at the same level as the punishing 1994 midterm elections that cost them both houses of Congress Without any significant increase in Democratic intensity since the previous polling cycle the auguries are getting dire for the presidents party

OBAMA VISITS WARD HE CARRIED BY 99 POINTS
How narrow is President Obamas appeal this cycle Just consider where is making one of his only campaign appearances Milwaukee JournalSentinel When President Barack Obama arrives in Milwaukee on Tuesday his task will be to help mobilize AfricanAmericans and other key Democratic voting groups who still give him positive ratings despite his lackluster standing nationwide The president will be visiting North Division High School in an overwhelmingly AfricanAmerican ward that he carried with 99 of the vote in 2012 outpolling Republican Mitt Romney 843 to 5

WSJ The states the president will be visiting  Michigan Connecticut Maine Pennsylvania and Wisconsin  are not home to this cycles most critical races Indeed he wont be campaigning for Democrats in any of the Senate races that could decide which party controls the chamber for the last two years of his presidency The only Senate candidate Mr Obama is currently scheduled to appear with before Election Day is Democrat Gary Peters in Michigan who is so far ahead that Republicans pulled their advertising in the race this month Thats a marked departure from a few months ago when White House officials left open the possibility of Mr Obama campaigning in Louisiana for incumbent Sen Mary Landrieu DLa

Tennessee state Sen Joe Carr could be the next Dave Brat Like Brat the upstart who overcame massive funding and namerecognition disadvantages to knock off sitting House majority leader Eric Cantor Carr is running in an open primary against a moderate Republican who has long angered conservative activists And like it was for Brat in June immigration has been a hot topic on the trail and drawn national support to his cause But unlike Brat Carrs opponent Sen Lamar Alexander RTenn saw him coming

Polls close in Tennessee at 8 pm ET You can track the results with the Tennessee Secretary of State and watch Fox for coverage of tonights key primary contests online at FoxNewscom Big turnout  There are early signs of a big turnout boost in the Volunteer State where Alexander a former governor a former US secretary of Education and onetime presidential candidate is seeking a third term at the age of 74 Carr a state senator from the conservative stronghold of Rutherford County south of Nashville has been running long and hard but only recently caught the attention of national conservatives drawn to his emphasis on opposing the Alexanderbacked immigration compromise legislation of 2013 Both Carr andAlexander have been running full tilt and getting lots of media attention in what is the last realistic hope for GOP insurgents to unseat a sitting senator this cycle Alexander has been highlighting his opposition to ObamaCare and touting his ties to the rebirth of Republicanism in the longtime Democratic bastion while Carr has stayed hard after the immigration issue

The Tennessean State Rep Joe Carr added that the record turnout in early voting during which more than 550000 ballots were cast could be an encouraging sign We think thats because we have a very competitive ballot at the top he said

Flinn is still in and thats trouble for Alexander in Memphis  Memphis doctor and regional media mogul George Shea Flinn has spent about 1 million on his longshot Senate bid and continued a lowintensity but steady campaign schedule Flinn who owns seven radio stations and three television stations in the state has persisted in the race despite meagre showings in preprimary polls But if Carr catches fire Flinn could play a significant role Flinns presence will cost incumbent Sen Lamar Alexander votes among more moderate Republicans in Memphis and the rest of Shelby County Metro Memphis is a Democratic stronghold and has a low concentration of Republicans but Shelby County is the largest by far of any county in the state and will deliver the biggest cache of votes today  perhaps 100000 of 800000 cast If Flinn gets some favoriteson status there Alexander may have to make up the difference among more conservative voters elsewhere in the state

Flinns Memphis radio station WHBQAM 560 was the first in the world to play an Elvis Presley song

A Tennessee titan who doesnt score well  The Tennessean If Republican Sen Lamar Alexander wins it will be in spite of the unkind comments some leading conservative groups make about his Senate voting record Typical of them is American Conservative Union Alexanders scores hit a low point with the group in 2013 when he earned a 60 percent rating He tied Republican Sen Thad Cochran of Mississippi for the lowest score among Republican senators facing a primary challenge in 2014 His lifetime ACU score has gone from 89 percent a decade ago to 76 percent Some prominent conservative groups give Alexander even worse scores than ACU Heritage Action an arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation gives Alexander a 49 percent score for the 113th Congress

COUNTIES TO WATCH
Rutherford  Carr needs a blowout here in his home county  perhaps 80 percent of the vote  if he expects to stave off Alexanders expected strength in the more moderate Davidson County home to Nashville

Knox County  The home to the University of Tennessee this is where Alexander can put the race away While suburbanites and rural residents in the western part of the sprawling county tend to be very conservative the more populous eastern portion is a haven for moderate Republicanism exactly Alexanders brand

Hamilton County  Neither candidate can claim a base in Chattanooga Alexanders colleague Sen Bob Corker is the former mayor and has pitched in for his senior senator there but voters also tend to be quite conservative in this mountainous region A key battleground in the race

DOWN BALLOT DRAMA
If turnout is unusually high it wont just be because of the Senate stakes While Republican Gov Bill Haslams reelection bid has been a snoozer two other contests have been intense One involves a deeply embattled incumbent House member whose sweeping rural district also happens to be in the heart of the battleground in the Senate race

Scandal survivor  National Journal Rep Scott DesJarlais RTenn slept with his former patients encouraged one to have an abortion and twice urged his exwife to have an abortion But oddly enough when it came time for the Tennessee congressman to run for reelection the prolife movement that had the most reason to despise him has instead given him close to a free pass Once considered a longshot DesJarlais is now seen by some local political strategists as an even bet to win his Thursday primary against state Sen Jim Tracy

OBAMA DUCKS ON MASS AMNESTY PLAN
President Obama at a prevacationpress conference left open the possibility of issuing millions of work visas for illegal immigrants Obama ducked a question about the controversial plan but said that he would scour over laws and regulations to see what authority he has to address the underresourced immigration system But the proposal would cross over from the selective enforcement that has allowed Obama to grant an indefinite amnesty to some 500000 immigrants who came to the US illegally as minors While Obamas decision caused plenty of outrage on the right the administration has been able to claim that Obama is simply prioritizing enforcement in the face of insufficient resources But granting visas to those previously deemed ineligible would not be shifting resources it would be expending resources in pursuit of a policy goal Its a move that would please his political base but also cause widespread anxiety about Obamas increasing tendency toward regency Obama is expected to roll out his immigration plan after Labor Day

IRS extends scandal soaked tax program for illegals  Daily Caller The Internal Revenue Service IRS quietly changed regulations to allow more undocumented immigrants to keep their taxpayer status through a program that is rife with fraud and abuse and to delay deactivation of immigrant taxpayer status until 2016 The IRS now prevents peoples Individual Taxpayer Identification Number ITIN from automatically expiring after five years as previously mandated Now immigrants can keep their ITIN so long as they pay taxes at least once in a fiveyear period Reports came out during the IRS scandal linking ITIN fraud to billions in lost taxpayer dollars The IRS was forced to reform the ITIN program at the start of 2013  but this new regulation undoes that reform

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/04/07/bill-oreilly-why-america-changing-so-dramatically/, By Bill OReilly Everywhere I go folks ask me what has happened to their country And its true That America is not the way it used to be We have gone from a traditional country to a secular society where politically correct thought dominates at least in the mass media     Now the founding fathers envisioned a fair country where the public school system would promote freedom would teach history government and civic behavior so that Americans would be better able to govern themselves What the founders did not want was the government intruding on peoples lives Thats quite clear in the Constitution For example no religion is to be imposed on any American thats because in Europe bloody wars were fought all the time over religion Thousands of people fled to the New World to escape the oppression However it was quite clear that the founders based the justice system in the New World on JudeoChristian tenets Thats why a sculpture of Moses holding the 10 Commandments adorns the Supreme Court building in Washington But today you could never put old Moses and the Commandments up on a government wall anywhere The Secular Progressives would scream You are imposing religion if you do that because Islam and other theologies do not believe in the 10 Commandments Enter Jesus the most famous human being who has ever lived But if youre a child attending an American public school and living in a secular home chances are you know little or nothing about Jesus because the schools are even frightened frightened to mention his name At Bridgeport High School in West Virginia they had a picture of Jesus hanging on the wall There he is For more than 30 years 2006 the ACLU and Americans United both fanatical secular groups demanded that picture be removed There was a big lawsuit and Jesus lost He is out of there Now Talking Points has pointed out many times there is a big difference between philosophy and religion As I make quite clear in my book Killing Jesus the Nazarene was a philosopher on this earth Some believed he was the messiah others did not But his message of brotherhood was philosophical and quite the opposite of the Romans who controlled the world Thus Jesus was executed for going up against the established authority Dont you think American kids should know that Should know the philosophy behind our justice system But no  secular Progressives have wiped that out Thats why I wrote the last days of Jesus for the kids So they could find out some important information about the man Jesus Now here is a bigger picture for the country When you have a Secular Progressive society as opposed to a traditional one behavior changes fewer judgments are made more lenient criminal sentences handed out abortion becomes more acceptable drug use and sale becomes more acceptable marriage changes and so does the conduct of children because they pick up what the adults are doing And with a progressive president and a very leftleaning Democratic Party these days you have an acceleration of secularism The outcome is likely to be a much weaker nation Less discipline less motivation less generosity because the secular religion preaches Its all about me there is no greater good or greater power So the next time you ask me where your country went Ill tell you to read this Talking Points Memo OReilly Factor hosted by Bill OReilly airs on Weekdays at 8PM ET on Fox News Channel,2014-04-04T00:00-04:00,abortion

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/11/03/midterm-elections-races-across-country-where-latino-vote-will-matter/,"With the 2014 elections upon us political campaigns are making lastditch efforts to win over voters as they prepare to head to the ballot This years races feature a number of Latino candidates  both incumbents and upstarts  who could help to decide the next trend in American politics Here Fox News Latino breaks down the key races to watch Arizona 7th Congressional District Ruben Gallego D vs Jos Pealosa I With no Republican in the race and a Libertarian opponent with little campaign cash or name recognition Gallego was considered a shoein for retiring Rep Ed Pastors seat The frustration among many Latinos over immigration inaction by both Congress and President Obama however could persuade many to sit out the elections Pealosa is arguing that that inaction is exactly why they need to vote  for someone who is an Independent This election is not over and Ruben Gallego should not take voters for granted he said last month California Governor Jerry Brown D vs Neel Kashkari R As Election Day approaches Brown the incumbent enjoys a solid lead over his Republican challenger a former US Treasury official Brown is riding a wave of kudos over ending the longstanding state deficit and making a surplus the new normal It meant raising taxes and targeting loopholes that benefited business however Brown has a relatively good relationship with Californias Latinos many of whom link the GOP to former Gov Pete Wilsons efforts in the 1990s to crack down on undocumented immigrants through Proposition 187 an initiative that called for denying health care education and other services Kashkari has played up his Indian roots in his campaign portraying himself as an immigrant and someone who is more representative of California than Brown whom he depicts as privileged Browns father was also governor 21st Congressional District David Valadao R vs Amanda Renteria D The district tends to alternate between parties In 2012 it split going to President Obama and Valadao To be reelected Valadao will have to once again overcome demographics Democrats account for nearly 75 percent of registered voters in the Hispanicdominated district The Central Valley is dubbed the bread basket of the state and country but it finds itself in the middle of one of the most devastating droughts in history Both are pushing water measures Renteria a 27 billion water bond that would provide storage for water and fund projects transferring water from Northern California Valadao introduced the Water Delivery Act which passed the House and would preserve hundreds of billions of gallons of water being flushed into the ocean Colorado Senate Mark Udall D vs Cory Gardner R The incumbent Udall is going allout to court Latinos as he battles challenger Gardner Udall launched a milliondollar round of Spanishlanguage television ads that are running through Election Day Colorado has emerged as ground zero for the fight between Republicans and Democrats for control of the US Senate Udall has had Bill Clinton Michelle Obama and Mass Sen Elizabeth Warren campaign for him while former Fla Gov Jeb Bush and NJ Gov Chris Christie have stumped for GardnerRepublicans need to pick up six additional seats in November to win control of the Senate from Democrats The latest polls for Colorados race show Gardner leading Udall by a couple of points within the margins of error Florida Governor Rick Scott R vs Charlie Crist D With the incumbent Scott and former governor Crist virtually deadlocked in the polls Hispanic voters in Palm Beach Broward and MiamiDade counties as well as the crucial I4 corridor in central Florida could determine who wins Thats why both candidates picked Hispanic running mates for lieutenant governor according to party leaders Scott made CubanAmerican Carlos LopezCantera the first Hispanic lieutenant governor in state history Countering Scotts selection Crist announced in July that MiamiDade Democratic Party chief and state party vicechairwoman Annette TaddeoGoldstein whose mother is Colombian would be his running mate 26th Congressional District Joe Garca D vs Carlos Curbelo R Incumbent Garca and challenger Curbelo insist they are running on the issues affecting the 850000 residents in their South Florida district but the ongoing backandforth over which one is more corrupt has not been exactly edifying Not only has this been one of the most bruising political matchups of the year its also been one of the longest Curbelo a MiamiDade School Boardmember announced in July of last year that he would run and he has focused on the criminal investigations against Garcas former chief of staff and excampaign manager Jeff Garcia no relation Last year Jeff Garcia pleaded guilty to ballot fraud and served 65 days in jail Rep Garca and Democratic operatives have countered that in 2009 Curbelo  who earns a living as a political consultant and lobbyist  improperly transferred ownership of his company Capitol Gains to his wife Georgia Michelle Nunn D vs David Perdue R With more than 9 percent of the Georgia population identifying themselves as Hispanic or Latino the Senate race between former nonprofit executive Michelle Nunn a Democrat and American businessman David Perdue a Republican is now more influenced by Hispanics than ever before It is one of the races where political analysts and members of the Latino community have noted that the percentage of Latino voters in the state could make a gamechanging difference While both candidates have ideological differences on immigration both are calling for a more secure border and are vague on how to carry out the states strict immigration law Nunn believes we need comprehensive immigration reform that secures our borders and provides an accountable pathway to citizenship that requires those currently living here go to the back of the line pass a background check learn English and pay back taxes her website page says Perdue places more of a focus on securing the border saying on his website page the debate in Washington over illegal immigration has become unnecessarily complicatedsimply put we need to strictly enforce current laws and any new laws should be straightforward focusing on true border security Nevada Brian Sandoval R vs Bob Goodman D Nevada Gov Brian Sandoval is heading into Novembers midterm election with such strong polling numbers and popularity that the Democratic Party did not even bother to put up a serious challenger Bob Goodman who was former Gov Mike OCallaghans director of economic development in the 1970s is the partys official candidate though polls show him trailing the governor by double digits Goodman won the Democratic primary with 25 percent of the vote five points behind the None of These Candidates option that appears on Nevada ballots Sandoval clinched the GOP one with 90 percent Goodman knows a victory at this point seems like a pipe dream but says he is running for the sake of democracy New Hampshire Marilinda Garcia R vs Annie Kuster D The New Hampshire 2nd Congressional District race pits a conservative rising star with the strong backing of national Republicans against a Democratic stalwart in this New England state In a recent debate Republican Marilinda Garcia criticized Democratic incumbent Annie Kuster for not holding town hall meetings and accused her of putting President Barack Obamas agenda ahead of constituent concerns Kuster responded that she meets with constituents every day visiting businesses and hosting round table discussions She described helping farmers win changes to proposed food safety regulations and argued its Garcia who has ignored constituents by missing about a third of the votes during her time in the state Legislature The candidates also tangled over a Kuster campaign ad that says Garcia wants to abolish the federal Department of Education and supports banning abortion In 2008 she voted for a bill that would have made it a felony for anyone to perform an abortion when there is a reasonable expectation that the fetus would be viable if delivered New Mexico Susana Martinez R vs Gary King D For Republicans 40 percent is the magic threshold That is the share of Latino votes the theory goes that a Republican presidential candidate should get to significantly bolster the chance of a victory New Mexico Gov Susana Martinez the nations first female Hispanic governor has proven that she is in that small circle of Republicans with a national profile who can generate such a level of support among Latino voters Martinez is running for reelection against New Mexico Attorney General Gary King a Democrat whose father served as governor in the state A recent poll in the Albuquerque Journal showed Martinez who is seeking a second term getting 40 percent of Latinos who indicated they planned to vote King a twoterm attorney general would get 50 percent of the vote The others say theyre undecided Latinos comprise 47 percent of New Mexicos total population North Carolina Kay Hagan D vs Thom Tillis R Latinos in North Carolina might become the determining factor in deciding who wins North Carolinas Senate race Thom Tillis a Republican businessman who is the state speaker of the House and Democratic incumbent Senator Kay Hagan are battling in a state where Hispanics are 9 percent of the population  having more voting power than ever before Tillis campaign website says the former speaker believes in doing more to secure our borders and opposes amnesty Hagan on the other hand voted in support of the Senates Gang of Eight bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform CIR bill in 2013 With nearly 900000 Latinos living in North Carolinas population of about 10 million some Hispanics are skeptical but hopeful about how their community will influence the Senate election Texas Greg Abbott R vs Wendy Davis D Current Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott faces a tough sell beyond the demographics Divisive Republican measures hes backed have been viewed as hostile toward Hispanics and particularly felt on the southern Texas border Abbott who is married to a MexicanAmerican also has supported the deployment of 1000 National Guard troops along the border to block illegal immigration which Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto called reprehensible Hes also fighting in court to uphold a new state law that forced the closure of the only abortion clinic in 300 miles But Abbott is getting help The Republican National Committee has been dumping 50000 a month into Texas to recruit Hispanic voters who went for President Barack Obama more than 2to1 two years ago Pete Gallego D vs Will Hurd R They call it the only true competitive race in Texas in this years election Its the states 23rd congressional district where no party really ever has a lock on voters Firstterm incumbent Democrat Rep Pete Gallego is fighting to hold on to his seat which he won in 2012 by beating thenincumbent congressional freshman Quico Canseco a Republican His challenger is former CIA operative Will Hurd who won a competitive primary and is getting strong support from national Republican and conservative groups GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney beat President Barack Obama in this district in 2012 5148 percent US Sen Ted Cruz a Tea Party Republican also came out the winner in this district And so Gallego who is 52 said he is pushing hard to win reelection in this vast district which spans more than 800 miles of the USMexico border and includes about a quarter of the land area of Texas Roughly 70 percent of the districts population is Latino  something that clearly has not guaranteed a Democratic victory George P Bush R vs John Cook D George P Bush the 38yearold scion of the countrys most enduring political dynasty is running for the post of Texas land commissioner and is widely expected to win by a large margin Unlike his rival Democrat John Cook a 68yearold who served on the El Paso City Council for three terms and as mayor for two terms Bush has never before held a political office The job of land commissioner is said to be one of the most powerful in Texas and has proven to be a stepping stone to bigger and better positions If Bush wins he would be continuing a family tradition His father Jeb was governor of Florida and is widely expected to run for president in 2016 his uncle George W was Texas governor and US president his grandfather George HW was CIA director vicepresident under Ronald Reagan and then president himself and his greatgrandfather Prescott was a US senator West Virginia Alex Mooney R vs Nick Casey D West Virginia could soon see its first ever Latino congressional representative His name is Alex Mooney and his mother is from CubaIf he were to win this race  which at the moment is viewed as a tossup  Mooney a conservative Republican running against Nick Casey a former chairman of the West Virginia Democratic Party would make history in a state that has the distinction of having the smallest percentage of Latinos in the entire nation Latinos make up just 12 percent  or slightly more than 22268  of the Eastern Panhandle states population Follow us on twittercomfoxnewslatino

man Youre anti war You said you were an anti war activist Now what do you do  do you send American  do you put Americans lives at risk  BOB BECKEL COHOST Well first I think its a little premature to say that were not doing anything Weve sent military people over there CROSSTALK BECKEL Well wait a minute you dont know everything thats going on Something like this theres a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes and the public doesnt know about My guess is theres a lot of Americans a lot of intel going over there and its a lot more than a hashtag Im a little surprised by old Rush which by the way using Rush is such an unusual thing for the show But the  he said its Nigerian girls What does he mean by that BOLLING Im not sure Im not going to put words in Rushs mouth JESSE WATTERS COHOST I think he means they are not American girls DANA PERINO COHOST So the question is the hashtag is bringbackourgirls Hes being specific to our  meaning our  CROSSTALK PERINO But I think that is actually just a hashtag that started actually in Nigeria It didnt start here BOLLING Dana John McCain said we should mobilize our assets He even suggested using our drone capabilities Your thoughts on that PERINO So if we had the intel and we could have a strike that where you could take out the terrorists and protect innocent life then yes of course That is exactly what that kind of technology should be used for You know how this  the hashtag thing if nothing else is being done then I agree that it is ridiculous However there are ways to mobilize things Sometimes it takes a little bit of time but I was thinking about the One Campaign and global antipoverty efforts have started like early 2001 2002 2003 and everybody wore those little bracelets and it wasnt because we thought that the bracelet was actually going to do anything but it was part of a solidarity with a movement to move forward And if you think of the Green Revolution in Iran remember that was really fueled by Twitter And one of the criticisms of President Obama and the administration was that they did not do enough to try to capitalize on the social media spreading of that message So by itself does the hashtag do anything Absolutely not Does it make you look cool if youre a part of the bringbackourgirls thing Yes What they should have done is why not  if you really want to not make it partisan find somebody else from across the aisle or get a lot of women together from Republicans and Democrats and whoever else and do it altogether Instead its a thing thats being mocked from the right to the left and vice versa left to right BOLLING Jesse what about the celebs the Hollywood elites now jumping on the bandwagon Is that bandwagon activism And if it is maybe we want that WATTERS I mean I think they are taking their cues from Michelle Obama obviously Kim Kardashian all of a sudden she starts tweeting about this You kind feel like  BECKEL She doesnt know where Nigeria is CROSSTALK WATTERS Of course not Anything that makes these celebrities feel good it makes them feel connected It makes them feel emphatic But they dont know the difference between Nigeria and Angola But if Michelle Obama have gone up and said whatabouttheSyriangirls They would have done the same thing I think its selective outrage BOLLING Do we risk American lives to save these Nigerian women WATTERS I mean logistically they have 300 girls captive If you go in theyre just going to start slaughtering them So I dont know if it makes a ton of sense But like you said theyre going to get intel in these guys and in a few weeks were going to send a drone to northern Nigeria and just zap these guys BOLLING Were going to drone their butts All right Lets move on  CROSSTALK PERINO One other thing  in 2005 a point in our history that doesnt get as much attention as it probably deserves 2005 about 200 marines were sent to Liberia and they liberated that country from a dictator 200 marines I dont believe there was any loss of life from our side So with intel and our capabilities and technology you can actually  if you decide its in your national interests you can do more BECKEL I know you want to move on but just very quickly the Arab Spring literally was directed by Twitter BOLLING It was certainly organized It certainly organized  GUILFOYLE Dana just a quick followup for your statement What do you think Do you feel that this is something that can make a legitimate case that it is in our national interests PERINO The girls in Nigeria GUILFOYLE Yes PERINO I think so I could be persuaded but I actually would say thats true in Syria as well because I think when you have 8000 children killed by chemical weapons  some by chemical weapon in Syria then yes I think we should have done something there too GUILFOYLE There as well BOLLING I have to move on the next one On Benghazi today Democrats still havent decided whether theyll participate in a new investigation into the deadly attack on our consulate Nancy Pelosi and her liberal colleagues dont seem to think Americans deserve answers BEGIN VIDEO CLIP REP NANCY PELOSI DCA MINORITY LEADER This is a stunt This is a political stunt Either people have gotten tired of Benghazi but they never knew about it in the first place So lets not be accomplices to this diversionary tactic END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Well Democrats have been accusing Republicans of trying to fundraise off Benghazi Tom Cotton an Army vet took to the House floor today to expose their hypocrisy BEGIN VIDEO CLIP REP TOM COTTON R ARKANSAS When I was leading troops in Iraq in 2006 men and women were being shot at and blown at by al Qaeda where was the outrage as they fundraise endlessly off the Iraq war Where was the outrage as they viciously attacked our commanders Where was the outrage when they said that soldiers were war criminals END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING What about it Bob BECKEL Well some of those comments that were made obviously way out of place but lets keep in mind the difference between Iraq and whats going on in Benghazi there were 6500 Americans killed in Iraq and 32000 injured badly And so I think its a little different when you are talking about trying to stop a war at that size and you are talking about Benghazi I dont think its equivalent BOLLING Its different WATTERS The one thing I think its not just that they were fundraising off Iraq theyre fundraising school shootings Sandy Hook Columbine and then to all of a sudden say you are not able to fund raise off Benghazi which is a legitimate scandal is really hypocritical Both sides do it It does look sleazy You raised money after 911 you raised money after Katrina These things happen in politics but its a little hypocritical for the left to go after the Republicans I think the Republicans stuck to their guns theyre not going to cave on this I think the left thought that the media was going to echo this sentiment and they didnt So I think theyre going to  BECKEL Yes the same congressman said that Republicans shouldnt be raising money on Benghazi and they are BOLLING No no Im not sure he said that Im saying  BECKEL Yes he did BOLLING OK But let me put this way I dont think its consistent across all Republicans Some say they wont raise money off Benghazi and some say they will And let me frame this properly  what they say raise money off of Benghazi that sounds terrible What they mean is theyre going to run and say Im a Republican I want more answers into what happened in Benghazi So therefore you should elect more people like me versus a Democrat who doesnt even want answers in Benghazi GUILFOYLE Thats how you frame it Is that not OK to do Because maybe there are Americans out there I want to vote for a candidate who is actually interested in getting to the bottom of investigations and not saying its just politics and actually want to hold an administration accountable The problem is transparency It sounds good to me BOLLING Dana should Republicans shy away from raising money in something as important as Benghazi PERINO Not my style I like how you frame it I can understand that in terms of judgment and character you should want more people like me in Washington compared to people like this who call getting to the bottom of something a stunt I actually understand that Now there is a select committee and Trey Gowdy is in the chair position Because he is so credible and he is wellrespected on both sides I think that everybody else at least on the political side of things just follow his lead And if I were there I would say Trey Gowdy and his spokesperson are the only two people that are speaking on this And if they ask questions without speechifying no theatrics Remember Bob the whole like watermelon and the gun thing during the Vince Foster situation that was a stunt and the theatrical event that didnt help on the PR side I dont think they need to One other thing just  when they  when Democrats say This is a stunt dont pay attention that is a message aimed directly to the left and to the media to other media to say dont bother covering this but I would like to propose something I would love  I would help organize a debate between someone like Steve Hayes and pick anybody from the mainstream media that was supposed to be covering Benghazi one neutral moderator and let them see  let the American people decide if this is just a stunt or a legitimate investigation BOLLING Hang on Jesse I know you want to jump in Just do me a favor One quick time around because we have another topic Should the Democrats show up yes or no WATTERS I would say yes they should if they dont  look theres going to be seven Republicans kicking Hillary Clintons butt out there If theyre not there to change the narrative and give her a little break during the hearing then theyre going to get screwed PERINO Agreed And so they dont know what else is out there That document that surprised everybody last week that was withheld by the administration where there is one document theres probably more BOLLING Bob should they show up BECKEL Absolutely not Theres only two questions left Where did the video come from And who did the standdown Thats it period CROSSTALK WATTERS And why wasnt there security at the embassy BOLLING And KG should they show up Maybe to get those answers GUILFOYLE Absolutely Youve got to show up You have all the facts all the information Otherwise how can you say youre a credible candidate if youre not willing to go in there and answer questions and participate BECKEL Because its a campaign rally for Republicans GUILFOYLE Well thats your case BOLLING Lets do this one  from Boko Haram to Benghazi to Beverly Hills where protests are growing wider over the sultan of Bruneis Sharia law Celebrities and others are boycotting the sultans famed Beverly Hills Hotel along with the Hotel BelAir after he imposed the harsh Islamic law in his country Jesse why dont you take this one first WATTERS Its funny to me how the left is all of a sudden realizing that fanatical Muslims hate homosexuals and hate women PERINO Yes WATTERS And its a little hypocritical for Hollywood who perpetuates violence against women in all their movies Ands theyre all of a sudden outrage that women are mistreated And speaking of this the homosexual situation theres a gay teen pedophile ring going around right now in Hollywood and theyre circling the wagons around these people out there But all of a sudden everyone is outrage I mean Muslims INAUDIBLE people all of the time all over the world but if youre going to stone a Muslim who happens to be gay then Hollywood gets upset Its crazy BOLLING But its OK Look thats American protest right there right Free market PERINO I dont understand I agree with Jesse like now the complaint is that they dont want to go to this hotel anymore I mean there are plenty of places in Hollywood where you can pay 22 for a martini that they are not looking for opportunity in that regard BOLLING Its famed Its got history Bob Have you been to Beverly Hills Hotel BECKEL Yes I had but I didnt know it was owned by Brunei Listen I would find every single economic investment that Brunei has got and I would boycott it I would take anybody any country that has Sharia law and I would stop doing economic trade with them including the Saudis I might add Weve just allowed this  Sharia law is  it is the most amazing human rights violator on anything thats ever been known in the face of this earth And therefore you reward by taking everything away from them BOLLING Its so difficult KG The global economy so intertwined Theres no way of  theres no way of calling out everything they own GUILFOYLE No but if you are made aware of it and you find out theres plenty of great hotels in Los Angeles like the Peninsula or Four Seasons So I would say there True BOLLING INAUDIBLE GUILFOYLE Well you know theyre not into Sharia law BOLLING Were going to leave  lets hope theyre not into Sharia law Next on The Five some controversial comments today from Pope Francis regarding world poverty Well tell you what he said Plus Mitt Romney breaks from some in his party on the minimum wage Why he thinks it should be raised when The Five returns COMMERCIAL BREAK PERINO Pope Francis is asking the world to do more to help people out of poverty and his words today are making some headlines Earlier the pontiff called on governments around the globe to redistribute wealth to the poor in a new spirit of generosity Hes urging the United Nations to help get rid of what he calls the economy of inclusion So this has been an issue for a while because I think its been a year that the pope has been there at the Vatican and he wrote a paper that got a lot of attention and we  also President Obama is talking a lot about income inequality And this question has come up Eric we were talking about before I dont find the popes comments that controversial because I feel like I can hear what hes trying to say in terms of the message of what I learned what we all learned when you go to Sunday school and youre taught by your parents what Jesus would have taught But this is causing some controversy because the question is how does the UN get involved BOLLING Look let me clarify this I love Pope Francis PERINO Oh I know you do BOLLING I love everything hes doing This is controversial because hes asking the governments to redistribute wealth When the church says the government around the world you know take money from your more wealthy give it to your poor Its no surprise I mean this is  Pope Francis has been about the poverty stricken his entire life Thats his  hes championed that cause straight through It just has become controversial I dont think its going to change his legacy I think hes a wonderful pope I think hes bringing Christians together in a fantastic way PERINO Well that makes people talk about it BOLLING Right PERINO And I want  Kevin Williamson whos National Review and one of my favorite columnist he wrote a piece about this a while ago but it was  I thought of it today and I want to pull up one sentence He says To give away wealth presumes the existence of that wealth Giving away all that you own does not do the poor an iota of good if you dont have anything You cant spread the wealth without wealth Capitalism is the precondition of generosity If you want to feed the Lords sheep you must begin by planting the fields And Bob I think that capitalism actually makes people more generous at least through charitable givings and thats how the church actually is able to further a lot of its message BECKEL Americans have the highest generosity in terms of contributing to charity of any country in the world but what the pope is saying is right Hes been in a lot of countries where theres a very small percentage of oligarchs and everybody else is poor We aint too far away from that And hes making the point about minimum wage and redistributing help good for him Im glad hes saying it Bring it into the forefront and not just have liberal say it It is time for us to take people in this country and not have the minimum wage that keeps them in poverty and hungry PERINO Well Kimberly actually if you look around the world maybe what is more actually needed is more capitalism I mean most of the poor living in places where you dont have capitalism and its socialism or worse GUILFOYLE Yes Well without capitalism how can you have economic growth How can you have new job development Thats what I dont understand They want everything but they dont want to do what it takes to get it Thats like hey push that car down the road Im sorry you made me take the wheels off how am I going to get it there It doesnt make any sense to me Before  you know Im sure people are very excited on the left that the pope said this Bless them But you know he also was definitely a champion against socialism in Argentina So theres a little bit of a dichotomy there But nevertheless I think his heart is in the right place but he is the pope and he is the head of the church Thats why hes not running the government right It makes sense PERINO But he does have political influence WATTERS Right I think the left is using the pope here a little bit I mean whenever he says anything about abortion the left is either silent or they try to marginalize him as some sort of old fashion bigot But today if you look at the story its on every mainstream Web site Its on every left wing Web site And the minute he says redistribution they are going to glom on to this and use this to force their socialist agenda But I do think they may be distorting his words a little bit I think maybe some of this was lost in translation Theres more of an empathetic play Hes not a socialist Hes not a Marxist I may disagree with his objective about how to get there I think free market capitalism probably is the best way to address poverty I have deep respect for the pope  CROSSTALK BECKEL Hes just looking out for the poor Do you recognize the poor treated badly Not only in the third world but in this country as well WATTERS Listen if the pope is going to go out there and lets say slash taxes climate change is a hoax lets deregulate the economy  I mean all hell would break loose Lets be honest I mean he knows what hes talking  CROSSTALK BECKEL But he wont say it because none of that is right PERINO Well lets just bring up Can we do one other topic Which is that former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was on Morning Joe this morning He was talking about minimum wage and hes for it and hes against it Now hes for raising it Listen BEGIN VIDEO CLIP MITT ROMNEY R FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE I for instance as you know part company with many of the conservatives of my party on the issue of the minimum wage I think we ought to raise it because frankly our party is all about more jobs and better pay And I think communicating that is important to us END VIDEO CLIP PERINO OK So showing on the right big tent lots of different philosophies they dont necessarily walk in lock step Eric would you think  weve talked about this at the state level minimum wages have been raised He didnt clarify though BOLLING No they were asking about a federal  by the way if you get a chance that was one of best interviews Ive seen Mitt Romney give It was  PERINO A couple of years too late BOLLING Exactly It was two years too late because had Morning Joe and Mika asked the question asked today two years ago he may have a different outcome in the election That guy was fantastic However this bothered me This minimum wage thing bothers me a lot because he went back to raising a federal minimum wage instead of letting the states decide on their own which I believe you know in states rights to figure out what their minimum wage should be Personally I think there shouldnt be one at all But he went there and he said and Im trying to figure out what was the purpose of doing that Hes not running for president He says Im not running for president Its not going to help out anyone that he endorses going down the road to say hey Mitt Romney thinks raising the minimum wage federally is a good idea I didnt understand why he was going there PERINO But Bob is he trying to maybe move the party in a direction that he thinks it should go BECKEL Well maybe You said a big tent though I dont know anybody on that tent on minimum wage who is a Republican besides Romney I applaud him for that And  PERINO Well thats untrue Pawlenty Santorum a lot of people are being very specific about that the Republican Party  BECKEL I stand corrected WATTERS Even your best friend Bill OReilly thinks we should raise the minimum wage BECKEL Well good for Billy PERINO Your best friend for real BECKEL But the point is a lot of states are tied to the federal minimum wage and at 725 people cannot get out of poverty and they go to bed hungry at night PERINO But then what about the issue of increased regulations and the other taxes and just in terms of energy costs If youre  were always going to be chasing Kimberly  GUILFOYLE Right PERINO  the minimum wage that will never actually solve the problem that Bob talks about GUILFOYLE Yes thats going to remain perpetually insufficient right So thats the problem So you have to think about  BECKEL 1010 is not sufficient That will work CROSSTALK PERINO For how long Bob BOLLING Bob I can stop you The CBO has scored it If you raise the minimum wage to 1010 you are going to cut out 500000 jobs in America Youre going to  CRROSSTALK GUILFOYLE Eliminate BOLLING  five hundred thousand people to the unemployment Is that what you want BECKEL They also said that 2 million people will be risen out of poverty CROSSTALK BOLLING So the five people in a room four is going to get a raise and one is going to get fired Thats a program you want BECKEL I want people to be out of poverty in this country and that minimum wage keeps them in poverty BOLLING Ive got news for you 500000 people will be poverty  BECKEL Maybe PERINO Not only that but this week Jesse there was a report that showed that entrepreneurial spirit of America has just been constantly declining with less people trying to create more businesses and I can understand the goal of wanting to get people out of poverty but not at the expense if you cant  GUILFOYLE Of job creation PERINO  if nobody has nobody is creating jobs then what have we solved WATTERS Right You know the whole minimum wage thing just like the income inequality thing its a dodge The policies have failed They havent created more good paying jobs So they try to nickel and dime this stuff on the fringes to drum up the base and stuff like that And the media goes along with it and people follow along with that It doesnt create growth and jobs CROSSTALK BECKEL Every state that has raised the minimum wage about 10 has not lost a single job WATTERS And it only affects like a couple of hundred thousand people This is not something thats going to like lift the whole country out of poverty BOLLING Its 16 million people on minimum wage right now in America but you are going to lose 500000 of them BECKEL Maybe youll lose them GUILFOYLE Listen to what hes saying Bob PERINO I also love how the liberals who hated Mitt Romney so much because of his policies  what they said that he was only for the rich people now they love him WATTERS Right PERINO I mean  CROSSTALK BECKEL Republicans said you should elect them because he understands business and he understands how INAUDIBLE There you got your business guy telling you ought to raise the minimum wage PERINO No but we voted for him GUILFOYLE What part of the scorecard dont you get PERINO All right Were going to move on Ahead two Christian brothers lose their show on HGTV Did their faith cause them their jobs They think so And thats up next COMMERCIAL BREAK GUILFOYLE Well are Christians who hold  Bob you with me  who hold traditional beliefs welcome to work at HGTV Well it doesnt appear that way after twin brothers Jason and David Benhams new show on the network was abruptly canceled this week Now they were supposed to star in a reality show called Flip it Forward but HGTV yanked the series after some people were upset about their traditional views on marriage abortion and more Now HGTV was apparently offended by these remarks BEGIN VIDEO CLIP DAVID BENHAM SHOW CANCELED BY HGTV via phone If 87 percent of Americans are Christians and yet we have abortion on demand we have no fault divorce we have pornography and perversion we have homosexuality an agenda thats attacking the nation we have adultery we have all of the things  I mean we even have allowed demonic ideologies to take our universities our public school systems while the church sits silent and just builds big churches END VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE Now the Benham brothers are standing by their faith and their values Now Eric interviewed them for The OReilly Factor tonight and heres a sneak peek BEGIN VIDEO CLIP D BENHAM The agenda that were dealing with in America right now is an environment whereby it seeks to silence those that disagree with it and it begins with Christians When HGTV released us it saddened us It was actually sad for the executives that had us on the call But our response to them was Hey thanks for the opportunity and good luck END VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE Eric congratulations You got that interview It will be on tonight And what was your experience with them Because thats just a clip BOLLING A couple very upbeat guys Remember they got halfway through the series and then it was yanked Now HGTV knew about where they stood on things like gay marriage and things like that prior to the series So whatever they did HGTV pulled that series happened after they had started and it was in definite response Now these guys are very nice and they  you know its an interesting interview But I dont know If they really  HGTV really wont  they wont exactly explain why but why did they pull it afterwards if they knew in advance GUILFOYLE Because of public outrage BOLLING Well because of gay activism Is gay activism so strong now has it gone from like an equality encompassing agenda to you know boycotts and pulling GUILFOYLE Bob you have a problem with this BECKEL Id say I watch HGTV every night Ive never heard of HGTV Home and Garden BOLLING Its big Bob BECKEL Its big Oh Im glad to hear it So are cooking shows and all this stuff I just dont watch them But when the guy said  the one comment that got me was demonic forces are taking over our universities and public schools who is he kidding What is a demonic force BOLLING Bob my One More Thing yesterday the satanic black mass at Harvard thats going to happen on Monday BECKEL Thats at Harvard BOLLING Thats one instance BECKEL You think theyre taking over the public schools WATTERS Heres the thing Bob Listen the audience at HGTV its a lot of gays and a lot of women And it was a business decision They were you know going to get boycotted potentially and it was going to be offensive to the audience But I think now businessmen in America they have to make a decision Am I going to be a businessman first or am I going to be an outspoken Christian Whats more important Do I want to make money or do I want to proselytize And the way these BECKEL Do these guys make these comments during their shows BOLLING Prior PERINO Years ago GUILFOYLE No Bob This  the clip were talking about was 2012 So were saying this is what they said in the past These are the beliefs that they hold But they also said on the show the other clips were showing here that theyre traditional that theyre you know family men so I think they were very much in keeping in touch with what their personas were But when this was highlighted they had to pull it BECKEL Well if they werent going to say it  they werent going to say it on the show whats the big deal GUILFOYLE Because they said it in the past and it became an issue Jesse just explained that WATTERS Right You have leftwing people trying to get scalps out there They want to take down Christians and they want to silence them And when you say these things some of them are pretty controversial I mean you didnt play the whole clip GUILFOYLE You might have offended the you know American Indians You should watch ph that WATTERS Im sorry Im sorry But youre trying to  youre handing these guys your opponents a loaded gun when you say things these things It wasnt just demonic They made a Nazi comparison The gates of Hell The enemies Its explosive stuff Theyve just got to polish it up because you cant say this stuff anymore GUILFOYLE Dana PERINO Well I think on the bigger picture its a march from the left to shut down the free expression of anybody who they disagree with I might disagree with that as well but guess what This is what I do I dont watch it Theres a Web site the Daily Mail Web site its a great place People love to go to that Web site You can find a lot of stories on there It is so disturbing to me If I ever find myself looking at some of the stories and digging deeper and going farther Its just so debasing I have to turn it off and I walk away So I dont watch it Same thing with Sister Wives I dont watch Sister Wives because I dont want to talk about polygamy BECKEL Do they grow  do they grow vegetables that are demonic PERINO No BECKEL Are you talking about this Youre not PERINO Im talking about a bigger picture thing BECKEL Im sorry I thought you were talking about Home or Garden PERINO No I mean the whole left Bob Im talking about the whole left GUILFOYLE Do the producers have

glove She left it on accident on the nightstand and he left it there for like three days And I was like Surely hes going to pick that up Surely hes going to pick it up Finally on the third day I put it you know where he couldnt help but miss it And I mentioned it on the show Which is also how I got the poster of Jasper finally hung up in the kitchen because I was complaining BECKEL But see this

break Dont mention this because if I have to say in on the air Im in real trouble but his wife nags him all the time WATTERS No wait a second I did not say that PERINO No he said probably because he

teams waited They said you know they passed on Johnny Manziel for a lot of reasons other than his  hes only five  hes under six feet which would be very short for an NFL quarterback Not because of

copyright or other notice from copies of the contentERIC BOLLING COHOST Hello everyone Im Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle Bob Beckel Dana Perino and Jesse Watters Its 5 oclock in New York City and this is The Five MUSIC BOLLING So does diplomacy work Three hundred girls were kidnapped in Nigeria by the Muslim terror group Boko Haram It caused outrage around the world Celebrities like Ellen DeGeneres and P Diddy have taken to Twitter with a bringbackourgirls Now members of the political class like Michelle Obama and Senator Dick Durbin are entering the fray Is activism a fad or is this actually becoming a part of American foreign policy Rush Limbaugh thinks for one its a joke BEGIN VIDEO CLIP RUSH LIMBAUGH RADIO HOST I think this is pathetic Im just stunned Weve got 300 Nigerian girls kidnapped by an al Qaeda group And nobody cared to talk about it for a while Hillary wouldnt call them a terror group Now all of a sudden for some reason were on a big push to get them back and this is how  the sad thing here is that the low information crowd thats puddling around out there on Twitter is going to think were actually doing something about it It is just unbelievable Bring back our girls They are Nigerian END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING KG Rush goes on to say are we this powerless that thats all we got is a hashtag KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE COHOST Yes I mean it is sad Its a hashtag Theyre holding up a sign I understand their hearts are in the right you know place But I would like to see some movement some action some leadership in a real significant way meaning results oriented Doesnt everybody want that and shouldnt have matter about the young Nigerian boys that were murdered as well So listen I hope they come home I hope they rescue them Thats whats forefront in my mind BOLLING All right Big boy you got a dilemma here my man Youre anti war You said you were an anti war activist Now what do you do  do you send American  do you put Americans lives at risk  BOB BECKEL COHOST Well first I think its a little premature to say that were not doing anything Weve sent military people over there CROSSTALK BECKEL Well wait a minute you dont know everything thats going on Something like this theres a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes and the public doesnt know about My guess is theres a lot of Americans a lot of intel going over there and its a lot more than a hashtag Im a little surprised by old Rush which by the way using Rush is such an unusual thing for the show But the  he said its Nigerian girls What does he mean by that BOLLING Im not sure Im not going to put words in Rushs mouth JESSE WATTERS COHOST I think he means they are not American girls DANA PERINO COHOST So the question is the hashtag is bringbackourgirls Hes being specific to our  meaning our  CROSSTALK PERINO But I think that is actually just a hashtag that started actually in Nigeria It didnt start here BOLLING Dana John McCain said we should mobilize our assets He even suggested using our drone capabilities Your thoughts on that PERINO So if we had the intel and we could have a strike that where you could take out the terrorists and protect innocent life then yes of course That is exactly what that kind of technology should be used for You know how this  the hashtag thing if nothing else is being done then I agree that it is ridiculous However there are ways to mobilize things Sometimes it takes a little bit of time but I was thinking about the One Campaign and global antipoverty efforts have started like early 2001 2002 2003 and everybody wore those little bracelets and it wasnt because we thought that the bracelet was actually going to do anything but it was part of a solidarity with a movement to move forward And if you think of the Green Revolution in Iran remember that was really fueled by Twitter And one of the criticisms of President Obama and the administration was that they did not do enough to try to capitalize on the social media spreading of that message So by itself does the hashtag do anything Absolutely not Does it make you look cool if youre a part of the bringbackourgirls thing Yes What they should have done is why not  if you really want to not make it partisan find somebody else from across the aisle or get a lot of women together from Republicans and Democrats and whoever else and do it altogether Instead its a thing thats being mocked from the right to the left and vice versa left to right BOLLING Jesse what about the celebs the Hollywood elites now jumping on the bandwagon Is that bandwagon activism And if it is maybe we want that WATTERS I mean I think they are taking their cues from Michelle Obama obviously Kim Kardashian all of a sudden she starts tweeting about this You kind feel like  BECKEL She doesnt know where Nigeria is CROSSTALK WATTERS Of course not Anything that makes these celebrities feel good it makes them feel connected It makes them feel emphatic But they dont know the difference between Nigeria and Angola But if Michelle Obama have gone up and said whatabouttheSyriangirls They would have done the same thing I think its selective outrage BOLLING Do we risk American lives to save these Nigerian women WATTERS I mean logistically they have 300 girls captive If you go in theyre just going to start slaughtering them So I dont know if it makes a ton of sense But like you said theyre going to get intel in these guys and in a few weeks were going to send a drone to northern Nigeria and just zap these guys BOLLING Were going to drone their butts All right Lets move on  CROSSTALK PERINO One other thing  in 2005 a point in our history that doesnt get as much attention as it probably deserves 2005 about 200 marines were sent to Liberia and they liberated that country from a dictator 200 marines I dont believe there was any loss of life from our side So with intel and our capabilities and technology you can actually  if you decide its in your national interests you can do more BECKEL I know you want to move on but just very quickly the Arab Spring literally was directed by Twitter BOLLING It was certainly organized It certainly organized  GUILFOYLE Dana just a quick followup for your statement What do you think Do you feel that this is something that can make a legitimate case that it is in our national interests PERINO The girls in Nigeria GUILFOYLE Yes PERINO I think so I could be persuaded but I actually would say thats true in Syria as well because I think when you have 8000 children killed by chemical weapons  some by chemical weapon in Syria then yes I think we should have done something there too GUILFOYLE There as well BOLLING I have to move on the next one On Benghazi today Democrats still havent decided whether theyll participate in a new investigation into the deadly attack on our consulate Nancy Pelosi and her liberal colleagues dont seem to think Americans deserve answers BEGIN VIDEO CLIP REP NANCY PELOSI DCA MINORITY LEADER This is a stunt This is a political stunt Either people have gotten tired of Benghazi but they never knew about it in the first place So lets not be accomplices to this diversionary tactic END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Well Democrats have been accusing Republicans of trying to fundraise off Benghazi Tom Cotton an Army vet took to the House floor today to expose their hypocrisy BEGIN VIDEO CLIP REP TOM COTTON R ARKANSAS When I was leading troops in Iraq in 2006 men and women were being shot at and blown at by al Qaeda where was the outrage as they fundraise endlessly off the Iraq war Where was the outrage as they viciously attacked our commanders Where was the outrage when they said that soldiers were war criminals END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING What about it Bob BECKEL Well some of those comments that were made obviously way out of place but lets keep in mind the difference between Iraq and whats going on in Benghazi there were 6500 Americans killed in Iraq and 32000 injured badly And so I think its a little different when you are talking about trying to stop a war at that size and you are talking about Benghazi I dont think its equivalent BOLLING Its different WATTERS The one thing I think its not just that they were fundraising off Iraq theyre fundraising school shootings Sandy Hook Columbine and then to all of a sudden say you are not able to fund raise off Benghazi which is a legitimate scandal is really hypocritical Both sides do it It does look sleazy You raised money after 911 you raised money after Katrina These things happen in politics but its a little hypocritical for the left to go after the Republicans I think the Republicans stuck to their guns theyre not going to cave on this I think the left thought that the media was going to echo this sentiment and they didnt So I think theyre going to  BECKEL Yes the same congressman said that Republicans shouldnt be raising money on Benghazi and they are BOLLING No no Im not sure he said that Im saying  BECKEL Yes he did BOLLING OK But let me put this way I dont think its consistent across all Republicans Some say they wont raise money off Benghazi and some say they will And let me frame this properly  what they say raise money off of Benghazi that sounds terrible What they mean is theyre going to run and say Im a Republican I want more answers into what happened in Benghazi So therefore you should elect more people like me versus a Democrat who doesnt even want answers in Benghazi GUILFOYLE Thats how you frame it Is that not OK to do Because maybe there are Americans out there I want to vote for a candidate who is actually interested in getting to the bottom of investigations and not saying its just politics and actually want to hold an administration accountable The problem is transparency It sounds good to me BOLLING Dana should Republicans shy away from raising money in something as important as Benghazi PERINO Not my style I like how you frame it I can understand that in terms of judgment and character you should want more people like me in Washington compared to people like this who call getting to the bottom of something a stunt I actually understand that Now there is a select committee and Trey Gowdy is in the chair position Because he is so credible and he is wellrespected on both sides I think that everybody else at least on the political side of things just follow his lead And if I were there I would say Trey Gowdy and his spokesperson are the only two people that are speaking on this And if they ask questions without speechifying no theatrics Remember Bob the whole like watermelon and the gun thing during the Vince Foster situation that was a stunt and the theatrical event that didnt help on the PR side I dont think they need to One other thing just  when they  when Democrats say This is a stunt dont pay attention that is a message aimed directly to the left and to the media to other media to say dont bother covering this but I would like to propose something I would love  I would help organize a debate between someone like Steve Hayes and pick anybody from the mainstream media that was supposed to be covering Benghazi one neutral moderator and let them see  let the American people decide if this is just a stunt or a legitimate investigation BOLLING Hang on Jesse I know you want to jump in Just do me a favor One quick time around because we have another topic Should the Democrats show up yes or no WATTERS I would say yes they should if they dont  look theres going to be seven Republicans kicking Hillary Clintons butt out there If theyre not there to change the narrative and give her a little break during the hearing then theyre going to get screwed PERINO Agreed And so they dont know what else is out there That document that surprised everybody last week that was withheld by the administration where there is one document theres probably more BOLLING Bob should they show up BECKEL Absolutely not Theres only two questions left Where did the video come from And who did the standdown Thats it period CROSSTALK WATTERS And why wasnt there security at the embassy BOLLING And KG should they show up Maybe to get those answers GUILFOYLE Absolutely Youve got to show up You have all the facts all the information Otherwise how can you say youre a credible candidate if youre not willing to go in there and answer questions and participate BECKEL Because its a campaign rally for Republicans GUILFOYLE Well thats your case BOLLING Lets do this one  from Boko Haram to Benghazi to Beverly Hills where protests are growing wider over the sultan of Bruneis Sharia law Celebrities and others are boycotting the sultans famed Beverly Hills Hotel along with the Hotel BelAir after he imposed the harsh Islamic law in his country Jesse why dont you take this one first WATTERS Its funny to me how the left is all of a sudden realizing that fanatical Muslims hate homosexuals and hate women PERINO Yes WATTERS And its a little hypocritical for Hollywood who perpetuates violence against women in all their movies Ands theyre all of a sudden outrage that women are mistreated And speaking of this the homosexual situation theres a gay teen pedophile ring going around right now in Hollywood and theyre circling the wagons around these people out there But all of a sudden everyone is outrage I mean Muslims INAUDIBLE people all of the time all over the world but if youre going to stone a Muslim who happens to be gay then Hollywood gets upset Its crazy BOLLING But its OK Look thats American protest right there right Free market PERINO I dont understand I agree with Jesse like now the complaint is that they dont want to go to this hotel anymore I mean there are plenty of places in Hollywood where you can pay 22 for a martini that they are not looking for opportunity in that regard BOLLING Its famed Its got history Bob Have you been to Beverly Hills Hotel BECKEL Yes I had but I didnt know it was owned by Brunei Listen I would find every single economic investment that Brunei has got and I would boycott it I would take anybody any country that has Sharia law and I would stop doing economic trade with them including the Saudis I might add Weve just allowed this  Sharia law is  it is the most amazing human rights violator on anything thats ever been known in the face of this earth And therefore you reward by taking everything away from them BOLLING Its so difficult KG The global economy so intertwined Theres no way of  theres no way of calling out everything they own GUILFOYLE No but if you are made aware of it and you find out theres plenty of great hotels in Los Angeles like the Peninsula or Four Seasons So I would say there True BOLLING INAUDIBLE GUILFOYLE Well you know theyre not into Sharia law BOLLING Were going to leave  lets hope theyre not into Sharia law Next on The Five some controversial comments today from Pope Francis regarding world poverty Well tell you what he said Plus Mitt Romney breaks from some in his party on the minimum wage Why he thinks it should be raised when The Five returns COMMERCIAL BREAK PERINO Pope Francis is asking the world to do more to help people out of poverty and his words today are making some headlines Earlier the pontiff called on governments around the globe to redistribute wealth to the poor in a new spirit of generosity Hes urging the United Nations to help get rid of what he calls the economy of inclusion So this has been an issue for a while because I think its been a year that the pope has been there at the Vatican and he wrote a paper that got a lot of attention and we  also President Obama is talking a lot about income inequality And this question has come up Eric we were talking about before I dont find the popes comments that controversial because I feel like I can hear what hes trying to say in terms of the message of what I learned what we all learned when you go to Sunday school and youre taught by your parents what Jesus would have taught But this is causing some controversy because the question is how does the UN get involved BOLLING Look let me clarify this I love Pope Francis PERINO Oh I know you do BOLLING I love everything hes doing This is controversial because hes asking the governments to redistribute wealth When the church says the government around the world you know take money from your more wealthy give it to your poor Its no surprise I mean this is  Pope Francis has been about the poverty stricken his entire life Thats his  hes championed that cause straight through It just has become controversial I dont think its going to change his legacy I think hes a wonderful pope I think hes bringing Christians together in a fantastic way PERINO Well that makes people talk about it BOLLING Right PERINO And I want  Kevin Williamson whos National Review and one of my favorite columnist he wrote a piece about this a while ago but it was  I thought of it today and I want to pull up one sentence He says To give away wealth presumes the existence of that wealth Giving away all that you own does not do the poor an iota of good if you dont have anything You cant spread the wealth without wealth Capitalism is the precondition of generosity If you want to feed the Lords sheep you must begin by planting the fields And Bob I think that capitalism actually makes people more generous at least through charitable givings and thats how the church actually is able to further a lot of its message BECKEL Americans have the highest generosity in terms of contributing to charity of any country in the world but what the pope is saying is right Hes been in a lot of countries where theres a very small percentage of oligarchs and everybody else is poor We aint too far away from that And hes making the point about minimum wage and redistributing help good for him Im glad hes saying it Bring it into the forefront and not just have liberal say it It is time for us to take people in this country and not have the minimum wage that keeps them in poverty and hungry PERINO Well Kimberly actually if you look around the world maybe what is more actually needed is more capitalism I mean most of the poor living in places where you dont have capitalism and its socialism or worse GUILFOYLE Yes Well without capitalism how can you have economic growth How can you have new job development Thats what I dont understand They want everything but they dont want to do what it takes to get it Thats like hey push that car down the road Im sorry you made me take the wheels off how am I going to get it there It doesnt make any sense to me Before  you know Im sure people are very excited on the left that the pope said this Bless them But you know he also was definitely a champion against socialism in Argentina So theres a little bit of a dichotomy there But nevertheless I think his heart is in the right place but he is the pope and he is the head of the church Thats why hes not running the government right It makes sense PERINO But he does have political influence WATTERS Right I think the left is using the pope here a little bit I mean whenever he says anything about abortion the left is either silent or they try to marginalize him as some sort of old fashion bigot But today if you look at the story its on every mainstream Web site Its on every left wing Web site And the minute he says redistribution they are going to glom on to this and use this,2014-05-09T15:01-04:00,abortion
Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/10/27/november-midterms-do-democrats-believe-women-cant-think/, It looks as though the Democrats are panicking over the midterms enough that theyve called out the warhorse Gloria Steinem Yes the Democrats have worked very hard to keep women back in the 60s and now they are literally trying to convince American women that nothing has changed and victims all will be If the evil GOP wins of course The problem for the Democrats is that women have realized the supposed feminist movement hasnt been about improving the quality of womens lives at all but about promoting the liberal agenda which as we see continues to destroy everyones quality of life     Noting the use of Ms Steinem in the Washington Times newspaper Cheryl Chumley writes  The outcome of this election will be determined by one factor Ms Steinem writes in an email filtered through the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Women The faults she slams as pure Republican The GOP hasnt passed Equal Pay laws and they constantly deny women their basic rights to make decisions about their own bodies she writes in her email The irony of course is that same liberal agenda is on its way to destroying the very basic ability we have to control our own bodies ObamaCare not only canceled our insurance it destroyed our ability to see our own doctors or use our preferred hospitals Medical relationships between women and their health care providers for generations was destroyed because those same Democrats that harp about evil Republicans wanting to control your body are actually the ones implementing an agenda that well controls your body It wont work All they need do is look at the Colorado Senate race Incumbent Sen Mark Udall is trailing badly his Republican challenger Rep Cory Gardner after Mr Udalls onenote campaign about womens rights It has been viewed as pandering and so badly received in our complicated world that a Washington Post headline declared Mark Udall has been dubbed Mark Uterus on the campaign trail Thats a problem The Democrats not only pander on the issue while destroying our lives theyre also fielding Democratic Party women as candidates who have nothing to do with feminism and everything to do with pandering incompetence and embarrassment Wendy Davis the Democratic nominee for governor of Texas is the perfect example of the fraud liberals and the socalled feminist movement are perpetrating on women nationwide In her race against Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott Ms Davis illustrates the contempt liberals have for their own voters and for Americans in general The absurdity of Ms Davis and the Democrats as heralds for women and their concerns became even more apparent last week On Oct 20 Ms Davis tweeted Greg Abbott wont say whether hed defend an interracial marriage ban   To use this as a base of attack is silly enough but the more important revelation of the supposedly feminist Davis campaign is that she has never bothered to find out about Cecilia Abbott the woman married to Ms Davis opponent If they had they would have learned about the very impressive Mrs Abbott who also happens to be the granddaughter of Mexican immigrants Mr Abbotts refusal to address a hypothetical query makes sense when you reject the nonsensical premise of your desperate opponent Democrats simply dont think women have minds of their own We not only see but live the results of their craven inept and corrupt policies Obamacare is one thing the ongoing economic stagnation that continues to drive wages down as we become an Obama parttimejob nation also makes life more difficult whether you are a married or single woman We have a world on fire because of Mr Obamas bizarre passive allowance of tyrants to grow strong and wreak havoc The Democrats think women care more about getting an abortion than the wars that will be fought by the loved ones and children of women and by women themselves Single women have also had enough All women must ask the question whether theyre better off now than six years ago and the answer for them like everyone else is a resounding no In fact the latest Associated Press poll of likely female voters confirms that women are not lemmings for any political party Women have moved in the GOPs direction since September In last months APGfK poll 47 percent of female likely voters said they favored a Democraticcontrolled Congress while 40 percent wanted the Republicans to capture control In the new poll the two parties are about even among women 44 percent prefer the Republicans 42 percent the Democrats   That is a ninepoint swing in one month and gives the GOP the edge As voters begin to look closely at their options for the midterm elections they reflect on how things are going For most including the women the Democrats have taken for granted misled used and liedto reality is trumping pandering sloganeering and miserably inept female candidates who are embarrassments for all of us who know whats truly possible In Ms Steinems desperate email to Democrats she implores This election is our chance to show them that their relentless sexism will not stand  in fact it will cost them their seats in Congress  Ms Steinem is right which is why the Democrats are losing not just the Senate but the support of women  Tammy Bruce is a radio talkshow host New

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/04/07/prospective-2016-presidential-candidates-start-testing-waters/,"When asked about whether hes got an eye on the 2016 presidential race US Sen Ted Cruz likes to say My focus is entirely on the US Senate At the same time hes made moves that have made many skeptical about his insistence that hes not thinking about running in 2016 The Tea Party Republican from Texas has made the obligatory pilgrimage to that shrine of presidential campaigning  Iowa whose caucuses are the opening act of the nomination contest
In fact Cruz has gone four times in the last eight months His fellow Republican US Sen Marco Rubio who like Cruz is CubanAmerican also has been coy about his 2016 plans But he too has engaged in activities that has many convinced that hes aiming for the Oval Office Rubio has made political appearances in Iowa and he also has put himself at the forefront of several national and international policy debates Last year he took a lead role in bipartisan Senate efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reform His high profile on that issue made him a fixture on Sunday morning news shows He shrank from the spotlight by design however after he drew fire from conservatives for backing the provision in a Senate immigration measure  which passed in June  that allowed for a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants Now hes back in the spotlight this time assailing President Obama for his handling of Russia and Ukraine and for being too passive over the Venezuelan governments strongarm treatment of protesters who have criticized its policies Indeed the two senators are examples of how just about everyone thinking about running for president is kicking it into gear now slowpokes included For months many prospective 2016 presidential candidates have been rubbing shoulders with donors networking with party leaders getting on TV and otherwise auditioning for the contest ahead especially on the Republican side Their pace is picking up A few are even admitting now what has been obvious for eons Theyre interested in the presidency even if they arent ready to commit Others have avoided the usual pathways for reasons that make sense to them even if their inscrutability exasperates others This is the time to show a little selfrestraint one of them Jeb Bush said back in November But that was then Hes shed some of that restraint now Hillary Rodham Clintons inscrutability has bottlenecked the Democratic contest because several may decide not to run if she does Asked in March for the umpteenth time about what shes going to do she responded in her practiced coy fashion Give me your name and number she cracked to a college student imploring her to run Obviously thinking about all kinds of decisions But shes been picking up her activities too Ready for Hillary a super PAC has been busy on her behalf in early organizing The question remains When will Hillary be ready for Hillary Whats clear is that springtime has arrived in 2016 presidential politics Much more is going on since The Associated Press last took a broad look at who is doing what to get ready for a potential campaign Heres a summary of the main players For the Democrats they are Vice President Joe Biden Clinton the former secretary of state New York Gov Andrew Cuomo and Maryland Gov Martin OMalley For the Republicans Cruz the Texas Republican senator Rubio the Florida Republican senator Bush the former Florida governor New Jersey Gov Chris Christie Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal Kentucky Sen Rand Paul Texas Gov Rick Perry Wisconsin Rep Paul Ryan former Pennsylvania Sen Rick Santorum and Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker NONDENIAL DENIAL Cagey words that cloak presidential ambitions none too convincingly Democrats Biden There may be reasons I dont run but theres no obvious reason for me why I think I should not run  February CNN Clinton I havent made up my mind I really have not  December ABC Cuomo Im sorry Im losing you We have a technical difficulty Im running for governor of the state of New York  Seeming not to hear a question about his presidential intentions February Fox Business Network OMalley No one ever goes down this road I would hope without giving it a lot of consideration and a lot of preparation and a lot of thought work and so thats what Im doing  February Republicans Bush I can honestly tell you that I dont know what Im going to do  His standard disclaimer Christie I am enormously flattered that folks would talk about me in my party as someone who they think could be a candidate for president But I am absolutely in  nowhere near that consideration process  Jan 9 news conference addressing the scandal over Fort Lee NJ traffic tieups Jindal My honest answer is I dont know what Im going to be doing in 2016  February Paul Were definitely talking about it my family is talking about it I truly wont make my mind up until after the 2014 elections But I

governors election while being paid as county employees Walker then a county executive wasnt charged but the episode has proved a distraction ___ RUN SHADOW CAMPAIGN One way to run without running is

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/05/06/mainstream-media-ignore-benghazi-developments/,This is a rush transcript from The Five May 6 2014 This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated DANA PERINO COHOST Hello everyone Im Dana Perino along with Andrea Tantaros Juan Williams Eric Bolling and Greg Gutfeld     Its 5 oclock in New York City and this is The Five MUSIC PERINO Last Friday Speaker John Boehner announced that he was forming a select committee to further investigate the September 2012 Benghazi consulate attacks Representative Trey Gowdy was named the head of that select committee yesterday and last night laid out his hopes for the expanded inquiry BEGIN VIDEO CLIP REP TREY GOWDY R SOUTH CAROLINA We need of a list of the documents to talk to and which ones are left to be talked to We need a list of the documents And by the way Im not interested in redacted documents or an overclassification I want the documents So I want all of the evidence You cant draw conclusions if you dont have all the facts and what this committee is going to do is once and for all lay out all the facts and then your jury can draw whatever inferences and conclusions they want to END VIDEO CLIP PERINO Sounds fair enough The select committee is only the sixth name in the last 25 years but you wouldnt know how rare the information is by watching the nightly news During their 90 minutes of TV last night not one mentioned the breaking developments which leads to this first question that I will pose to you Greg Gutfeld GREG GUTFELD COHOST Yes Uhhuh PERINO If the media doesnt think a story is relevant or important they will make sure that nobody else does either GUTFELD Yes I mean well OK lets go for the facts that we were talking about earlier which that there are four times as many reporters who are Democrats as Republicans That doesnt mean we tell the whole story because the people who arent Democrats are usually to the left of the Democrats Theres more nonconformity among zebras Then you look at the media how incestuous they are with the White House that they really do like President Obama a lot He reflects their values I would say its incestuous but thats insulting to Woody Allen The problem with this whole thing as long as theres no Democrat involved in this committee they arent going to pay attention to it because they are going to say this is not important This is a partisan deal So its a deal that they have made before the issue actually happened Its like we dont have to cover it if there are no Democrats but if they had actually done their job there would have been Democrats You see my point PERINO And there still could be You cover all the topics in the Ablock with that wonderful opening GUTFELD Im sorry PERINO So I just want to show people this poll from Indiana University School of Journalism which is what youre talking about in terms of how many more Democrats than Republicans GUTFELD Right sorry PERINO Selfidentifying as reporter level This isnt a huge surprise Andrea You were in Washington DC for a while and covered media and politics for a long time Not a big surprise But a lot of reporters will say that their party affiliations  used to at least  not affect their reporting But do you think thats maybe thats changing and they maybe dont ask the questions that they might have if they were actually being impartial ANDREA TANTAROS COHOST I think thats right and in the last couple of years weve seen some of these reporters when they are at conferences and they are on panels John Heilemann for example and Mark Halperin  PERINO Oh yes TANTAROS  have said and very candidly admitted that there is a leftleaning balance or swing to the journalists They have admitted that that the newsrooms are primary leftist And a lot of them bought into the narrative and the story line And so theyre not going to change now I mean they have too much invested I mean Greg you brought up the point they are too close I think they are too friendly So again were in the second term Theyre not going to go back on this It would be too uncomfortable for them And also their own credibility is on the line Remember they were the one that advance this story that he was the one he was the one that weve all been waiting for They were the ones that they have been waiting for What I dont understand Dana is from  not just a credibility perspective but a business perspective why these outlets wont report on this And when Eliot Spitzer went door for prostitution I raced out to buy a copy of The New York Times which I dont typically do I dont understand from a business perspective why And lastly this is the stuff that Pulitzer Prizes are based on Pentagon Papers Iran Contra We know that the media has it in them to report if they want to Theyre just choosing not to Theyre putting ideology in front of their own career advancement to win an award which I think is just bizarre PERINO Pulitzer Prizes are actually given for a lot less now TANTAROS Thats true PERINO INAUDIBLE awards a couple of weeks ago Eric Im going to ask you a question about something that might be worrying to the media or any Democrats who think they might not want to participate which is last week when Ben Rhodes the deputy national security adviser for communications when his email was released in the Judicial Watch release it wasnt in the initial documents because it had been redacted Then it comes out later on One of the things I think that the media should be aware of is they dont know what else is in there And if you are a Democrat you also dont know what else might be coming out So do they risk looking foolish Well they try to say FOX is foolish for covering this story Do they run a risk ERIC BOLLING COHOST Im trying to figure out why the Democrats are pushing back over  out of  for just finding out whats going on If that document isnt perfect example of why another panel has to be  you know House panel has to ask the questions because more information continues to come out maybe Judicial Watch will get more question Heres the really interesting question Trey Gowdy is fantastic Hes a great guy to have there But look do we need an independent panel Do we need a noncongressional panel an independent prosecutor to come in and do the exact same thing so he can actually  less than partisan just find out whats really going on and then turn it over to a congressional panel PERINO I think that maybe he should be given a chance to least show that he  CROSSTALK BOLLING No no not  OK lets say  yes I agree with that but in addition to Trey Gowdy to the House panel Were certainly not going to get one from the Senate because Harry Reid would never think of doing that because apparently they dont care in the Senate  Senate Democrats dont really care whats going on How about some independent counsel PERINO OK Well Ill think about that Juan I want to ask you a question I saw it on the panel last night on SPECIAL REPORT you were talking about Trey Gowdy and his  having been a former prosecutor and that he is a serious guy that will do a serious investigation Then later on OREILLY FACTOR I saw Bill Richardson former governor saying that he doesnt believe that President Obama or Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were involved in any cover up But how does he know that Because as  theres not  maybe theyll say theres not evidence to say that there was but theres certainly not enough evidence yet to say well then who pushed the video in the first place Like doesnt anybody want to get to the truth JUAN WILLIAMS COHOST I think everybody feels that weve had the truth I think everybody feels like weve had  I believe its 13 hearings Weve had multiple congressional investigations Weve had 50 briefing Weve had thousands of pages of documents and everybody feels like you know what I think Jay Carney said today yesterdays facts todays facts they are the facts The facts dont change And youve had Republicans  theres nothing new What youve had   I tell you whats new We have a document that says White House tries to protect the president politically GUTFELD Right WILLIAMS Oh my God What a shock What a shock GUTFELD OK But your strategy right now is the strategy that was used with Bill Clinton with Monica Lewinsky is denial and whats the big deal when Im caught WILLIAMS No theres nothing to be caught about Theres nothing to be caught GUTFELD There was no funny business  CROSSTALK WILLIAMS Theres no funny business  look lets talk about  GUTFELD First he denied the White House being involved Now we find out its no big deal WILLIAMS Everyone knows the White House was involved right from the start GUTFELD They said  they didnt say that WILLIAMS Of course they said  PERINO Heres the thing is that if you did not think Benghazi was relevant enough to cover in the first place you dont understand the timeline therefore you cant understand what you are saying which is like that cant possibly be true because X and Y are two different things in this case they are both X WILLIAMS Let me just say in terms of the journalist part journalists love ratings I mean you know more than politics money counts Money And you know what The American people  guess what The American people just have come to a conclusion this is not it TANTAROS Juan youre not going to sell papers by repeating talking points that somebody else wrote for you Youre going to sell papers  WILLIAMS Oh my God TANTAROS  by answering the question that werent answer Thats why this is news now because the administration continues to report to this report this ARB report that has so many holes in it OK It was done by the administration number one Number two  WILLIAMS Oh my gosh Admiral Pickering  TANTAROS Can I finish Go ahead WILLIAMS Mullen Ambassador Pickering are just to be impugned they have no credibility TANTAROS Juan Hillary Clinton was not interviewed for this report WILLIAMS Why shouldnt she They decided not to interview her TANTAROS Dont you think she should be interviewed for this report WILLIAMS She testified Every Republican who wanted to slash Hillary Clinton had their shot in public TANTAROS Wow this is significant amount of data missing from this report Its the cat guarding the henhouse WILLIAMS Oh my gosh Let me just say  TANTAROS And the question still arent answered what was the president doing that night WILLIAMS There is a conspiracy  the only conspiracy going on here is the conspiracy of silence among Republicans TANTAROS Thats absolutely false WILLIAMS You know what George Will George Will  youre talking about the SPECIAL REPORT last night  George Will said listen dont forget what happens when Republicans overdid the Clinton investigation and impeachment It hurt them politically I think this is the same war GUTFELD But the thing  I dont think thats  I think the thing when you were looking at the media the idea that the influence of the media on everybody else in saying its just no big deal it is a big deal and when you say its a big deal they mock you The Daily Show says its not a big deal therefore its OK for everybody else to say its not a big deal Its not a big deal dude is actually probably the most precise way of saying it And this is  and people think that divisiveness this current divisiveness comes from hate It doesnt come from hate It comes from helplessness When theres an explicit partnership between the government and the media the citizen becomes marginalized And marginalization turns to anger and anger turns to violence When you realize that nobody actually gives a damn about what you believe that the media  the media is now the Stepford wives They are pliant they are submissive and they are robotic to the president it is when the public decides screw them BOLLING Can I just throw something else out there WILLIAMS What about all the hearings Would you just ignore all the hearings GUTFELD There was no new evidence and people are saying its no big deal Thats my point WILLIAMS But I think theres been hearings Theres been exhaustive hearings GUTFELD The email said the White House was involved WILLIAMS It seems like obsessive behavior at this point PERINO I think it is unacceptable for the media to say theres nothing new here when the document that was reveal last week had been redacted by the White House Why had they not just  given the Ben Rhodes  if it was no big deal why not just  when they release the documents actually do so They didnt thats why its different WILLIAMS No one thought  they thought it was about more than Benghazi PERINO OK Thats ridiculous WILLIAMS OK PERINO Also George Will shows that the right doesnt think in lockstep the way the left does  the way that the left has been able to close in on this and say no big deal here nothing to see I think that Trey Gowdy deserves at least a chance to show  and he says he has no information Eric Ill give you the last word BOLLING Very quickly Yes there is new information Juan Thats why there should be another hearing We now know that there was an effort by Ben Rhodes who knows Did someone else tell Ben Rhodes to run with this idea of pushing the video instead of going with what they actually knew And the other thing is weve since learned in the last couple of weeks or week and a half or so that President Obama was not in the Situation Room during the Benghazi attack So the question remain where was he that night He definitely made a speech the next morning and flew off to Vegas and did his fundraiser So why does it matter Because the next time you elect a president do you think  what kind of guy is this next president going to be Is he going to be the guy whos in the Situation Room trying to ensure that two more Americans arent dead after first two are dead seven hours earlier Or are you going to take one that decides to go to Vegas on a fundraiser WILLIAMS Let me suggest to you the real crime took place in Benghazi CROSSTALK TANTAROS Why havent we  why wont the media stay in the story the president pledged in the Rose Garden to bring them to justice the people who perpetrated the deaths of four Americans that we left behind And just as recently as last week Jay Carney contradicted things that he had said before things that people said under testimony Thats why this is a story Juan because if it was no big deal they wouldnt keep contradicting themselves and lying They would get the answers consistently correct and they havent PERINO Yes its not hard to get the answers consistently correct if youre  TANTAROS Thats right PERINO  you have a timeline that doesnt change Thats just common sense of the press secretary Also another thing thats common sense as a press secretary a former one is that you make joke And when I suggested that a weather man ask the president about Benghazi I was joking So all you people who called me with the most horrific words today on the left you can just relax It was a joke Next on The Five we havent heard from Monica Lewinsky for years but the former White House intern has reemerged with new details about her affair with Bill Clinton Andrea has those So stay tuned COMMERCIAL BREAK TANTAROS Well its been more than 16 years since that woman became a household name BEGIN VIDEO CLIP BILL CLINTON FORMER PRESIDENT I did not have sexual relations with that woman Ms Lewinsky I never told anybody to lie not a single time END VIDEO CLIP TANTAROS Monica Lewinskys has been MIA for the last decade or so but the former White House intern has resurfaced and she wants to set the record straight about her affair with Bubba She wrote an essay for Vanity Fair And in it she writes Its time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress Shes breaking her silence quote To take my narrative and give a purpose to my past She says quote My boss took advantage of me but I will always remain firm on this point it was a consensual relationship But she deeply regrets quote what happened between me and President Clinton So Eric why now Theres a lot of conspiracy theories floating out on the timing of this article But why do you think Monica Lewinsky we havent heard from in years decides to go in such a very public magazine BOLLING Trying to figure it out  after all this time and in the magazine she had an opportunity to make up to 10 million selling her story to various tabloids and whatnot She said she chose not to but this is time  just as Hillary is about to announce that shes going to run for president Now the theory that Im hearing  this could be completely offbase  is that to provide sympathy for Hillary Just remind everyone that Bill Clinton was a jerk Hillary Clinton stood by her man And thats what kind of person she is Im not sure if that holds water or not Theres a bunch of theories flying around TANTAROS Dana youre nodding That would be mean that there would have to be some level of collusion with the Clintons Do you think  PERINO It doesnt have to be because the media and Democrats can communicate without talking right They just look at one another and its understood And so you dont have to have a plan Theres no like going to be any secret document Its just something like we know that we need to do this and theres not like a secret committee somewhere like making this up I think there might be another reason I do think  Im persuaded by that I think thats true somehow this is getting out there Also though shes 40 Monica Lewinsky is 40 and 40 is a strange age for a woman Like you start thinking like well what is life for And she has had quite a time So I think maybe she has  you know if you have 40 to 50 years in your life and she wants to put some distance behind it and make a clean break before the 2016 nonsense gets started I could  CROSSTALK TANTAROS So you  wait you are saying that lines of men have not just been around the block to date Monica Lewinsky Greg GUTFELD Shes almost been married but close but no cigar You know the problem is the said thing about is like her obituary no matter what the first line will always be about this and it happened when she was in her 20s and she will never  no matter what she does its always going to be she was in the Oval Office with you know Bill And Hillary stood by her pig So I dont know if that makes her  still makes her a feminist or not Its just someone who seized power above else But I do agree with  Eric I think this has something to do with building sympathy Not  people are going to say its to take Hillary down But its not really Its to build Hillary up TANTAROS And then Hillary Clinton if and when asked about it on the campaign trail can say  you know what weve dealt with this Shes said her piece GUTFELD They should meet for lunch Hillary and Monica should meet for lunch PERINO With Donald Trump and have pizza GUTFELD She should try Hillary in her reelection campaign and keep her around just to bug Bill TANTAROS You know what I actually dont think shes doing that for Hillary I dont think shes trying to gain sympathy I think shes trying to gain sympathy for herself And mainly what you said Dana  if you look back on Monica Lewinskys life shes tried to Juan launch a hand bag line I mean shes popped up here and there Im surprise she hasnt done a reality TV show But if you read this article she lashes out at Hillary Clinton and exposes her in a way that is not very  is not very sympathygaining She said she may have faulted her husband to being inappropriate but I find her impulse to blame the woman not only me but herself troubling I think Monica Lewinsky is furious And shes angry and shes doing this on her own saying you know what Im going to right my life after they had wronged it WILLIAMS Well in fact in the article she says  you know that people were maligning her as a narcissistic loony tune And this was not so much she thinks President Clinton as the powers that be that political power players were trying to protect the Clinton legacy But just in fairness to Monica Lewinsky since shes having her big day I mean Im not sure why she came out but she says that the kid who committed suicide at Rutgers stirred up her mom She said she was the first victim of Internet sort of gossip  PERINO Humiliation WILLIAMS Right humiliation right Dana So she says now shes going to take on the Internet humiliation and bullying She says this is an opportunity for her to get  and I will say I was  Im still to this day surprised She got her advance degree a PhD at Oxford in psychology And so she said she tried to get afterwards and everybody tried to use her They wanted her  GUTFELD Why is it always psychology Why is it always psychology BOLLING Can I  she wants to burn the blue dress or bury it PERINO Bury it GUTFELD It wont burn BOLLING I have a better idea Three ideas she can either donate it to the Smithsonian Its a national treasure put right next to George Washington  TANTAROS A national treasure BOLLING Or she can auction it off and maybe the proceeds go to bullies  victims of bullies Or the third one donate it to the Clinton Library Theres plenty of room there TANTAROS Bullies Bill Clinton is the biggest bully of them all if you read Ken Starrs report PERINO You know that the video of President Clinton in the Roosevelt Room when he said I did not have sexual relations with that woman its still shocking Its actually still shocking to watch it For me I just think  I cannot believe that actually happened TANTAROS And reading the report of what actually happened the blue dress was the least of it BOLLING Thats true TANTAROS Maybe thats why she didnt  maybe thats why psychology Greg instead of sex ed She has the other one covered WILLIAMS Wow you guys are tough CROSSTALK TANTAROS It was the least of it WILLIAMS And he wants put it in the Smithsonian TANTAROS Ill send you a copy of the Kenneth Starr report WILLIAMS How about the porn museum in Las Vegas TANTAROS Coming up a former actress filmed her own abortion so other woman wont afraid to have one She thought it was quote cool The author of Not Cool has the details on that disturbing story up next COMMERCIAL BREAK GUTFELD Heres a heartwarming tale An abortion counselor filmed her own abortion describing it as birthlike BEGIN VIDEO CLIP UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE I found out that I am pregnant Hey Im pregnant Im pretty early Im not ready to have children Yes Im really having an abortion tomorrow morning I just want to share my story to show women that there is a thing as a positive abortion story INAUDIBLE I got lots of work I dont feel like a bad person I dont feel sad I feel in awe of the fact that I can make a baby I can make a life END VIDEO CLIP GUTFELD Yes and you can take one In the inevitable glowing Cosmopolitan article she describes herself as a depressed actress who became obsessed with birth and then abortion so she became an abortion counselor But because birth control pills may cause weigh gain and depression she skipped all of that and when she got pregnant she decides quickly to get an abortion because theres no weight gain from that birth control only weight loss So what a coincidence An actress obsessed with her own importance embraces abortion as an issue gets pregnant and films her abortion and an article from Cosmopolitan is born Talked about planned unparenthood was this stunt nursed from the beginning Does it matter Its just matter It makes you wonder if Cosmo would devote this much space if a woman choosing to have a child despite the inconvenience Instead they run a piece on horror stories when encountering prolifers See the real villain here is the magazine who took advantage of someone who clearly needs help To film the abortion became her therapy and the fetus a prop for a column Who knows Maybe the article will win an award You can put it next to the sonogram to remind her it was worth it She  the lesson she learned from the abortion Andrea is that she can make life Isnt that amazing TANTAROS Yes Isnt that a good lesson I agree with you Shes deeply disturbed This is a woman who admits that she was severely depressed and was competitive and jealous of other women before she applied to be this counselor which makes me wonder did the Cherry Hill Women Center ever think of a psychological exam So you have a woman who is depressed who doesnt like other woman whos against birth control as a birth control counselor what could go wrong GUTFELD Yes TANTAROS Its positively disgusting If you read even further down Greg she doesnt even seem to care about the death of this child Shes just so amazed with herself Shes so impressed that she was able to go through this and film this and create this baby that she doesnt even care and she never took the pill and she just says I know its kind of embarrassing but oops with clear disregard for human life GUTFELD Well I think it was more just  because as an actress this was something to gain attention It got it WILLIAMS I dont know if she was an actress It says in the article that shes an abortion counsellor working at this Cherry Hill New Jersey clinic Shes GUTFELD Quite an interesting one WILLIAMS Shes 25 years old I think its just a sad topic I mean Ive got to tell you it just depresses me But you know I mean she says Look its a reality I think its now like a third or more of American women at some point in their lives have an abortion and that she wanted to take away this guilt That the purpose of this video was to say you dont have to walk around and be like you know you have a scarlet A because youve had an abortion This happens in a womans life And a high percentage of American women have had abortions So OK but I just think  I dont know why you have to  theres nothing to celebrate here GUTFELD Yes Thats the thing here Eric It seems like theyre trying to make lemons  lemonade out of lemons or something BOLLING You know I write these notes And I came to the same conclusion If shes an abortion counsellor she knew that she was running a high risk of getting pregnant if she continued So did she do it as a publicity stunt I wrote right there Publicity stunt Maybe she did I dont know But heres the problem She called it a positive experience which is absolutely disgusting How can you possibly say this whole thing was a positive experience for you Heres the thing though One of the sound bites we rolled  now I didnt hear her say this but she said it was amazing that I can make a life You know the proabortion people have this wall that they try and put up and say Im not really sure its a life yet Not until some point it may not be technically a person a life But for her to say that and recognize that its a life and that she was willing to take it and then be proud of taking it GUTFELD Yes Its bizarre BOLLING Its like some sort of genocide I mean thats the only way you can describe it GUTFELD What do you think PERINO A couple of things So even when Americans are asked to pay for the contraception for everybody they wont take the pills that are free because it might cause weight gain GUTFELD Yes And depression PERINO Just make sure I got that straight Secondly I always wonder in these stories about what about the father and how the fathers are not consulted Well maybe he was but she doesnt feature that in her video And the last thing I say is Ive always been amazed that if a baby is wanted its celebrated And theres news You can even release the news in the newspaper Theres going to be news on the front page of The New York Post theres going to be a baby If a babys not wanted its OK to destroy the baby and say that its not a life Ive never understood that TANTAROS I know weve got to move on but real quick she does report she has an IUD inserted now So no worrying anybody Shes too irresponsible to take the pill every day so she has an IUD And you know what Greg We dont know if this was a positive story because we dont know where shes going to be in ten years GUTFELD Yes TANTAROS Thats what shes not telling these young girls reading Cosmo how this story really ends GUTFELD Yes TANTAROS If she was depressed before lets check back in ten years Id love to read that editorial GUTFELD I want to get to this Its an update in the Nigerian kidnapping story the mass kidnapping story where hundreds of girls were kidnapped by the Islamic radical Boko Haram group Weve got video of the leader of this group Hes been capturing these girls Hes got I guess  abducted eight more This is what he has to say BEGIN VIDEO CLIP UNIDENTIFIED MALE through translator Ladies go get married Leave western education Im the one that captures your girls Ill sell them in the market Theres a market for selling people God has commanded me to sell END VIDEO CLIP GUTFELD So PERINO We have a maniac A homicidal crazy maniac GUTFELD Yes And the United States are sending a team to help But no troops Just military law enforcement experts PERINO Well what I hope is that what theyre not telling us is that hopefully there are undercover CIA agents on the ground that are either tracking them or are able to help the authorities in Nigeria to try to find these poor young girls GUTFELD Yes Eric President Obama just released a statement calling the abduction of the Nigerian schoolgirls heartbreaking and outrageous BOLLING And honestly theres not a lot more he can do at this point as David points out Maybe theres some covert operations hopefully And again hopefully the UN gets involved Once you cross a country line thats international and thats human trafficking And thats something that they should be all over GUTFELD Is it our fought Juan Should we be going over there WILLIAMS As a matter of moral imperative You know I think everybody in the world and one of most amazing things to me is that this is now an international point of concern Everybody in the world says you know thats crazy And you know just on a personal level you can imagine you send your daughter to school and this is a poor country in places And these people are sending their child to school Theyre trying to do their best especially for young women and the guy kidnaps 200 women PERINO Almost 300 WILLIAMS You and I were talking earlier How did they do it They had a convoy Theyre threatening people you know And now out of  incommunicado Into the jungle potentially across the border into Cameroon So we dont know I mean so if it helps if the US gets involved to determine where theyre located Thats our fight I mean if we can offer in terms of intelligence some information that allows this president good luck Jonathan whose wife has denied  what kidnappings doesnt believe it Thats where you just get into Oh my God Corrupt government stupidity You know and theres real lives at stake GUTFELD Yes It is TANTAROS I hope this is kept classified what we are doing so that other terrorists dont see that this could be the new front on war  theres going to be copycats Because theyre preying on the most vulnerable This does seem to be a new terror tactic going after women Also every time we hear that theres a Republican war on women can we play that clip over and over again because it just proves that you can jail a filmmaker and you can give a big speech and talk about shared tolerance A guy like that is not going to change his mind GUTFELD All right still ahead are smart phones and social media ruing our lives Ruining mine A new video is warning that technology is set to unplug ph and Eric will share it with you next on The Five COMMERCIAL BREAK BOLLING Over the week I opened a fiveminute video called Look Up It talks about how weve become so obsessed with our social media life is literally passing us by Heres a clip BEGIN VIDEO CLIP UNIDENTIFIED MALE Look up from your phone shut down the display Take in your surroundings Make the most of them Just one real connection is all it can take to show you the difference of being there to be there in the moment when she gives the look that you remember forever as when love overtook you The time you hold your wifes hand sit down beside her bed You tell her that you love her lay a kiss upon her head She then whispers to you quickly as her heart beats a final beat that shes lucky she got stopped by that lost boy in the street But none of these times ever happened because you never had any of this When youre too busy looking down you dont see the chances you miss So look up from your phone shut down those displays We have a finite existence a set number of days Dont waste your life getting caught in the net as when the end comes nothings worse than regret END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Honestly it tore me up way too close to home The message look up from your laptop your iPad or your smart phone See your wife See your life See your kids See your friends because if you dont before you know it its too late and theres no getting those times back By the way I wish Beckel was on I love having you on Juan But Beckel gives us a hard time every day in the breaks checking the iPhones And were all guilty of this arent we TANTAROS Guilty as charged During the commercial break I was glued to not one but two Its a poignant video Will it change behavior I dont know because I think you get addicted And it just  it made me feel bad that I do it but it also made me feel grateful that I was raised in a time when my mom didnt have a phone I think wow I was really lucky because she was so engaged and my siblings were so engaged with each other That you know I feel bad for kids nowadays WILLIAMS Its compulsive And especially in an environment Dana you know that I live in in terms of politics People are always like Oh whats next whats next whats next To me and actually an executive here at FOX said Put the phone down I know youve got to think We need you around here thinking and coming up with ideas We dont need you reading So these days you can text somebody text me at 1 am in the morning and then the next day theyd be like Man you didnt get back to me Im like Are you kidding me GUTFELD Sorry about that Juan WILLIAMS Yes And it was kind of lewd too BOLLING In a very short period of time it has 23 24 million views already PERINO Yes I think a lot of people feel it and we are all guilty of it Are we seeing it  remember when I went to that concert and the mom brought her daughter to the concert The girl was eight years old and the mom didnt talk to her at all the whole time She was on her phone And I felt bad for her And then I realized Id been doing that to Peter the whole night too I do think that point about putting it down and trying to be creative There was a study last week that said that you have your best thoughts your most creative thoughts when youre doing something so walking yoga when youre actually moving and not on your phone So to that point thats good And also the last thing Ill say at the comedy club I went to with Bob on Saturday night one of the comedians had this great line He said Yes your parents told you not to talk to strangers but they didnt mean forever How about that BOLLING We try and engage social media Should we be doing that GUTFELD This is  this is baloney Were going to sit here and go Oh yes this is so important but we are going to go right back to it Its bogus By the way theres an inherent flaw in this video Hes looking down right and he misses the woman of his dreams That logic you can use like I decided to order in instead of going to the restaurant I decided to skip the gym instead of going to the gym You could be missing things  you could miss your own death Maybe if you were  maybe if you looked up and you walked  youd be hit by a bus This is the dumbest video ever You know it drives me crazy Yes I hate it Technology opens  opens avenues of communication for a lot of people who didnt have it before Were in a medium where we could talk to all sorts of people There are people that maybe are shy This stuff helps them communicate People said the same thing about telephones back then Oh when we got telephones now we cant go talk to our neighbors Maybe thats a good thing Maybe your neighbors are jerks PERINO Or maybe youre annoying your neighbors GUTFELD But also phones are great For women phones are a great way to ward off weirdoes Like if youre walking down the street maybe the guy comes up to you wants to talk to you Youre just like this Im sorry Im on the phone This thing keeps the creeps away TANTAROS Its a good teach ph for my One More Thing WILLIAMS I cant believe you had this just blasted emotion over this This really upset you GUTFELD I am a cold person No but Ill tell you can I make one more point And

WILLIAMS I thought you were laughing at GUTFELD This is my normal pace WILLIAMS Prince had some pretty awful explicit lyrics about women and things you do TANTAROS Yes You sexy blanketyblank And Im a huge Prince fan I think hes a musical genius But its a little late in the game I mean he made all of his money I mean he wrote songs for He created Mary Jane Girls Appalonia was it Vanity I love him I was rocking out to Dynasty Pearls over the weekend WILLIAMS Yes TANTAROS But I just  its a little disingenuous now thats hes made all his money with really lewd songs to say that hes going to stop cursing WILLIAMS I remember Richard Pryor Richard Pryor who used the N word and cursing all the time At some point he went to Africa and came back and said You know what I didnt see any Ns over there Im going to stop Of course what happened is just what you said All the younger comedians said Look how Richard Pryor became famous using profane language and they started doing it BOLLING Me WILLIAMS Yes BOLLING Let me tell you my 15yearold son every other word in hiphop music now is a curse word I dont know how theyre ever going to clean that up Even if you took the N word out its still  you know

of it is for kids and especially suburban kids they just think This is my opportunity to rebel But you know its just damaging Its terrible especially for minority kids  Dana PERINO Well I was just

What happens if I curse in front you Will you be mad PERINO No WILLIAMS No PERINO Ive got a pretty strong stomach for that WILLIAMS Oh OK PERINO Strong ears I should say GUTFELD First to Andreas point Prince is going to be 57 in June This is what happens when you get old and youve had your fun But I have a theory and I dont think anybodys ever said this before We have seen a dramatic drop in violence in this country over the last couple of decades as swearing has increased and Im wondering if swearing is a necessity to prevent violence That if you didnt have swearing what would you do PERINO You bottled it all up GUTFELD Yes What would you do before you swore Who knows Maybe swearing is helpful PERINO Maybe stab somebody TANTAROS I find it very helpful WILLIAMS Who knows Well have

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/09/15/woman-striving-to-become-nevadas-first-latina-lieutenant-governor-want-to-help/,The race for lieutenant governor typically is lackluster but this year the outcome could be a game changer for some of the states most powerful politicians The winner would replace Nevadas sitting governor Republican Brian Sandoval if he opts to run for the US Senate in 2016 Sandoval would be challenging veteran Harry Reid a Democrat who has been serving in the US Senate since 1986 Reid is one of the most powerful Democrats in Congress currently holding the post of Senate Majority Leaders Reid has stumped for rising star Lucy Flores the Democratic state assemblywoman running for lieutenant governor Flores is plucky easily speaking with candor about things many politicians would downplay She talks about an abortion she had in her teens and the life on the wrong side of the law that she lived as a young adult During those darker years Flores stole cars and belonged to gangs Her story is one of redemption of reinventing yourself and hoping others can draw strength from it for themselves she says She graduated from law school and went on to successfully run for the state legislature If she becomes lieutenant governor she would be a heartbeat away from being the states chief executive if Sandoval cannot or chooses not to continue to serve If elected Flores 34 would be the first Latina to occupy the post I feel nervous incrementally as we get closer to the election Flores told Fox News Latino Weve done a really awesome job generally speaking Everyone has done everything they possibly can do I leave it up to fate Characteristically Flores envisions the office which routinely has devoted its attention to tourism and transportation among other things having a broader and more substantive role Flores says she wants to give the states youth a shot at success opportunities such as she had even in the face of daunting odds She said the state has the lowest performing indicators out there whether graduation rates performance scores in reading and math Weve done poorly in terms of ensuring our students and teachers have the resources they need to deal  quite frankly  with many of the challenges our kids are experiencing these days whether drugs povertyrelated issues homelessness kids showing up to school hungry Her rival in the race Republican State Sen Mark Hutchison also said he wants to focus on helping his constituents to attain the same American dream he was able to achieve through decades of hard work His mission is to give that same opportunity to his constituents I think what Nevadans are really focused on is What are you going to do in terms of governmental policies laws and ways in which we can make sure our families are having those same opportunities Hutchinson said Though they have ideological differences on how to help people in the state succeed both candidates seem to agree on one thing Nevadas education systemconsistently ranked one of the worst in the countryneeds an overhaul Flores and Hutchinson oppose a ballot measure to increase corporate taxes to fund education Hutchinson said hed like to replace poorly performing teachers with quality educators and make it a priority to help all students learn English Nearly half of the students in Nevada are Hispanic Flores wants to improve education by making changes to the states tax structure which hasnt been updated in decades On the economy Hutchinson said he wants to return Nevada to its prerecession days by bringing in new jobs and making the economy conducive to potential business owners Continuing to see the economic comeback weve seen under Brian Sandoval is very important Hutchinson said Flores supports a hike in the minimum wage to help low and middleincome families Hutchinson said the increase would hurt business owners who create jobs Flores says for too long Nevada was intoxicated by its own gilded trappings People could make a lot of money she said without even having a high school diploma They could work in the casinos or as valets and sometimes command six figures Flores said But when the economy tanked so did many of the industries that lined many Nevadans pockets and the strong education that the state lacked suddenly was crucial Gaming and tourism took a huge loss she said those jobs became scarce People began realizing that we need to focus on education For many years we were unable to bring new businesses to Nevada They looked at our education system and would take a pass Now Flores points to herself of what can a good education can lead to what investing in young people can produce later If it werent for my mentors for the resources that came my way I very well could have ended up on the same path I was on she said referring to a life of crime To young people who may feel adrift who may see a bleak future she says this Look at me and many others like me and recognize that every single person has challenges in life she said Theres never going to be a time when there isnt a challenge  Matt Finn is a part of the Junior Reporter program at Fox News Get more

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/05/16/un-twisted-logic-free-speech-equals-torture/,AP It is happening again Free speech is under attack at the United Nations And once again religious liberty is in the crosshairs Earlier this month a prominent NGO nongovernmental organization the Center for Reproductive Rights made a formal argument to the United Nations Committee Against Torture that the Catholic Churchs prolife speech actually tortures women and girls     Yes that was their argument that efforts to save childrens lives  to spare them from the horror of abortion  constituted torture within the meaning of the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Here is what the Center for Reproductive Rights urges the UN Committee to do Note that the Holy See has negatively interfered with states attempts to develop legislation on abortion that would have served to better protect women from torture or illtreatment Note that the Holy Sees actions are a violation of Articles 1 2 and 16 of the Convention against Torture and that the rights of freedom of speech and of religion extend only so far as they do not undermine womens reproductive rights including the right to be free from torture or illtreatment To understand the absurdity of this argument one only needs to read the definition of torture in Article 1 of the Convention For the purposes of this Convention the term torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering whether physical or mental is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed or intimidating or coercing him or a third person or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity It does not include pain or suffering arising only from inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions Simply put there is no rational reading of this definition that would encompass a church urging women to spare their childs life or would encompass political leaders urging their governments to pass prolife legislation In fact the reasoning is exactly backward Abortion not only destroys a human life it does so in a particularly grotesque and brutal way Moreover in many countries and cultures children are killed  through sexselective abortion  merely for the crime of being a girl Applying the definition of the Convention abortion inflicts severe pain and suffering with the consent or acquiescence of public officials often based on discrimination on the basis of sex If the word torture belongs in this debate at all it would describe the worlds abortionondemand regimes not the actions of a church dedicated to the sanctity of life But this is the UN and rationality does not always reign In fact the UN has a disturbing recent history of attempting to restrict free speech and religious freedom For years UN human rights committees passed antiblasphemy resolutions that prohibited defamation against religions The resolutions strongly advocated by the UNs Muslim nations would have protected the Muslim faith from public criticism including from criticism of the violent extremes of Shariah law Christian evangelism would have violated international law This effort was only defeated after strong American leadership from a Bush Administration that was committed to defending religious liberty Following the American lead the EU also eventually opposed and the measure died Will American leadership defend free speech and religious liberty in todays UN Given its radical commitment to abortionondemand mandating that even Christian employers pay for abortifacients I have no confidence it will uphold religious liberty abroad Prolife speech is under constant attack and I know that better than most Years ago I had the privilege of defending prolife speech at the Supreme Court when I argued Hill v Colorado a case where the Supreme Court tragically sided with the censors and determined that prolife Americans had fewer free speech rights than their proabortion fellow citizens This latest attempt to shut down free speech at the UN should be of grave concern to all At the American Center for Law and Justice we understand that international law can find its way even into American courts and if we wait to defend religious liberty until the threat comes home weve often waited too late That is exactly why were engaging directly at the UN through our affiliate the European Centre for Law and Justice  standing up for religious freedom and free speech Its obvious that the Churchs enduring moral witness has provoked the abortion lobby in this latest attack on free speech That witness must not be

 The most revealing quote about Obamas political instincts
 Reid relapses with Koch amendment
 Roberts packs punch in first debate
 Rubio teams with Romney foreign policy alums
 Thats a lot of breadsticks     THE MOST REVEALING QUOTE ABOUT OBAMAS POLITICAL INSTINCTS
President Obama said this weekend that fears of damaging his partys chances of holding the Senate were not behind his decision to abandon plans to use executive action to grant temporary amnesty to large numbers of illegal immigrants Instead the president told NBC News relaunched Sunday chat show that he waited for a different political reason Obama said he pulled back because voters changed their mind on the subject of immigration itself after seeing the chaos at the southern border amid the surge of Central American minors seeking sanctuary in the US The truth of the matter is that the politics did shift midsummer because of that problem Obama said going on to blame Republicans for exploiting the humanitarian situation Not that Democrats would ever do such a thing What the president said in essence was that he is not doing what he knows to be right because people are paying too much attention Instead Obama said he will wait until voters have calmed down lest his action be rolled back amid a public outcry Or an even shorter version Of course its not about politics for Senate Democrats its about politics for me

That explains it  Obamas answer doesnt seem to be an evasion since the evasive answer would have been to say that the measures werent ready or werent satisfactory or anything else he could think of But instead Obama was delineating between playing politics to push the issue itself as opposed to the somehow less noble pursuit of preserving his Senate majority as if the two werent connected Of course the amnesty action would have hurt Democrats but so did threatening it for months on end Eliminating the threat temporarily will make things less bad perhaps but it will also hurt Democratic turnout in key precincts What a mess Obama going from a massamnesty impeachmentbait measure to no measure at all is far worse than if he had done nothing at all How did he manage to screw up the one thing he was doing other than a bajillion fundraisers to try to help Democrats Obama party of one  First he waited and waffled The politics of the issue have been clear for more than a month Rather than ratcheting up speculation Team Obama could have quietly started stepping on the executive action story line instead of pumping it up Second Obama did not understand his foes He expected Republicans to freak out and start drafting articles of impeachment but instead the GOP has done what the president has failed to do keep its political focus on the task at hand Third and most importantly Obama overestimated his commitment to his allies The president may have once imagined himself willing to risk his legacy and one of his most prized issues with an audacious move but flinched as he got closer The verdict of this cycle is the same as most of Obamas presidency He is a party of one Obama needed listeners to know that he was politically savvy but also wanted them to know he wouldnt waste his acumen on something so crass as saving his fellow Democrats SUPER MODELS FOR GOP SENATE TAKEOVER
The prognosticators reset their dials after another round of public polling on key Senate races showing a timely shift in favor of Republicans Odds in favor  Nate Silver The FiveThirtyEight forecast model gives Republicans a 651 percent chance of winning the Senate with the new polling added similar to the 635 percent chance that our previous forecast gave them on FridayRepublicans have long been favored to win back the seats in Montana West Virginia and South Dakota three states where Democratic incumbents have retired The GOPs next two easiest targets are in Louisiana and Arkansas where the Democratic incumbents Mary Landrieu and Mark Pryor are struggling with electorates that have turned much redder since their tenure in office began Marginal momentum  NYTs Upshot The Upshots Senate model now gives the Republicans a 61 percent chance of retaking the Senate up from 58 percent before the infusion of new dataThe overall effect of the likely voter screen is to increase the GOP margin in the national Senate popular vote by two percentage points Thats hardly ideal for Democrats A fine nine  Weekly Standards Jay Cost Republicans could well do better than six seats In fact they could easily take nine seats from the Democratsin Alaska Arkansas Colorado Iowa Louisiana Montana North Carolina South Dakota and West Virginia In each of these states Republicans plus independents constitute a majority and there is no clear Democratic candidate edge A true repeat of the 2010 wave should therefore give the Republicans 54 seatsgive or takein the Senate Dems losing the edge  WSJ Republican candidates have opened up leads in two key Senate races according to new NBC NewsMarist polls brightening the partys prospects for retaking control of the chamber in the November elections Rep Tom Cotton R Ark has opened up a fivepoint lead over Democratic Sen Mark Pryor in Arkansas among likely voters 45 to 40 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell leads Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes by eight points 47 to 39 in Kentucky Libertarian David Patterson was at 8Republicans are doing well in red states but still trailing in blue states like Colorado where incumbent Democratic Sen Mark Udall leads Republican Rep Cory Gardner by six points 48 to 42

Unfavorable conditions  WaPo In Kentucky Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimess favorable rating in May according to NBCMarist was 39 percent with just 24 percent viewing her unfavorably Today her favorable rating is unchanged at 39 percent but her unfavorable rating his risen 17 points to 41 percent In other words Grimess image went from 15 points positive to two points negative In May Democratic Sen Mark Pryors favorableunfavorable split was a pretty strong 5035 among registered voters  and he led Cotton by 11 points Today its 4442 among likely voters and he trails Cotton by five So from a plus15 image to plustwo REID RELAPSES WITH KOCH AMENDMENT

 Decision day on ObamaCare birth control rule
 Court could end forced union membership
 Still likable enough Obama offers muted defense of Hillary on buck raking
 Power Play Braley makes his case
 Patriotic pest control     DECISION DAY ON OBAMACARE BIRTH CONTROL RULE
On the heels of a unanimous Supreme Court ruling smacking down President Obamas claim to that he had the power to circumvent the Senate for key appointments the administrations expansion of executive power is front and center again at the high court Expected today is a decision on Obamas effort to force business owners to pay for birth control methods that violate their religious beliefs Devout Christians Jews and Muslims believe that the socalled morningafter pill destroys a human life just as an abortion does The administration says that even business owners who sincerely hold those views must still pay for ObamaCarecompliant insurance plans that provide those drugs The case is significant not only as it relates to religious exemptions from the law but also may open the door to further limitations of the governments newly expanded powers to mandate the purchase of health insurance

The deets  WSJ The birthcontrol decision could have immediate consequences for a highprofile provision of the Affordable Care Act two years after the court upheld the laws requirement that most Americans obtain health insurance The owners of Hobby Lobby Stores Inc an Oklahoma City artsandcrafts chain owned by founder David Green and his evangelical Christian family along with the Mennonite owners of Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp a Pennsylvania cabinetmaker challenged the heathlaws requirement that most employerhealth plans cover contraception without charging copayments They say the requirement violates the rights of religious owners of forprofit companies who believe some forms of birth control are immoral citing a 1993 statute the Religious Freedom Restoration Act which encourages federal law to accommodate individuals religious beliefs Behind the challengers are dozens of other religious business owners who say they have been waiting on the courts decision to shape their future health coverage offerings to workers

More Pyongyang than Peoria  In a piece for Fox News Opinion Christianity9to5org editor Michael Zigarelli offers his view of how the justices ruling on the ObamaCares birth control mandate has broad implications for religious freedom in America If the law requires business owners under threat of state punishment to abdicate their bona fide religious beliefs then we are adopting a new form of governance  one thats more Pyongyang than Peoria

What is and isnt at stake  Sam Baker examines the potential scope of the Hobby Lobby case for the National Journal

Did justices tip hands  Oral arguments in March seemed show a divided court sympathetic to the view of business owners who say their religious objections protect them from ObamaCare mandate that their plans should cover all kinds of contraceptives

COURT COULD END FORCED UNION MEMBERSHIP
Also expected today is a ruling on a suit that could change the political landscape for decades to come and deal a blow to the Democratic Party Many states require government workers to pay dues to designated unions Those unions in turn spend the money to help elect politicians dedicated to increased spending and expanding pay and benefits for government workers Democrats statelevel and national clout relies heavily on those compulsory payments In states where governments stopped forcing dues payments workers have fled in droves sapping the available resources for Democrats to stay in power While the fight has been playing out at the state level for years an Illinois provision that forced all of the states home health workers to pay dues could end up changing the rules on the national level

Case file  WFLD On Monday morning the US Supreme Court is expected to hand down its opinion on a case involving a Winthrop Harbor Ill woman which could have a significant impact on the future of public sector unions Illinois state law allows Pam Harris to work as the full time caregiver for her son Josh who is severely disabled She is paid by Medicaid But when Gov Pat Quinn DIll signed an executive order allowing caregivers like Harris to be unionized she filed a lawsuit saying shes technically not a state employee and complaining that her sons Medicaid benefits would go toward a union she doesnt support in violation of her First Amendment rights This is public dollars intended to support individuals with disabilities It is not public funding intended to support the union Harris said Harris lost in the lower courts but last fall the US Supreme Court agreed to hear her appeal If Harris wins public employee unions could suffer a major setback Membership and dues could fall dramatically as would their political clout

conservatives rebuking an unpopular President Barack Obama while skirting divisive social issues that have tripped up the GOP The annual Voters Value Summit opens Friday in Washington with speeches from several potential presidential candidates including Kentucky Sen Rand Paul Texas Sen Ted Cruz former Arkansas Gov Mike Huckabee and Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal The speaking program features ambitious Republicans with positions on social issues across the spectrum   from the libertarianleaning Paul who favors less emphasis on abortion and gay marriage to Huckabee a former Southern Baptist pastor whose conservative social values define his brand     But evangelical organizers of the event largely expect participants to unite around what they call Obamas attack on religious liberty according to Tony Perkins president of the host organization the Family Research Council Perkins cited an Obama administration rule that compels health insurers to cover female contraception in addition to a foreign policy he says doesnt do enough to protect Christian values around the world Without religious freedom we lose the ability to even address those other issues Perkins said of social issues declaring that a fundamental shift is underway toward religious freedom but that evangelical voters would not forget conservative values such as traditional marriage come Election Day

 Sweet ride     PICK SIX NOW A MAJOR TELEVISION EVENT
Youve voted Youve quarreled Youve tweeted And today it starts paying off Since the start of the year Fox News First readers have been playing pundit as part of our Pick Six contest Thats where we ask you to plot the most likely path for a Republican takeover of the Senate and list the six Democratheld seats most vulnerable to GOP efforts And today the Fox News Channel starts sharing your collective wisdom with the rest of the nation in where else West Virginia

Magic number  This midterm cycle is all about six Senate seats With Democrats playing defense in the House Republicans seem all but certain to continue their control of the lower chamber The only threat to the status quo in Washington is the GOPs chance to take control of the Senate for the first time since 2006 To do that Republicans need a net gain of six seats And if the path begins anywhere it will begin in West Virginia

Very different takes  Campaign Carl Cameron is on the ground in the Mountain State as two potential 2016 contenders underscore the importance of the race as they come to campaign for the candidates dueling to replace retiring Sen Jay Rockefeller first elected 30 years ago Sen Elizabeth Warren DMass is in for Secretary of State Natalie Tennant the woman trying to keep the seat blue in a state that is increasingly crimson in hue On the other side of the state Rep Paul Ryan RWis is stumping for Rep Shelley Moore Capito RWVa Talk about contrasts The chief spokesman for entitlement overhauling juxtaposed with the woman who liberals hope will push a populist agenda back to the fore of the Democratic Party

Campaign Carl wants to know  ifin conservative West Virginia a visit from liberal Massachusetts Sen Elizabeth Warren helps Democratic Secretary of State Natalie Tennant stave off a GOP pickup West Virginia will make history and elect its first female US Senator this year Right now Republican Congresswoman Shelly Moore Capito leads the polls and has a superior war chest Democrats accuse the GOP of waging a war on women whileRepublicans accuse the Obama admin of waging war on coal Paul Ryan tours West Virginia with Capito today to help make the economic case against the ObamaTalentWarren Agenda  Chief Political Correspondent Carl Cameron

Warren heads to Michigan later this week to fundraise with Senate hopeful Rep Gary Peters DMich Peters faces Republican Terri Lynn Land in the race to succeed retiring Sen Carl Levin DMich

Hobby Lobby hobby horse  Charleston WVa Daily Mail Capito and Tennant are running for Senate at a time where much of the national dialogue is focused on womens issues including reproductive health access to abortions and the economy While much of their campaigns focus on job creation and helping small business  two aspects that affect the majority of voters  both acknowledge the pressing issues women face in todays society That includes a recent decision handed down by the US Supreme Court that found corporations could object to providing some types of contraception to employees via health insurance plans based on religious beliefs The decision has created a firestorm among womens rights groups who argue a womans boss shouldnt have the right to decide her reproductive choices

Power Play Recap  Chris Stirewalt sat down with Rep Capito to discuss her campaign strategy earlier in the race Watch here to find out why Capito thinks she will do more for West Virginia coal jobs

Fundraising figures  Charleston WVa Daily Mail Republican Rep Shelley Moore Capito raised 13 million in the latest fundraising quarter about a halfmillion dollars more than her Democratic opponent West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie Tennant Capitos additional money puts the campaign above 71 million raised since she announced her candidacy in late 2012 and gives the congresswoman nearly 5 million cash on hand

Global warming clouds Warrens clout  From West Virginias foremost political analyst Hoppy Kercheval  Warrens liberalism is a soft spot that Capito supporters want to exploit The National Republican Senatorial Committee charges that Warrens agenda is counter to the interests of West Virginians For example she supports the EPAs anticoal rules and backs a carbon tax We know enough to know that reducing carbon pollution from power plant emissions will make a real difference in the fight against climate change Warren said on the Senate floor after the EPA revealed its plan to cut emissions by 30 percent

RAND RETURNS FIRE ON PERRY FOREIGN POLICY ATTACK
In a surefire preview of 2016 Sen Rand Paul RKy is defending his foreign policy in an oped this morning after Gov Rick Perry RTexas claimed Paul had isolationist policies Perry who has been in the limelight over the ongoing border crisis attacked Paul in a weekend Washington Post opinion piece saying that Pauls strategy suggests that our nation should ignore what is happening in Iraq Paul responds today in Politico Some of Perrys solutions for the current chaos in Iraq arent much different from what Ive proposed something he fails to mention His solutions also arent much different from President Barack Obamas something he also fails to mention Because interestingly enough there arent that many good choices right now in dealing with this situation in Iraq Paul makes it pretty snarky too apparently his new glasses havent altered his perception of the world or allowed him to see it any more clearly

The seemingly unprovoked attack on Paul is a sign not only of Perrys interest but of Pauls status as the man to beat  so far  in the GOP 2016 stakes Perry is following the same path that other 2016 potential candidates have followed in hitting Paul on foreign policy Gov Chris Christie RNJ and Perrys fellow Texan Sen Ted Cruz have both made similar claims about Pauls policies

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/04/17/easter-2014-hope-for-dead/,AP What is the connection between freedom and rising from the dead When America was in its infancy and struggling to find a culture and frustrated at governance from Great Britain the word most frequently uttered in speeches and pamphlets and editorials was not safety or taxes or peace it was freedom     Two acts of Parliament broke the bonds with the mother country irreparably The first was the Stamp Act which was enforced by British soldiers who used general search warrants issued by a secret court in London to rummage through the personal possessions of any colonists they chose ostensibly looking to see whether those colonists had purchased the governments stamps The second intolerable act was the imposition of a tax to pay for the Church of England which all adult male propertyowning colonists were forced to pay no matter their religious beliefs The Stamp Act assaulted the right to be left alone in the home and the Church of England tax assaulted the freedom to retain ones earnings and to choose to support ones own means of worship The two taxes caused many colonists to realize they needed to secede from England and form their own country in which freedom would be protected by the government not assaulted by it Today it seems the power of the government continues to expand and the freedom of the individual continues to shrink The loss of freedom comes in many forms Sometimes it is direct and profound as when the government forces you to buy a health insurance policy for yourself or your employees that pays for contraceptive services euthanasia and abortion no matter your core religious beliefs Sometimes it is more subtle like when the government prints money to pay its bills and as a result all the money and assets you already have lose much of their value Sometimes the government steals freedom without you knowing it like when NSA agents in defiance of the Constitution they have sworn to uphold read your email and text messages and listen to your phone calls Sometimes the governments assaults on freedom are just plain inexplicable like when the president wins political support by lying repeatedly about keeping your doctor and your health insurance and about the governments not reading your emails or listening to your phone calls Freedom is the ability of every person to exercise his own free will rather than be subject to the will of the government or anyone else Free will is a characteristic we share in common with God He created us in His image and likeness As He is perfectly free so are we When the government takes away our free will the government steals a gift from God it violates the natural law it prevents us from having and utilizing the means to the truth The moral ability to exercise free will to seek the truth is a natural right that all humans possess and the government may only morally interfere with the exercise of that right when one affirmatively has given it away by using fraud or force to interfere with the exercise of someone elses natural rights We know from the events 2000 years ago which Christians commemorate and celebrate this week that freedom is the essential means to discover and unite with the truth And to Christians the personification the incarnation the perfect manifestation of truth is Jesus  who is the Christ the Son of God and the Son of the Blessed Virgin Mary On the first Holy Thursday Jesus attended a traditional Jewish Passover Seder Catholics believe that at His last supper He performed two miracles so that we could stay united to Him He transformed ordinary bread and wine into His own body blood soul and divinity and He empowered His disciples and their successors to do the same On the first Good Friday the Romans executed Jesus because they were persuaded that by claiming to be the Son of God He might foment a revolution against them The revolution He fomented was in the hearts of men and women The Romans had not heard of a revolution of the heart nevertheless they feared a revolution that would disrupt their worldly power and so they condemned Him to death by crucifixion Jesus had the freedom to reject this horrific event but He exercised His freedom so that we might know the truth The truth He manifested is that His acceptance of the destruction of His body would enable Him to die so that He could rise from the dead On Easter three days after He died that manifestation was complete when He rose from the dead By doing that he demonstrated to us that while living we can liberate our souls from the slavery of sin and our free wills from the oppression of the government and after death we can rise to be with Him Easter  which manifests our own immortality  is the linchpin of human existence With it life is worth living no matter its costs or pains Without it life is meaningless no matter its fleeting joys or triumphs Easter has a meaning that is both incomprehensible and simple It is incomprehensible that a human being had the freedom to rise from the dead It is simple because that human being was and is God Jesus is the hypostatic

 Credibility gap worsens IRS scandal
 First in Fox News First New call for Obama to visit border
 Can the Granite State crack the Pick Six
 Hillary responds to Rubios lastcentury knock
 Hey he didnt say he had never been armed     KOSKINENS CREDIBILITY GAP WORSENS IRS SCANDAL
The emails at the IRS may or may not be lost One thing that is lost for sure is much of the credibility of agency Commissioner John Koskinen the man tapped by President Obama to restore confidence in the beleaguered IRS in the wake of the revelation that the tax agency targeted Obamas political foes Koskinen who so haughtily and huffily refused to apologize and lectured lawmakers about his resume and qualifications is going to get barbequed today The third or fourth iteration of this email story has badly sapped his credibility as an outside reformer come to right the severely listing IRS

Watch Fox Correspondent Doug McKelway will follow IRS Commissioner John Koskinen appearance today before a House Oversight Committee panel No explanation  It all involves Lois Lerner who we know was looking to cover email tracks who we also know put out the story with a planted question and who now famously refuses to testify The potential charge being bandied by Republicans now sounds an awful lot like obstruction of justice Ask Martha Stewart how lightly federal courts treat that one Its not hard to imagine a motive to destroy evidence for a person in a situation like that But we wouldnt know what Lerner says about the emails because she wont testify The possibility that the emails could be recovered from another outside source may cause her to rethink that stance

Missed opportunity  The Lerner email debacle reinforces what weve known since this scandal popped more than a year ago The smart political play for Obama was always to find some fairminded Republican to act as overseer and repairman for the damaged agency The decision to stay within the pack for a new boss looks now to be a very grave error Whatever actually is going on Koskinen just doesnt have the credibility now to allay investigators evidence concerns or the public mistrust of the agency The pick was a botch perhaps driven by a desire to push ahead with ObamaCare implementation a key new role for the agency

Wait what  During a Democratic fundraiser in Seattle Tuesday night President Obama touted that he rarely learns anything from the news arguing Whatever theyre reporting about usually I know But Team Obama claimed he learned about the IRS and other scandals after watching the news However hes getting his news the president will continue a West Coast swing with three more fundraising events today in California

 Dither thou goest Mr President

 Udall ripped for ObamaCare cover up
 Power Play Feud could prove costly for Dems in Hawaii
 By infuse freshness we mean youre fired     DITHER THOU GOEST MR PRESIDENT
President Obama has made clear  repeatedly and from the outset  that the military strikes he has ordered in Iraq will be limited shall set no precedent for future humanitarian actions and would not be the prelude to any larger American effort to defeat the Islamist army that controls the northwestern portion of that country These are understandable strictures given Obamas disastrous experience with intervention and regime change in Libya as well as the attitudes of his political base The ongoing Libya debacle and the recollections of the Iraq war make it hard for Obama to argue for more robust activity not to mention that Obama himself was a chief author of Iraqs post US occupation story But today more boots are on the ground in Iraq and military planners are looking into an ambitious rescue effort for trapped civilians

Fox News contributor Kirsten Powers weighs in on President Obamas inattention to Iraqi Christians

Back and forth  This seesawing approach is a product of the presidents political andor philosophical considerations The principles make it hard for the mission to succeed and while the US waits for Western or Arab allies to join the effort the people Obama aims to help are dying and the US looks impotent in the face of a motley Islamist army So Obama is now sending more troops in hopes of attaining the limited goals he set It answers Hillary Clinton and other hawks who are pressuring the president to do more But a few hundred more advisors will not satisfy Hillary  Co Meantime the presidents dribbling escalation antagonizes his supporters who are watching the man who continually takes credit for leaving Iraq drawn further in Under similar pressure Obama crawfished his way into two surges in Afghanistan and the results have been dire for all involved

HILLARY ON SYRIA SMACK TALK SORRY NOT SORRY
How do you know when a politician is not sorry One strong sign is if she puts out a press release calling attention to the underlying offense Democratic 2016 frontrunner Hillary Clintons campaign released a statement saying that she had called President Obama on Tuesday to explain that when she said his slogan for foreign policy was unworthy of a great nation and not an organizing principle and blamed his inaction in Syria for the continued unraveling of the region it was not an attempt to attack him his policies or his leadership Thats true in the sense that it was not an attempt but rather a successful gambit There was pointedly no apology mentioned Real political contrition means letting the other person publicize the call if they choose to at all This looks more like a campaign stunt aimed at highlighting her differences with Obamas unpopular policies Adding extra insult Hillarys spokesman used brotalk and said the two would be hugging it out when they meet tonight at a huge Marthas Vineyard bash hosted by one their partys preeminent influence peddlers Publicly criticizing your former boss the sitting president during multiple foreign policy crises is not a hugitout kind of moment In an interview on Special Report with Bret Baier Obamas national security spokesman Ben Rhodes was measured in his response to Hillarys effrontery But you can be sure that Team Obama will not let this go unpunished

A little lobbying between friends never hurt anybody right  While the president is celebrating tonight with the superlobbyist set he might want to bring some employment applications His administration has now dropped its much ballyhooed restrictions on employing lobbyists

But she sure made a convincing case against it  Daily Caller Hillary Clinton now says she was a strong advocate of arming the Syrian rebels when she was secretary of state but in a February 2012 interview she passionately pushed back against the viability of such an opposition  even raising the specter that such a policy might be akin to supporting alQaida What are we going to arm them with and against what she said when pressed in a CBS interview about why the Obama administration wasnt giving the Syrian rebels weapons to help them in their fight against Syrian dictator Bashar alAssad We know that alQaida leader Ayman al Zawahiri is supporting the opposition in Syria Are we supporting alQaida in Syria Hamas is now supporting the opposition Are we supporting Hamas in Syria

DEMS DISAGREE ON OBAMAS IMMIGRATION ACTIONS
New York Magazines Jonathan Chait warned liberals that President Obamas threatened action to legalize millions of illegal immigrants while lawful would set a precedent for executive authority that would be hard to ever undo To think that the cycle will end here and that a future president wont claim more expansive and disturbing powers to selectively enforce the law requires an optimism not borne out by history In the short run we will rejoice in the sudden deliverance of massive humanitarian relief to people who have done nothing more than try to create a better life for their families In the long run we may look back on it with regret But not to worry says The New Republics Brian Beutler who argues that Obamas unilateral action is okay because amnesty is inevitable Congress is very likely one to three years away from passing a law that will give permanent protection to this same class of people But it isnt quite there yet Under the circumstances Obamas move wouldnt just constitute a judicious allocation of resources but an eminently humane reprieve for the hundreds or thousands of unlucky duckies

Go for it  HuffPo reports on how a Democrat political group is pushing a legal case for sweeping action on immigration by citing instances when past presidents have given limited reprieves to selected groups of immigrants

Washington Examiner Executive Editor Mark Tapscott is not at all impressed with White House Press Secretary Josh Earnests response to criticism of an administrationwide crackdown on reporting and limitations on media access Earnest said that President Obama has set an historically high standard of transparency that is part of the legacy to which future presidents will aspire

Fox,http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2014/11/05/ballot-measures-marijuana-advocates-looking-to-california-in-2016-after-tuesday/,SEATTLE  Marijuana activists who have longed for decades to end Americas drug war pocketed more major victories Tuesday with Oregon and the nations capital approving recreational pot use The advocates believed they also have another win too in Alaska as a legal pot measure held a steady lead The only major loss for druglaw reformers came in Florida and even there a medical marijuana proposal earned 58 percent   just shy of the 60 percent required to pass The victories came in a midterm election that saw a low turnout and an electorate that handed Republicans back control of the US Senate for the first time since 2006 The results emboldened marijuana activists as they prepare legalization efforts in California Massachusetts Maine and other states in the next presidential election year Were starting work right now for 2016 said Joe Brezny whos leading a campaign to legalize marijuana in Nevada The other side is in trouble if were doing this well in a Republican midterm year Legalization opponent Kevin Sabet called the votes a bit of a wakeup call before 2016 noting that drug policy groups had spent millions on the legalization campaigns vastly outspending opponents This is going to make our side redouble our efforts to find donors who can put forth real money said the president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana adding that if they can get the resources to get their message out voters could make informed decisions Sabet pointed to the result in Florida as well as votes in five Colorado cities banning marijuana dispensaries in saying I think weve slowed the legal marijuana freight train The measures were among many that appeared on ballots with voters approving ones to raise the minimum wage in four states passing expanded gun background checks in Washington state and rejecting abortionrelated measures in two states In California drug war opponents welcomed a vote that reduces penalties from felonies to misdemeanors on possession of small amounts of drugs    including cocaine and heroin The pot votes however were considered by many to be the first real test of marijuana reforms popularity since Washington state and Colorado passed the nations first legal pot laws in 2012 boosted then by the higher turnout among young people typical of presidential election years Tuesdays vote saw voters in the District of Columbia make it legal to possess up to two ounces of pot and up to three mature marijuana plants for personal use but it does not provide for the legal sale of marijuana Thats left up to the DC Council The measures in Oregon and Alaska would follow Colorado and Washington state in setting up regulation and taxation systems It was an extraordinary day for marijuana and criminal justice reform and all the more remarkable on a night the Democrats were getting beat up so bad said Ethan Nadelmann executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance a major legalization backer Some voters in Alaska said marijuana was essentially legal in the state anyway thanks to a 1975 state Supreme Court decision that possession of small amounts in the home is protected by citizens right to privacy Its just a waste of cop time and court time and its pretty much harmless as far as Im concerned Well break even on making money on taxes on it voter Scott Jenks said Gayle Boyer who said people shouldnt be arrested for using marijuana voted against the measure saying there were too many unanswered questions about legalization    and the experiments going on in Colorado and Washington state We need to let them be the guinea pigs she said Advocates opponents and the US government have closely watched Washington and Colorado to gauge the impact on the black market drug use among teens and impaired driving among other areas In both states adults over 21 can purchase marijuana including potent extracts and edibles at statelicensed dispensaries Colorado allowed sales to begin at the start of the year by letting its alreadylicensed medical dispensaries begin selling for recreational use There have been some concerns over the strength of edibles sold prompting plans for new rules there In Washington where there is no regulated medical industry legal marijuanas rollout has gone more slowly Colorado is on track to bring in about 84 million this year from medical and recreational pot taxes and fees In Washington where recreational pot sales began in July the tax collections have totaled more than 7 million Here are how some other ballot measured fared on Tuesday MINIMUM WAGE Voters in four states approved increases in the state minimum wage In Arkansas it will rise from 625 an hour to 850 by 2017 in Nebraska from 725 to 9 and in South Dakota from 725 to 850 In Alaska it will increase 2 an hour to 975 in 2016 GUN SALES In Washington state voters approved a measure to expand background checks on gun sales and transfers the checks will extended to private transactions and many loans and gifts The rival measure would have prevented the state from expanding checks in that fashion it was trailing statewide FOOD FIGHT Colorado voters rejected a measure that would have required labeling of certain genetically modified foods The proposal would have applied to raw and packaged foods produced entirely or partially by genetic engineering but not apply to food served in restaurants A similar measure was too close to call in Oregon In Hawaii voters in Maui County opted to temporarily ban the cultivation of genetically engineered crops after a campaign featuring 8 million in advertising from some of the worlds largest cornseed producers SUGARY DRINKS Voters in Berkeley California became the first in the country to pass a tax on sodas and other sugary drinks Highdollar advertising campaigns by the 76 billion US softdrink industry had defeated the proposal in more than 30 other cities and states in recent years including San Francisco where voters on Tuesday rejected a soda tax ___ David Crary in New York Nigel Duara in Portland Oregon Rachel DOro in

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/04/07/is-intimidation-to-blame-for-ouster-mozilla-chief-over-gay-marriage/, The forced resignation of Mozillas CEO over his views on gay marriage has sparked a passionate debate that doesnt always break down along the lines you would expect The media framing of the saga of Brendan Eich has been that a bigot got what he deserved that is when it was covered the network evening newscasts couldnt find time for the Mozilla story last week But even some of those who deeply believe in samesex marriage say its a case study in intolerance     Eich was pushed out of the company that makes the Firefox browser after a week in the top job because he contributed 1000 to Californias Prop 8 back in 2008 He has not spoken of gays in disparaging terms or made his workplace unfriendly to gays He simply supported the position backed by Barack Obama until the spring of 2012 that marriage should be between a man and a woman I believe that samesex marriage will eventually become the law of the land given the shift in public opinion and that most younger people regard it as a nonissue But you can believe that and also think that those who hold different views should be treated with respectjust like in the divisive debate over abortion Andrew Sullivan the gay blogger who has been an advocate of samesex marriage for decades and is married to his husband is appalled by what happened to Eich Will he now be forced to walk through the streets in shame Why not the stocks The whole episode disgusts me  as it should disgust anyone interested in a tolerant and diverse society If this is the gay rights movement today  hounding our opponents with a fanaticism more like the religious right than anyone else  then count me out If we are about intimidating the free speech of others we are no better than the antigay bullies who came before us For Sullivan to accuse some of his fellow gays and gayrights advocates of fanaticism and intimidation is an incredibly strong statementand a tribute to his long record of independent thinking Americablogs John Aravosis who got into a heated debate with Amy Holmes on yesterdays Media Buzz takes a different viewand at one point compared opposition to samesex marriage to the Holocaust Holmes shot back that the Human Rights Campaign endorsed Obama when his position was also in favor of traditional marriage Aravosis writes Normally I wouldnt really care how a corporate CEO felt about marriage equality Dont get me wrongI care And Id laud a CEO if she came out in support of it But I dont think Id launch a campaign against a company simply because its boss wasnt quite there yet on marriage I know lots of people who arent there yet  though that audience is slimming down fast But Brendan Eich wasnt simply not there yet  he played an active role in creating and enforcing discrimination against millions of gay Californians So his offense was pretty severe and it went arguably beyond speech  he joined the ranks of antigay activist But does that mean he cant be CEO of a company Well I think once you reach the level of CEO in a visiblynamed company theres greater internal sensitivity to anything in your life that could harm the business The company chastised itself for giving Eich the top job and celebrated his departure Mozillaprides itself on being held to a different standard and this past week we didnt live up to it We know why people are hurt and angry and they are right its because we havent stayed true to ourselves We didnt act like youd expect Mozilla to act We didnt move fast enough to engage with people once the controversy started Were sorry We must do better Eich for his part told the Guardian before he quit I dont want to talk about my personal beliefs because I kept them out of Mozilla all these 15 years weve been going I dont believe theyre relevant In National Review Reihan Salam says Eich could have minimized the damage but chose not to I was a supporter of samesex civil marriage long before our incumbent president  at least a decade before if memory serves I continue to support samesex civil marriage But I find the campaign against Brendan Eich instructive Had Brendan Eich decided to apologize  had he decided to say that he had come around on the issue and had he added that his donation to the Proposition 8 campaign was a profound mistake that he would regret for the rest of his life and which he will atone for by making a large donation to one of the organizations pressing the case for samesex civil marriage  he could have spared himself all of this troubleAgree with him or disagree with him Brendan Eich was willing to pay a price for his beliefs That is true he could have saved his job by mouthing the right words In Slate Will Oremus acknowledges that the pendulum has swung dramatically in recent yearsbut insists it doesnt matter There was a time when supporting gay marriage made you a radical Then there was a time when it made you a progressive Now weve reached a point wherenotsupporting gay marriage makes you unfit to lead a major Silicon Valley organization Some will say weve come too far too fastthat its unfair to pillory someone for a political view that was held by the majority of Californians just six years ago Theyre wrong The notion that your political views shouldnt affect your employment is a persuasive one Where would we be as a democracy if Republicans were barred from jobs at Democratled companies or vice versa But this is different Opposing gay marriage in America today is not akin to opposing tax hikes or even the war in Afghanistan Its more akin to opposing interracial marriage It bespeaks a conviction that some people do not deserve the same basic rights as others An organization like Mozilla might tolerate that in an underling and it might even tolerate it in a CTO But in a CEOthe ultimate decisionmaker and public face of an organizationit sends an awful message Well give the last word to a Mozilla staffer Erin Kissane who penned a tortured blog post before her boss stepped down As a queer employee of Mozilla I dont actually feel particularly vulnerable but I know many people in the wider community have been stung as well as intellectually offended by this choice So my first duty is to them to the people harmed Neither Brendan nor our board have apologized for the ramifications of their actions which is certainly their call But I am sorry for the harm done To everyone who has flinched away and everyone retraumatized by these events I offer a complete and sincere apology I have chosen to walk under this banner and that makes me complicit and I am so sorry for the pain I know this has caused Brendan I grew up in a very conservative religious home and many of the people I love the most can still be described as very religious and very conservative I think your views on this issue are wrong and that your actions have done harm but I can no more caricature you as a terrible person driven by homophobia and hatred than I can break off relations with my cherished family members because they take actions similar to yours Her conflicted stance

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/11/06/seeing-light-one-mothers-story-raising-child-with-down-syndrome/,Angelo explores Sesame Street during a Lincoln Center Passport Program tour of the Somebody Come and Play exhibition at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts on Oct 25 2014Cait McCarthy As a 30something living in New York City Gina LeVeque had an exciting career in journalism a passport with stamps from Italy and a longterm boyfriend To an outsider and even to LeVeque at the time her life looked pictureperfect When LeVeque learned she was pregnant in the fall of 2007 she and her boyfriend celebrated They talked about getting married and building a family     But during a doctors visit that October LeVeque like hundreds of other expectant moms in the United States today received news that would shake her seemingly idealistic world Her child which she had been carrying for about 14 weeks had Down syndrome You just have this sinking feeling of dread LeVeque now 43 told FoxNewscom I had this thing in my head I dont know where it comes from maybe its pride Im healthy I went to an Ivy League school I ran a marathon When LeVeque recounts receiving the prenatal diagnosis and the days that followed the word fear peppers her description She thought she knew about Down syndrome The physical side effects from poor muscle tone to upward slanting eyes plus the learning disabilities and impulsive behavior One in every 691 babies in the United States is born with Down syndrome making it the most common genetic condition in the country according to the National Down Syndrome Society The disorder varies in severity causing lifelong disabilities and developmental delays and in some health problems About half of children born with Down syndrome have some sort of heart defect which can be lifethreatening according to the Mayo Clinic Abnormalities in their immune systems can also put them at greater risk for infectious diseases like pneumonia People with Down syndrome are also at an increased risk for conditions like leukemia dementia sleep apnea obesity gastrointestinal problems and skin conditions The hardest decision Everyone took a side While LeVeques mother and aunt wanted her to keep the baby her father and boyfriends mother pressured her to terminate the pregnancy Although he doesnt feel this way today at the time LeVeques boyfriend also wanted her to have an abortion LeVeque recalled her doctor at the time telling her about one of her neighbors who had a daughter with Down syndrome and frequently ran away Her family regularly had to call the cops in the middle of the night the doctor said LeVeque made two separate appointments for an abortion but she canceled both It was a time of complete despair in my heart and chaos around me she said LeVeque said she couldnt turn to her family for support Her mother who had been married several times and was an alcoholic at the time abandoned her and her younger halfbrother when she was in the fourth grade I think that for a lot of people if they did come from any kind of brokenness its not unusual as they get older that they develop unusually close friendships or that their friendships become more significant in their lives because they dont have that closeness with their family LeVeque said Without question I would say I fell into that category LeVeque sought advice from friends who directed her to the Sisters of Life a NYCbased Catholic community aimed at assisting pregnant women in crises In December she moved into their convent for six months severed ties with her boyfriend and considered putting the child up for adoption until she met with other parents who had once been in her position I spoke to this woman who had put her child up for adoption and I couldnt relate to what she was saying LeVeque said I was still very fearful but I do remember when I canceled the second appointment and having a phone conversation with her boyfriend and saying I am going to have this child I remember feeling such lightness for the first time in so long this freedom really just light I didnt know what the road was ahead but difficult as it was I was making the right choice Seeing the light Today LeVeque and her son Angelo 6 live in Manhattan where LeVeque said he continues to emanate that light It sounds like a clich that God can make good out of all things but Angelo is a real testament to that LeVeque said He is this little pure soul Hes happier and more popular in school than I ever was in my entire career Children are innocent but I have to say that a lot of people have approached me and they do this almost on a weekly basis in talking about his light Angelo started attending school about a year ago and LeVeque said hes fallen into a routine of being greeted by his peers He basically starts running and he also has arthritis so hes basically doing his version of a run toward school and the kids see him and they start going Oh its Angelo and they all come around Its almost like you hear the Rocky theme song coming People push each other out of the way to hug him Christine HammillCregan a volunteer at Sisters of Life who saw LeVeque through the early days of her pregnancy recounted the first time she saw her friend with Angelo From the moment he was born he did it for Gina HammillCregan 48 told FoxNewscom Everything all those fears that she had at the diagnosis it all disappeared and she was engulfed in the love of a mother Raising a child with special needs often comes with its own set of unique challenges but LeVeque is Angelos biggest advocate She does all the research does everything she needs to do to get him into the best school for him and get him the best doctor and the right diagnosis HammillCregan said Thats a lot of work Shes a mom and thats what shes going to do But thats really timeconsuming Its a lot of work One step at a time While most children start walking at age 2 Angelo did not walk until he was 3 and half years old LeVeque said But anytime she would take Angelo to the doctor they would point to Down syndrome as the cause for his inability to walk It wasnt until LeVeque visited Dr Joseph Dutkowsky associate clinical professor of orthopedic surgery at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City that Angelo was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis When I first met Angelo he came in with two or three pairs of braces and wouldnt walk Dutkowsky also the president of the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine told FoxNewscom in an email Children with Down syndrome do walk at his age so I blanked his Down syndrome out of my mind and just looked at him as a child Dutkowsky said making the arthritis diagnosis was easy He didnt walk because he couldnt he didnt walk because he was in pain How normal is that Once he was treated for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis he immediately started walking and running Angelos misdiagnosis illustrates a problem that is becoming more common in the medical community Dutkowsky said Once a diagnosis of Down syndrome cerebral palsy etc is made doctors have a great tendency to focus on all symptoms relating to that diagnosis he said In fact persons with disabilities can and do get the same things common cold appendicitis ovarian cysts as everyone else The medical community and educators are simply behind in relating this fact to doctors at all levels of training More challenging than raising a child with special needs LeVeque said is dealing with prejudice and remaining patient with people who arent educated about Down syndrome The biggest lesson LeVeque has learned from her son is to accept others for who they are and to not try to change them rework them or fix them Seeing the world through the innocent eyes of little Angelo has allowed her to view life from a new perspective  Its like the way that the world should be is the way that he lives it LeVeque said Theres not enough love in the world People are so competitive and edgy and stressed out but he just enjoys life,2014-11-06T06:00-05:00,abortion

 Finally the campaign condom     LAW AND DISORDER PENTAGON PUSHES BACK
Is the United States at war with the Sunni Islamist separatists in control of Iraq and Syria It sure sounded that way when Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel addressed the subject at a press conference Theyre beyond just a terrorist group They marry ideology a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess They are tremendously wellfunded Hagel said it was beyond anything that weve seen He followed that with a grim warning So we must prepare for everything And the only way you do that is that you take a cold steely hard look at it and get ready So what do you do about that Gen Martin Dempsey the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said it would require escalating the conflict and striking targets inside of Syria

The latest  Reuters At least 191369 people have been killed in Syrias conflict through April more than double the figure documented a year ago and probably still an underestimate the United Nations human rights office said on Friday

But  Once upon a time President Obama considered bombing Syria but opted not to do it saying he lacked the authority to act alone Hagel and Dempsey spoke of building a Gulf Warstyle multinational coalition to take on the Islamist army but while France is feeling bellicose these days that still sounds a little farfetched Of course when Obama previously considered bombing Syria he was thinking of targeting the other side the regime of Bashar al Assad Will he be more willing to act and build a coalition now that the US is seemingly on Assads side or at least united by a common enemy If the raids help Assad Russia China and Iran might even be on board at the UN

The president has a foreign policy which has failed once again He underestimated the extent of the threat represented by terror in the world and specifically ISIS and as a result now we find ourselves facing a very severe and horrific series of scenes on the world stage  Mitt Romney onThe Kelly File Watch the full interview here

Lawman  While the military is pushing for escalation there are contradictory signs from the presidents inner circle Attorney General Eric Holder sounded like he was heading up a criminal investigation on Thursday not speaking of a war effort As the president mulls which way to go will he be persuaded to lead the charge of a Western coalition army or the lead prosecutor in a criminal case

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/08/06/oklahoma-ag-challenges-irs-plan-investigate-churches,  This is a rush transcript from The Kelly File August 5 2014 This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated     SHANNON BREAM GUEST HOST Developing tonight  a new challenge to the Feds over a secret plan to target churches One states attorney general is now demanding to know exactly what is in that IRS deal with an atheist group to investigate what pastors are saying from the pulpit Scott Pruitt is Oklahomas attorney general he is a Republican and joins us live Mr Attorney General thank you for your time tonight SCOTT PRUITT OKLAHOMA ATTORNEY GENERAL Hello Shannon Hello Shannon good evening BREAM All right Let me ask you about this A lot of questions because we dont have details What are you asking the IRS and DOJ to tell you and what are the red flags for you PRUITT Well you just said something very key  you said there are no details And that is primarily the concern that theres been a settlement thats been entered into by the Freedom from Religion Foundation and the IRS And there was a lawsuit that was filed in Wisconsin and this settlement occurred And this organization is an organization that has referred a bishop in Wisconsin to the IRS for enforcement for sharing his scriptural views about abortion and homosexuality and hes done the same thing with the Billy Graham Association as well So this settlement is of great concern Because if the IRS has agreed to new protocols or new enforcement under the law this goes to the content of what a pastor is going to say in the pulpit we need to know about it BREAM All right So the group says and I talk about the cofounder there Dan Barger who says listen were not asking the IRS to do anything special Were just asking them to do their job Because in our estimation the tax code and the socalled Johnson Amendment which was from thenSenator Lyndon Johnson says essentially that churches and charities if theyre 501C3s cannot talk about political candidates Now you mentioned the one topic there with the church from Wisconsin And Im trying to find our exact facts here But essentially there was a sermon that was given or something sent out that said you cant vote for somebody if youre a Catholic you cant vote for somebody who is prochoice It just square with the teachings of this church They didnt mention a candidate but Freedom from Religion Foundation said thats like telling them to vote for Mitt Romney So where do you draw the line PRUITT Well thats  the traditional view and you cited it Shannon is under the Johnson amendment a pastor cant endorse from the pulpit a candidate endorsement There is a concern that this has now reached content that if a pastor engages in scriptural teaching around the sanctity of life or the sanctity of marriage that this organization believes that that is considered electioneering or politicking under the IRS code and has referred it for enforcement to the IRS If this settlement reaches that level thats a whole new level of enforcement and we need to know about that because that shouldnt be something done in secret I mean Shannon the other issue is that litigation  when you have settlement you cant regulate through litigation you cant adopt rules through litigation If the IRS has adopted new protocol thats considered rule making under the administrative procedures act and they cant do that through a lawsuit They have to go through open processes notice and comments So there are concerns here about the process but also whether this group has achieved a victory as theyve held it to get into content beyond candidate endorsement BREAM Yes And you mentioned the issue with Billy Grahams ministry And essentially it was a newspaper ad that urged voters to consider these issues about abortion and samesex marriage and that kind of thing and praying that we will turn our hearts back to God Freedom from Religion Foundation complained about that If they come to power now to reach a deal with the IRS how far do you think theyre going to go PRUITT Well we need to know I mean thats the reason the settlement needs to be disclosed Thats why weve sent the letters to the Justice Department to Attorney General Holder and the commissioner at the IRS to disclose that settlement to see if there are new protocols of enforcement that go to content as you have described You know we know that there have been 99 churches Shannon that have been referred for enforcement to the IRS for further inquiry This is a very disconcerting settlement thats occurred This group has hailed it as a victory This group has a very different view of the first amendment and a very different view of the traditional enforcement under the Johnson amendment And if the IRS is engaged in  settlement and not gone to rule making we need to know about it so we can take appropriate steps BREAM And we know a lot of churches out there pastors priests are saying to the IRS bring it on They want this legal challenge so they can fight that Johnson amendment or at least the interpretation of it in court Mr Attorney General please let us know if you get response from the IRS or DOJ Wed love to have you back Lets talk about it PRUITT Thank you Shannon BREAM Thank you sir Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network LLC

may be updated Watch The OReilly Factor weeknights at 8 pm and 11 pm ET     OREILLY The Factor followup segment tonight The state of Arizona investigating Planned Parenthood for failing to report a possible rape of an underage girl and inaudible plan parenthood is under fire for inappropriate and perhaps criminal conduct towards minor Recently a live action group which opposes Planned Parenthood did another undercover sting this time in Minnesota A young woman telling Planned Parenthood she was 15 years old and asking for advice concerning a boyfriend A viewer warning some of the tape you are going to see and hear is graphic Roll it BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE I think it just depends on what it is you are looking for a horse whip I wouldnt recommend it I mean it kind of depends what it is you are looking for There are probably a lot of things out there I dont know about I know for example patients will sometimes come in with rope burns or markings on their breasts from like clamps If its consensual its OK END VIDEO CLIP  OREILLY Its not OK Joining us now from Phoenix Kristen Waggoner Senior Vice President with the Alliance Defending Freedom Organization which has filed a complaint against Planned Parenthood in Arizona So I understand today there was a pretrial hearing for a man named Tyler Cost 18 years old who is involved with the statutory rape situation and Planned Parenthood Pick up the story from there KRISTEN WAGGONER ALLIANCE DEFENDING FREEDOM Well Mr Cost has been indicted on 30 different counts of sexual assault ranging with women who are under 15 years of age and also under up to  under 18 years of age One of those counts there have been 13 victims One of those counts is a woman who reported her rape to it Planned Parenthood And we filed a formal complaint on behalf of Alliance Defending Freedom to have the State of Arizona formally investigate this immediately investigate Planned Parenthood because every girl deserves to be protected And what the allegations have shown is that Planned Parenthood actually told this mother and the rape victim that it wasnt worth the hassle of reporting her rape to authorities OREILLY How old was this girl who is pregnant WAGGONER She was 14 years of excuse me 14 years of age OREILLY All right 14 years of age She went to Planned Parenthood with her mother She did have an abortion subsequently correct WAGGONER Yes OREILLY OK And Planned Parenthood provided the abortion services but would not tell according to you and the allegation would not tell state authorities that this girl of 14 had been raped by this Taylor Cost at 18 thats against the law There is a Romeo Juliet exception in Arizona which means two year difference between the man the girl and the boy they dont prosecute But this is way beyond that Now Planned Parenthood what do they say Do they deny it What do they say WAGGONER Ambiguous statement saying that of course they would comply with the law but actions speak louder than words here What we know is that this young woman and her mother reported the rape to Planned Parenthood The sheriff has that in his official report And that they did not report it to authorities And that Mr OREILLY If you have that kind of evidence that you have it all then Planned Parenthood is guilty What will happen then Will a counselor be prosecuted for Planned Parenthood Will they be shut down Whats the result of all of this WAGGONER We are asking that state authorities get to the bottom of this Get to the truth of it because whats an important piece of this is that Mr Cost went out and victimized several young girls after Planned Parenthood had notice of the rape So we want the truth to come out first and foremost but we want Planned Parenthood to have accountable and those clinics that have violated the law they need to be shut down because this is not about a profit motive it shouldnt be putting a buck ahead of a young girls health and safety CROSSTALK OREILLY As you said this is a serial he is charged with serial sex crimes and he could have been stopped if Planned Parenthood had obeyed the law But Im just wondering I know the attorney general for Arizona is investigating because we talked to his office He is on it But Im wondering whether they will actually file charges which is very rare against Planned Parenthood As you know on this program tape after tape after tape all over the country shows these Planned Parenthood counselors talking to minors in inappropriate ways sometimes illegal activities sometimes that they shouldnt be directed to but nothing seems to happen to them Planned Parenthood WAGGONER Right and thats one of the things that significant about this is that nothing was happening until we along with our friends at the Center for Arizona Policy put out a press release and then did a press conference to highlight this issue So the tragedy of this situation is that we would even need a child abuse reporting law to cover Planned Parenthood because you would think they would be concerned about the health and safety of women But instead they are concerned about widening their profit margins as much as possible OREILLY All right Ms Wagoner we are going to follow the case and we appreciate your time today Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network LLC ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Copyright 2012 CQRoll Call Inc

Press RIO DE JANEIRO  Brazils rapid religious transformation is reverberating through the countrys tight presidential race where abortion and gay marriage have emerged as hotbutton issues and Pentecostal televangelists could be political power brokers The socially conservative Pentecostal population now includes more than onefifth of the electorate just three decades after barely registering any presence at all That change has the secularminded incumbent quoting Psalms while her Biblereading main rival has repeatedly stressed her belief in a secular state to avoid alienating liberal voters ahead of Sundays firstround vote     During a recent service at his 6000seat Assemblies of God church in a gritty Rio de Janeiro neighborhood Brazils most influential Pentecostal pastor spent half of the service talking about the election nudging voters to support top opposition candidate Marina Silva who is a member of the Assemblies of God by far Brazils largest Pentecostal denomination If Silva makes it to the second round and defeats incumbent Dilma Rousseff in an expected Oct 26 runoff she would become the first Pentecostal leader of a country with more Catholics than any other A pastor isnt the owner of anybodys ballot I dont have a band of angels who can peek over your shoulder in the voting booth said Silas Malafaia his face looming on two jumbo TV screens bookending the enormous stage where he paced But youve got to vote your conscience Dont just give your vote away Vote against the corrupt and those who want to destroy the family Malafaia alone has 800000 followers on Twitter books that have sold in the millions and sermons beamed around the globe He is part of a rapidly swelling movement that is strongly rooted among poorer Brazilians a group that otherwise heavily favors Rousseffs Workers Party which has lifted millions from poverty with expansive social welfare programs and the creation of millions of new jobs In a survey released Friday the Datafolha polling group found that 54 percent of Pentecostal voters would support Silva in an expected secondround vote while Rousseff was favored by 38 percent Among the population as a whole the two were neck and neck Datafolha polled 11474 people across Brazil on Sept 2526 and the margin of error was two percentage points But in a Datafolha poll released Tuesday night Rousseff had pulled ahead of Silva in a secondround vote leading 49to41 A breakdown by religion in the latest poll was not yet available Rousseff a former Marxist guerrilla who was imprisoned and tortured during Brazils military dictatorship rarely spoke of religion before this campaign but she has been making the rounds of Pentecostal churches and invoking Gods name of late In August she spoke to hundreds of Pentecostals in Sao Paulo at an Assemblies of God church Im opening my remarks by saying that the Brazilian state is secular Rousseff said to a silent crowd But citing the Psalm of David Id like to say that Joyful is the nation whose God is the Lord she immediately added to loud applause By contrast the deeply religious Silva has made no campaign stops in churches and has kept Pentecostal leaders at arms length in public hoping to combat suspicions among nonreligious voters that conservative pastors could shape the stance a Silva government would have on social issues Those worries intensified when her official platform reversed support for gay marriage less than 24 hours after its release last month following blistering attacks on the proposal from Malafaia and other Pentecostal leaders Silva supports Brazils current law allowing samesex civil unions which gives gay partners the same rights as heterosexual couples but stops short of supporting religious weddings for gays As an impoverished daughter of a rubber tapper deep in the Amazon Silva wanted to become a nun and as a teenager moved into a convent where she first learned to read and write at age 16 There she came into contact with priests adhering to liberation theology a Latin Americaninspired movement that advocates for the poor But in 1997 facing extreme health problems after five bouts with malaria as a girl and hepatitis as a teenager Silva then a senator converted to the Pentecostal faith upon being told by a doctor that only a miracle could help her For some Silvas mixed religious background could be a political asset Marina is in a really nice position where she got Malafaia the rock star pastor of the Assembly of God to back her so she probably feels like a lot of her evangelical support is solidified said Andrew Chesnut a professor and expert on Latin American religions at Virginia Commonwealth University who has focused on Brazils Pentecostals And the fact she was involved with liberationist Catholicism  means more progressive Catholics will sympathize with her But when it comes time to cast their ballot Brazilian Pentecostals who are overwhelmingly poor will face a dilemma in choosing between Silva a woman who shares their faith and their gratitude to Rousseffs Workers Party for strong socioeconomic advances in the last 12 years Michelle Jeronimo a 22yearold heading into Malafaias service last week said Silva would get the backing of Pentecostals because she would maintain Gods posture in the face of widely perceived government dishonesty Pentecostals are so disappointed with the corruption with the broken promises so theyre looking to this Pentecostal side of her Jeronimo said adding that Silva will fulfill what she said what she promised what she said she intends to do But Silre Noguiera handing out campaign fliers for Pentecostal congressional candidates outside Malafaias church looked over her shoulders before whispering where her political allegiance lay The Workers Party governments are the only ones that ever did anything for the poor Dilma has my vote she said Im not convinced most Pentecostals will vote based on religion At the end of the day they want a president wholl give them a better life ___ Brad Brooks on Twitter wwwtwittercombradleybrooks,2014-10-01T00:00-04:00,abortion

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/06/26/supreme-court-what-hobby-lobby-religious-freedom-case-wont-resolve/, Win lose or draw the decision by the US Supreme Court in two cases involving religious freedom expected by the end of June will not resolve all the questions regarding the legality of the Obama administrations Health and Human Services Mandate While forprofit employers have been threatened with massive ObamaCare fines since 2012 the temporary safeharbor for religious nonprofits expired this year What has gone into effect is what the Obama administration has labeled an accommodation But it is not an exemption Rather the accommodation will in fact require that these religious nonprofits comply with the health laws mandate     The decision for the consolidated cases Sebelius v Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood v Sebelius will determine whether the government can use onerous fines to threaten family businesses like those run by the Green and Hahn families to violate their religious beliefs But the fate of the Obama administrations socalled accommodation for religious nonprofits is the subject of other lawsuits that are making their way through the lower courts now The religious organizations that are plaintiffs in the 51 nonprofit lawsuits filed so far are diverse in faith backgrounds and in purpose They include religious hospitals ministries colleges and universitiesincluding my alma maters Franciscan University and the University of Notre Dameas well as orders of priests and nuns such as Priests for Life and the Little Sisters of the Poor The fine print of the Obama administrations accommodation for these religious nonprofits reveals a baitandswitch The very explanation HHS gives in its final rule for how the accommodation will work exposes the fallacy of the Obama administrations claim that under its accommodation these religious groups would not contract arrange pay or refer for the coverage that violates its religious beliefs HHS notes that plan participants and beneficiaries on an accommodated plan do not have two separate health insurance policies Rather the insurance issuer the insurance company for the religious organization will make what HHS calls separate payments for the objectionable coverage Calling them separate does not align with reality These payments are directly linked to the insurance plan they are supposedly separate from There is no optin or optout The payments are automatically made for the accommodated plans participants and beneficiaries and start and end with a persons enrollment in the accommodated plan  not a moment before and not a moment after HHS also acknowledges that issuers typically do not receive enrollee information prior to enrollment Put another way the relationship between the issuer making the separate payments and the plan enrollees is completely dependent on the supposedly accommodated organizations plan Where does the money for the separate payments come from  In its final rule HHS explains that these payments can be envisioned as cost neutral for the insurance issuer because they would be insuring the same set of individuals under both the group health insurance policies and the separate payments HHS assumes that providing contraceptive coverage would result in fewer pregnancies and at least equally lowered costs on the accommodated group health plan  One has to question whether that is true considering that contraceptive use as the Obama administration has said in its own talking points is already ubiquitous But even accepting HHS assumption the math only works if these contraceptive payments are considered in conjunction with the supposedly separate health plan Even selfinsured plans cannot avoid participating in the coercive morally offensive mandate The accommodation requires a selfinsured employer to notify a thirdparty administrator that it objects to this coverage But in HHS own words the selfcertificationwill be treated as a designation of the third party administrator to make contraceptive payments No means yes It is a clear and intentional fiction to claim that the payments are separate and distinct from the accommodated plan and that the employer plays no role in the facilitation of and payment for the coverage it objects to Both the family businesses and nonprofits challenging the Obama administrations threat of crippling fines have been predominantly winning The vast majority of lower courts have granted at least preliminary injunctive relief protecting religious liberty Although the ultimate outcome of these cases as both sides have appealed their losses appear hopeful for the plaintiffs even good Supreme Court rulings will not solve the entire problem A nonreligious organization for example Americans United for Life may have a moral objection but not a religious objection and a claim under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act RFRA To that end conscience protecting legislation has also been introduced in both the US House of Representatives and the Senate Importantly the Health Care Rights of Conscience Act HR 940 and S 1204 protects the conscience rights of religious and moral objectors A loss in the Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood cases would certainly be a significant setback for conscience rights The denial of injunctive relief for the Green and Hahn families will force real people into an immediate untenable position of either facing fines that may cripple their businesses or violating their religious beliefs The Obama administrations lawyer conceded during oral arguments that under its theory of the case other antilife mandateslike the abortion insurance mandate passed by the Washington State Housewould be enforceable against religious objections Fortunately history tells us that when the US Supreme Court gets it wrong the battle is not over RFRA itself was a Congressional response to a court decision denying a religious liberty claim Win lose or draw Congress can add clarity and security to our cherished First Amendment freedoms by passing the Health Care Rights of Conscience Act  Anna Franzonello is Staff Counsel at Americans United for Life and twice testified before the

record while in the Georgia State AssemblyReutersGaAppealsus An Obama judicial nominee is facing some fierce opposition from an unlikely source more than two dozen liberal groups and two Democratic congressmen from his home state Michael Boggs a judge for the Court of Appeals of Georgia and a former state representative was nominated in January for the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about his nomination is scheduled for Tuesday     However Boggs nomination is coming under fire over some of the bills he sponsored and voted for while serving in the Georgia General Assembly mainly because his votes reflect more socially conservative views on abortion and gay rights despite the fact he served as a Democrat Among the bills he cosponsored was one in 2003 to establish a Choose Life adoption support program to encourage women to consider adoption over abortion The bill would have established a Choose Life license plate to fund the program Another bill Boggs cosponsored that year would have tightened restrictions on minors seeking abortions These bills drew the ire of NARAL ProChoice America which in a petition on its website calls Boggs dangerous for women and urges supporters to tell their senators to oppose his nomination Were disappointed that prochoice President Obama nominated someone who doesnt share our prochoice values it reads We agree with the president on a lot of things but not this pick However Kelsey Hazzard the head of Secular ProLife criticized NARAL ProChoice Americass efforts in an article for prolife website Life News saying it is clear the prochoice movement is attempting to maintain its grip on the Democratic party NARAL is willing to spend a good deal of money to send a message to Obama maintain your partys proabortion ideological purity or suffer the consequences she said Hazzard also criticized the head of the group Ilyse Hogue for accusing Boggs of being antiAmerican because his voting record What makes this really rich is that Hogue then goes on to define what it means to live your life as an American when she declares wrongly that America is a prochoice nation she said Boggs initially did not disclose his voting history on these matters to the Senate Judiciary Committee but provided the additional information in a letter last month to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy DVt and Ranking Member Chuck Grassley RIowa He also apologized for not including it earlier A spokeswoman for the committee told FoxNewscom Boggs sent the materials because committee staff requested more information about his background She said requests of this nature are relatively common for judicial nominees Boggs is also coming under fire from civil rights and LGBT groups over his voting record while in the Assembly In 2001 Boggs voted against a bill that established a new state flag for Georgia that removed the Confederate flag that had previously dominated it and in 2004 he voted for a bill to prohibit samesex marriage Boggs opposition to the flag bill has been slammed by Reps John Lewis and David Scott both Democrats from Georgia who have criticized Obama over the nomination Let me be frank here Im proud of this first black president I love this first black president But when you are hurt by the one you love theres no greater pain than that Scott told a radio station in February The president of the United States needed to have stood up to these white Republican senators and said I cant put a man on the court that wanted to keep the flag of slavery and oppression and racism  the most visible of hatred of black people on my court Scott was referring to the fact that the White House has stated in numerous media reports the selection of Boggs was part of a broader deal the administration cut with Georgia Republicans to get the judiciary positions filled However one state lawmaker in Georgia who served in the Assembly with Boggs told the Atlanta JournalConstitution he disagreed with trashing Boggs or any other nominee in the White House deal Democratic Rep Tyrone Brooks said he told Boggs that himself The flag bill was not a defining

California state university accused of forcibly grabbing an antiabortion activists poster and assaulting the 16yearold girl has pleaded no contest to three misdemeanor charges University of California at Santa Barbara Associate Professor Mireille MillerYoung was charged with one count each of grand theft vandalism and battery in connection to the March 4 incident involving 16yearold Thrin Short her older sister Joan and other prolife activists who were holding signs in a free speech zone on the campus when the professor went berserk     MillerYoung who remains employed by the university and her attorney Catherine Swysen did not respond to requests for comment The charges reportedly carry the possibility of jail time but sources close to the matter say MillerYoung is likely to be ordered to pay a fine perform community and undergo counseling when shes sentenced on Aug 14 According to a police report on the March 4 incident MillerYoung told police that she was pregnant and was triggered by the protesters signs and the graphic images depicted on them  Katie Short We hope that the sentence as a whole will unambiguously undo the good example she believes she set for her students both in her own mind and theirs Katie Short the girls mother and legal director of Life Legal Defense Foundation wrote FoxNewscom in an email Thrin and Joan Short said they had distributed nearly 1000 informational pamphlets during the event which was organized by the Riversidebased nonprofit Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust Things took an unexpected turn when according to Short MillerYoung approached the demonstrators and a group of students who had gathered Before she grabbed the sign she was mocking me and talking over me in front of the students saying that she was twice as old as me and had three degrees so they should listen to her and not me Thrin Short told FoxNewscom in March Then she started the chant with the students about tear down the sign When that died out she grabbed the sign With a graphic antiabortion sign in hand MillerYoung  whose faculty web page says she specializes in black cultural studies and pornography  then allegedly walked through two campus buildings as Short her sister and two UCSB students followed Short captured much of the confrontation on a cellphone video later posted to YouTube while her sister called campus police MillerYoung then allegedly pushed Short at least three times as she tried to stop an elevator door from closing as the educator stood inside with her sign Short said MillerYoung later claimed she had a moral right to act in the manner she did according to a report filed by campus police Thrins father William Short said he would have expected an academic to engage in thoughtful debate with someone she disagreed with She was free to engage in a rational dialogue with them he told FoxNewscom in March Instead she chose to bully them steal and destroy their property and hit and scratch my daughter After doing so she said she thought she was setting a good example for her students I think the goal of this prosecution should be to set a good example for her students one that will not only deter her from repeating this conduct but will also deter those who approve of her actions from imitating her appalling behavior William Short continued UCSB spokesman George Foulsham said the university does not discuss personal matters Professor MillerYoung is not currently teaching any courses and is not scheduled to teach any courses during the fall quarter Foulsham wrote in a statement to FoxNewscom on Friday Thrin Short meanwhile said shes disappointed there will not be a trial in the case There are still people who think that we were deliberately trying to upset people and that in a way we deserved what happened she wrote FoxNewscom For that reason I am disappointed that there will be no trial where we can show that we tried to calm her down and reason with her and the students but she didnt want us having any discussions with the students,2014-07-25T10:22-04:00,abortion

If you can divine a national trend from a runoff election in Mississippi be our guest But rather than pondering the motives of 3188 Mississippi voters who made the difference in a bitter hyperlocal election theres a more useful consideration today Whats at stake nationally this year is control of the US Senate and Republican chances of taking the majority went up significantly Tuesday night During New York Democratic Rep Charlie Rangels victory speech the stage nearly collapsed Rangel asked heavier people on the stage to take safety over ego and step down From Natchez to Norwood to Naples  Not only will Democrats be denied the opportunity to rummage through Mississippi state Sen Chris McDaniels past and present statements in a bid to make him the Rep Todd Akin of 2014 but Colorado Republicans lined up behind a very electable ticket Colorado Democrats had hoped to ruin the chances of Rep Cory Gardner the GOP Senate challenger who is threatening incumbent Sen Mark Udall by associating Gardner with former Rep Tom Tancredo Democrats spent money to bolster the gubernatorial bid of Tancredo an immigration hardliner whose policies and rhetoric would have posed constant challenges to Gardner as Democrats tarred them with the same brush Instead Colorado Republicans picked the more temperate former Rep Bob Beauprez to take on Gov John Hickenlooper A flawed gubernatorial candidate hurt GOP Senate chances in Colorado in 2010 but this time the red team will have a clear lane to challenge a very vulnerable incumbent Down in Florida a Republican deemed too radical handily won a special House election to replace a scandalsoaked member booted after a drug bust Democrats hardly tried to stop the rise of Repelect Curt Clawson Meanwhile other potentially damaging primary contests in other states all flopped the right way for the GOP to have the advantage in November Lessons schmessons  Whatever it is that happened in Mississippi is important no doubt Political professionals will debate for years to come the strategies and tactics in the race But we already knew the larger lesson from Mississippi three weeks ago The voting public is deeply frustrated with the Washington power structure And if there was any question about that outgoing House Majority Leader Eric Cantors shocking stumble removed all doubt But ultimately what matters in 2014 is control of the Senate As the new Fox News polls show the overall climate could hardly be worse for Democrats The president continues to find new lows and the ongoing international crises are taking a deepening toll Add to that todays news about the skidding economy  the nations economic output was worse in the first three months of the year than any time since the immediate aftermath of the Panic of 2008  and the picture becomes clear Democrats will have their hands full preventing another shellacking like the one they took in 2010 let alone holding their Senate majority MCDANIEL MAY CONTEST RESULTS

border Civilians are fleeing in panic because these ISIS savages are known to slaughter innocent people     Meantime Turkish tanks and troops do nothing sitting on their side of the border watching the carnage unfold Turkey is a Muslim country and all throughout the world there are about 16 billion Muslims and 35 countries practice some kind of Sharia Law That means they are governed by people who abide by principles of Islam that are controversial to say the least In some places you can even be stoned to death for committing a sin A study published by the Pew Research Center last year asked Muslims if they favor Sharia Law In Afghanistan 99 percent do Pakistan 84 percent Iraq 91 percent Egypt 74 percent Jordan 71 percent And even in Great Britain a national opinion poll found that 78 percent of British Muslims believe people who criticize Mohammed should be prosecuted by civil authorities So you can see that millions of Muslims think their religion should dictate what happens in society Enter uber liberals Bill Maher and Ben Affleck Mr Maher is antireligionist He despises all organized religion makes no secret of that Mr Affleck is a traditional liberal a fervent supporter of President Obama and of many left wing causes Over the weekend Mr Maher an author named Sam Harris and Mr Affleck debated Islam BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  MAHER All Im saying is that liberal principles like freedom of speech freedom to practice any religion you want without fear of violence freedom to leave a religion equality for women equality for minorities including homosexuals  these are liberal principles that liberals applaud for but then when you say in the Muslim world this is what is lacking then they get upset SAM HARRIS AUTHOR Yes yes well liberals have really failed on the topic of theocracy Theyll criticize white theocracy theyll criticize Christians Theyll still get agitated over the abortion clinic bombing that happened in 1984 but when you want to talk about the treatment of women and homosexuals and free thinkers and public intellectuals in the Muslim world I would argue that liberals have failed us AFFLECK So hold on are you the person who understands the officially codified doctrine of Islam You are the interpreter of that HARRIS Im actually welleducated on this topic AFFLECK Im asking you You are saying if I criticize that youre saying that Islamaphobia is not a real thing That if youre critical of something  MAHER Well its not a real thing when we do it AFFLECK Right MAHER Well no it really is HARRIS Im not denying that certain people are bigoted against Muslims as people And thats a problem MAHER Right big of you have HARRIS But the  MAHER But why are you hostile about this concept AFFLECK Thats gross Its racist MAHERS Its not but its so not Your shifty Jew AFFLECK Absolutely not MAHER Youre not listening what we are saying HARRIS We have to be able to criticize bad ideas MAHER Of course we do AFFLECK Ok ok but  MAHER But why  HARRIS But Islam is the mother load of bad ideas AFFLECK So we have ideas like blasphemy END VIDEO CLIP  OREILLY Interesting how Mr Affleck invokes the name of Jesus Now who is correct As far as condemning all Muslims Mr Affleck is on the side of the angels pardon the pun As Talking Points stated last week most Muslims are peaceful people Even if they do believe in Sharia Law thats a flaw in their thinking it doesnt mean they are violent maniacs Also like the bible there are violent passages in the Koran it doesnt mean much Interpretation of scripture is what separates a fair person from a hateful fanatic However Mr Maher is correct on the overall effect Islam is having on the world right now The truth is many Muslim nations have not confronted Islamic terrorism have not attacked violence in the name of Allah and have not even condemned the jihad There is exception to the rule but they are few Therefore militant Islam continues to drive worldwide terrorism and have plenty of sanctuaries from which to commit their evil Ben Affleck should well understand that he himself would be beheaded in a heartbeat by these ISIS animals and that even though they are the most extreme element of the jihad they are not that far away from their fanatical cousins You may remember that hours after America was attacked by al Qaeda on 911 thousands of Muslims regular folks celebrated in the streets They were happy that more than 3000 innocent people including Muslims were murdered Again these people are a minority but they were not called out in any official way by Muslim nations around the world The truth is that Islamic jihad could not could not exist if not for Muslim nations turning away Turkey could crush ISIS right this minute but Turkey does nothing The Afghan people could turn against the Taliban they do not The Pakistani government harbored Osama bin Laden  the government did Those facts are something that Ben Affleck and others who agree with him should think about In any discussion about the overall effect Islam is having on the world Talking Points well understands that for centuries Muslims coexisted peacefully with other religions But now terrorism and the jihadists are again on the move And most Muslim nations are not joining with the West to confront that therefore criticism of Islams role on the world stage is certainly valid The Muslim world needs to take a hard look at itself And thats The Memo OReilly Factor hosted by Bill OReilly airs on Weekdays at 8PM ET on Fox News Channel,2014-10-06T00:00-04:00,abortion

 Would the juror driving the silver Mazda please see the bailiff     OBAMA TRIES TO BUY A THRILL
The hard and bitter sentiment against President Obamas policies foreign and domestic is plenty to drive Republican voter enthusiasm But how can you get Democrats to the polls at a time when the partys base is deeply disillusioned over a 30year war and the Senate looks like a lost cause Cash US News explores a 60 million Democratic grassroots voter turnout initiative but the real sums being spent are likely more than quadruple that once we factor in deeppocketed party patrons and labor unions But however big the push can you recreate the Obama magic recipe for victory without the key ingredient an enthusiastic voter base Having been forced to not only expand the war in Iraq and Syria but also abandon some plans for enthusing Democrats and trolling conservatives the president cant do much to get the band back together So the only thing left to do is go see the millionaires and billionaires in hopes that they will underwrite a massive getoutthe vote effort to close the gap in key states

The stakes are high for Democrats come November as they need to limit Republican gains in the Senate to five or fewer in order to retain control of the upper chamber If the GOP can flip six seats from blue to red this year the dynamics in Washington will change in a big way Fox News First wants to know which six Democraticheld seats are most vulnerable The current consensus among readers Arkansas 137 Montana 131 West Virginia 123 Louisiana 117 South Dakota 119 and Alaska 87

Reader Donna Stickling included Iowa in her six noting It seems rather strange that Rep Bruce Braley DIowa closed the gap from 6 points to just 2 in a weeks time I truly question those recent poll numbers But heres the thing about polls Theyre all different and are certainly not of equal value Online polls sketchy sometimes partisan polls that dont reveal their methodology and polls that have shady histories abound But even good polls can disagree and still be accurate more on that another time The thing to watch is the trend in legitimate polls And in Iowa the trend is the GOPs friend So what do you hear beyond the noise of schlocky polls

run for reelection would he be more attuned to whats going on at the border GUTFELD I think so and I think I said this before Thats why the polls dont remember If it were a conservative Republican he should act that way If you are  if you know that you have any consequences you should do everything you can to fulfill your ideology I dont think he was bad last night I think thats  when I watch him speak I say the Republicans should have that should have a guy who has that kind of confidence I dont like him using the word really because thats a banned phrase But the fact is he  FOX News has said this whole idea of this impeachment movement is ridiculous So hes just echoing what we have been saying And he says it with a sense of humor and hes having fun True This is a miserable time for this country Its terrible But hes won two elections He doesnt care Hes changing society To him watching the border break down is a political triumph because his mission is to create comprehensive reform So this isnt bothering him This is what hope and change is all about Its just the Republicans need to find somebody who can do that GUILFOYLE So what I learned from this youve been looking for a guy like this GUTFELD Ive been saying  Ive been saying the right needs to find their Obama somebody who can handle this kind of stuff BOLLING Part of the problem with that theory why President Obama is acting like this because he can is the fact Bob that were probably the seventh crisis in in the last five and a half years BECKEL But you know theres a method to his madness First of all he  in every one of these things he said  he said Im doing my job the Republicans are not And thats his message And frankly it happens to be true On immigration he can say the House can bring it up they dont like whats in the Senate but they could bring it up debate it amend and go to conference But they wont do that When Boehner says hes going to sue him I mean come on Are they going to impeach him I mean that guy from Texas is about the only guy signed on to that I think theres a little bit more here than just you know taking it too easy TANTAROS But hes not doing his job And either he doesnt understand or he doesnt care about constitution which is weird as a constitutional attorney Bob it would take one quick fix in the law thats currently on the books to handle this situation at the border at least the court and deportation issue Theres no effort by this administration to do any of that GUTFELD You know what he needs In every movie the main character has a best friend that comes over and tells him all the things he needs hear to get the girl back He has less friends than friends than E coli	He doesnt have anybody in his circle that says Dude time for an intervention youre scaring the crap out of the country youve got to stop playing pool He doesnt have that Its time for an intervention But the groupies in the media they wont help him GUILFOYLE Maybe Valerie Jarrett can CROSSTALK BOLLING We so happen to have a couple of people who maybe he should start listening to Heres Mark Halperin first Listen BEGIN VIDEO CLIP MARK HALPERIN TIME How does that speech how does that tone how does the confrontation given all the history  totally accept how does that solve this How does that deal what kind of country are we that the president cant figure out a way to lead to get the situation with the kids solved END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING It gets worse Roll the Carville SOT now BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JAMES CARVILLE DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST I think its a mistake	Probably I think its a significant mistake I think the public expects a president to show up at these kind of moments and frankly I agree with the Democratic consultants that came before I mean people are frustrated Why didnt he go He should have gone END VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE Right BOLLING So they are jumping off the bandwagon Bobby BECKEL Well you know I talk to  BOLLING Are you by the way BECKEL No But I talked to a guy who is intimately involved in their campaign both of them And I said to him can you guys give me anything to work with Anything It would be nice And he said about Gregs point about the close people around him he said you have to know what its like to get through Valerie Jarrett and Michele Obama and I think thats a tough deal for anybody on a staff to do This guy is not on the staff but he made it pretty clear to me the Stepford comment is maybe something to that because he lives in a zone that nobody else goes to TANTAROS Stepford staff they just sit around and go aha aha GUTFELD Or he does what they tell him TANTAROS No one has the guts to say knock it off GUILFOYLE I dont think he wants to hear it either I dont know that hes very open  BECKEL Oh youre right about that GUILFOYLE Yes He doesnt want to hear it He doesnt want to be criticized because this is an individual who has  you know grown in a way where life has been very kind to him Hes been popular his whole life Hes gone to the best schools Hes been you  know he has all the people fawning over him lifting him up in the chair and say you want to be president of the United States BECKEL He lost his father and mother I mean come on GUTFELD And his dog GUILFOYLE Weve all had bad things happened But Im telling you hes in the White House He won election twice Things are actually going pretty well for him BOLLING You know when this changes though for the American people is when he goes and says I need 37 billion Not only do I need 37 its an emergency And guess what Heres how I want to spend it I want to spend it on things like health care for these people processing for these kids sending these kids back talking to the countries that are going to take these kids instead of closing the border Then it affects every American	He cant be so aloof and were going to pony up 37 billion TANTAROS But if the media is not going to call you on it and youre confident that the people who that write the history books are going to give you a pretty good review then Gregs right I mean in his own mind he thinks he is the best president And if you look at what he wants multiculturalism open borders then he is the most successful president in the history of time And you think hes the worst by most definition	But hes getting exactly what he wants GUTFELD The media is you know is actually the main culprit here because you see those guys complaining about Obama because they already voted for him twice Now they can be honest CNN called our border this morning the final burden for undocumented aliens So our border is actually their burden And they are documenting their perilous journey through  they dont look at the struggle of citizens in towns immigrants end up in What we do is theyre falling the people here So we know the side that the media is taking through this and its the same side that our president is on So they might complain but its phony CROSSTALK GUTFELD Of course not Are you kidding me They would be fired BECKEL Its going to go through because its been appropriated in the House and tacked on to the homeland security bill Do you think anybody is going to vote against that BOLLING Well I  maybe I mean I dont know Here in lies the problem he says I need it and its going to say any Republican doesnt vote for  BECKEL I think it was a very smart move putting on that bill BOLLING Hold on KG  GUILFOYLE Yes BOLLING 37 billion we did the math yesterday at 74000 per kid But look at it this way its 68000 teachers that we could be spending that money on instead of that GUILFOYLE Yes and theres a lot of families who are really struggling in this country and children that are hungry and starving Just even the increase in shelters here in New York City that people cant even provide meals for their children Thats why you see some other protest that people are so disgusted and dishearten by oh how arrogant how cold and callous Look at these poor children I do feel bad for these children who wouldnt But why are their parents put them in harms way and sending them across the border like this with drug dealers and coyotes I mean thats hardly a safe environment	And we shouldnt encourage We should do something to help protect the children by securing the border so these predators cant take advantage of it GUTFELD But I have  there is one shelter that I think is useful it has 132 rooms and 35 bathrooms Its called the White House You can probably put eight bunk beds in a room you can get 1000 people in there You know what this is Its also mutation of language We know what a refugee is A refugee is somebody that is fleeing persecution Not all of the  calling all these people refugees is a lie They are not fleeing persecution they are fleeing a crappie country I mean do people leaving Chicago are they refugees If you leave Detroit are they refugees The big point is if you believe that these are refugees what do you do about it You go to those countries and you fix those countries but nobody likes American exceptionalism They dont want us to go there BECKEL Greg heres the point The real culprit here is Mexico because Mexico allows them to transfer through their country  TANTAROS Thats right BECKEL  from Central America and goes up and they turn over these drug lords control that basically control that border and thats whats happening Mexico should be called into account TANTAROS Why do we funnel millions of dollars one to this country but also to the Central American countries which is part of this supplemental Eric and I were joking that we should move to San Salvador open up a PR firm because a lot of these PR firms are going to get these tax dollars What did you say BOLLING What were calling  coyote PR TANTAROS Coyote PR We could have tequila happy hours I mean really do you really think youd be able to buy a PR campaign These countries know that if they send people there theyre going to be staying	Actions speak louder than words You have to  BOLLING Hold on  BECKEL Heres the action US aid stops GUTFELD Yes BOLLING Well OK how about this Just meet with the president of Honduras Guatemala Just meet with them Just sit down and say  CROSSTALK BECKEL And the president of Mexico too GUTFELD I mean why not encourage a Central American spring you know BOLLING Interesting GUTFELD You know why not Because they love our country so much  GUILFOYLE You just started revolution GUTFELD Why dont we export our country there Because again thats American imperialism and everybody hates that TANTAROS We brought them to Lower Manhattan and did like an Occupy Wall Street Dont you think a lot of the Obama donors in New York have a problem with that GUTFELD Would love that BECKEL Good news there was no spring this year So  GUTFELD Yes its true BOLLING Got to leave it right there Stay tuned because were just getting started Greg is going to tell you about a new war in America next And later my fool of the week Back in a moment COMMERCIAL BREAK GUTFELD Theres a new war in America the humane versus the inhumane The humane are those who see borders as obstacles who believe the homeless should get free pot who think gender pronouns are evil who see business as oppression The inhumane are the rest of us who want to deport babies bully the indigent let the sick die because we hate Obamacare We are racist probably homophobic But underneath it all were just inhuman Led by a White House that sees all through the prism of politics our border is now the ball and a game between the humane and the inhumane	Hmm I feel a montage BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS SEN DICK DURBIN D ILLINOIS We have to acknowledge this as the humanitarian challenge it is and make sure the United States will receive these children in a humane way JOSH EARNEST WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY The president has asked for additional resources from Congress to open up detention facilities across the country where these individuals can be housed in humane conditions SEN PATTY MURRAY D WASHINGTON Im also focusing myself on giving the administration on the resources they need to protect these children and to treat them humanely UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE We stand ready to support efforts to treat little children in a humane way END VIDEO CLIPS GUTFELD Im so inhumane Remember when the right left and center shared one thing  a border it created identity It made us Americans especially to those beyond our fences Remove that and what are we The debate over citizenship is the debate over survival And anyone fleeing from persecution knows this Humane masks policies often that are anything but In Berkeley its free pot for the homeless You think that makes them less homeless You think pot improves their lot Id say not But look at the border The humane has gone insane Buildings full of blank faces some pawns others cons on a quest of separation and sadness And those who see this horror and want answers are inhumane Hardly weve just seen history and they are full of those who are namely in humane leave them weeping in their wake So isnt it more humane to use these children as pawns Kimberly I mean  GUILFOYLE You know its just  I dont know So much politics is coming in this right But when you see criticism thats really fairly accurate and reasonable coming from both sides you know you have a serious problem on your hands I would like nothing better than the president to rise to the occasion and do something about this something lasting instead of always looking back to say this is why Im having problems now because of the guy before me Thats not leadership Take ownership much it You were elected twice The liberals always say they want to control every aspect of your life from birth to death and tell you exactly how to do it because they know best Well if you do President Obama tell us how we can solve this problem and do something about it GUTFELD Bob you know there are a lot of people that are worried so when they are on camera they are angry and cameras are in their faces and they look angry Are they inhumane for being concerned about gangs or illness BECKEL You know heres the problem with this whole discussion is that I dont believe that Republicans are inhumane I think a lot of them are very humane And I dont believe all Democrats are as you described them are liberals But I recognize that you paint a broad brush But the fact is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants in this country There are 60000 kids down there It is much bigger problem	And I think if Democrats Republicans can get together they can get a bill simply sit down and talk to each other But politics has played a role Obama has politicized and the Republicans have politicized But were not all inhumane or humane I think everybody  I think you guys are humane people I dont think you want to see  I certainly dont want to say that I want to see a socialist country I dont But I certainly do believe these kids should not be sent back and I think they are a small percentage of the bigger problem GUTFELD Isnt part of the problem Eric that everything is a team sport now Everybody picks a side We used to  its OK to do that but when its your border you kind of go thats off limits I dont know BOLLING So you ran a bunch of sound bites of Democrats  only Democrats using the word humane because they are trying to garner sympathy for the cause GUTFELD Yes BOLLING I mean very specific and concise about this How humane is abortion You dont hear a Democrat say apply the word humanity humane to the abortion cause because if they did it would blow their theory out of the water CROSSTALK BECKEL I dont think it was all would send a message Some of those people really believe its a humanitarian problem GUTFELD I think so too BOLLING But is a humanitarian problem But it happens not to be our humanitarian problem BECKEL Well it is now because they are here BOLLING It shouldnt be GUTFELD And also there are different ways to hand all humanitarian problem other than saying that those who disagree with you arent humane I mean to me in my mind the most humane thing in the world in the history of the world has been the United States Weve done more to help the world than anybody Why cant we export our values to places where there are problems rather than the problems forcing people to come here TANTAROS Yes And the reason that they use the term humane is exactly what you said because then it has the benefit of implying that anyone who doesnt agree with them is inhumane which Bob you even agree the Republicans that dont support this bill no matter where the funding is going are inhumane I think Juan earlier in the week said why are you attacking kids By the way you are very humane today Im all in favor of you having dates in the afternoon before the show LAUGHTER TANTAROS For the record BECKEL It was very helpful GUTFELD Very relax CROSSTALK TANTAROS Very humane BECKEL No I think we got be careful about painting these broad strokes Just like Greg do it thats what he does GUTFELD Oh BECKEL No but you do Look you do it well And its funny what you do GUTFELD But you do that to the right TANTAROS Dont you think its inhumane to keep these kids away from their parents to keep these children and these young girls at risk of being raped Do you think these conditions are humane at all or do you think its humane to let veterans die The four Americans who died in Benghazi is that humane CROSSTALK BECKEL No Look I dont believe any of this is humane and the VA or anything else Parents sent these children up here and the Mexicans allowed them to come through TANTAROS But these conditions are anything but humane BECKEL I understand that GUILFOYLE And you got gang members now we talked about MS13 coming in and recruiting Now weve provided them with open recruitment BECKEL Thats why you need money to be able to take care of this GUILFOYLE I know but its  yes OK Its always money is the answer for liberals Oh the Republicans theyre inhumane They got	INAUDIBLE arms But thats not the situation here BECKEL If youre not going  youre not to get them all out at one time and they cant live in conditions like this so you need funding GUILFOYLE Its awful for these children awful BECKEL Huh GUILFOYLE It is awful for the children GUTFELD But Kimberly you mentioned these gangs and I think its inhumane to call them a gang I think its cruel Maybe call them a troop or a cooperative or a merry band of men seeking adventure TANTAROS With great tattoos GUTFELD Yes their  dont call that  or ink BECKEL They are Boy Scouts troop GUTFELD Theyre Boy Scouts troop exactly CROSSTALK GUILFOYLE Im so sorry Its from my LA prosecutor days It hardens me Its hardened me Dont ban me GUTFELD All right Nancy  I would never ban you All right Nancy Pelosi thinks five men on the Supreme Court shouldnt make decisions about womens birth control Megyn Kelly isnt buying it Youll hear why when we come back COMMERCIAL BREAK GUILFOYLE All right Nancy Pelosi getting a little hysterical over the Hobby Lobby decision and shes playing the gender card She thinks that quote five men have no business ruling on birth control BEGIN VIDEO CLIP REP NANCY PELOSI D CALIFORNIA We should be afraid of this court that five guys should start determining what contraceptions are legal or not That court decision was a frightening one that five men should get down to the specifics of whether a woman should use a diaphragm and should she pay for it herself or her boss Its not her bosss business END VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE Megyn Kelly isnt buying it BEGIN VIDEO CLIP MEGYN KELLY FOX NEWS HOST Nancy Pelosi either doesnt know what shes talking about or intentionally misleading you First of all the gender of the justices in the Hobby Lobby majority is totally irrelevant	Ms Pelosis reference to it is obviously an attempt to stoke resentment	When Roe versus Wade was decided it was all men in the majority Does Ms	Pelosi those justices were illequipped to fairly decide that case Or is it only when a judge disagrees with Ms Pelosi that his gender is an issue If Speaker John Boehner made a similar comment about female Supreme Court justices Nancy Pelosi would be crying sexism and thats what she is guilty of here END VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE Take it to Pelosi MKstyle All right What do you think What do you make as a man to  BOLLING Im probably the worst person to go to there because I agree with Megyn for the reasons she just pointed out because its not just Pelosi though Its liberals They do the same exact thing If they get a Supreme Court ruling they dont like the Supreme Court is biased theres 54 Were screwed We cant wait until theres another Democrat on the Supreme Court Democrat appointed or whatever posted to the Supreme Court BECKEL Are you kidding me BOLLING But when they go in your favor like Obamacare and things like that oh they are the best things  BECKEL You were whining so much about that Obamacare the 54 decision BOLLING And you whined about the Hobby Lobby decision BECKEL I was just about to say BOLLING Your victory is about the Obamacare and then you cry CROSSTALK BECKEL I was about to say  I was going agree with you When you get beat in the Supreme Court you dont like it and use whatever ammo you got GUILFOYLE He didnt make a gender argument about it All right Andrea look definitely a bold move on Megyn Kelly taking on Nancy Pelosi in a very pointed way How do you see it TANTAROS Well the next segment were going to do on the show is how women can get away with things men cant Women can get away with what Nancy Pelosi got away which is blaming men on the court or something You know this week weve seen part of the Democratic Party either play the Catholics on the Supreme Court  GUILFOYLE Right TANTAROS  or blame the men on the Supreme Court So Im sure they said OK youre a Democratic female your hit that woman talking point GUILFOYLE Right TANTAROS And if you would put any other word in that blank Kimberly right Jewish right Any other word Single woman and imply that somehow single woman on the Supreme Court are making these decisions their heads would blow off on the other side GUILFOYLE There would be an explosion TANTAROS Yes Its sexist what shes doing and its really cheap too I have this last question You know the Griswold birth control case was decided on the Supreme Court that was mostly men Does Pelosi have a problem with that GUILFOYLE Well thats the problem Shes very selective to try to make an argument to attack The bottom line is if you equip yourself with the law and the constitution then you know that it was a ruling on sound legal principle Is what the Supreme Court is supposed to do They are not a partisan arm of either party BECKEL If you look at brown versus board of education which I think was the most important decision in the civil rights movement all white males and they voted unanimously So I think you go to be a little careful You can whine like I do when we do something But Im not the minority leader of the House of Representative that you got to be careful with your words You also have to know your history And if you dont understand history  GUILFOYLE Is this your advice to her BECKEL Yes BOLLING Why are you being so logical and forward today GUILFOYLE I dont know BECKEL I had a rough day yesterday TANTAROS Who is this woman you went out with this afternoon GUILFOYLE I got a call from Pelosis office and she wants you to ban five men and five napkin burger GREG GUTFELD COHOST By the way Pelosi is right Men made that court ruling They also invented electricity The polio vaccine and get this they invented the birth control pill What a bunch of sexist jerks	I would say Pelosi should think before she speaks but then she would never speak We dont have sexist but shes sexist towards not just men but women but think women are incapable of existing without a government sugar daddy They cant figure out how to buy their own pills To her women are helpless and the government is white knight Im sorry racist the knight in shining armor that comes in to save the day Thats to me is more sexist BECKEL My exwife believes electricity was done by a woman GUTFELD Wasnt it Thomas Edison BECKEL It was I think GUTFELD Ben Franklin the key and the light bulb It really was Nicholas Tesla who got his stuff stolen from Thomas Edison We know thats right Russians GUILFOYLE Oh my goodness BECKEL Thats right GUILFOYLE Thats another episode of The Five goes haywire All right ahead can women get away with some things that men cant Stick around because well debate that lightning rod topic next on The Five COMMERCIAL BREAK TANTAROS Fasten your seat belts for this one Were now going to debate things in life that women can get away with that men cant The daily caller put together a list Here are some interesting ones	Women can go gaga over cute animals Order overly complicated drinks like one with fat free milk but with extra whip cream on top People watch without looking like a total creep And this one probably isnt up for much debate but women can easily get out of speeding tickets Thats one is probably is true BECKEL Thats true TANTAROS OK Kimberly I added some to this list GUILFOYLE OK TANTAROS Line jump You can cut a line GUILFOYLE Done that TANTAROS Yes GUILFOYLE Men usually cant get away when we do that TANTAROS Shriek when we see a bug because when a guy does that he is kind a wuzz And  GUILFOYLE I thought I took on a flying cockroach last night TANTAROS Stress about our hair and get away along with it Sorry Bolling GUILFOYLE Bolling is actually feminism on that one BOLLING Theres a more than that than it looks GUILFOYLE Whatever you dont call Bolling when hes in the hair chair No no I got to talk later Im doing the hair man BECKEL You see Eric can get away with it when hes in the hair chair But you guys dont  you can get away with it GUILFOYLE Were girls BECKEL Thats my point I got this all figured out frankly GUILFOYLE OK BECKEL Women first of all they never forget anything If you have an argument with a woman six months later you think its resolved She goes remember that thing we talked about I thought it was a left field	The other thing you know why they get out of speeding tickets GUILFOYLE Be careful BOLLING Be very careful GUILFOYLE Daisy duke BECKEL OK They smile GUILFOYLE What were you going say BOLLING Doing the new Bob that actually matters This is awesome by the way GUILFOYLE How do they get out of them BECKEL I think they flirt with the cops and the cops are men GUILFOYLE You are so well behaved today Did you have a date this afternoon or lobotomy Who stole the old Bob BECKEL The lobotomy happened a long time ago TANTAROS OK Eric what do you think about the list BOLLING Heres what I think you may left one off on the list When youre on the beach my wife will see a good looking guy and say good Lord look at that But if I see an attractive woman not only can I not comment on it I have to pretend Im looking the other way If I glance in the general direction I get smacked The whole thing BECKEL You know Im glad Im seeing you firing yourself on this one youre right GUILFOYLE Shes very open with you Thats why TANTAROS Greg some Italian man told me you can do anything you want as long as you look good doing it Is that your life motto GUTFELD Yes it is But you know theres one perk women cant get away with and thats giving birth So  because they give birth they can have all the perks they want If you had a choice no perks at all and you dont give birth or giving birth and having the perks Ill take the no perks any day Its a mistake that feminists make Chivalry exists not because men believe women are the weaker sex chivalry exists because we believe women have the stronger burdens they have the tougher job The reason why men die younger is because were busy preserving the more important sex BECKEL I dont think men get enough credit for the birthing process GUTFELD What BECKEL I dont think men get enough credit for the birthing process GUILFOYLE Here we go You know Bob  TANTAROS Heres something that I thought of CROSSTALK TANTAROS Kimberly women can get away but men cant slap women	When hes being bad you slap him  GUILFOYLE I know some men really like that so no ones brought a penalty flag on that BECKEL Shes a wonderful person She catches you on The Five	ranch at 200 in the morning almost got my head Ive been dead It went in the wallfire and get away My wife cant do The Five arm GUILFOYLE Shes a great golfer right BECKEL Yes she was She was a nice person TANTAROS Are you upset about the double standard Eric BOLLING I never really thought of it but that one birthing experience makes up for a lot of opening doors GUTFELD It clears the slate The reasons from a biological standpoint they are more valuable than the male Thats why you can populate a city with one man BOLLING We have to shave our face right That is a burden BECKEL They keep moving our crap around If you just could let it sit where it is and not move it all the time GUILFOYLE Bob thats another relationship segment BECKEL It

antiAmerican and you deserve to apologize to veterans After hearing from you folks CBS did just that UNIDENTIFIED MALE voiceover We want to apologize to veterans particularly those who served in Vietnam END VIDEOTAPE BOLLING Well done BECKEL Ill say this Its amazing to me how many people in The Five audience responded to that I had a chance to talk to the head of the American legion and he was working  a lot of people worked it was just not in the United States but The Five audience CBS got over half a million hits on that and got a lot of pressure put on them They said it	Its the power of once in a while you have some influence here and I think its great TANTAROS You were also really excited that someone else was apologizing other than you GUILFOYLE Right BECKEL Yes Thats something that happens to me Remember the apology tour I was going to go with that But the problem I said something there that was at that real problem GUILFOYLE People should know your heart is that right in

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/08/17/pope-francis-makes-silent-powerful-anti-abortion-statement-in-south-korea/,"SEOUL South Korea AP  Pope Francis has generally avoided hotbutton culture war issues like abortion arguing that the churchs doctrine on the sanctity of life is wellknown and that hed rather emphasize other aspects of church teaching But he made a strong albeit silent antiabortion statement Saturday during his visit to South Korea stopping to pray at a monument for aborted babies in a community dedicated to caring for people with the sort of severe genetic disabilities that are often used to justify abortions Francis bowed his head in prayer before the monument  a garden strewn with simple white wooden crosses  and spoke with an antiabortion activist with no arms and no legs He also spent an hour blessing dozens of disabled Koreans who live in the Kkottongnae community founded by a priest in the 1970s to take in disabled children and adults abandoned by their families There is still tremendous stigma and discrimination against people with disabilities in South Korea and supporters of the Kkottongnae community argue that if it didnt take these people in no one would Francis caressed and hugged each of the residents of the community young and old and seemed genuinely pleased when one of the elderly residents with cerebral palsy Kim Inja Cecilia presented him with an origami crane she folded with her feet South Korea banned abortion in 1953 with exceptions for rape incest or severe genetic disorders The constitutional court upheld the ban in 2012 Activists however say authorities turned a blind eye to abortions for decades until cracking down in recent years due to South Koreas low birthrate one of the lowest in the world During the 1970s and 1980s South Koreas government saw big families as an obstacle to economic growth and encouraged families to have no more than two children Francis referred to the culture of death afflicting South Korea during his homily on Friday But generally he has shied away from making headlinegrabbing antiabortion statements much to the dismay of conservative Catholics who had been emboldened by the frequent denunciations of abortion by two previous popes In a 2013 interview with a Jesuit journal Francis acknowledged that he had been reprimanded for not pressing the issue But he said it wasnt necessary to harp about abortion all the time The churchs pastoral ministry cannot be obsessed with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrines to be imposed insistently Francis said at the time We have to find a new balance otherwise even the moral edifice of the church is likely to fall like a house of cards losing the freshness and fragrance of the Gospel A day after the interview was published though Francis offered an olive branch of sorts to the more doctrineminded conservatives in the church denouncing abortions as a symptom of todays throwaway culture and encouraging Catholic doctors to refuse to perform them Follow us on twittercomfoxnewslatino

 Obamas embrace of theater on ISIS helps struggling Dems
 Baier Tracks Long week
 First in Fox News First NRCC ramps up with six new spots
 Joe Biden and a busload of nuns
 Of hogs and serenity     OBAMAS EMBRACE OF THEATER ON ISIS HELPS STRUGGLING DEMS
President Obama and Democrats hit the panic button two weeks ago as voters expressed deepening despair over Obamas foreign policy and the makings of a terrible tide in November were taking shape The president acknowledged having failed at the theater of presidential leadership and after a fashion turned to new more dramatic language about his incremental escalation of the effort to contain Islamist militants who keep beheading Westerners in their captivity While White House officials briefing reporters on Monday said they wouldnt be running on the ISIS war per se they expressed satisfaction that the presidents new more resolute persona had stabilized things with voters The briefers laid out the events of weeks to come designed to highlight the presidents new part As lawmakers gnaw on a proposal to provide more arms to rival rebel factions in Syria the president is getting ready to take his show on the road with stops in Atlanta to show engagement on the expanding threat of the Ebola virus and in Florida where he will visit military commanders

What will 100 grand buy you  President Obama was the guest of honor Monday night at a Democratic Senate fundraiser with the amazing price of 100000 per attendee at the posh Jefferson Hotel

On the home front  But while the president has altered his playbill to indicate attentiveness to national security issues he and his party also have been deploying new measures against Republicans as the midterm season heats up And it seems to be working Democrats are seeing returns on a strategy to use superior financial resources to attack Republicans for trying to buy elections As todays fundraising totals show wellheeled Democrats are dumping far more money into keeping the Senate than Republicans and their allies are putting into trying to win it Having spent so heavily in the early going to blunt the bucks of conservatives the president and his team are carefully turning toward rallying the Democratic base Obamas campaign schedule is taking shape and the president has cut his first ads of the general election season radio spots aimed at black voters and single women

Seven weeks  Hows it going Despite abysmal polls for the president and deep frustrations with Democratic polices the party seems to be staving off catastrophe Are Republicans counting Senate chickens before theyre hatched and not donating and mobilizing Will a late surge in spending by proGOP groups change the landscape There are just seven weeks to find out

New Normal Dem incumbents benefitting from national gloom  American Enterprise Institute data mavens Karlyn Bowman and Jennifer Marsico explain how voters can be so deeply dissatisfied with the direction of the country and its governance but still not storming to the polls to boot out incumbents As in the 2012 election a new normal of lowered expectations and resignation to a less bright future at home and abroad Their forecast is for GOP gains but tempered by a defeatist spirit about the future A lot can change between now and the November 4 elections But it seems to us that right now that passive dissatisfaction is the order of the day rather than an active energized one that brings many voters to the polls the pair wrote That may be why the polls in so many hot Senate contests this fall arent moving much

Say anything  The impeccably sourced David Drucker explains one reason why Democrats are doing better  theyre staying focused Outside liberal groups are running more effectiveadsin keySenate races by sticking to the script while conservative groups focus too much on their own agendas Republican strategists say While many conservative groups focus on their traditional messages leftleaningsuper PACsand nonprofits are working together and tailoring their ads to the themes Democrats are campaigning on allowing them to reinforce the candidates messages  and the partys overall arguments about the election When it comes to aligning their message and coordinating activities the left gets it better than anyone a seniorGOPstrategist confided to theWashington Examiner Labor groupswill run ads aboutcontraceptionif that will help them win Its not just how much you spend but how you spend it Our groups rarely get outside their comfort zone

BAIER TRACKS LONG WEEK 
Its only Tuesday and the bad foreign policy news seems to be piling up The ISIS coalition looks shaky at best President Obamas push to get the Defense Department to fight Ebola suggests a bigger threat than first appreciated Iran seems emboldened in the current environment China is increasingly willing to push back against US interests and North Korea is starting to act out again Needless to say the US does not need any more headaches abroad But Afghanistan is essentially falling apart both politically and militarily The June 14 Afghan election is still unresolved and now the Afghan military may start splitting up and choosing sides between the two rival candidates The infighting has allowed the Taliban to  as crazy as it sounds  take the political high ground A deteriorating Afghanistan as US troops start to leave there would join a deteriorating Iraq and an Islamist army trying to set up a caliphate And its only Tuesday  Bret Baier

INSURERS IGNORING OBAMACARE ABORTION RESTRICTIONS
Fox News An ObamaCare provision that requires individuals to pay separately for abortion coverage to ensure abortions are not funded by taxpayers is being widely ignored by insurance providers according to a government watchdog report released Monday The GAO has found ObamaCare massively funds abortion on demand Rep Chris Smith RNJ said MondayIn its report the GAO found that 23 states restrict how insurance plans offered in the ObamaCare exchanges may include abortion as a benefit and 28 do not The GAO then surveyed 18 insurance providers within the 28 states that do not restrict abortion coverage to determine how the coverage is being handled According to the GAO 17 of the 18 providers surveyed said they were not billing policyholders separately for the abortion coverage

 Dems veer into danger zone with abortion bill
 Bipartisan bill to speed deportations gains ground
 Conservative group targets Christies judgment on judges
 Braley does the chicken dance
 DC stands for doesnt count     DEMS VEER INTO DANGER ZONE WITH ABORTION BILL
Democrats today are kicking up their electionyear effort to shift the discussion to social issues in a bid to drive a wedge between female voters and the GOP Sen Richard Blumenthal DConn is leading a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing today on his bill that would override the laws banning lateterm abortions and imposing regulations on abortion clinics in an increasing number of states The bill which already has the support of nearly twothirds of Senate Democrats would eradicate the restrictions in at least a dozen states where abortions have been banned after the start of the sixth month of pregnancy and rules in many more states that regulate the conditions at abortion clinics The New York Times editorial board is enthused as are others on the left who have seen access to elective abortions restricted in the aftermath of the discovery of a house of horrors at the Philadelphia abortion clinic operated by Dr Kermit Gosnell But Blumenthals antiantiGosnell bill takes Democrats into some very dangerous political territory

Trickier topic  The Democrats gynecological approach worked twice before to save the Senate thanks in part to some selfdestructive Republican candidates  most notably former Rep Todd Akin who still is out there trying and failing to explain his unorthodox understanding of biology Having so recently been on these crusades Democrats still have the battle plan handy and are quick to race into the fray The fundraising emails were out on the Hobby Lobby case even before reporters had finished reading the opinion and the legislation from vulnerable Senate Democrats was out soon thereafter But fighting state abortion regulations is something very different than just punking Akin or thinking up some new birthcontrol hashtags Americans got comfortable talking about the pill a long time ago but still find it kind of fun and sexy Abortion though is still a raw subject and demands delicate discussion Its a topic around which errorprone politicians ought not tread The majority of Americans favor restrictions on abortion leaving the Democratic default position on the issue  unrestricted access to elective abortion  increasingly out of step Its great to say you think ladies ought to be able to get the pill a largely uncontroversial position for 40 years But how about sharing your view on when life begins Or whether unborn children feel pain Wheres your hashtag for those

Shetlands sheepdogs  So while todays Blumenthal hearing certainly is part of Democratic efforts to shift the election narrative and to frighten suburban women about Akinite boogeymen lurking in every doctors office its also evidence of the power of the left wing in the Democratic Party One would have to imagine this hearing is designed to placate the vocal wellfunded prochoice crusaders in the Democratic base and not designed to proceed even to a show vote After all the most influential prochoice political group doesnt even talk about the issue in its ads instead attacking Republicans on unrelated topics Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid a selfprofessed prolife Mormon knows the power of the issue in swing states like his own Surely he intends to squelch the subject and get back to regular programming as soon as the hearing wraps If he doesnt Democrats from red states will start having to answer whether they would support rolling back restrictions

Right back at you  Republican strategist Lauren Zelt suggests a different way for her party to counter Democratic gender warfare turn the beat around From her column in The Hill Whats our answer to the grammatically questionable notmybossbusiness It doesnt lie solely in carefully debunking the Democrats argument Its a tedious process and it doesnt make for a good hashtag sound bite or campaign ad A better strategy could be to point out the obvious In 2014 the Democratic Party is the party defining women solely by their reproductive organs When did it become socially acceptable again to define women that way When did we travel back to 1955

ObamaCare decision as early as today  A decision could come as early as today in the lawsuit that would end ObamaCares insurance subsidies in more states who did not set up their own state exchange If the DC Circuit Court of Appeals rules in favor to the suit more than half of the country would lose insurance subsidies in President Obamas signature health care law Regardless of the decision it is likely to appealed to the Supreme Court

BIPARTISAN BILL TO SPEED UP DEPORTATIONS GAINS GROUND
WaPo A pair of lawmakers from Texas will introduce bipartisan legislation in Congress on today to speed up the deportations of tens of thousands of Central American children who have entered the country illegally across the southern border Sen John Cornyn R and Rep Henry Cuellar D say their bill aims to amend a 2008 law that currently requires the federal government to provide greater legal protections to young immigrants who attempt to enter the United States from noncontiguous countries The legislation would rewrite the law to allow Central American minors be treated like those from Mexico and Canada who can be deported more quickly Under the plan unaccompanied minors from any country would be able to have an immigration court hearing within seven days of their processing by Health and Human Services and an immigration judge would be required to rule within three more days on whether the child would be allowed to stay or be deported The bill authorizes 40 new immigration judges to help process the cases The lawmakers are calling their bill the HUMANE Act an acronym for Helping Unaccompanied Minors and Alleviating National Emergency

Whats the president doing today Oh you know a photoop to draw attention to a political issue It is almost as if he believes political theater can help solve problems

Poll 6 out of 10 disapprove of Obamas handling of border crisis  Fiftyeight percent of American adults disapprove of the way President Obama is handling the immigration crisis according to a new Washington PostABC News poll While Republicans in Congress are still trying to piece together their response to Obamas 37 billion request to aid the influx of Central American children at the border slightly more adults 66 percent disapprove of the GOPs lack of action But there is hope for the President a majority of respondents support the nearly 4 billion plan that will provide care for the illegal children while waiting their deportation hearings speed up the hearing process and increase border security

Asylum approvals skyrocket under Obama  Daily Caller The number of foreigners who successfully filed asylum claims in the United States almost tripled from 2012 to 2013 up to 30393 Thats 10 times the number from 2008 when President Barack Obama was elected and it is evidence his immigration officials are approving most of the asylum requests from the growing wave of Central American migrants If you came illegally to the US seeking asylum in 2013 you had better than a fourinfive chance of successfully filing an asylum claim Thats up from a threeinfive chance in 2008 The migrants include mothers with children and youths who have been brought north by their parents who are living illegally in the United States Roughly 240000 migrants  parents youths and children  are expected to cross the border by the end of September The total includes 57525 unaccompanied youths and children from October 2013 to June 30 2014 according to DHS

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/10/31/largely-ignored-ballot-measures-across-us-could-impact-latinos/,"Along with hundreds  maybe even thousands  of candidates fighting to get themselves elected to political offices across the country there are more than 140 ballot initiatives that are being decided on Tuesday All of them asking voters to take sides on issues as varied as drivers cards for undocumented immigrants in Oregon and raising the minimum wage in Arkansas to recreational marijuana and stricter gun laws That is actually a very low number of ballot measures down from nearly 190 in 2012 But that doesnt mean that there isnt a lot at stake both in terms of important issues as well as money spent by itself one California ballot measure Proposition 45 which would allow the states insurance commissioner to intercede in conflicts over health insurance rate hikes has drawn more than 50 million in spending by outside groups A number of those ballot initiatives could have a direct impact on the lives of Latinos and this has politicians activists political action committees and voter organizations on all sides hoping to win over this key demographic There are less ballot initiatives this year but the ones that are on the ballot are very important Justine Sarver executive director of the Ballot Imitative Strategy Center told Fox News Latino The Latino voting population is not huge in a lot of these states but it is still very important The ballot initiative in Oregon  the Alternative Driver Licenses Referendum  is probably the one that could most directly affect the lives of Latinos The measure is a citizens veto referendum on State Bill 833 a bill passed in 2013 by the Oregon Legislature which grants official driver IDs to people who cannot prove legal presence in the US  Justine Sarver executive director of the Ballot Imitative Strategy Center The proposal has enflamed sentiments on both sides of the immigration debate Trying to make life easier for these people here illegally just makes me ashamed and embarrassed that that our government supports this measure Cynthia Kendoll a campaign manager for Protect Oregon Driver Licenses told FNL Kendoll and other opponents of granting government identity cards to undocumented immigrants and others who cant prove theyre in the country legally is that theres no way to prove the people who apply for the cards are who they claim to be  making the system ripe for corruption This is one of the most fraudriddled documents in the nation Kendoll said of SB 833 Weve got a pervasive culture of corruption where we pick which laws apply to whom and how to enforce them Supporters counter that these documents help keep roads safer as people who may have been driving without insurance or a licensewill go through the training process and be more accountable The measure makes sense because it makes drivers know the rules of the road and it is not a proxy for immigration laws Becky Straus legislative director of the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU of Oregon told FNL It has nothing to do with immigration but instead its about drivers safety and civil liberties Oregons 60 Driver and Motor Vehicle Services offices could begin issuing driver cards in as little as 30 days if the initiative passes Recent polling data suggests the majority of likely voters are leaning toward vetoing SB 833 Oregon would become one of 12 states in the US to allow drivers cards for undocumented immigrants while only two states  Arizona and Nebraska  deny drivers license to young people granted protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA program Illinois also has a number of proposals on the ballot in this years elections including a nonbinding question about raising the minimum wage in the state but the most pressing for Latinos in the state is the Right to Vote amendment Proponents and adversaries of the initiative alike have suggested that the amendment is at least in part meant to discourage a controversial voter identification card like that being used in Texas but the main thrust of the proposal is to ensure that no person is denied the right to vote based on race sex color ethnicity as well as a host of other factors When Illinois state Senate voted back to put the amendment up for vote in November the move was widely praised by Democrats who claim that proof of citizenship measures unfairly disenfranchise lowincome people  often Democrats  who dont have IDs or the money to acquire them No voter should have to face the suppression tactics that we see in other states across the nation Democratic Gov Pat Quinn said in a prepared statement as he encouraged voter approval earlier this year The US Supreme Court said last week that Texas can use its controversial new voter identification law this election A majority of the justices rejected an emergency request from the Justice Department and civil rights groups to prohibit the state from requiring voters to produce certain forms of photo identification in order to cast ballots Democrats in Illinois including the bills sponsor Sen Kwame Raoul have not denied the fact that the Right to Vote amendment is an attempt to dissuade any implementation of voter ID laws It is definitely definitely intended to discourage voter ID laws Raoul said If you cast a vote for this you are casting a vote against voter ID laws For the amendment to go into effect it would need to garner the approval from either 35 of the people who vote solely on the question or a majority of all people voting in the election Some of the other measures that are piquing interest across the nation deal with issues like birth control gun ownership and the legalization of marijuana In Colorado a personhood amendment would add fetuses to those protected by the states criminal and wrongful death act Opponents say it would effectively ban abortions In North Dakota Measure 1 would provide the inalienable right to life for humans at any stage of development Supporters and opponents differ on what impact it might have on abortion regulations Voters in Oregon Alaska and the District of Columbia all have the chance to legalize the recreational use of marijuana by adults a step already taken two years ago by voters in Colorado and Washington state A measure in the Latinocentric state of Florida would legalize medical marijuana use Washington state has two competing gunrelated measures on its ballot with one pursuing background checks for all gun sales and transfers including private transactions and another that would prevent any such requirement involving purchases from private sellers The Associated Press contributed to this report  Follow Andrew OReilly on Twitter aoreilly84 Follow us on

dominated debate ahead of a landmark meeting on Catholic family life that opens this weekend  the fate of Catholics who divorce and the outcome will be a key test of how far Francis reform agenda will go AP PhotoDomenico StinellisThe Associated Press VATICAN CITY  From his stylish living room overlooking St Peters Square Cardinal Walter Kasper doesnt come off as a figure at the center of one of the greatest storms swirling in Catholicism in decades Relaxed on a black leather sofa the German theologian says he fully expected the knives would come out when at Pope Francis request he made a suggestion that challenged a deep church taboo and has dominated debate ahead of a landmark meeting on Catholic family life that opens this weekend The issue is not abortion contraception or gay marriage It is the fate of Catholics who divorce   and the outcome will be a key test of how far Francis reform agenda will go     Delivering a speech to a closed meeting of cardinals last February Kasper suggested that Catholics who remarry without an annulment a church declaration that the first marriage was invalid and thus never existed might receive Communion after a period of penance Church teaching holds that without an annulment these Catholics are living in sin and thus ineligible to receive the sacraments Based on the mudslinging the remarks caused between church liberals and conservatives outside observers might have thought that Kasper had proposed that women be ordained priests Five prominent cardinals    including the Vaticans doctrine czar and its supreme court chief justice    published an entire book to refute him Francis top economic adviser did the same in a preface to another book Conservative commentators canon lawyers and theologians have been furiously blogging to argue that Kaspers suggestion is impossible for the simple reason that it runs contrary to Jesus teaching on the indissolubility of marriage The church is not going to change its teaching on the indissolubility of marriage because she cannot American Cardinal Raymond Burke one of Kaspers fiercest critics told reporters this week But as he faces the firestorm Kasper appears to have a powerful ally the pope himself During his first Sunday blessing as pontiff Francis praised Kasper by name as a great theologian and gave an unprecedented papal thumbs up to his book Mercy which provides the theological basis for mercy being at the heart of the Christian message Showing the churchs merciful face rather than its moralitydriven side has come to define Francis pontificate and informs the way he has long treated complicated pastoral issues like divorce I believe that this is the season of mercy Francis told reporters last year when asked about a possible opening for divorced and remarried Catholics Kasper an 81yearold veteran Vatican official is calm amid the tempest and certain that a solution can be found I think we can have common criteria a common doctrine on marriage and family Kasper said And then I think the bishops conferences should decide concrete ways to do it On divorce Kasper argues that if the church can forgive a murderer surely it can forgive someone whose first marriage failed and wants to try again while still participating in the sacramental life of the church Mercy is that God gives us a new chance in every situation if we want it Kasper says That is a very important message We can always start anew While the divorce issue has dominated the premeeting debate the twoweek synod will cover a host of hotbutton issues related to Catholic family life including premarital sex contraception and gay unions Vatican officials say no issue is offlimits and that Francis wants a frank and open discussion that will continue into next year when final proposals are made In some ways Francis took some of the steam out of divorce issue by creating a special commission of canon lawyers to study technical ways to streamline the annulment process Catholics have long complained that it can take years to get an annulment if they can get one at all Many dioceses in the developing world dont even have annulment tribunals The United States has so many that it accounts for nearly half of all the annulments granted worldwide 18895 in 2012 compared to the 42686 globally Critics of the annulment process say the wealthy and wellconnected get preferential treatment Supporters say it is a way to provide justice and arrive at the truth of why a marriage failed Some canon lawyers and theologians speculate that one change the Vatican might approve is to remove the automatic appeal for all annulments which would certainly streamline the process For Irene Calvo Crespo a 46yearold communications consultant from Spain no amount of streamlining would remove the trauma she says she endured going through the annulment that her exhusband sought so he could remarry in the church They had been married for 10 years and had two children when they separated in 2009 In an interview over coffee in Rome she said she testified for more than two hours before five strangers    the ecclesial tribunal    about the most intimate details of her sex life She said she endured groundless accusations by her exhusbands family and friends made solely to conform to the churchs requirements that there was some inherent defect in the marriage to render it null According to court documentation she provided to The Associated Press the church granted the annulment on the grounds that her exhusband lacked internal freedom on his wedding day that caused a defect in discretion of judgment He claimed he never really wanted to marry her but was compelled to go through with it by his strict conservative upbringing she said You can take all the testimony of the world you can do all the psychological exams but the truth is that we were in love and were well aware when we married and no tribunal in the world can change this truth she wrote in a letter to the tribunal If this tribunal wants to join a farce for reasons unknown to me go ahead but you should know this is all theater ___ Follow Nicole Winfield at

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/08/is-gay-marriage-battle-over-silence-on-right-is-deafening/, After the Supreme Court cleared the way for gay marriage to become legal in 11 more states I checked out some conservative websites for passionate pushback There wasnt any     I saw nothing on National Review other than a link to a Washington Post story Is The Fight Over Gay Marriage Effectively Over Hot Air ran four paragraphs The Daily Caller had a link to CNNs Jeff Toobin calling it an outrageousabdication of duty that the high court wouldnt take the cases allowing lowercourt rulings in favor of samesex marriage to stand The Weekly Standard published a short news story that mostly consisted of Ted Cruz ripping the decision as judicial activism at its worst On an American Family Association show Mike Huckabee the Fox News contributor and possible 2016 contender also spoke out against the decision I am utterly exasperated with the Republicans and the socalled leadership of the Republicans who have abdicated on this issue he said adding that if that doesnt change Ill become an independent But Cruz and Huckabee are exceptions The silence on the right is deafening We havent seen conservative commentators on Fox denouncing what the Supreme Court did And many Republicans are simply ducking the issue With public opinion increasingly favoring gay marriage it seems the conservative movement has essentially surrendered And with gay weddings soon to be performed in 30 states that is unlikely to change I should stop right here and point out that a major chunk of the country still believes that marriage should be between a man and a woman Their views should be respected but are often minimized by the mainstream media which are undeniably liberal on this issue And obviously there are still advocates battling this legal trend But the Republican National Committee put out no statement on Mondays ruling and when MSNBC asked Reince Priebus about that yesterday he sounded rather obligatory in saying Im not running from that position against gay marriage Earlier Michele Bachmann said gay marriage was not an issue in the midterms and pronounced questions about it boring This is to put it mildly an incredible sea change from 10 years ago when George W Bush ran for reelection on a constitutional amendment to ban samesex marriage And just 212 years ago Barack Obama had not yet endorsed gay marriage The dramatic shift in public opinion especially among younger folks can be traced to the fact that as individual states allowed gays to marry the sky didnt fall and people grew accustomed to the idea The media coverageand this was true again this weektends to play up footage and photos of happy couples celebrating and that becomes the public face of the story The same is true as Virginia Wisconsin Indiana Oklahoma and Utah now begin to allow gay marriage in the wake of the high courts decision There has been plenty of speculation as to why the court couldnt muster four votes to take any of the cases Perhaps the conservative wing feared that Anthony Kennedy would help produce a sweeping ruling in favor of gay marriage Perhaps John Roberts wants to let the legal debate play out further before the high court weighs in Perhaps as Ruth Bader Ginsburg has suggested the liberal wing doesnt want to impose a definitive ruling on the country as it did with abortion Or perhaps the justices just wanted to duck The aforementioned Washington Post piece pretty much says its over TheSupreme Courts surprising moveto pass on deciding whether state prohibitions on samesex marriage violate the US Constitution may reflect two things about the justices a natural inclination for incremental steps and a worry on the part of conservatives that the battle  for now  appears lost Many observers of the court were stunned that the justices passed up reviewing lowercourt decisions that overturned prohibitions on samesex marriage in five states delaying a decision that would answer the question for the nation Gay rights proponents took it as a sign that the court likes to move slowly when endorsing momentous societal change that it feels no need to decide an issue before it must  and that the courts move provides aclear signal for future challengesof voterapproved prohibitions on samesex marriage Bloomberg News sees the GOP backing off Republicans didnt want this fightWhile polls suggest that a majority of Americans now support samesex marriage it doesnt play well with the partys baseThe GOPs political arms declined to comment in the immediate aftermath of the decision But the decision could cut both ways The issues reemergence in the political debate could also be uncomfortable for a handful of Democrats fighting to hold onto their Senate seats For example Senators Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas both oppose gay marriage but voters in their socially conservative home states might be convinced to vote Republican in hopes of establishing a GOP majority that would block the expansion of gay rights through legislation or the judiciary A New York Times editorial demands that the court step up The forces against marriage equality are not going down without a fight In nearly half the country gay and lesbian couplesare still treatedas secondclass citizens denied the respect and dignity  as well as the tangible financial benefits  that come with the ability to marry Samesex marriage is among the most important civilrights issues of our time and the country is ready to resolve it once and for all The justices have all the information they need to rule that there is a constitutional right to samesex marriage What are they waiting for Andrew Sullivan who first made the legal case for gay marriage in a 1989 New Republic cover story is ecstatic What Ilove about this conservative but extraordinary decision from SCOTUS is that it affirms the power of federalism against the alternatives Marriage equality will not have been prematurely foisted on the country by one single decision it will have emerged and taken root because it slowly gained democratic legitimacy from state to state because the legal and constitutional arguments slowly won in the court of public opinion and because an experiment in one state Massachusetts and then others helped persuade the sincere skeptics that the consequences were in fact the strengthening of families not their weakening I think of all those who never saw this day the countless people who lived lives of terror and selfloathing for so so long crippled by the deep psychic wound of being told that the very source of your happiness  the love for someone else  was somehow evil or criminal or unmentionable And I cherish America a place where this debate properly began a place where the opposition was relentless and impassioned a country which allowed a truly democratic debate over decades to change minds and hearts where the Supreme Court guided but never preempted the kind of change that is all the more durable for having taken its time The legal debate and the grassroots debate over samesex marriage will continue But in light of what the Supreme Court didor more precisely failed to dothe political battle seems to be over Click for more from Media Buzz  Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of MediaBuzz Sundays 11

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/05/13/is-conservative-free-speech-banned-in-america/,"Reuters Is there free speech left in Americaif youre a conservative or Christian

Isnt free speech protected by the US Constitution Can your views cost you your job career or property Dont look now but its happening Views considered too conservative old fashioned or politically incorrect are no longer tolerated by Obamas socialist cabal or the thought police I know I repeat myself     

Let me give you just a few examples of political correctness run amok Interestingly in each of these cases I disagree with the views expressed

Lets start with the case of openly gay football player Michael Sam On Saturday he became the first gay player drafted into the NFL I say congratulations Im happy for Sam I was rooting for him I actually thought he should have been drafted higher

But have we traded one prejudice and civil rights violation for another Many religious Americans were offended by Sams publically affectionate hand holding hugging and kissing with his boyfriend on national TV after his NFL draft selection If its called progress and a sign of freedom that two men can openly kiss on national TV what is it called when someone offended by that same scene can be fined or suspended from their job Is that progress Is that free speech

Ask Miami Dolphins safety Don Jones He tweeted about how disgusted and offended he was by that kiss Jones was immediately fined and barred from team activities until he finishes training for his recent comments made on social media Training You mean like a reeducation camp

I may disagree with Don Jones comments They may have hurt Michael Sams feelings They may have offended gay Americans They may have been politically incorrect But thats not the point Just because you disagree with someones opinion does your employer have the right to suspend you from your job Can that same employer demand thought training to get your job back In America

This is a NFL football team Whether you are gay or straight should not matter But neither should your views on two men kissing All that should matter is how well you tackle in the open field If you happen to get grossed out by two men kissing thats none of your employers business I dont happen to agree with what Don Jones said publicly but I think the Miami Dolphins and the NFL should be sued for 100 million dollars for a violation of the employee rights of Don Jones He has every right to say what he wants and believe what he wants Where is the public outrage Where is the ACLU

If we allow employers like the Dolphins to censure fine suspend or fire a player for his thoughts political or religious beliefs have we made progress Just realize this cuts both ways How will liberals feel when their views get them fined suspended and fired Whats good for the goose is good for the gander as they say This is not a road we want to head down

But Don Jones is far from an isolated case Its happening across America Free speech is no longer tolerated by the left Even CEOs of a private business are under attack Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich recently lost his job for making a donation to support Prop 8 the ballot initiative that barred samesex marriage in California

Once again I happen to disagree with the opinion of this CEO I personally think government should stay out of our boardrooms and bedrooms I dont believe government should tell people whether they can be married or not But thats not the issue here Remarkably a CEO in America was fired for his personal belief that marriage is between a man and a woman Worse he wasnt fired for leading the battle but rather just for writing a check to a cause he believed in This isnt supposed to happen in America Where is the public outrage Where is the ACLU

Whats next Should we tar and feather CEOs whose views we disagree with Do employees also lose their jobs or careers for making a political donation Who has been appointed as the judge and jury to determine which donations result in the loss of your job

Its great that anyone can be openly gay in America nowadays Im cheering But should conservatives be forced into the closet Why trade one civil rights violation for another Is that progress

For the first time in my life Im rooting for the ACLU to take a stand Because soon in Obamas America it will be conservatives forced to sit in the back of the bus Soon it will be justified not to serve Christians because they stand in opposition to gay marriage or abortion Soon CEOs will be forced out of their jobs for publicly opposing minimum wage increases Soon well see signs openly displayed Republicans need not apply for the job

 Crisis mode Obama leadership woes sinking Dem hopes
 Walsh heading for the exits
 Grimes gets a Billigan from Bubba
 Establishment scores doesnt sweep in primaries
 What cheese     CRISIS MODE OBAMA LEADERSHIP WOES SINKING DEM HOPES
The WSJNBC News poll dropped like a bucket of cold water on Washington where fevered attacks over legislative minutiae and blameplacing in recent weeks has caused politicians to forget what is actually going on And whats going on is that Americans are deeply frustrated with their president his refusal to govern by normal means and his handling of crises at our border and around the world Foreign policy seldom intrudes into the midterm election discussion but when the world seems to be falling apart Americans get anxious and upset with their commander in chief and his party Thats clearly whats happening here Sixty percent of respondents said the US is in decline only 35 percent were satisfied with Americas role in the world and just 21 percent said that the next generation would be better off

The president likes to say that he can act alone on domestic issues a dubious supposition But on international affairs an area in which American presidents have enormous latitude the situation is dire Respondents offered a negative assessment of the US response to the Ukrainian war the Syrian civil war the conflict in Gaza the rise of ISIS and especially the flow of illegal immigrant minors across the southern border Just 11 percent were satisfied with the handling of the border crisis Overall just 36 percent of respondents approved of Obamas handling of foreign policy 12 points lower than ahead of the 2010 vote

The consequences for November are ominous for Democrats Republicans are in slightly better shape in the genericballot test than they were at this point in 2010 the year that a wave election washed away the Democratic majority in the House The presidents job approval now at an alltime low of 40 percent in this poll is 7 points lower than it was four years ago The reality is setting in that Democratic hopes of holding the Senate are winnowing a realization that could turn a bad year into a rout The president promises more executive action to mobilize base supporters on immigration and corporate taxes but with numbers like these Democrats will be increasingly unwilling to hustle for what looks like a lost cause And the harder the president goes in rallying his base the deeper he will sink in the estimation of moderate voters who are so fed up with his administration

UNINSURED RATES JUMPED DESPITE OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES FINES

PACs faced a Sunday deadline to disclose how much donors gave and how much operatives spent in June Highlights from the filings ___ MISSISSIPPI GOOD FOR FUNDRAISING The antitax Club for Growth Action last month had its second best fundraising haul this election cycle as it raised money to pour into Chris McDaniels bid to deny incumbent Republican Thad Cochran a seventh term in the Senate McDaniel had a narrow edge over Cochran in their primary but neither candidate captured more than 50 percent of the vote That sent both into a runoff that had outside groups establishment Republicans and national figures scrambling to ship millions to the state Cochran captured more votes on the second round and appears likely to return for another term but McDaniels allies are threatening to challenge the results Club for Growth Action which demands antitax purity and punishes those who stray from that orthodoxy raised 12 million in June as it railed against Cochran In all the Club for Growth Action fund spent roughly 35 million in Mississippi as of June 30 ___ DEMOCRATS PAYING DOWN DEBT The Democratic National Committee narrowly outraised its Republican rival last month and cut its debt to just 3 million down from a onetime high of 23 million The DNC raised almost 9 million in June while the Republican National Committee reported Sunday that it raised 85 million Despite narrowly being edged out last month the RNC still has 144 million in the bank   roughly twice the DNCs almost 78 million Republicans have outraised Democrats in 10 of the last 18 months although the RNC has done so only once since January of this year Both parties central committees tend to amass debt toward the end of a hardfought presidential campaign and 2012s contest between President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Gov Mitt Romney was no exception The DNC spent heavily to help Obama win a second term    and help motivate Democrats nationwide to support candidates elsewhere on the ballots    but it went into debt to do so The DNCs debt ballooned to a high of almost 23 million in March 2013 as donors who opened their wallets throughout 2012 tired of giving for a politically quiet year The DNC since has been paying down those costs and working to control its spending ahead of 2014s midterms ___ HOUSE SENATE DEMOCRATS OUTRAISE GOP House and Senate Democrats campaign arms alike again outraised their Republican rivals The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised 109 million from donors in June and has 509 million in its bank accounts At the same time the National Republican Congressional Committee said donors gave another 96 million to the committee tasked with keeping House Republicans in the majority and has 425 million saved The Democrats House campaign committee has outraised the GOP in 16 of the last 18 months despite long odds of tipping control of the chamber away from Republicans The Democrats have now raised almost 125 million since the last elections and have been spending heavily to help their incumbents and candidates On the other side of Capitol Hill the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee reported that it raised 72 million in June The National Republican Senatorial Committee said it raised 6 million Senate Democrats have 305 million in the bank to Republicans 246 million Democrats are defending a sixseat majority in the Senate and have been spending heavily to hold those seats and perhaps oust incumbent Republicans The GOP has also been spendhappy with aggressive criticism of endangered Democratic incumbents in North Carolina Louisiana and Colorado ___ DONORS FOR WOMEN The group dedicated to electing women who support abortion rights has raised almost 32 million for federal candidates this cycle EMILYs List which help recruit train and support proabortion rights candidates has also spent close to 32 million this cycle In June alone the group raised 32 million and spent 21 million It was the groups best fundraising month this campaign cycle EMILYs List also reported having 28 million saved ___ TWO SAN FRANCISCANS 3 MILLION A pair of San Francisco billionaires gave a jump start to an environmental super PAC Tom Steyer gave NextGen Climate Action the group he founded another 2 million bringing his yeartodate giving to 41 million Retired Golden West Financial Corporation executive Herb Sandler meanwhile wrote NextGen Climate Action a 1 million check Sandlers fortune also helped found the liberal Center for American Progress Steyer and Sandler were the only donors to NextGen Climate Action in June Steyer has pledged to spent 100 million on this years elections  perhaps as much as 50 million of that from his own fortune The group has raised 126 million since January 2013 ___ ROVEBACKED GROUP SLIPS IN MONEY American Crossroads the super PAC backed by former George W Bush chief strategist Karl Rove saw its fundraising dip in June but still spent 18 million The group among establishment Republicans favorite raised almost 113000 in June    and 100000 came from Denverbased Hallador Energy Company The haul was a dramatic dip from the 52 million the group raised in March Even so the group still has 29 million saved to pay for the ads it has booked in the fall and Roves fundraising network could round up millions when it is needed American Crossroads figures do not

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/05/06/can-god-bless-godless-america/," The White House is waging an allout assault on religious liberty Public schools are indoctrinating our children with the gospel of secularism Hollywood is spewing toxins into our homes The soundtrack of our lives is a pulsating mix of sex and violence and filth The American family is in ruins What was once wrong is now right and what was once right is now wrong

Our nation stands on a precipice Freedom hangs in the balance We live in a postmodern and postGod nation The perfect storm is brewing Do not be deceived There may be a war on religious liberty but the true target is Christianity

Tony Perkins president of the Family Research Council and Kelly Shackelford president of Liberty Institute penned an open letter to the American people last year Hostility against religious liberty has reached an alltime high they warned The freedom of religion is being pushed out of public life schools and even churches Our Founding Fathers considered religious liberty our first freedom and the bedrock upon which all other freedoms rest the men wrote They understood that ones right to worship God and follow his conscience according to the principles of his religious faith was foundational to civic tranquility A man whose religious faith was repressed could never be a loyal citizen since the state was usurping his first allegiance and costing him his primary freedom This is one of the most important distinctions that makes America an exceptional nation  if not the most important

Both groups document more than 600 recent examples of religious hostility Six hundred American stories Our stories Their documentation included many stories I have covered during my career at Fox News Channel

The Obama administration wants to force religious organizations and Christian business owners to provide insurance for birth control and abortioninducing drugs in direct violation of their religious beliefs The military conducted training sessions that labeled Evangelical Christians and Catholics as examples of religious extremists The Internal Revenue Service launched investigations into prolife organizations demanding to know the contents of their prayers

This is happening right here right now in the United States of America We are under attack from within  from an enemy who wants to remove any mention of God from the public marketplace

In recent days a Florida child was bullied by his public schoolteacher for reading his Bible during free reading time The teacher was recorded on a voice mail message telling the childs parents that hes not permitted to read those books in my classroom

Seventhday Adventist preacher Eric Walsh was suspended with pay from his job as the public health director of Pasadena Calif after critics exposed videos of sermons in which he preached that homosexuality is a sin Pasadena officials told local reporters the pastor was placed on paid leave while they investigate his sermons and determine whether he has the ability to lead a department that hes headed since 2010

A while back Rev Billy Graham penned a letter expressing his dismay over the moral decline of the nation declaring that his heart aches for America and its deceived people

The farther we get from God the more the world spirals out of control Graham wrote noting that the nation seems to be going out of its way to remove God from the public arena Just a few weeks ago in a prominent city in the South Christian chaplains who serve the police department were ordered to no longer mention the Name of Jesus in prayer he wrote noting that officers were only allowed to pray to the being in the room

Our society strives to avoid any possibility of offending anyone  except God he continued

We ask God to bless America but we elected a president whose pastor asked God to damn America We ask God to bless America but we slaughter millions of unborn babies We ask God to bless America but we silence His children

God bless America We should be on our knees asking for His mercy instead The time has come for people of faith to rise up and claim their Ebenezer We need patriots who will take back this land We need patriots who will say we are still one nation under God

The storm clouds are gathering The winds of revolution are blowing friends Religious liberty is under attack

Years ago the Christian songwriter Steve Green penned a song titled Find Us Faithful It was a prayer that all who came after us would find this generation of believers faithful The call still rings true today

In these early days of the 21st century the fire is flickering and the footprints are few Storm clouds are gathering The winds of persecution are blowing But friends no matter how difficult these days have become let not your heart be troubled

The time has come brothers and sisters my fellow countrymen Who among you is willing to take a stand for religious liberty Who among you is will to risk everything for the cause of Christ Who among you is willing to rise up and declare that we are still one nation under God

If my people who are called by My name will humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land the Scriptures declare

The most pressing problem facing America cant be solved in Washington DC True hope and change cant be found at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue It can only be found at the foot of the cross
on Calvary

Our government may spy on our phone lines It may throw us in jail It may take away our photography shops and bakeries It may demand to know the content of our prayers But we will not be bullied We will not be intimidated We will not be silenced

Its time for a new generation of believers to rise up and restore the dream of our Founding Fathers  the dream of a nation where all men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights The dream of a people who declare we are still one nation under God

Life has come to the court for ten years to make a silent appeal against abortion  AP PhotoJ Scott ApplewhiteThe Associated Press WASHINGTON  People cant plead ignorance of the law to excuse a violation The first case of the new Supreme Court term Monday tests whether theres a double standard when it comes to the police A case from North Carolina turns on whether an officers mistaken belief about a state law still can justify a traffic stop that led to the discovery of cocaine     The justices are beginning their fifth year together and Chief Justice John Roberts is at the start of his 10th year at the head of the high court Their term could be one for the ages if they decide as seems likely to take on the issue of samesex marriage and settle once and for all whether gay and lesbian couples have a constitutional right to marry But before they get there the court has an array of cases involving   Religious employment and housing discrimination   The drawing of political districts in Alabama and Arizona   A dispute between Congress and the president over passports that is heavy with Middle East politics   The use of a law to prevent document shredding against a fisherman accused of throwing undersized red grouper overboard and   The prosecution of a selfstyled rapper whose Facebook postings threatened his estranged wife an FBI agent and area schools Mondays argument on the police action involves an appeal by Nicholas Heien whose Ford Escort was pulled over when an officer saw that the right rear brake light wasnt working although the left one was The officer found cocaine during an ensuing search and Heien was later convicted of drug trafficking Typically evidence found in a car that has been pulled over for a valid reason can be used against a defendant But North Carolinas quirky traffic laws mandate that only one brake light on a car be functioning The case tests whether the officers mistaken understanding of the law makes the traffic stop unreasonable and the search a violation of Heiens constitutional rights A divided state Supreme Court said the mistake was reasonable enough to justify the routine traffic stop The next day the justices will take up the case of Arkansas prison inmate Gregory Holt who says his Muslim beliefs require him to grow a halfinch beard Arkansas prison officials permit no beards with the exception of inmates with certain skin conditions who can have beards a quarterinch long Prison officials say their rule is a matter of security because beards can be used to hide prohibited items and 18 states are backing the states argument But groups across the political spectrum and the Obama administration say Holt has a right to grow a beard under a federal law aimed at protecting prisoners religious rights More than 40 states already allow beards with little evidence that inmates have tried to hide prohibited items in them Last term the court bitterly divided over the religious rights of familyowned corporations that objected to paying for womens contraceptives under President Barack Obamas health care law The Gregory Holt case appears likely to unite the court said University of Notre Dame law professor Richard Garnett I think theres every reason to expect agreement among the justices that Arkansas hasnt even come close to satisfying the burden Garnett said The courts calendar this fall also includes a foray into the online world Anthony Elonis of Bethlehem Pennsylvania is challenging his conviction for using Facebook to post threats of violence The issue in Elonis case is whether he had to intend to make the threats The government argues that the proper measure is whether a reasonable person would feel threatened Elonis said his online postings should be considered speech that is protected by the First Amendment and that he used the forum to vent his frustration over a series of events that included the loss of his job and the breakup of his marriage

Scalia in a reference to the rap artist Beyond individual cases on the courts docket court observers across the political spectrum are using the milestone 10th year to offer assessments of Roberts and the court he leads The courts record on gay rights is comparable to its embrace of civil rights for AfricanAmericans in the 1950s and 1960s under Chief Justice Earl Warren said University of Chicago law professor David Strauss The court will go down in history as one that was on the frontiers of establishing rights for gays and lesbians Strauss said even though the chief justice has mainly been in dissent But the Roberts court also has rolled back campaign finance limits upheld abortion restrictions and been generally skeptical of the consideration of race in public life in decisions driven by a conservative fivejustice majority To liberals Roberts has ignored his promise during Senate confirmation hearings to be modest instead using the power of court to move dramatically to the right Brianne Gorod of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center Some conservatives meanwhile are dismayed by what they see as Roberts unwillingness to take big steps on key issues and they have yet to forgive his vote to uphold Obamas health care law in 2012 Roger Pilon a vice president of the libertarian Cato Institute wrote in Catos Supreme Court review that missed opportunities can become lost opportunities With the court closely divided on key issues a change on the bench can mean the difference between victory and defeat That was indeed the case with the replacement of Justice Sandra

Fox,http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2014/10/01/ap-gfk-poll-look-at-where-voters-stand-on-top-issues-in-midterm-election/,WASHINGTON  Its October and in some places voters are already voting The latest Associated PressGfK poll finds those likely to cast a ballot are focused more on the economy than other issues But that hasnt stopped campaigns from trying to appeal on other topics as well Heres a look at what voters think on the top issues of the election cycle THE ECONOMY The nations economic blues remain at the top of voters list of important issues Asked to name the nations biggest problem 19 percent cite the economy significantly higher than the 12 percent who name the next highest issue on the list terrorism and national security Among all adults 4 in 10 approve of President Barack Obamas handling of the issue a figure thats held steady since late last year Likely voters give Republicans a narrow edge as the party more trusted to handle the economy 36 percent to 31 percent who favor the Democrats approach But six years after impressions of the economy took a negative turn from which public opinion has never recovered a sizable 22 percent say they trust neither party on the issue Overall 62 percent of likely voters describe the economy as poor about the same as at this point in 2012 but better than 2010 when 79 percent of likely voters said it was in bad shape HEALTH CARE Many expected Obamas signature domestic policy initiative to become a central topic in this years campaigns but the voters are less interested Though 8 in 10 call health care an important issue for them personally when asked to name the top issue facing the country just 5 percent of likely voters named health care Public opinion on the law has been stagnant since the rollout of the state insurance exchanges a year ago Overall 25 percent of adults say they support the health care program 40 percent oppose it and 34 percent are neutral About 6 in 10 say the law itself has been more of a failure than a success  Among likely voters theres more support for the health care overhaul 30 percent but also more opposition 47 percent Those likely voters who call health care an extremely important issue are more closely divided than others on how the laws been working though still fall mainly on the negative side of the line 45 percent say its been a success while 54 percent call it a failure IMMIGRATION About twothirds of likely voters call illegal immigration a serious problem for the United States today and 8 percent name immigration or border security as the top issue facing the nation Only 35 percent say they approve of Obamas handling of the issue Voters are generally in favor of providing a legal way for illegal immigrants already in the United States to become citizens 53 percent back that but that support rests heavily on Democratic likely voters 75 percent of whom favor such a policy Among Republicans who are most apt to mail in a ballot or show up at the polls 33 percent favor it along with 37 percent of independent likely voters THE THREAT OF TERRORISM About 8 in 10 likely voters say terrorism is a key issue for them with Republicans more apt than Democrats to consider it important Overall 83 percent of Republicans say the issue is important compared with 72 percent of Democrats Similarly 87 percent of Republicans consider the threat posed by the Islamic State group an important issue compared with 75 percent of Democrats And although some have raised the possibility of securityfocused women as a key to the election there is no difference by gender on the importance of the issue Republicans have a 16point advantage among likely voters as the party more trusted to protect the country 39 percent vs 23 percent and its one issue where the parties havent lost quite as much faith among the public Just 16 percent say they trust neither party to keep the nation safe the lowest share on any issue tested in the poll SOCIAL ISSUES Democrats hold their strongest advantages in the poll on issues such as abortion or samesex marriage yet these same issues land near the bottom of voters priority lists Asked in an openended question to name the most important issue currently facing the US neither issue scored even 1 percent of responses When asked how important each issue was personally 43 percent of likely voters ranked abortion an important one 32 percent said that about samesex marriage Female likely voters are more likely to call both issues important On abortion 47 percent of women consider it important compared with 38 percent of men and on samesex marriage 35 percent of women say its a key issue compared with 28 percent of men The APGfK Poll was conducted September 2529 2014 using KnowledgePanel GfKs

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/04/10/hillary-obama-and-media-reducing-politics-to-sex-and-race/, Also  View from the Left     Hillary Obama and the media Reducing politics to sex and race Weve apparently settled on what the 2016 presidential campaign is going to be about Sex Not sex as in Hillary Clintons gender but sex as in sex scandals And by the way the grand narrative of Barack Obamas presidency is about race and that wont change until he leaves office These are among the pronouncements in a pair of New York Magazine essays Frank Rich writing about Hillary and Jonathan Chait weighing in on Barack Now nobody with a pulse could deny that the Republicans and Democrats are engaged in a gender war and that Hillary will become the focus of that and that Bills escapades in the 90s will be used against her in some form But is that the overriding question about her probable candidacy or just a juicy journalistic topic I say as someone who has written about the subject its the latterstories about Hillary and sex get more ratings and clicks than explorations of her record at Foggy Bottom Heres Rich the former New York Times columnist welcoming the Republicans with a makemyday tone Undaunted the GOP is back on sex patrol Reince Priebus the chairman of the Republican National Committeetweeted in February Remember all the Clinton scandals  Thats not what America needs againan acknowledgment that Clinton scandals are exactly what his party does remember and does need again whether America needs them or notPriebus elaboratedto Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC that a Hillary run provides a lot of opportunity for us and that everythings on the table You dont need a slideshow to surmise what everything is a euphemism for The Democrats will publicly scold the Republicans for recycling yesterdays garbage But in private they should pray that Priebus and his camp will bring it on  the old Clinton sex scandals and better still some new ones real or fantasized the more women the better The received wisdom that sex scandals threaten a Hillary run is preposterous Its the reverse thats true The rights inability to stanch its verbal diarrhea on the subject of female sexuality  whether provoked by rape contraception abortion traditional marriage gay marriage gay parenting or pop culture  did as much as anything to defeat Mitt Romney his binders full of women notwithstanding in 2012 He lost women voters to Obama by 11 percentage points And that obsession with sex can defeat the GOP again Partisan rhetoric aside I happen to agree that the GOP would face a backlash for hitting the Monica Lewinsky button too hard as Rand Paul was doing earlier this year The country litigated all this during the impeachment drama some 16 years ago and moved on But with the current president targeting female voters for the midterms as in his push on equal pay even if pay in the White House is unequal theres no way sex and gender issues arent going to swirl around the potential first woman president My question is whether the media will conduct that as a healthy debate or one in which both sides are reduced to caricatures A related question is whether Clinton will do what she avoided doing in 2008 running as the woman to crack the ultimate glass ceiling Rich acknowledges that the GOP has taken a few steps from the National Republican Congressional Committee offering seminars on running against female politicians to John Boehner saying that some of our members just arent as sensitive as they ought to be But then he cites such examples as Mike Huckabee saying women who cannot control their libido turn to Uncle Sugar to buy contraceptives Huckabee says he was characterizing the Democratic view Rich in case you were wondering says its hard to imagine how Hillary can lose the presidency Meanwhile the Chait piece on Obama sees both sides engaged in a blackandwhite psychodrama Liberals dwell in a world of paranoia of a white racism that has seeped out of American history in the Obama years and lurks everywhere mostly undetectable Conservatives dwell in a paranoia of their own in which racism is used as a cudgel to delegitimize their core beliefs And the horrible thing is that both of these forms of paranoia are right During the Obama years race has saturated everything as perhaps never before Hardly a day goes by without a volley and countervolley of accusations of racial insensitivity and racial hypersensitivity And even when the red and blue tribes are not waging their endless war of mutual victimization the subject of race courses through everything else debt health care unemployment Whereas the great themes of the Bush years revolved around foreign policy and a cultural divide over what or who constituted real America the Obama years have been defined by a bitter disagreement over the size of government which quickly reduces to an argument over whether the recipients of biggovernment largesse deserve it There is no separating this discussion from ones sympathies or prejudices toward and identification with black America There is more Fox doesnt respect Obama says Chait and MSNBC has spent the entire Obama presidency engaged in a nearly nonstop ideological stopandfrisk operation When Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell chided Obama for playing too much golf Lawrence ODonnell accused him of trying to align  the lifestyle of Tiger Woods with Barack Obama  After Arizona governor Jan Brewer confronted Obama at an airport tarmac Jonathan Capehart concluded A lot of people saw it as her wagging her finger at this president whos also black who should not be there Martin Bashir hung a monologue around his contention that Republicans were using the initials IRS as a code that meant the Nword Chris Matthews calls Republicans racist so often it is hard to even keep track Its not exactly breaking news that both sides have played racial politics during this administration While the president has occasionally waded into these waters from the beer summit with Henry Louis Gates to the Brothers Keeper initiative he generally steers clear of explicitly racial topics That hasnt insulated him from

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/07/25/dinging-democrats-new-york-times-takes-on-governor-and-senator-over-ethics/, Plenty of people believe that the New York Times leans left Hell I think the New York Times leans left at least when it comes to social and cultural subjects A decade ago the papers first ombudsman Daniel Okrent said that of course the Times is a liberal newspaper especially when it comes to the social issues gay rights gun control abortion and environmental regulation among others And if you think The Times plays it down the middle on any of them youve been reading the paper with your eyes closed     But that inclination doesnt mean the Times pulls its punches when it comes to investigating Democrats That was true when the paper broke the story about Eliot Spitzer and prostitutes that led to the governors resignation And it was doubly true in the last two days First up the Times ran a devastating piece on John Walsh the Montana Democrat who was appointed to the Senate in February and is running for election Walsh is a decorated Iraq war veteran But one of the highestprofile credentials of Mr Walshs 33year military career appears to have been improperly attained An examination of the final paper required for Mr Walshs masters degree from the United States Army War College indicates the senator appropriated at least a quarter of his thesis on American Middle East policy from other authors works with no attribution  Most strikingly the six recommendations Mr Walsh laid out at the conclusion of his 14page paper titled The Case for Democracy as a Long Term National Strategy are taken nearly wordforword without attribution from a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace document on the same topic And the explanations are painful Walsh said he doesnt think he plagiarized An aide didnt contest the allegation but said Walsh was going through a difficult time because a member of his unit had committed suicide  but that the senator didnt seek treatment Then Walsh contradicted her saying he was being treated at the time for posttraumatic stress disorder is currently on antidepressants and is considering an apology to the scholars whose work he used I would not want to be his campaign manager helping Walsh spin his way out of this especially since he was already trailing his Republican opponent Exhibit No 2 is this Times piece on how Andrew Cuomo set up a highpowered ethics commission worked to undermine it and then recently abolished it  The story starts with the withdrawal of a subpoena for a media firm that had placed millions of dollars in ads for the state Democratic Party and an explanation from the panels chief investigatorThey apparently produced ads for the governor The pulledback subpoena was the most flagrant example of how the commission established with great ceremony by Mr Cuomo in July 2013 was hobbled almost from the outset by demands from the governors office While the governor now maintains he had every right to monitor and direct the work of a commission he had created many commissioners and investigators saw the demands as politically motivated interference that hamstrung an undertaking that the governor had publicly vowed would be independent Cuomo said in a statement thata commission appointed by and staffed by the executive cannot investigate the executive It is a pure conflict of interest and would not pass the laugh test This was a threemonth investigation by the Times taking on a governor who has a huge lead for reelection this fall and who has generally been backed by the papers editorial page Will the media pursue this story despite its complexity with the same fervor devoted to the governor across the river Chris Christie and his George Washington Bridge traffic problems The Times should be regularly scrutinized for bias given its agendasetting impact on journalism and politics But no one can say it wont conduct serious investigations of Democrats As a footnote Public Editor Margaret Sullivan examines why two stories didnt make it into the paper  one a report saying that mass government surveillance is becoming a dangerous habit the other a Human Rights Watch study finding that the FBI and Justice Department have created a climate of fear in some Muslim communities through the use of surveillance Both were widely covered elsewhere Turns out that dropped balls were to blame in both cases  a miscommunication a reporter on vacation another who had an email go to spam  rather than some conspiracy in the top ranks Click for more from Media Buzz  Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of MediaBuzz Sundays 11 am and 5 pm ET He is the author of five books and is based in Washington Follow him at HowardKurtz Click here for more information on Howard Kurtz,2014-07-25T05:00-04:00,abortion

 This marathoner really hit the wall     PRESSURE GROWS FOR TRAVEL BAN FRIEDEN OUSTER
With a new poll showing that 60 percent of voters including 57 percent of Democrats favor the idea of banning travel to the United States by those in the Ebola hot zone in West Africa how long can the Obama administration hold the line The issue of a travel ban took center stage in key Senate debates in Kansas and Colorado on Wednesday night and is sure to stay front and center as a dozen or more contested Senate races rage into their final days The administrations decision is hard to defend and easy to attack especially compared to convoluted claims Democrats have been making about funding caps

Colorado Senate frontrunner GOP Rep Cory Gardner a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee willreportedly break off the campaign trail today to attend a committee hearing on Ebola

Must be serious  With President Obama abandoning his prior stance of not canceling political or personal events amid crises for the sake of not alarming the public we are left to wonder if it is time to panic More likely the current spin is just as politically motivated as was the defense of fundraising and recreation amid the furor over the public beheadings of Americans by Islamist militants The daily revelations of botched and bungling responses to Ebola have put the administration on defense That explains an unprecedented secondstraight day of scrubbed Obama campaign events If theres more bad news today Obama doesnt want to be sipping Chablis at a fundraiser when the story breaks But we also must wonder if the president isnt taking some time today to review rsums Dr Thomas Frieden has so bungled the public outreach and protocols for current crisis that he is one more calamity away from being Shinsekied

Author of Bloomberg bans  The NYT profiled Frieden then New York health commissioner when he was being vetted for his current CDC post Since being appointed the citys health commissioner by Mayor Michael R Bloomberg in 2002 he has gained a reputation as New York Citys health conscience the architect of the citys widely emulated campaigns to ban smoking in bars post calorie counts in fastfood chains and ban arteryclogging trans fats in restaurants

Hot zone  Friedan heads to Capitol Hill today to defend his agencys struggle to deal with Ebola It has been a rough run for the administrations public face on epidemic response His prior claims that the disease could be detected before entry into the US and dealt with by hospital workers if it did breach our borders proved false On Tuesday Frieden countered charges that the CDC has been wrong saying our information is clear and correct When Megyn Kelly pointed out that the CDC director had assured the American public that we would stop Ebola in its tracks Frieden responded What we are doing is making sure that we stop the train of transmission You can see the follow up on The Kelly File here When it was revealed that Freidans agency had allowed a nurse who had treated an Ebola patient and who was complaining of a fever to board an airplane calls for Frieden to resign began at once

Whenever they tell you that words dont matter remember that on this day in 1854 a gangly man with a strong Kentucky accent made a speech that changed America Today is the anniversary of the Peoria Speech by Abraham Lincoln in which the former oneterm congressman and Senate hopeful made his first public remarks in opposition to slavery He didnt get the Senate seat that was before direct election of senators but he did change the trajectory of his country which then seemed bound for the expansion of slavery in the Western territories Chicago newspaperman Horace White who had come out to hear Lincoln and Sen Stephen Douglas DIll that day described Lincoln thusly although awkward he was not in the least embarrassed The key White wrote was that Lincolns eloquence was of the higher type which produced conviction in others because of the conviction of the speaker himself His listeners felt that he believed every word he said and that like Martin Luther he would go to the stake rather than abate one jot or tittle of it You might need a third cup to get through the threehour speech but you can read it here

 Klain A political fixer for a political problem
 Braley looks to recalibrate on lateterm abortion
 Crist has a fan in MO
 Power Play Midterms reveal depth of ObamaClinton feud
 Bat Boy lives on     KLAIN A POLITICAL FIXER FOR A POLITICAL PROBLEM
We learned an awful lot today about how the Obama White House views the threat from Ebola with the appointment of Ron Klain as czar for dealing with response to the disease Since Klain who rose to fame as the chief Democratic lawyer in the 2000 Florida recount is a political fixer and not an expert in epidemiology or public safety we can assume that President Obama sees a political problem that needs to be fixed The White House says that it is possible and perhaps likely that more Americans will be diagnosed with the virus which we can assume means that more cases are almost certainly out there But we are told that because the government has learned from its mistakes is now being aggressive with quarantines or not everything will be okay The effort to get Americans to calm down and relax about the disease that dissolves human organs and carries a 70 percent mortality rate has somehow not worked out So now in response to all the alarm the administration is trying to match the public tone And as was the case two months ago on Islamist militants in Iraq and Syria the only circumstance that seems to be different is public opinion

A CBS News Poll has found that positive assessment of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has declined dramatically with only 37 percent of respondents saying the CDC is doing an excellent or good job  down from 60 percent in a May 2013 Gallup poll

Czared or Shinsekied  The selection of Klain as Ebola czar aside from squandering what might have been the best altrock band name ever is in part to get a handle on the bureaucracy in the person of a party loyalist but mostly window dressing The government already has someone whom might be called an Ebola czar It has in fact no shortage of people who are in positions to take the lead role The real problem here is political A lack of confidence in the existing team The appointment of a czar is a way to put a new face on outreach and an acknowledgement of the missteps by the administration It spares a symbolic sacking of the frustrated and mistrusted Centers for Disease Control boss Dr Thomas Frieden Better to be czared than Shinsekied one supposes

Weekly Standard North Carolina Senator Kay Hagan said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is giving us great guidance on how to deal with Ebola virus infections here in the United States

A plan based on a ban  But the big issue is of course the travel ban The calls for a ban on travel to the US by those from West African nations in the hot zone predates the arrival of the first infected visitor but accelerated after his death and the subsequent infections and travels of his caregivers Both the president and Frieden were defensive Thursday about a travel ban and you could certainly see cracks in the faade The rationale subtly shifted from the previously stated claim that a ban would do harm because of isolating and destabilizing the affected nations The president claimed Thursday that a ban wouldnt work because people would sneak through by breaking up their travel going first to nonafflicted regions and then heading to the US Maybe but ask Steve Hayes how aggressive our travel ban systems are Also telling is that Obama claimed he was opposed to those who favor a ban instead of the protocols that weve put in place now The calls actually are for a travel ban plus screenings plus anything else anyone can think of This straw man suggests Obama is preparing to offer his own compromise position

The Hill lists the lawmakers who are calling for a travel ban

Crawfishing again  So we start to get a pretty clear sense of where the president is going Obama has a habit of taking audaciously inactive positions like not bombing ISIS only to crawfish backwards when public outrage intensifies A travel ban of some kind is on its way just as a war of some kind is now underway against ISIS A president who prides himself on defying his critics has this midterm year turned into a public opinion appeaser But positions obtained through backpedaling particularly on national security are unlikely to reassure Having opted for another crawfish maneuver Obama will struggle to stay ahead of the public panic that is driving his actions

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/04/26/francis-deeply-influenced-by-both-saint-popes-owes-papacy-to-jpii-but-style/,VATICAN CITY  When Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio almost became pope in 2005 he told a confidant that   had he been elected    he would have named himself after the pope he so admired John XXIII When he did become pope in 2013 his first public words echoed what John Paul II had said upon his election    that cardinals had searched far to the ends of the Earth to find a new leader     John XXIII and John Paul II two of the 20th centurys great spiritual leaders changed the face of the Catholic Church and the papacy itself with their remarkable and remarkably different papacies They also had a profound influence on Pope Francis who will declare them both saints Sunday in historys first canonization of two popes John embraced by progressives reigned from 19581963 and is credited primarily with having convened the Second Vatican Council which brought the 2000yearold institution into modern times During his 26 years as pope John Paul ensured a more conservative implementation and interpretation of the council while helping to bring down communism and energizing a new generation of Catholics Just weeks after he was elected Francis prayed at the tombs of both men    an indication that he feels a great personal and spiritual continuity with them To canonize them both together will be I believe a message for the church Francis said last summer These two were wonderful both of them ___ FRANCIS ROOTS Francis owes his papacy    and his career    to John Paul who was elected in 1978 as the first nonItalian in 455 years It was John Paul who plucked Bergoglio from relative obscurity and from internal Jesuit exile to make him an auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992 Six years later John Paul promoted Bergoglio to archbishop of the Argentine capital and in 2001 made him a cardinal putting him in the running to possibly succeed him as pope In Bergoglio John Paul probably saw a kindred spirit a conservative who like John Paul opposed the Marxist excesses of liberation theology in Latin America Bergoglio later testified before the church tribunal for John Pauls saintmaking process that his pope had been heroic in his suffering as he battled Parkinsons disease in his later years He said his own devotion to the Virgin Mary was due in part to John Pauls great devotion to the Madonna But in many ways Francis is much more a pontiff in the style of John XXIII Francis emphasis on a poor church on internal church reform and spreading the faith to the peripheries of society echoes the concerns of John XXIII The young Angelo Roncalli joined the Franciscan orders lay branch before being ordained drawn to the emphasis of its founder St Francis of Assisi on caring for the poor and his message of peace The current pope eventually decided to name himself after St Francis signaling a deep spiritual connection In a sentimental sign of his admiration for John XXIII Francis included Johns longtime private secretary Loris Capovilla in his first batch of new cardinals even though at age 98 Capovilla was well over the age limit to vote in a conclave Francis was similarly so determined to see John made a saint that he broke the Vaticans own rules for canonization declaring that the Vatican need not go through the process of certifying a second miracle attributed to his intercession Francis is a Roncallian pope said Alberto Melloni Johns biographer and the head of the Bologna foundation where his papers are kept We see the fruit of the council today in Pope Francis ___ MISSIONARIES OR MORALIZERS Francis is a pastor pope like John and less doctrinaire than John Paul Francis once quipped when asked why he didnt raise abortion and samesex marriage during his first foreign trip to Brazil that he didnt feel it necessary    just as I didnt speak about cheating lying or other matters on which the church has a clear teaching Had John Paul not spent the better part of a quartercentury clarifying church teaching on issues such as abortion euthanasia and homosexuality for a generation of Catholics confused after the turbulent 1960s Francis perhaps might not have felt that way But the remark also points to Francis forgiving focus on mercy over morals Thats not to say that John Paul was all doctrine On the contrary his globetrotting papacy his foresight to launch the wildly popular World Youth Days and his natural ability to communicate all made him the worlds Catholic pastor on a global altar That too has influenced Francis who seems to have a similarly easy casual way of dealing with young people though he lacks the booming voice John Paul cultivated in his days as an actor George Weigel John Pauls biographer said its frankly ridiculous to see Francis only as a rupture from the doctrineminded papacies of John Paul and later Benedict XVI as many people view him Pope Francis is obviously a man who is inspired by John Paul II deeply admired John Paul II Weigel said He inherited a church shaped by John Paul II and Benedict XVI in what I try to think of as a 35year long arc of interpretation of the Second Vatican Council But there are clear differences John Paul born Karol Wojtyla willingly put himself front and center in the churchs cultural wars using the papal pulpit to enter into the politics of morality in a way Francis has so far shied from emulating    even though those wars are far from over Pope Francis doesnt represent a man who fights over how the council was received or the conflict between the churchs principles and the public sphere of morality Melloni said He represents the fruit of the council in the sense of putting the Gospel in the center of Christian life That emphasis on spiritual life was obviously a core part of John Paul who was known for his intense internal prayer life But for John it represented a break from popes past For many centuries what was considered important to be a pope was to be a great sovereign a great politician Melloni said John marked a turnabout in which the practicing life of a Christian was again essential to being pope ___ PERSONALITY TRAITS Like Francis John grew up in a large devout family where the women taught the young the simple piety of poor Catholics of the era For John it was his mother Marianna For Francis his grandmother Rosa They both hailed from hearty northern Italian stock Francis grandparents moved to Argentina from Piedmont Roncallis family still hails from Bergamo John Pauls background was totally different though he too came from a devout Catholic family In Wadowice Poland he lost his mother when he was a child his older brother when he was 14 By the time he was in his 20s he was alone in the world after his father died Despite their different upbringings all three arrived at the papacy with a visceral need to be around people John defined his life at the Vatican as that of a bird in a gilded cage and took every opportunity to escape Francis opted to live at the Vatican hotel rather than the Apostolic Palace saying his psychiatric health was in the balance John Paul rarely ate alone often using the dinner table as both a place to talk over serious business or share good times with old friends from Poland People and yes even crowds energized him said Monsignor Slawomir Oder who spearheaded John Pauls sainthood case Oder also acknowledged a darker side to John Paul He had a temper and wasnt afraid of showing it He was hot blooded and emotional Oder said recalling how John Paul once berated a priest in his diocese for a misdeed and ordered him to hand over his drivers license John was known as the good pope    affable rotund with big ears warm eyes a gentle smile and an excellent sense of humor For those enthralled by Francis papacy it all sounds familiar though Francis himself has admitted he has an authoritarian streak The Rev Robert Wister a professor of church history at Seton Hall University said the message to take home from Sundays canonizations    which might witness two living popes Francis and emeritus Benedict XVI honoring two dead ones    is that there can be different approaches to the papacy different types of popes different applications of church teaching depending on the signs of the times Were still one church he said ___ Follow Nicole

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/15/fox-news-poll-as-election-nears-voters-say-things-are-going-to-hell-in/, The worlds going to hell in a handbasket according to a majority of voters in the latest Fox News poll And thats draining support for President Obamas policies But will it help Republicans on Election Day Unclear     CLICK TO READ THE POLL The new poll released Wednesday finds 58 percent of voters feel things in the world are going to hell in a handbasket That includes nearly half of Democrats 48 percent and majorities of independents 61 percent and Republicans 71 percent Some 35 percent of voters channel Bob Marleys mantra that everything will be all right Meanwhile by a 6136 percent margin voters say they dont feel hopeful about the direction of the country Thats a reversal from 2012 when 57 percent felt hopeful The shift is driven by a nearly 30point drop among Democrats 80 percent felt hopeful two years ago while just 52 percent say the same now In August 2012 Democrats were likely buoyed by Obamas reelection campaign In a recent economic speech at Northwestern University Obama said even though he wasnt on the ballot this election  his policies were He should be glad thats not actually the case a 53 percent majority would vote against his policies if they were up for a vote That includes one in six Democrats 17 percent Plus by a 10 percentagepoint margin more voters think the country is worse off today than before Obama was elected 49 worse off vs 39 better off The presidents job rating is only slightly better 40 percent approve and 52 percent disapprove And then theres this voters not only think his signature legislation ObamaCare is mostly a bad thing for the country 52 percent they also believe the administration misrepresented the law to get it passed 55 percent Despite all that negative sentiment toward the administration the poll shows Republicans have failed to make significant gains this election season  mostly because voters think they stink too For example views of the Republican Party are more negative than positive by 18 points 36 favorable vs 54 unfavorable while the Democratic Party is underwater by just 7 points 43 favorable vs 50 unfavorable Before the 2010 midterm election Democrats were underwater by 8 points while the GOP was even at 44 percent favorable and 44 percent unfavorable Meanwhile Obamas 44 percent favorable rating is the lowest since he entered office 52 percent unfavorable His alltime low is 41 percent favorable in January 2007 The generic ballot test shows likely voters prefer the Republican candidate over the Democrat in their House district by a slim threepoint margin 4542 percent Thats well within the polls margin of sampling error Two weeks ago the GOP candidate was up by seven points 4740 percent among likely voters The gender gap continues as women are more inclined to back the Democratic candidate by a 10 point margin while men pick the Republican candidate by 18 points Independents are twice as likely to support the Republican over the Democrat 4925 percent Likely voters also want Republicans to win control of the US Senate this year by 47 to 43 percent Three weeks before Election Day the spread on the generic House vote has narrowed despite enthusiasm remaining higher among the GOP Among likely voters more Republicans 45 percent than Democrats 30 percent are extremely interested in the election by 15 points Two weeks ago it was GOP 10 Republicans 66 percent are also more likely than Democrats 60 percent to say the outcome of this years election will be very important to the direction of the country The wellknown getoutthevote efforts by Democrats could blunt the Republican enthusiasm edge So far though about equal numbers  about one voter in four  have been contacted this year about voting for Republicans as for Democrats Economic issues dominated the 2012 presidential election This year theres ISIS Ebola Ukraine The number of voters prioritizing economic issues has dropped from 45 percent in 2012 to 32 percent now At the same time the number picking national security issues went from seven percent before to 23 percent in the new poll Fiscal issues 16 percent and social issues 12 percent stay mostly unchanged Voters are sharply divided on social issues such as legalizing samesex marriage 45 favor versus 45 oppose and creating a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants currently living in the US 46 favor vs 44 oppose Majorities of Democrats favor legalizing samesex marriage 66 percent favor and creating a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants 61 percent favor Republicans are the reverse Majorities oppose legalizing gay marriage 64 percent oppose and making it easier for illegal immigrants to stay 57 percent oppose On abortion 43 percent of all registered voters are prolife while 48 percent are prochoice Among likely voters it splits 4646 Pollpourri Voter confidence that the Secret Service can protect the president from harm has dropped to 47 percent  hardly surprising given that an armed man jumped the fence and made it inside the White House last month In January 2009 a high of 66 percent had confidence in the Secret Service Now a 52 percent majority is not confident Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta released a book critical of his former boss President Obama What do voters think of officials slamming a president after working for him By more than twotoone voters say it is honorable rather than disloyal 5927 percent A 55percent majority favors Obama stopping all border crossings into or from Mexico until a US Marine who mistakenly crossed the border six months ago is released 36 percent opposed The Fox News poll is based on landline and cell phone interviews with 1012 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research D and Shaw  Company Research R from October 1214 2014 The full poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points For the subgroup of 831 likely voters the margin of sampling error is also plus or minus three points,2014-10-15T18:00-04:00,abortion

Harry Reid saying that he is going to pass a constitutional amendment should sound about as credible as Donald Sterling saying that he was going to buy the New York Yankees The Senate Majority leader cant pass a tax bill that has major bipartisan support He cant pass a warm and fuzzy energy conservation bill his endangered members want He cant even deliver a vote on the Keystone Pipeline More astonishing Reid cant muster the nominations of the presidents picks for two key judgeships and senior administration posts despite having changed the Senate rules so that that a simple majority is all that is required to confirm nominees So who is Reid kidding when he talks about passing a constitutional amendment to limit campaign spending with a two thirds majority of the whole of the house and approval of two thirds of the states Nobody really But Reid still mostly skates by with spouting such inanities because his members and the political press know that its all a gag designed to hurt Republican electoral chances Watch Fox Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel will dive into latest of the Michael Boggs nomination controversy Reid will certainly go down as the Senate leader who broke the old rules of decorum and comity His defenders will say that he had no choice given the obstructionism of Republicans and that his feverish nearconstant denunciations of two billionaire conservative activists Charles and David Koch is a patriotic act But whatever one thinks of the why of Reids antics the how looks pretty darned dim If Reids fellow Democrats are willing to let him hold a succession of show votes on a deadmeat Constitutional amendment even as the basic functions of the upper chamber wither and die he may endure in his gambit After all Reid has shown a willingness to expound on nearly anything and has little regard for the truth in making his allegations and paid little price in the part But Grab your popcorn  Politico The Koch brothers are headed to the big screen  and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid are coming along for the ride The two congressional Democratic leaders will appear at a screening in the Capitol of Koch Brothers Exposed 2014 Edition  a documentary that Senate Majority Leader Reid DNev participated in Not wild about Harry  Senate Democrats might decide as Mark Tapscott argues that the time has come to tell their longtime leader to cool it on the stunts and GOP trolling If Reid continues to go down this path he is liable to become too famous a face for the party And like the other three party leaders on the Hill his face is not a popular one Watch Fox Rep Mike Pompeo RKansas will appear in the 11 am ET hour But is it really all about him  Bloomberg The effort to tie this years Democratic Senate candidates to Reid may have repercussions for Reids bid for a sixth Senate term in two years The shrewd senator said in an interview at the Capitol that he anticipates the Koch brothers will help fund his eventual 2016 Republican opponent Im told theyre going to spend against me he said adding that for now hes just focusing on his job as majority leader Still Reid stressed that hes not taking anything for granted in his race two years from now He said Over the years I do the best I can and realize I only need one more than 50  my elections are normally quite close Youre cool Shel  One prominent friend of Harry Reid conservative megadonor Sheldon Adelson is being recognized for his role in promoting Jewish Values this Sunday at the Champions of Jewish Values International awards gala Delivering the keynote address Gov Chris Christie RNJ who is reportedly sharing a table with fellow potential 2016 contender Gov Rick Perry RTexas Jewish Political News  Updates has the deets JARRETT CLAIMS BOEHNER LYING ABOUT IMMIGRATION VOTE

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/16/wendy-davis-alison-grimes-mess-with-media-and-pay-price/, It may not look that way on the surface But as the midterms head into the home stretch Alison Lundergan Grimes is now running against the media So is Wendy Davis This is not an overt usversusthem situation in either the Kentucky Senate contest or the Texas governors race But the press has these Democratic candidates on the defensive and they in turn are doubling down on big blunders     Maybe this is a warmup for 2016 Hillary Clinton said at a conference the other day that more and more reporters are looking for the best angle the quickest hit and the biggest embarrassment And she argued that journalists spend dramatically less time reporting the real news than 40 or 50 years ago Politico reports And hey in this era of shrinking newsrooms and Twitterdriven traffic Hillary has a point But her viewpoint is also informed by a testy relationship with the media that dates back to her time as first lady Candidates who stumble as Grimes and Davis have in the last week face a stark choice They can admit their mistake make some expression of regret and move onor they can keep digging the hole deeper The problem with refusing to move on is that the media keep hammering away at the original mistake and the pundits pile on turning a one or twoday flap into a weeklong embarrassment Grimes misstep in her race against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was hardly the result of a gotcha question The Louisville Courier Journal editorial board wanted to know whether she voted for Barack Obama and Grimes repeatedly refused to say She stuck to that stance when a media panelist asked Grimes the same question during a debate with McConnell this week Lets get this straight This was a selfinflicted wound notwithstanding her lofty rhetoric about the sanctity of the ballot box Grimes is desperate to avoid being tied to Obama Unless theres another explanationlike she didnt vote at allshe could have said that of course she supported Obama shes a Democrat however shes disappointed in him disagrees on a bunch of issues yadda yadda yadda Nonstory Liberal Washington Post blogger Greg Sargent thinks the media are going too far McConnell campaign operatives tried hard to stoke the impression that this was the defining moment of the evening underscoring the manufactured quality that continues to characterize this story ever since Grimes first declined to answer this question No question Grimes did screw up by pulling an unsightly homina homina homina when she was first confronted with this and its obviously a legitimate question But the media pileon that has followed is unquestionably over the top NBCs Chuck Todd got it all going by claiming she had disqualified herself which the McConnell camp promptly put in an ad which generated more coverage of how devastating this was for Grimes which then primed news outlets to grant outsized attention to this question when it was posed again Todd should have qualified his remark but he did get to the nub of the problem Grimes is asking Kentuckians to give her a vote in the Senate but wont tell them who she voted for in the last two presidential elections Thats not a manufactured issue Sargent also makes this telling point The Grimes campaign has posted videos of newscasts from theCBS affiliate theNBC affiliate and theABC affiliate that dont treat this as headline news at all instead discussing the clash over issues such as the minimum wage jobs and coal So maybe the local media are more interested in the substance of the race than the national pundits Its fair to ask though why the media arent equally obsessive about a McConnell mistake in that debate McConnell a diehard foe of ObamaCare didnt want to diss the states successful health care exchange called Kynect So he said The website can continue but in my view the best interests of the country would be achieved by pulling out Obamacare root and branch Pressed again he said Yeah I think its fine to have a website This is an absolute contradiction As National Journals Ron Fournier says He cant have it both ways Uprooting Obamacare upends Kynect The Kentucky exchange was created with 252 million in federal grants provided through Obamacare A critical aspect of the Affordable Care Actand by extension the Kentucky planis the requirement that Kentucky residents secure health insurance A full repeal of Obamacare would eliminate the grants place a burden on Kentucky to finance the exchange read higher taxes and scuttle the mandate The national media which lionized Wendy Davis when she mounted that abortionrights filibuster have really savaged her over the attack ad against Greg Abbott Here too Davis is refusing to accept the media verdict and insisting she was right to use a wheelchair image in an ad against an opponent who cant walk She kept repeating her talking points in an interview on MSNBC Andrea Mitchell asked Could you have gone after what you see as his hypocrisy by pointing out what he did in that rape case what he did in these other cases without the stark image of the empty wheelchair which seemed to be trying to point people towards his own supposed disability I have no idea why Andrea said supposed as Abbotts spine was crushed by a falling tree three decades ago Even liberals have expressed disgust with Mika Brzezinski saying the commercial made her cringe Here is my ad watch on the Wendy Davis spot which makes clear that Abbott was pursuing his legal philosophy as state attorney general and a state Supreme Court justice rather than crusading against the disabled as a private lawyer One of my pet peeves is that television replays these controversial ads hundreds of times but doesnt examine the substance For instance the ad says Abbott argued a woman whose leg was amputated was not disabled because she had an artificial limb What Abbott said as AG is that people who interviewed the woman for a managerial job didnt know she was an amputeeand a jury later rejected her claim that discrimination was to blame Still Abbotts stringent approach can make him appear insensitive to disabled victims But by failing to acknowledge that the wheelchair image was a mistake Davis has bought herself a weeks worth of negative coverage Maybe thats what she wants because it gets so much play for her attack ad but I dont see how this brings her one step closer to closing the gap and becoming governor Its not that the media are pushing their own agenda in these races Its that journalists and pundits are offended when candidates strike low blows or duck legitimate questions And then it becomes very difficult for the candidate in question to change the story line Click

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/04/22/supreme-court-skeptical-ohio-law-punishing-campaign-lies/,FILE June 20 2013 The US Supreme Court building in Washington DCAP The Supreme Court appears to be highly skeptical of laws that try to police false statements during political campaigns raising doubts about the viability of such laws in more than 15 states Justices expressed those concerns early and often Tuesday during arguments in a case challenging an Ohio law that bars people from recklessly making false statements about candidates seeking elective office     The case has attracted widespread attention with both liberal and conservative groups saying the law tramples on the timehonored if dubious tradition of political mudslinging Critics say free speech demands wideopen debate during political campaigns including protection for negative speech that may sometimes twist the facts The high court is not expected to rule directly on the constitutional issue because the current question before the justices is only a preliminary one Can you challenge the law right away or do you have to wait until the state finds you guilty of lying But the justices couldnt resist going after the law itself pointing out that the mere prospect of being hauled in front of state officials to explain comments made in the heat of an election has a chilling effect on speech Whats the harm Justice Stephen Breyer asked Eric Murphy attorney for the state of Ohio I cant speak thats the harm Justice Anthony Kennedy said theres a serious First Amendment concern with a state law that requires you to come before a commission to justify what you are going to say The case began during the 2010 election when a national antiabortion group the Susan B Anthony List planned to put up billboards accusing thenRep Steve Driehaus of supporting taxpayerfunded abortion because he voted for President Barack Obamas new health care law Driehaus a Democrat who opposes abortion claimed the groups billboard ads distorted the truth and therefore violated the false speech law Driehaus filed a complaint with the Ohio Elections Commission an action which prompted the billboard owner to decline posting the ads The commission found probable cause that the ads violated the law but Driehaus later withdrew his complaint after losing his reelection campaign The Susan B Anthony List then challenged the state law as unconstitutional but a federal judge said the group didnt have the right to sue because it hadnt yet suffered actual harm The 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati agreed Murphy argued that the Susan B Anthony List has not shown a credible threat of harm because the Driehaus case was ultimately dismissed before it was referred to a prosecutor But Justice Elena Kagan wondered why a probable cause determination didnt count as harm For the average voter they think probable cause means you probably lied she said Chief Justice Roberts pointed out that third parties such as TV stations or billboard owners are going to be intimidated by the law preventing a group from getting its message out The slightest whiff of this is going to be legal trouble Roberts said Justice Antonin Scalia said the Susan B Anthony List intends to make the same charges against other Democrats in the next election He said the harm is that the group fears being dragged before the Ministry of Truth for similar proceedings referring to the government propaganda office in George Orwells novel Nineteen EightyFour At one point Murphy reminded the justices that they were not there to debate the merits of the law just the question of standing But Breyer said the merits discussion is meant to suggest that there are real people who would really like to speak in an election campaign And if they feel they cant they are really being hurt Michael Carvin attorney for the Susan B Anthony List suggested that election speech has an extraordinarily short shelf life and a group accused of false speech will never be able to go through the entire process of being accused of a crime and exonerated before the election is over You have this regime which has existed for decades in Ohio where they continue to impose very serious burdens on speakers on what we consider facially unconstitutional law yet it has consistently evaded judicial review precisely because of the short time frames of the election Carvin said More than 500 false statement claims have been brought under the Ohio law between 2001 and 2010 Murphy told the justices Only five cases have been referred to a prosecutor and of those three resulted in plea agreements So you have a system that goes on and on year after year where arguably theres a great chilling of core First Amendment speech and yet youre saying that basically you cant get into federal court Justice Samuel Alito said,2014-04-22T14:21-04:00,abortion

According to the American Cancer Society breast cancer is found in about 1 in every 3000 pregnant women Its also the most common type of cancer found during pregnancy breastfeeding and within the first year of delivery However pregnancy does not cause breast cancer to develop Its simply that women between the ages of 15 and 44 who develop breast cancer are also of reproductive age and are more likely to be pregnant said Dr Michael Pearl professor and director of the division of gynecologic oncology and director of womens cancer services for the Stony Brook University Cancer Center in New York Pregnant women also tend to be diagnosed in later stages than women who are not This is primarily a result of breast changes during pregnancy Pregnant womens breasts are usually larger more tender and feel different than they did prior to pregnancy so women and their doctors may not feel a lump Theres also a concern about exposure to radiation so pregnant women are not usually evaluated as aggressively Whats more providers are often hesitant to order a biopsy or mammography because women are presumed to be young and healthy during pregnancy Pearl said  Chemotherapy is relatively safe
Breast cancer is a very manageable disease even if it has spread said Dr Jane Kakkis medical director of breast surgery at MemorialCare Breast Center at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in Fountain Valley Calif Kakkis performed Leivas mastectomy At one time chemotherapy was thought to increase the risk for miscarriage premature delivery or birth defects Yet after the first trimester research shows that chemotherapy is relatively safe and terminating a pregnancy will not improve a womans prognosis Pearl said  In fact toddlers who were exposed to chemotherapy in utero had the same mental development and heart function as those who were not according to a study presented at the European Society for Medical Oncologys conference in September A second study found that children and adults who were exposed to radiation in utero had no adverse effects Chemotherapy however is not without risks Babies born to moms treated with chemotherapy may be smaller Theyre usually delivered early especially if treatment is deemed to be safer if administered after the baby is born Also if the chemotherapy crosses the placenta it may cause the baby to have a low white blood cell count What are other options
When deciding on a treatment plan its important to consider what impact the treatment could have on the pregnancy and how the pregnancy will affect treatment If the woman does not wish to have a child and the pregnancy could complicate the management of the cancer then she may consider terminating the pregnancy If its a desired pregnancy then we work around that Pearl said There are several treatment options depending on the stage of the cancer how far along the pregnancy is and the womans preferences For example women may opt for a lumpectomy and chemotherapy and then delay radiation until after delivery A mastectomy may not be necessary and reconstruction can always be done after delivery too The least amount of surgery should be done in order to clear the cancer Kakkis said The same goes for a bilateral mastectomy Only the cancer side should be addressed during the pregnancy and the other side should be left alone to minimize the risk of complications she said For women who need radiation a shield and other types of technology can ensure that the treatment is administered precisely Theres still going to be some scatter dose but it should be low enough that it shouldnt have a significant impact on the baby Pearl said Hormone and targeted therapy drugs are never safe during pregnancy Additionally women who are diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer an aggressive form of the diseaseshould be treated immediately because the illness could worsen It takes a village
Experts say women who have breast cancer and become pregnant should always get multiple opinions and make sure they feel confident with the physicians they choose This is a challenging clinical situation and you dont want to deal with a doctor who doesnt do enough breast cancer treatment to know how to negotiate the pathway with a patient Kakkis said If a woman is diagnosed with cancer during pregnancy its crucial for her to be evaluated and managed by a multidisciplinary team Pearl said It isnt just the oncologist  Julie Revelant is a freelance writer and copywriter specializing in parenting health healthcare nutrition food and womens issues Shes also a mom of two Learn more about Julie at revelantwritingcom",2014-10-12T06:00-04:00,abortion

event in Washington Thursday June 19 2014 Some of the Republican Partys most ambitious leaders are courting religious conservatives as evangelical Christians claim new momentum in their fight for the GOPs soul AP PhotoMolly RileyThe Associated Press WASHINGTON  New Jersey Gov Chris Christie is joining the parade of ambitious Republicans courting religious conservatives as the early jockeying for the next presidential contest intensifies Christie was to deliver his first major address to an evangelical conference on Friday the second day of the Faith and Freedom Coalitions annual meeting which brings hundreds of social conservative leaders to Washington Hell be joined on a packed agenda that also includes the GOPs 2012 vice presidential nominee Wisconsin Rep Paul Ryan and tea party firebrand Sen Rand Paul RKy     Each is weighing a 2016 presidential run The appearance comes at a critical time for Christie who is broadening his political outreach as he works to recover from a political retribution scandal in his home state This group of potential presidential contenders largely represents a wing of the Republican Party eager to downplay the GOPs positions on divisive social issues although each of the three opposes gay marriage and abortion rights including funding for Planned Parenthood among other social conservative priorities The day before GOP Sens Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas insisted that Americas leaders must do more to defend Christian values at home and abroad blaming President Barack Obama for attacks on religious freedom as they addressed the conference led by longtime Christian activist Ralph Reed Those of us inspired by JudeoChristian values  have an obligation to our country and to our fellow man to use our positions of influence to highlight those values Rubio said He charged that Obamas policies completely ignore the importance of families and values on our society thinking that instead those things can be replaced by laws and government programs Organizers said more than 1000 evangelical leaders were attending the conference designed to mobilize religious conservative voters ahead of the upcoming midterm elections and the 2016 presidential contest While polls suggest that social conservatives are losing their fight against gay marriage Republican officials across the political spectrum concede that evangelical Christian voters continue to play a critical role in Republican politics You can ignore them but you do so at your own peril said Republican operative Hogan Gidley who has worked for former presidential candidates Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee In the 2012 general election exit polls showed that white evangelical and bornagain Christians made up 26 percent of the electorate The group has far more power in lowerturnout Republican primary elections This weeks conference highlights the balancing act leading Republicans face as they work to bridge internal divisions and improve the Republican Partys image While religious conservatives continue to wield influence in the GOP just last year the Republican National Committee released an exhaustive report calling on Republicans to adopt an inclusive and welcoming tone on divisive social issues There was little talk of abortion or gay marriage on the main stage Thursday Rubio and Cruz largely sidestepped direct mention of lightningrod issues in favor of less controversial themes,2014-06-20T05:40-04:00,abortion

be updated Watch The OReilly Factor weeknights at 8 pm and 11 pm ET     INGRAHAM In the FACTOR Investigation segment tonight terrorists teaching at public universities Now you may remember that Bill Ayers the unrepentant domestic terrorist and onetime friend of President Obama used to teach at the University of Illinois at Chicago BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  Well now THE FACTOR has learned that James Kilgore a convicted terrorist who spent 27 years on the run is working at the University of Illinois UrbanaChampaign Campus Kilgore was a member of the Symbionese Liberation Army the radical group in the 1970s responsible for bank robberies killings and the kidnapping Patty Hearst He was finally captured in South Africa in 2002 and extradited to the United States where he was convicted for the 1975 murder of a California housewife He served six years Now Chris Kennedy the Chairman of the University of Illinois Board of Trustees is pushing for the university to ban Kilgore from working there END VIDEO CLIP  But some professors are actively supporting him citing and I kid you not academic freedom Joining us now from Springfield Illinois Republican State Senator Chapin Rose who has been investigating Kilgores employment at the university Senator first of all if people hear this and I think theyll Youve got to be kidding me CHAPIN ROSE SENATOR ILLINOIS STATE R Yes INGRAHAM Lets say this guy  lets say this guy it turns out was caught praying at an abortion clinic or had given to some propay ph campaign in California the professors would probably be like Get him out of here you know hes far too extremist for us But I guess Symbionese Liberation Army and seconddegree murder thats academic freedom ROSE Laura its just crazy And frankly my constituents  living in a university town theres always something interesting and theres a lot of rolling of the eyes goes on But you know my constituents are beyond angry And the fact is the state always got all kinds of budget problems And it turns out that theres apparently money for this And I just  you know you learn these things you read about them and you go There they go again Absolutely amazing INGRAHAM Well whats the recourse here for the citizens in your district I bet if you took a poll on this right thered probably be  LAUGHTER ROSE Right INGRAHAM  overwhelming support for what youre trying to do But the university has its own charter although taxpayer money obviously goes to the university But they have their own  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP   charter and their own rules for hiring and firing do they not ROSE Yes sure they do But you know what this is a public institution its a lingering institution The state of Illinois spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year  END VIDEO CLIP   in taxpayer dollars on this institution And the tuition payers quite frankly have fair value issues here You know the guy has a PhD in African Studies which was issued in frankly an assumed name  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP   you know

Im happy about that But I mean is he not allowed to work And if theres no rule against  ROSE Of course INGRAHAM  hiring someone whos served time as a seconddegree murdered then what are you really  END VIDEO CLIP   going to accomplish here ROSE Yes so first of all sure absolutely hes entitled to live his life and he had served his time But again theres absolutely no  you know we dont have to put him on the payroll We certainly dont have to put him on the payroll to teach art BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  I mean thats absolutely you know ridiculous One of the emails Ive found even from him was he even questioned the fact that hes not qualified to teach art Yet there he is But look the reality is this You know what is someone with these types of convictions  END VIDEO CLIP   doing you know as a janitor of U of I let alone you know a professor I mean this makes no sense And one of the things and one of the questions Ive had for them is so if  take James Kilgore out of this equation for a

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/05/13/guns-and-supreme-court-is-second-amendment-privilege-not-right/,The United States Supreme CourtLibrary of Congress The Supreme Court unwisely declined to review Drake v Jerejian last week a case that challenged New Jerseys discretionary system of concealedcarry permitting By denying review the Court failed to resolve a nationwide split about the meaning of the Second Amendment     Eventually the Court will have to face the issue and decide if it was serious when it held that the Second Amendment protects an individuals right to keep and bear arms In 2008 in the landmark case of DC v Heller the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment protects the individual right to keep and bear arms Later in 2010s McDonald v Chicago the Court held that the Second Amendment protects citizens from not just federal prohibitions as Heller said but also from state and municipal prohibitions Since that time the Court has not heard another Second Amendment case Both Heller and McDonald made it clear that the government cannot ban or effectively ban guns but lower courts are still struggling to define what restrictions are allowed under those rulings The Supreme Court needs to clear up the uncertainty Gun controllers in cities and states across the country are taking advantage of that uncertainty to test the limits of gun control After McDonald struck down Chicagos de facto gun ban the city created a restrictive permit system requiring one hour of range training But the city also banned gun ranges The Seventh Circuit struck down the ban on ranges More recently a judge struck down Chicagos ban on virtually all sales and transfers within the city because the Second Amendment right must also include the right to acquire a firearm The current situation is similar to the politics of abortion Roe ruled that a complete prohibition on abortion is unconstitutional while allowing certain restrictions and Heller ruled similarly on the Second Amendment After Roe Prolifer supporters immediately began enacting barriers to abortion seeing what would stick Subsequent guidance from the Court however cleared up the constitutional rules surrounding abortion The Second Amendment is sorely in need of similar guidance from the Court Drake gave them that opportunity In 2012 in another case from Illinois the Seventh Circuit struck down the states complete prohibition on carrying firearms The Second Amendment after all protects the right to keep and bear arms A total ban is not OK said the court but what restrictions are allowed is still an open question All states now allow some form of concealed carry but many states particularly those in the Northeast only do so through a system of discretionary permitting that converts the right to keep and bear arms into a privilege granted by government bureaucrats In those may issue states citizens not only have to demonstrate that they meet all the objective criteria they also have to convince the local sheriff or another bureaucrat that they really need a concealed carry permit In Drake the Third Circuit upheld New Jerseys discretionary permitting system that is so restrictive that it only grants 002 percent of licenses Imagine you wanted to throw a May Day rally to commemorate International Workers Day When filling out the permit forms concerning restrictions on noise cleanup and time you see that youre also required to demonstrate a justifiable need for your rally In other words government bureaucrats get to decide in their discretion if your May Day rally is important enough to grant the permit Now imagine they only grant 002 percent of those rally permits This would be a clear First Amendment violation In fact allowing any bureaucratic discretion would violate the First Amendment Generally where constitutional rights are concerned giving bureaucrats too much discretion is a bad idea Weshouldnt allow cruel and unusual punishments when some sheriff thinks it is really good idea And we definitely shouldnt let county administrators decide whether you have enough free exercise of religion But that is essentially what the Supreme Court is allowing in Drake by declining to review Consequently more judges and lawmakers across the country will disregard the Courts decision in Heller simply because they dont like guns Until the Court steps in with guidance the Second Amendment will continue to be treated by many judges as a privilege rather than a right  Trevor Burrus is a Research Fellow at the Cato Institutes Center for Constitutional Studies  FollowFoxNewsOpinion on Facebook,2014-05-13T07:00-04:00,abortion

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/08/03/what-every-woman-should-know-about-placenta-previa/," It didnt hit me that this could potentially be problematic Courtney Nowak of Staten Island NY remembers thinking She had just had a routine sonogram at 13 weeks and her doctor had drawn her a picture to show her that her placenta wasnt where it should be it was now covering her cervix She told Nowak that the condition placenta previa was common it was nothing to worry about As the pregnancy progressed the placenta could move she assured her Nevertheless Nowak was told to avoid heavy lifting vigorous exercise and sexual intercourse And if she had any bleeding or pain she had to call her doctor immediately     After researching the condition Nowak became a little nervous especially since she was over 35 and already considered highrisk I was aware that things could happen she said Fortunately at her 30week sonogram Nowak and her husband found out her placenta had moved And five months ago Nowak gave birth to a healthy baby girl What is placenta previa
One out of 200 pregnancies are affected by placenta previa a condition in which the placenta covers part or all of the opening of the cervix  according to Dr James Bernasko an OBGYN in the division of maternalfetal medicine at Stony Brook University Hospital in New York When you have a placenta thats lying over the cervix or very close to the cervix when labor begins it can cause a lot of bleeding and that endangers the health and sometimes the life of the fetus and the mother he said Whats more a recent study in the journal Obstetrics  Gynecology found that women with placenta previa who had previous births had a twofold increased chance of delivering a low birth weight baby  Experts arent sure why placenta previa occurs although one theory is that upon implantation the embryo tries to go to a part of the uterus where it thinks it will get the most nourishment For example if there is a scar in the uterus or the blood supply isnt optimal the embryo will implant somewhere else Sometimes that somewhere else may be close to the cervix Bernasko said  Risk factors for placenta previa include  Smoking before pregnancy or during
 Maternal age over 40
 Abnormally shaped uterus
 Several previous pregnancies
 African American or Asian American race
 Cocaine use
 Previous pregnancy with placenta previa
 One or more previous cesarean sections
 Uterine surgery or abortion Placenta previa is usually diagnosed at the 20week sonogram and since many women can have a silent placenta previa one without any bleeding women should have regular sonograms Bernasko said The good news is that the placenta usually moves upward as the pregnancy progresses and about 90 percent of placenta previa cases will resolve by the time the woman is full term In women who have no bleeding some providers will say its not necessary to make any changes Other doctors may advise women avoid strenuous activity exercise and sexual intercourse or order bed rest The recommendations that providers give vary considerably Bernasko said If you have bleeding your provider will likely put you on bed rest If the bleeding stops you may either have to restrict your activity or be on bed rest at home or in the hospital depending on how heavy the bleeding was If your pregnancy is at 37 weeks or more and you have very heavy bleeding your provider will recommend a Csection If its earlier than 37 weeks and the bleeding is lifethreatening to you or your baby a Csection is necessary as well However most providers will recommend a Csection at 37 weeks and would prefer that you dont wait until your due date to do so as you get closer youre more likely to go into labor on your own which could turn into an emergency It may be a bit of cautious recommendation but its only because we dont know exactly when the womans going to go into labor Bernasko said  Julie Revelant is a freelance writer and copywriter specializing in parenting health healthcare nutrition food and womens issues Shes also a mom of two Learn more about Julie at revelantwritingcom",2014-08-03T06:00-04:00,abortion

justasheated battle is being waged in a number of states over guns abortion booze marijuana  even bears Ballot initiatives often are the sidebar story of any election but for some voters the debate this year over yes or no on a range of ballot questions has been the marquee issue drawing millions of dollars to each side and in some cases forcing candidates running in those states to take a position     One of the highestprofile battles again is over weed After Colorado and Washington became the first states to effectively legalize  and regulate  nonmedical marijuana in the last election the propot movement is trying to expand the legal weed map next week Unlike several past elections gay marriage is not on the ballot this year But other social and economic hot buttons including the minimum wage are According to electiontracker Ballotpedia voters are weighing in on 153 ballot measures on Election Day Marijuana bans up in smoke Two years ago voters in Colorado and Washington legalized recreational pot statewide and the federal government largely has stayed out of their business On Nov 4 Oregon which voted down such a measure in 2012 Alaska and the District of Columbia will ask voters whether they too want to join the marijuana legalization experiment Promarijuana voices like Morgan Fox at the Marijuana Policy Project say the prospects for legalization are looking good Polls have shown voters in Oregon and DC largely support the measures though voters views toward legalizing weed in Alaska are still a bit hazy Florida with its huge senior community also has a question on the ballot on legalizing medical marijuana They all seem like they are pretty close except for DC which has overwhelming support Fox said But I think they all stand a very good chance of passing Last week Sen Jeff Merkley DOre became the first US senator to support marijuana legalization for his state Drug Policy Action which has received major funding from billionaire currency trader George Soros contributed 500000 to the Yes on 91 campaign in Oregon Washington DCbased New Approach PAC tied to the family of the late billionaire Peter Lewis gave 300000 to the effort Big money plays a huge role in the yes campaign said Kevin Sabet legalization opponent and cofounder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana SAM You have millions of dollars poured in to the yes side and on the no side you just have a lot of volunteers from citizens and groups that dont traditionally have a lot of money They are trying to manipulate from the outside End of the dry spell There arent many places that still ban alcohol though 10 states including Arkansas still have areas that do A ballot initiative that would legalize booze statewide is pitting big fundraising guns at WalMart which wants to want to end prohibition against the liquor dealers who want to keep it It promises to be a big draw on Nov 4 According to local reports 37 out of Arkansas 75 counties prohibit the sale and purchase of alcohol Business interests like WalMart want to be able to sell beer and wine over the counter everywhere in Arkansas Liquor dealers who operate shops just outside dry counties have lined up to defeat the measure known as Issue 4 An October poll by Talk Business  Politics found that 54 percent of voters opposed lifting prohibition statewide Dueling gun measures Following the elementary school shooting massacre at Sandy Hook and other highprofile tragedies involving firearms gun control advocates have been pouring cash into legislative efforts as well as ballot initiatives Washington state has two dueling gun measures at the ballot box on Nov 4 If both win it likely will tie up the issue in court Initiative 594 calls for a comprehensive tightening of the states background check policies  requiring background checks for virtually all purchases including online and gunshow sales Opponents including the National Rifle Association NRA have been vastly outspent as the campaign heads into the last week According to a report in September the proI594 funders including former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg and Bill and Melinda Gates have given 75 million toward its passage Competing measure I591 is supported by gun rights advocates and would do the opposite by barring the state from enacting its own backgroundcheck laws deferring to the federal government on that front It also would prohibit government agencies from seizing guns without due process Dont feed the bears A ballot initiative drawing major national attention in Maine would restrict the way residents can hunt for bears Right now hunters can use a range of tactics to kill their quarry  from trapping and chasing them down with dogs to baiting them with sweets like jelly doughnuts All three methods would be banned if Question 1 passes Maine hunters would have to stalk and shoot bears the oldfashioned way which is more humane proponents say Critics say it would balloon Maines bear population Both sides have spent some 16 million on TV ads to persuade the public Abortion Three state measures would challenge some abortions In Colorado voters will decide whether to amend the state constitution to define the fetus as a person under the criminal code In North Dakota voters weigh the question of whether the state constitution should protect the rights of the unborn In Tennessee a measure would make it easier for the state to pass restrictions on abortion Drugtesting docs and malpractice In California voters will decide whether to require doctors to submit to drugtesting the first such policy in the country Proposition 46 also would raise the cap on painandsuffering awards Proponents say it would be a win for patients while critics say it all amounts to a grab by tort lawyers Sentencing reform Prison overcrowded California is weighing Prop 47 which would dramatically change how the state treats certain nonserious nonviolent drug and property crimes by downgrading them from felonies to misdemeanors The measure also would allow those currently serving time for such offenses to apply for a reduced sentence as long as they have no prior convictions for more serious crimes like murder attempted murder or sexual offenses Minimum wage Several states are asking voters to decide minimum wage increases A South Dakota measure would hike the rate from 725 an hour to 850 An Alaska measure would raise it from 775 an hour to over two years 975 Arkansas and Nebraska also have similar measures on the ballot Illinois is asking voters about the minimum wage but the result is nonbinding,2014-10-27T07:48-04:00,abortion

contraception legislation is the latest example of Democrats winbylosing strategy which forces Republicans to vote on sensitive matters that might rile women this fall  AP PhotoJ Scott Applewhite FileThe Associated Press WASHINGTON  Democrats and Republicans are fervently pursuing a batch of doomed bills in Congress because they target a coveted prize in the Nov 4 elections female voters Wednesdays Senate vote on contraception legislation is the latest example of Democrats winbylosing strategy which forces Republicans to vote on sensitive matters that might rile women this fall     Recent votes on pay equity and family leave issues were similarly aimed at women who are increasingly crucial to Democrats election hopes and therefore worrisome to Republicans Any shift in womens typical turnout or Democratic tilt this fall could determine tight elections especially for the Senate Republicans need to gain six Senate seats to control the chamber and these womens issues are especially lively in the most contested states including Colorado North Carolina Arkansas and Louisiana Both parties must cater to their ideological bases in this midterm election year even as they woo women who dont always vote Nearly all Republicans are opposing measures that appear likely to expand abortion access place new requirements on employers or limit religious conservatives rights And Democrats overwhelmingly support abortion access worker benefits and equal treatment of women in the workplace Still Democrats approached this weeks birth control debate with different tactics depending on whether they were seeking reelection in a GOPleaning state or in a 5050 or Democraticleaning state Democrats knew Republicans would block their bill to counter the Supreme Courts ruling involving the Hobby Lobby arts and crafts company The court said employers may exclude birth control products from their health insurance plans if the products violate the employers religious faith Many Democratic and womens groups objected No women should require a permission slip from their boss for affordable contraceptives that otherwise would be covered Sen Patty Murray DWash said Two Democrats who strongly campaigned against the court ruling are seeking reelection in states that President Barack Obama carried at least once thanks in part to strong backing from women Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mark Udall of Colorado Minutes after all but three of the Senates 45 Republicans voted to block the Democrats Not My Boss Business bill Udall said his party will continue to contest a ruling that says a boss beliefs can supersede a womans rights to health care benefits that she has earned GOP leaders defended themselves in floor speeches press releases TV interviews newspaper opeds and news conferences Sen Kelly Ayotte RNH said Democrats were misleading women by suggesting a Hobby Lobby employee could not buy birth control products even with her own money No employer can interfere with a woman employees access to contraception Ayotte said Republicans promised to push legislation guaranteeing such access Democrats laughed at the GOPs idea of guaranteeing people something they already have The court ruling Hagan said just shifts the additional cost back to women who have employersubsidized insurance from companies like Hobby Lobby And that could affect access to birth control for lowincome women she said Other Democratic senators in tough reelection races were more cautious Sens Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana were among the few Democrats who did not cosponsor their partys bill Pryor has said he understands the deeply held religious views of those who brought the Hobby Lobby lawsuit but he disagrees with the courts ruling Sen Jeff Merkley DOre enthusiastically backed the bill His GOP challenger Monica Wehby is treading more lightly in a state Obama won by 13 percentage points The courts ruling was very limited in scope Wehby told reporters at the time As long as women have access to contraception through a third party then I think we have to respect everyones beliefs as much as possible Recent elections explain the two parties fixation on female voters Women have outvoted men in every federal election since 1982 reaching 54 percent of the total in 2004 and 53 percent in 2012 Female voters preferred Democrats by 11 percentage points in 2012 while men favored Republicans by 8 percentage points Single women greatly preferred Obama over Republican Mitt Romney 67 percent to 31 percent They backed Obama over John McCain in 2008 by an even bigger margin The voting rate among women and especially single women usually drops more than male voting in nonpresidential elections So Democrats are seeking ways to inspire women to vote this fall They pushed a pay equity bill that Senate Republicans blocked in April It would have made it easier for workers to compare salaries and require employers to explain pay disparities Republicans try to turn the tables by pushing their own doomed initiatives pitched as prowomen Female GOP senators say they want legislation to reinforce existing laws against workplace inequities Those efforts have about as much chance of passage in the Democraticcontrolled Senate as the dozens of failed Republican bids to overturn the presidents health care law which Republicans portray as harmful to women Obamacare has caused countless women to lose the health care plans they had and liked Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy said in a Senate floor speech this week His Democratic opponent Alison Lundergan Grimes embraced her partys Hobby Lobby position albeit in gentle careful tones I support the right of all American women to have full access to contraception and respect the exemption of churches from providing this service Grimes said in a statement The Supreme Court she said got it wrong regarding corporations ___ Associated Press Director of Polling

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/07/09/democrats-urge-president-visit-border-confront-crisis/,This is a rush transcript from The Five July 8 2014 This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated DANA PERINO COHOST Hello everyone Im Dana Perino along with Andrea Tantaros Juan Williams Eric Bolling and Greg Gutfeld who has a hangnail     Its 5 oclock in New York City and this is The Five MUSIC PERINO The crisis surrounding the flood of unaccompanied illegal immigrants at the USMexico border is intensifying by the day President Obama will travel to Texas tomorrow but will not be visiting the actual border His twoday trip includes fundraisers and a meeting now with state and local leaders thats 500 miles away in Dallas That meeting will now include Republican Governor Rick Perry While the meeting might be a first step two Democrats representing border districts say the president should pay a visit to their constituents BEGIN VIDEO CLIP REP RAUL GRIJALVA D ARIZONA I think a visit by the president is reaffirming that the border lands are vital and important I think a visit would be important and very symbolic REP HENRY CUELLAR D TEXAS Im sure that President Bush thought the same thing that he could just look at everything from up in the sky and that he owned it for a long time I hope this doesnt become the Katrina moment for President Obama saying that he doesnt need to come to the border He should come down This did not happen overnight END VIDEO CLIP PERINO Earlier today White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest addressed the president and the calls for him to visit the border BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JOSH EARNEST WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY The president is well aware of exactly whats happening on the border and what we are focused on right now are not political statements that would be made with an appearance but rather with specific concrete action END VIDEO CLIP PERINO OK Juan let me start with you because what  I think where they ended up is not a bad place but the last several days for the White House has not been very pretty politically and I think thats two Democrats were trying to give some helpful suggestions maybe to push the White House publicly into trying to do the right thing Its a half measure to do the meeting in Dallas but perhaps better than nothing JUAN WILLIAMS COHOST Well again it comes down to optics and how it looks and I think the president is in a box here I really do think hes hurting politically because on the one hand you have people in the immigrant community who are saying hey why are you trying to push these kids out Why are you not giving them you know a fair hearing in the courts according to the previous US law from 2008 Those kids are entitled to a deportation hearing And so Obama is saying no in fact hes saying maybe you just have the border patrol look at these kids and make a quick decision as to whether or not they should ship out and send back to El Salvador Honduras Nicaragua or wherever PERINO It is pretty incredible to me that today The New York Times writes an article that basically blames George W Bush for this because there was a law that was signed in 2008 Andrea that was unanimous except for two Republicans who decided not to vote for it and it had to deal with preventing child sex trafficking George W Bush was against it was against child sex trafficking I mean what a monster And now they are trying to tie his actions in 2008 to this problem that now at the border six years later is something that the Obama administration  I assume that they are also against child sex trafficking	 but for six years they dont know this is going to be a problem I just find it amazing that they will try to tie anything back to President George W Bush and not take responsibility for this ANDREA TANTAROS COHOST Its incredible I can tell you firsthand when I worked on the hill when George Bush was in office we championed numerous pieces of legislation against child sex trafficking because President Bush pushed us to do so So thats actually not true You cant tie this to President Bush Its not surprising theyre going to do this In the words of Dianne Feinstein Democratic senator in his own party she puts it back on the White House and says look President Obama you have the ability through your executive power that you love to use at every turn to get this process moving in a quick and order 	 quick and orderly fashion My question is Dana one how can Congress ignore this They cant	But my question is if he takes to the courts will he respect the courts decision on this OK Number one President Obama has not respected the courts decision on a number of rulings including most recently Hobby Lobby Harry Reid says were done were going to fight this battle out	So he doesnt respect the decisions of the courts And also if it does go to the courts dont you need these kids	parents to come get them if the courts do rule that they have to leave If the parents come to this country then I ask this are they going to let the whole family stay and then we have an even bigger issue on our hands The real problem too Dana is it looks bad now but its going to look even worse when there is something truly terrible that happens someone gets murdered raped killed this becomes a national story and President Obama hasnt done anything about it PERINO As a stopgap measure another thing that the president can do Eric is he can ask Congress for additional funds to try to manage the crisis and today he asked for  youre going to run down the numbers for us 37 billion ERIC BOLLING COHOST And he also called it an emergency It was an emergency Well this has been brewing for a long time so Im not sure how this becomes the emergency Yes 37 billion Ill throw out a couple  some of them  let me just read a couple of them 116 million to pay for transportation costs associated with transporting the kids from where they show up to where theyre going to end up being 354 million to pay for operational costs of responding to significant rise in apprehensions 45 million to hire about 40 additional judges  45 million for judge teams 15 million to provide legal representation to the kids who show  were paying for their legal defense And this is the one that really is going to get you 295 million for support efforts to repatriate and integrate the people who come here So they break the law they come over here we spend 300 million to send them back in addition to the half a billion dollars thats already appropriated to doing this type of thing to central America alone I mean its absolutely insane If anything there should be a vote on whether or not this is truly an emergency and let them decide  WILLIAMS What would you do Eric BOLLING Send them back Juan WILLIAMS Yes thats what it says Send them back BOLLING No no no PERINO And send the bill to them BOLLING An even better idea if you want to spend 4 billion spend it closing the border WILLIAMS Well let me just say you understand these people are not running across the border right You understand theyre running to border agents and under the law  BOLLING Right and theyre being overwhelmed at the border crossing WILLIAMS Yes but you understand thats our law BOLLING I do understand how illegal immigration works CROSSTALK WILLIAMS This is not a matter  this is a matter once they get into the country you couldnt be more right Once they get in the country if they dont show up for the deportation hearing that is illegal immigration BOLLING Theres 37 billion asked for and theyre going to spend about 50 billion or 60 billion  million of 37 billion AUDIO GAP	That is insane PERINO Let me get Greg in here You can comment on anything you want but I will throw out a possible question for you GREG GUTFELD COHOST OK PERINO One of the things President Obama has a hard time with in the polls of late is that trend line of the president understands the problems of people like me GUTFELD Right PERINO So to me I dont understand why he wouldnt try to at least go down and show some empathy because travel opens the mind And he could	 that could actually work in both ways for Republicans and Democrats people that support the immigrants being here and people that want to send them back At least if he went he would be seeing something GUTFELD Yes but its hard for him to defend something that he actually doesnt like I dont think he particularly likes the idea of borders Essentially America to him is a boring party and he wants to have more people here because he really doesnt like this place You know people talk about the pull factors These are the things that encourage people to come to this country We heard about the horrible crime down south But really whats causing people to come here is an attractive economy and lack of enforcement of our laws But what also helps I think encourage people to come here is the media in the sense just simply by replacing illegal with undocumented which is a message to them that we are pushovers Out of a cowardly fear of racism we have allowed language to trump the law The media is in the same boat with President Obama about amnesty They believe a border is bigotry The media is Obamas Victorias Secret pushup bra always there to make nothing look like something He has no policy He doesnt know what hes doing But the media endorses that world view So he never has to face the outrage The guy said that this is his Hurricane Katrina Hes had seven Katrinas Hes hurricane Latrina now that the country is in the toilet	We need FEMA to put a tape around him theres so much destruction BOLLING Can I just add One of the youre right the pull factors I think one of the biggest pull factor is when these people are sending their kids and they dont see the kids coming back they say hey its OK to stay Its OK to send them PERINO The ultimate pull factor  BOLLING You send them back and you close that pull factor PERINO I think the ultimate pull factor is I think its the economy but it is still the American dream Its the safety net If my kids get there  I can understand a mom OK mom and dad they make a decision a really tough one to send their kid to say as long as they could step one toe in America they might have a chance at having a better life than here TANTAROS But its not  but its not everyone that believes that	I would love to be optimistic to think that everyone who is trying to cross the borders wants to have the American dream wants to come here and work but its the American dream  a lot of them under President Obamas definition  and that is come to this country and become a dependent	Its just the reality Theyre not going to be all likeminded Now the president has said you know these arent dangerous his administration said theyre not dangerous We dont know that We have no idea whether theyre dangerous WILLIAMS Andrea do you realize hes talking about drug dealers drug cartels kidnappers thieves and murderers TANTAROS To that point Juan The Associated Press has reported the drug cartels have already flooded across the borders and infiltrated every major city  WILLIAMS Thats not these children TANTATOR Let me finish Theyve been doing this for a long time OK Number two the reason Dana that the president cant address this crisis and Josh Earnest cant be earnest with us about the crisis is because January 28th 2013 Jay Carney stood at the podium and said quote The border has never been better enforced than it is now Our borders are more secure than they have ever been in history and the president has demonstrated significant leadership on this issue WILLIAMS And whats wrong  CROSSTALK BOLLING All of it Whats right about it TANTAROS Its not true Theres not one accurate  CROSSTALK WILLIAMS Hang on hang on Net migration is a negative and people have blamed it on the fact that the Mexican economy has been doing better and our economy is doing worse so who wants to come These kids arent coming from Mexico Eric Theyre coming from Central America from the place thats the most dangerous highest murder rate in the world Let me just  BOLLING Juan Juan  CROSSTALK WILLIAMS You know what Republicans had a chance in the House to pass a real immigration plan with huge border security It was passed on a bipartisan basis by Republicans and Democrats in the United States Senate	Guess what House Republicans said were not interested GUTFELD Yes because there were other things involved in that bill	We know that TANTAROS Exactly WILLIAMS Like what What do you say Whats your big objection GUTFELD Well there were some things that had to do with amnesty and making it much easier for people to get in here rather than stand in line WILLIAMS No what it had to do with was we have 12 million along us and its the status quo now we havent passed any form of  TANTAROS Juan are you really going to stand behind that immigration bill that funneled money to La Raza to register illegal residents to the Democratic Party WILLIAMS To register illegal immigrants oh my God TANTAROS What about the fact they could break three crimes and still be eligible for amnesty in this country and that they didnt have to get to the back of the line All of these things in that bill I dont care what  WILLIAMS Theres a real serious argument  CROSSTALK TANTAROS It was a huge push for dependency and growing this government WILLIAMS Dana hits on something Its a real serious issue We have a crisis at the border The president is not looking good But America we need to deal with this issue and this kind of attacking children I just dont see it GUTFELD Juan Juan Juan everybody here is for legal immigration	For just a line we all just want a line Border is our container	Without it we dont have a country Using children as basically a prop in order to get families in thats what question object to and it really does  its kind of offensive to say oh you dont like children Its accurate with me but I dont know of everybody else The fact is using children as basically  as a way to climb in is not the way to go BOLLING And you yourself point out OK its not necessarily only Mexicans coming right WILLIAMS No its mostly Central Americans BOLLING Shouldnt we take the children of all the other countries around the world who have heartache at home who have tough economies who have dangerous cities and towns should we just take all then as well Let them just come through the border The same thing GUTFELD Im bringing all of my kids to your house to swim in your pool when youre not around WILLIAMS Thats not the same thing Remember this is  this started basically last October It peaked in May Were talking about something that is urgent and immediate PERINO But no if it started last October then how is it an emergency today WILLIAMS The numbers  the numbers grew PERINO I know But they had some sort of warning They had nothing in place The border patrol is trying  is doing their best but they dont have the reinforcements that they need So now the president has an emergency Did they learn about it  CROSSTALK TANTAROS The argument that you used Juan  Andrea youre attacking children that is a line  I didnt hear me attack any kids WILLIAMS You said those kids are not little kids who are not innocent TANTAROS What I want to do is protect the American citizens that are here now that are tax paying and worry about them first WILLIAMS Im all for that but let me tell you  TANTAROS That is what my priority is and keep Americans safe WILLIAMS I want to protect  TANTAROS Not attack children WILLIAMS The American  TANTAROS Youre using kids Juan Youre using children WILLIAMS Im not using kids TANTAROS Yes you are WILLIAMS Im saying those kids are deserving of the American opportunity PERINO Well I got to tell you  GUTFELD Im deserving of the Mexican opportunity WILLIAMS Then go my son go LAUGHTER PERINO The commercial break is going to be outstanding and we will let you know how it goes But I got to run Directly ahead Hillary Clinton speaks for the first time about the controversy surrounding her defense of an accused child rapist early in her legal career But does her explanation raise more questions about her actions Details next on The Five COMMERCIAL BREAK BOLLING Remember when we told about Hillary Clinton chuckling about her child  getting her child rapist client off easy BEGIN AUDIO CLIP HILLARY CLINTON A prosecutor called me a few years ago said that he had a guy who had been accused of rape and the guy wanted a woman lawyer ROY REED Mmh why CLINTON Would do it as a favor to him Do you remember that case where I represented that guy That was  it was a fascinating case a really interesting case This guy was accused of raping a 12yearold Of course he claimed that he didnt all this stuff He took a lie detector test I had him take a polygraph which he passed which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs LAUGHTER END AUDIO CLIP BOLLING Well theres an old saying in politics PR life whatever when youre digging yourself into a ditch just stop digging That said this weekend Hillary Clinton chose to keep digging the I laughed about a getting a guy who raped the 12yearold girl off of the few weeks time served ditch by attempting to rationalize her actions BEGIN VIDEO CLIP CLINTON I was appointed by the local judge to represent a criminal defendant accused of rape I asked to be relieved of that responsibility but I was not and I had a professional duty to represent my client to the best of my ability which I did By the very nature of criminal law there will be those who you represent who you dont approve of but at least in our system you have an obligation and once I was appointed I fulfilled that obligation END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Madam Secretary the question wasnt whether you were lawyering up a child rapist The question we have I have is about your tone deaf mute and blind guiltfree no remorse laughing about it Ands look she was a defense attorney  we get thats what defense attorneys do We get that But it was the chuckling the laughing ha ha I got him off for the few weeks TANTAROS Yes So the accused have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel but theres no constitutional requirement that lawyers think that rape is funny when theyre trying the case It doesnt mean that every time that you win in court Hillary you get to sit around and have a belly chuckle These are things that are going to come back and haunt her Now the media is not going to talk about this but this is her on tape in one of the most serious and sensitive instances trying to even if she didnt agree with it trying to do her job It was her job to do this case She didnt have to sit there and bust a gut in such a I think terrible moment of timing but she will have to talk about this because this is who Hillary Clinton is BOLLING Dana this ship sailed a couple weeks ago She decided to bring it back up over the weekend Is that illadvised PERINO Well I cant  I believe that she was probably asked about it I dont think that she necessarily volunteered it and then she decided she would answer it so thats the way  although reading in commentary magazine today just looking at some of the somewhat inconsistent explanations as to whether she was appointed or whether she actively tried to be on the case but regardless you do  maybe  lets just say give her the benefit of the doubt and say you didnt have a choice you had to take the case You do have a choice of how you talk about it later And she  we are all the product of everything weve ever done	Shes going to have to answer that Interesting to me that this didnt come up in 2008 because during that primary campaign with President Obama that was very  it was vicious and they threw a lot of things at one another Im surprised this one didnt come up BOLLING Greg it seems like almost weekly now since she decided to kick off that book tour were finding more and more stuff I got to assume the trail doesnt end here GUTFELD Yes Shes like a ma not news machine of groaning gas	But look she was only defending a child rapist It wasnt a Koch brother so its OK She was just doing her job which you know means impugning the credibility of a rape victim They all do that And its OK if youre a feminist I feel this would be a bigger story if it was Chris Christie doing this it would be all over the place or Mitt Romney Remember when Mitt Romney put his dog on the car oh that was awful wasnt it Its much worse than defending a child rapist And Im chuckling over that BOLLING Yes GUTFELD No thats the hilarity of this is that shes going to get away with it because she does But the thing is it should provide no joy to the Republicans because they have to find an actual candidate to beat her and they havent so she will be president They can laugh about this but shell still be there BOLLING But you know what Juan four months ago three months ago she looked almost like she was unbeatable WILLIAMS Yes BOLLING Now there are a lot of little breaks little chinks in that armor WILLIAMS Well I must say I think that the Republican Party is doing a good job early on of trying to find any and everything they can  BOLLING Thats not substantial WILLIAMS That  I think most people have been through this As weve said at this table its a lawyers job CROSSTALK PERINO The thing that bothered  the thing that tripped her up the most wasnt something a Republican operative came up with It was a question from Diane Sawyer about how she felt about the vast wealth that she and Bill Clinton have now compared to  WILLIAMS Yes exactly Not this one PERINO  the message about income inequality But that was the one that started it off poorly It wasnt a Republican operatives you know handiwork WILLIAMS Oh no but I think there have been a bunch Dana I mean everything from she was helping her husband when he was having  PERINO Well they might be able to help her along but Hillary Clinton has done herself no favors WILLIAMS No I think its been a rocky tour Let me just say that	I dont think  I think if you look at her right now youd look at the poll numbers You see them declining Obviously as Greg said shes still the titan on the field BOLLING Can we do this then So that came up that reemerged over the weekend but this also emerged over the weekend Hillary Clinton giving some props to French Marxist Thomas Piketty Clinton says I think he makes a very strong case that we have unbalanced our economy too much towards favoring capital and away from labor And Spiegel says Piketty argues that the growing gap between the rich and the poor is threatening democracy Clinton says I do agree with that All right Quick around the table we dont have a lot of time	Around the table this isnt helping her either Income inequality issue and she sides with a known Marxist TANTAROS Yes and she wrote her paper in college about Saul Alinsky	Hillary Clinton is not Bill She is from the President Obama wing of the party Shes from the progressive wing of the party That is who she really is So to the last point who Hillary Clinton really is laughing about getting a murder charge taken down from manslaughter Shes a progressive	Shes a dyed in the wool  I dont know if shed move to the middle and take her husbands advice when she becomes president But Im wondering Dana if the reason President Obama didnt bring it up is because he didnt want to contrast his record as a lawyer with her record as a lawyer because he doesnt have a record as a lawyer PERINO The article  an article about it did run in Newsday but the author said it was given a wash by the editors to protect her I would just say the best piece about Pikettys book is by Jonah Goldberg It was a cover story in Commentary Magazine So look you just have  dont read Pikettys book Its so long Read Jonah Goldbergs piece about it and basically it says he makes a shady case with bad facts and he gets to the point that he says  I dont  well here is the bottom line If I were Hillary Clinton I wouldnt necessarily hitch my wagon to that star BOLLING Absolutely Thoughts on Hillary Clinton and Piketty GUTFELD Well Spinal Tap had a better tour than her The idea that inequality is a threat it shows you that progressives tend to choose solutions that are always far worse than the threat they attempt to cure	In this case what would be the solution to inequality  capping salaries forcing businesses to jack up wages and then no longer hiring Weve seen when that happens WILLIAMS But you must admit that income inequality is a huge political issue in the country  CROSSTALK GUTFELD Its been made a that way PERINO However can I make a point because I missed yesterday GUTFELD Yes PERINO On Saturday there was an article in Politico and a couple of other places where the Democrats are trying to do a communications pivot away from income inequality because they are desperate to protect their red state Democrats in November So now the president is like a president without a message He cant bring up income inequality anymore WILLIAMS When you see the argument over the Federal Highway Trust Fund and other things that argument  PERINO I agree but the Democrats are walking away from it TANTAROS That goes over with the regular voters  BOLLING Theyre yelling Porter is yelling at me and say lets go bro Coming up outrage erupts after The New York Times publishes this fullpage ad from the proatheist group slamming the Catholic Church and its members on the Supreme Court for the Hobby Lobby ruling The latest on the uproar when we return COMMERCIAL BREAK TANTAROS The New York Times is under fire for publishing a controversial ad that many find offensive to Catholics Last Thursday the Freedom from Religion Foundation took out this full page ad in the paper protesting the Supreme Courts Hobby Lobby ruling	It features a picture of birth control pioneer Margaret Sanger and criticizes the quote all male all Roman Catholic majority on the high court for putting quote religious wrongs over womens rights The Times defends running the ad saying it complies with their companys policy Part of their statement to us says quote We do not accept advertisements that are gratuitously offensive on racial religious or ethnic grounds or that are considered to be in poor taste So Greg isnt that exactly what this ad is If you replaced the words all male Catholic lets assume with all female or Jewish or any other term besides Catholic there would be Armageddon GUTFELD Its  its actually a compliment to Catholicism because they wouldnt have accepted an ad that was critical of Islam precisely for this reason Catholics dont cut your head off They dont mutilate your body They dont kidnap virgins The worst thing Catholics do is shake your hand at mass which I find irritating What they did was they narrowly interpreted a law that allows a business to opt out of a few pills that they can afford So string them up by the rosaries I say TANTAROS But isnt this profiting off of bigotry Eric BOLLING Well sure The New York Times is profiting Im not sure its bigotry but it certainly  look the ad is basically a fund raiser for freedom from religion So I guess that we should be OK They should be able to do that But what it is is the media  again the divide and conquer media  men against women blacks against whites wealthy against poor  kind of a sad commentary but Margaret Sanger right TANTAROS Yes Interesting choice for the ad BOLLING She shouldnt  no woman can call herself free who does not own and control her own body Isnt that how they kind of got in trouble in the first place TANTAROS Yes And we dont have time to get into the history of Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood and why she started it but its pretty uncomfortable right Juan I mean lets look at this uncomfortable statistic as well 1924 Democratic convention remember when the liberals ran out Al Smith because he was Catholic WILLIAMS Yes TANTAROS That was a perceived bias towards Catholics in the Democratic Party Are we seeing that move now Progressives are being pretty bigoted against Catholics because the other day The Huffington Post ran an article questioning should we have all Catholics or a very maledominated Catholic Supreme Court Then we have the National Organization of Women coming out They have a Dirty 100 list that goes against nuns WILLIAMS Wow TANTAROS How disgusting WILLIAMS The Little Sisters are on that list because of their argument in the Hobby Lobby case BOLLING Which is asinine WILLIAMS But I dont know if its asinine Look I wouldnt have put it there But I mean TANTAROS Is there a bigotry against Catholics in the Democratic Party Is this a growing movement by progressives WILLIAMS I think what youre seeing is a fundraising letter right	I mean the big argument to me is the one that Greg raised which is The New York Times refused an ad that said End Islam And they said at the time Oh we dont  I think theyre worried that these  the terrorists might come after The New York Times if they ran that ad OK But then how are you going to then say it fits your standards and run an ad that goes after the Catholics Now I got to tell you I think the Roman Catholic Church has a lot of power in this country and if you  and when it comes to the abortion issue I think they have you know cooperated with making it a wedge issue that benefits Republicans I dont think theres any question about that PERINO But most Catholics vote Democrat WILLIAMS At this point they do PERINO So WILLIAMS Let me just say also you know whats in your favor Guess who approved Roe v Wade It was an allmale court PERINO Are you reading my notes WILLIAMS What PERINO I was going to make that point Ill end with this Remember when The New York Times ran the ad during the surge when General Petraeus came back to Washington to testify in front of the Foreign Relations Committee which included senators Clinton and Obama who were planning to run for Congress SIC And The New York Times allowed an ad that said General Betrayus	which I think would have fit the definition of what you just described as their reasoning for denying an ad That would have been one I think  that I would have said no to as well but maybe The New York Times	should just say Well run any ad GUTFELD Yes TANTAROS I wonder should we draft an ad and send it over asking if we should have unmarried women on the court or why the court has someone whos Jewish on when theyre only 2 percent of our population is Jewish	What would happen Greg if they ran that ad 	GUTFELD Can I completely avoid that question and just go after NOW	Because Little Sisters of the Poor they help the poor the impoverished the elderly They help 13000 people in 200 homes It now puts them on this list calls them  calling them the Dirty 100 You should see a picture of these nuns Theyre these little nuns and theyre absolutely adorable They take a vow of poverty Now take the vow of stupidity Theyre just idiots idiots Just look at these little old ladies BOLLING I totally tote ally agree with you But who is the president of NOW now You know whoever Find out Google her Find out who she is send her an email send her a letter and say Youve got to stop that That is just ridiculous Going after Little Sisters of the Poor PERINO I think that theyve come undone Theres a huge disconnect between the young people I think that are writing their ads and the people with any common sense And they dont check them Nobody is  no one is doing a gut check TANTAROS I think this is the face of progressivism revealing its ugly head BOLLING Terry ONeill TANTAROS Up next Terry ONeill Send your emails Listen up coeds Would you stop shaving your underarms as a way of expressing feminist outrage over socalled societal norms Well find out where a college professor is offering some extra credit for this hairraising gender study course when we return COMMERCIAL BREAK GUTFELD Womens bodies are under assault Victimized under the guise of evil tradition I speak not of honor killings or lashings for adultery but of shaving armpits Thank heavens for feminists According to campus reform ASU gender studies professor Breanne Fahs whos giving extra credit to female students who stop shaving their underarms and legs and then journal on it On todays campus this replaces learning If you wish to be clean shaven however you dont get credit Is that discrimination Sure but its not like anyone cares which is my point Who exactly are you rebelling against when you advocate armpit rights to a class of feminists What risk are you taking A real teacher might give extra credit for stuff that challenges their world view Have them volunteer at the border Campus outrage is big over little things and tiny over the big things	Victim of female genital mutilation Hirsi Ali got booted from speaking at Brandeis and not a peep Nigerian girls are kidnapped same thing	Oppression galore they just snore Instead the modern professor traffics in safe lefty dreck to elevate status in places where their beliefs go unquestioned I am woman hear me roar is now I am woman Read my thesis on the patriarchal assault on my armpits Meanwhile millions of women are dying to come here fleeing from real actual oppression But I guess its no fun bashing a culture if it isnt western All right AT remember when college taught you stuff like stuff that was needed to prosper Not to make symbolic gestures TANTAROS I dont know if it taught me that much stuff about prospering I thought about this Greg In certain classes I was doing so poorly I may have considered growing my armpit hair out just to up my C to an A Now absolutely not But this just shows you how out of touch unity  university professors are and the left is when they talk about the real issues facing women right So I guess hes implying that because of gender roles women have an unfair place in the world because we have to shave our bodies and men dont Has he been outside of that college campus GUTFELD She TANTAROS Oh she clearly does not know about the trend of manscaping	 sorry I got them confused GUTFELD Yes A lot of manscaping TANTAROS Theres a lot of armpit hair on this teacher so Theres a lot of manscaping happening GUTFELD Yes TANTAROS She doesnt even know that some men out there have less body hair than I do although I lasered all my armpit hair off so I dont have any right now I couldnt even do this exercise if I wanted me to PERINO Thats discrimination GUTFELD My goodness the things we learn here on this show Dana is it any wonder other countries like China are smiling all the way to our banks PERINO Yes I think thats  and I believe this is going to do wonders for the marketing department at Arizona State University if they dont want men to go to their university This might be the perfect way to discourage them GUTFELD Eric imagine a parent paying a tuition for this BOLLING You just nailed it though Dr Fahs says theres no better way to learn about societal norms than to violate them Even better if you have a parent that teaches you them before so you dont have to grow your armpit hairs long or whatever the other things that you might do to realize that its pretty darn gross and stop doing it Am I wrong PERINO If you want to have armpit hair fine I dont care BOLLING You dont PERINO I dont care I mean I would not want to do it and I would not have taken this  I wouldnt have suggested WILLIAMS But you would notice a woman whos had you know hair on her legs hair on her armpits PERINO I notice it of course WILLIAMS It is a challenge to societal norms and its supposed to be a learning experience Why is everybody so uptight about GUTFELD Im not uptight about it PERINO Whats wrong with societal norms I love societal norms I want more societal norms GUTFELD Societal norms actually are a great thing PERINO Right Its called manners GUTFELD Manners PERINO Whats wrong with manners WILLIAMS No no the idea its the challenge So you see that you have norms GUTFELD Thats interesting You should grow your armpit hair out and then get dreadlocks Hows that PERINO Gross TANTAROS Actually if you let it grow long enough you could get dreadlocks under your armpits GUTFELD Thats what I meant Because Im a sad strange man All right Up next one fan caught on camera sleeping through a game	Weve been there havent we Its baseball And now hes suing Find out why when we come back COMMERCIAL BREAK WILLIAMS A baseball fan is crying foul after broadcasters made fun of him for sleeping on camera during a YankeesRed Sox game in April So check this out BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JOHN KRUK ESPN COLOR COMMENTATOR Thats not the place you come to sleep Ill tell you what How comfortable is that Probably wont have any neck problems tomorrow DAN SHULMAN ESPN PLAYBYPLAY ANNOUNCER I mean is that guy to his left his buddy whos just letting him sleep or is he here alone Whats the deal with this guy KRUK Maybe thats his buddy and he likes him a lot better when hes asleep END VIDEO CLIP WILLIAMS Well now hes suing Andrew Rector filed a mindboggling	10 million lawsuit against the Yankees Major League Baseball ESPN and the two announcers He said they mocked him for snoozing Rector claims his character was defamed and he suffered emotional distress I know youre a sensitive soul Mr Eric What do you think BOLLING This is whats wrong with American lawyers right there	You heard what they said and its kind of innocuous You heard exactly that But the gentleman Mr Rector is saying heres what they said about him The plaintiff is not worthy to be a fan of the New York Yankees I didnt hear that He said that the plaintiff is a fatty cow needs two seats all the time and represents a symbol of terror I mean theyre completely turning around what  they were having a little fun  Shulman and Kruk were just having a little bit of fun with the fan And by the way I think you sign away your rights on the back of that ticket by using that ticket WILLIAMS I think its opinion I mean I dont see what the problem is here except you know you dont go to a baseball game I heard somebody say on FOX earlier today and expect to be defamed and ridiculed But on the other hand go to court 10 million is that serious PERINO I hope the judge says Get the heck out of here GUTFELD Wouldnt it have been a different story if it turned out he was dead TANTAROS What WILLIAMS What PERINO You mean if he had died in the seats GUTFELD Yes if he had been dead and nobody knew that PERINO That would be a different story GUTFELD Then wed be leading with that story WILLIAMS Yes because its baseball Thats why youre about this thing right GUTFELD Yes Baseball Ive done that many times in many games Often Ive ended up completely naked WILLIAMS Did they shave you while you were naked GUTFELD Yes WILLIAMS Well what do you think TANTAROS I dont think this will even make it to a court A judge will throw it out and then they probably wont settle for anything because its so ridiculous And if youre a Yankees fan at a matchup against the Yanks and the Red Sox and you fall asleep youre asking for it WILLIAMS Let me  just play with me OK so I say hey you know what All his friends are making fun of him All of his friends say Man you fell asleep on TV At the Yankees game TANTAROS So what By the way Bob Beckel has fallen asleep when weve been doing breaking news on this show and weve made fun of him I think Kimberly called it a FOX Snooze Alert And weve outed him Bob doesnt have a case WILLIAMS Yes he sued He sued He sued Well see how that one	turns out Well anyway One More Thing coming right at you COMMERCIAL BREAK PERINO Time now for One More Thing Im going to kick it off Many of you know Katie Pavlich who is a FOX News contributor Shes on lots of shows sometimes on here but mostly on Outnumbered She was on Hannity last night talking about her new book This is her new book	It is called Assault and Flattery You might not know that she is already a New York Times bestselling author This is her new book and it basically takes on the concept of the war against women and who is really waging it and shes got a great writing style It was very engaging So congratulations to Katie And Greg I will pass that to you I will call on Juan No pictures WILLIAMS Well you know that 1995 hit This is How We Do It	Well this is how Tom Hanks does it BEGIN VIDEO CLIP MUSIC END VIDEO CLIP WILLIAMS Yes that was Hanks at a wedding in Canada over the weekend And guess what It was tweeted out by Justin Bieber Justin Bieber tweeting Tom Hanks dancing getting it on having a great time I think that was pretty cool And apparently a lot of people do Its a big hit on social media TANTAROS Better than that naked tweet of his midsection WILLIAMS Why do you bring those things up PERINO Andrea knows all Andrea knows all And youre next TANTAROS OK So yesterday we talked about gun violence in Chicago	And I want to show you and a Chicago magazine does an excellent job showing how fraudulent these numbers are What youre hearing coming out of Rahm Emanuels mouth and the chief of police it isnt true Theyre fudging the numbers So they keep talking about how the murder rate has gone down in Chicago Look at this Murder 171 versus 180 But heres the issue that you really need to look at Shooting incidents are up 880 shooting incidents versus 833 So when they talk about incidents not only has it gone up they only count an incident as one incident even if seven people were shot Heres the real number to look at At the very bottom the Chicago Tribune talks about shooting victims This is how New York City breaks it	down 2185 this year alone versus 1196 So when you hear them talking in Chicago about how theyve improved the murder rate getting better its not Its all fuzzy math Its all fraudulent PERINO An informative One More Thing All right Greg GUTFELD Time for a banned phrase Journaling This is a new academic phrase that means writing in your diary PERINO In your journal GUTFELD In your journal They call it a journal but lets face it	Its a diary for adults Diaries should only be for 12yearold girls It should be about some guy they have a crush on maybe some unicorns or your digestive issues BOLLING Didnt you use that in your monologue today GUTFELD Yes I did Journaling is a stupid word Writing no journaling PERINO Now speaking of something stupid Eric has got an app hes going to tell you about BOLLING Oh its my turn OK so I love Snapchat So Snapchat GUTFELD Ive never heard that from you BOLLING However so Sean says Have you Yod yet Im like Whats Yo Its like I dont know Take a look Take a look at the little screen You tap it and someone Yoing you comes on at the top of the screen Im like thats really stupid until I realized there are other applications Restaurants retail and this one The Israelis are Yoing	about incoming rockets PERINO Maybe not where I was going with that thought Hmm GUTFELD Yo PERINO I can do that all day long Im going to send you an email	Im going to write you a letter that just says Yo BOLLING Thats Yo Thats the app GUTFELD Im banning a phrase PERINO OK Dont forget to set your DVR Never miss an episode of The Five Well see

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/science/2014/10/03/mummified-fetus-reveals-ancient-surgical-procedure/,A mummified fetus dating back to 1840 and discovered in Central ItalyRuggero DAnastasio A 19thcentury mummified fetus that underwent an ancient surgical procedure while in its mothers womb has been discovered by researchers in Italy according to a new report The procedure was apparently done when a mothers life was in danger or the fetus had already died     The investigators found the mummy after a devastating magnitude63 earthquake occurred in LAquila in central Italy on April 6 2009 The earthquake resulted in more than 300 deaths and damaged many buildings in the nearby area including the historical St John the Evangelist church in the village of Casentino The floor of the church partially collapsed exposing underground rooms holding mummified human bodies which included the newfound fetus that dates back to 1840 according to the researchers estimates When the researchers examined the fetus mummy using a radiograph they saw a fetal skeleton that was not fully connected or articulated which means that some of the bones were not in the exact same position to each other as they likely were when the fetus was alive They were not able to establish the sex of the fetus as they could not determine the morphology of its pelvic and jaw bones which scientists use to identify sexual characteristics of skeletons The researchers did estimate the fetus was at 29 weeks of development inside its mothers womb See Photos of the Mummy Fetus and Excavation Site A few features of the mummy suggested that an operation had taken place The fetus skull had been dissected in several places and disconnected from the spine while its arms had been separated from the rest of the body at the joints none of which typically occurs in the process of postmortem examinations All of these characteristics strongly suggest a case of embryotomy which was a procedure that occurred before removing the fetus from the womb study author Ruggero DAnastasio of University Museum at University of Chieti Italy told Live Science This likely case of embryotomy is the only anthropological proof of this surgical practice up to now in this geographical region he added Embryotomy was a common practice in ancient times DAnastasio said The procedure was practiced in Alexandria and then in Rome during the first and second centuries the researchers wrote in the study Physicians typically performed it when a mothers life was threatened due to delivery complications or when the fetus was already thought to be dead in the womb According to some reports however embryotomy was also the most extreme method of abortion during the medieval period they wrote The remains of this fetus had been reassembled to match its anatomic shape including the fragments of the skull being placed at the top of the mummy inside a headgear The careful reassembly and dressing of the fetus indicates a high sense of compassion for the death of unborn children within the local community at the time the researchers said The other human remains found at the site likely date back to the 19th century or earlier as confirmed by a scientific method of age determination called radiocarbon dating and information gathered from personal objects Those items include rings and rosary beads shoes and clothes as well as the textiles and shrouds used for wrapping the mummified bodies Some of the bodies had lesions from autopsy procedures such as craniotomy in which a bone flap is removed from the skull to access the brain according to the report published online Aug 12 in the International Journal of Osteoarcheology Copyright 2014 LiveScience a TechMediaNetwork company All rights reserved This material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed,2014-10-03T07:25-04:00,abortion

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/09/02/texas-governors-race-democrats-and-dream-wendy-davis-win/, To the extent that Democrats dream in Technicolor the grand dream would be turning Texas from red to blue in future presidential elections Why Add Texas 38 electoral votes to the megastate troika of California Illinois and New York and the sum is 142  more than midway to the magical 270 Toss in another dozen reliably blue states and the Democrats haul climbs to 256 Republicans would have to all but run the table in the remaining 34 states  including battleground Colorado Florida Ohio and Virginia  to ever have a viable shot at the Oval Office     As Jerry Seinfeld would say good luck with all that How close are Democrats to flipping the Lone Star State Barack Obama received only 41 of the statewide vote in 2012 down 25 from 2008 by contrast Michael Dukakis received 433 of the November 1988 presidential election running against Texas transplant George H W Bush And Hillary Clintons chances in 2016 Currently not so robust if Wendy Davis current gubernatorial run is a benchmark About Davis she rose to political notoriety in June of last year for waging a 12hour filibuster on the floor of the Texas Senate to delay a state bill adding to and updating abortion regulationsThat landed the state senator in the pages of Vogue and in East Coast salons where prochoice activists implored her to run to become Texas 48th governor That moment in June would also prove to be her political highwater mark The first sign of trouble for Davis though she received 78 of the vote in the Democrats March primary she fared poorly in heavily Hispanic predominately Catholic communities in South Texas  Democrats she may lose in November thanks to the prochoice brand Texas surveys show the prolife position holding a 10 advantage statewide It may explain why though Davis continues to run as a womens rights champion shes now talking about ending the statute of limitations on rape and sexual battery cases in Texas rather than making her candidacy a straight referendum on abortion A second problem at the heart of Davis appeal was a feelgood story of a woman overcoming lifes hardships That was until a January Dallas Morning News report that punched holes in her biography  the madeforLifetime tale of a divorced teenaged mother who lived in a trailer and earned her way to Harvard Law wasnt quite as it was advertised That prompted Davis campaign to issue this statement from the candidate I am proud of where I came from and I am proud of what Ive been able to achieve through hard work and perseverance And I guarantee you that anyone who tries to say otherwise hasnt walked a day in my shoes What she didnt note her Republican opponent Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott is a paraplegic If elected Davis wouldnt be making Texas political history two women  Miriam Ma Ferguson and Ann Richards  have run the Lone Star State albeit a halfcentury apart However Davis is trying to reverse the political order Texas hasnt held an openseat gubernatorial contest since 1990 The winner of that election Richards the last Democrat to serve as governor In the five gubernatorial elections since the closest a Democrats come to the governors office is 459 Richards take in 1994 while losing to George W Bush Running on personality and biography one would assume a Davis campaign swathed in sunshine and optimism think Obama and hope in 2008 Instead its been darkness and slight Davis highestprofile ads this summer That would be a pair of buys suggesting that Abbott was unsympathetic toward rape victims and opposed to cancer research Curiously whats missing from the candidates ads would be    the candidate herself Why would Davis under attack from one web site for being too attractive decide not show her telegenic self Perhaps because shes a polarizing figure An April survey by Public Policy Polling found the state senator with a 32 favorability rating among women and 33 among men Abbott led 4941 among women and 5332 among men Not every election is a fait accompli  certainly when Texas early voting doesnt begin until Oct 20 and the two gubernatorial contenders will debate in McAllen three Fridays from now a second debate in Dallas at the months end hangs in limbo as the two sides have clashed over format In the meantime Davis has to figure a way around these hindrances a polling deficit perhaps as high as 128 thats the Real Clear Politics average a 31 money disadvantage Abbott is so wellfinanced that hes running ads in movie theaters local news that overshadows the governors race current Texas Gov Rick Perrys indictment the ongoing refugee crisis along the Mexican border Collectively it suggests that Wendy Davis a year after filibustering in a pair of pink Mizuno Wave Rider 16 runners is running an uphill race  in a Texas that isnt quite as blue as Democrats would like to dream it is  Bill Whalen is a research fellow at

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/11/06/how-will-republican-congress-handle-obama-and-culture-wars/, Because of the way the news business works I am writing this column before the close of the polls in the socalled midterm elections and hence as I write I do not know their outcome Will the Republicans or the Democrats control the US Senate for the next two years Will it make a difference The two major political parties are more alike than they are different On the two paramount issues of our day  war and debt  they are identical With the exception of Democratic progressives and Republican libertarians the two parties stand for perpetual war and perpetual debt Both stances increase the power of the government and each invites present and future destruction     A healthy society should avoid war at all costs except when immediately vital for its own selfdefense A healthy government should pay its bills and not push them off to the next generation Do you know any American whose freedom and safety have been enhanced or fortified because of all our empire building in the Middle East Do you know that the federal government borrowed two trillion dollars to wage these wars and now spends twenty cents of every dollar in interest on its debt Do you know that the congressional leadership and most of the rank and file of both political parties have brought this about There are two great freedoms being assaulted under the radar that will soon come to the fore the freedom to live and the freedom to speak Both parties use abortion as a litmus test You want the Democratic nomination for any federal or state office you need to support a womans right to abortion You want the Republican nomination for any federal or state office you better claim that you are prolife I say claim because thats all Republicans need to do to satisfy each other If Republicans truly were prolife theyd have passed a oneparagraph statute when they ran the Congress and George W Bush was in the White House that legally defined a fetus in the womb as a natural person Of course morally and biologically a fetus is a natural person The fetus has human parents and possesses a fully actualizable human genome  all the genetic materials needed to grow and flourish and possess selfdirected humanity But no such legislation ever came Since the Supreme Court denied personhood to every fetus in 1973 much as it had done to AfricanAmericans in 1857 more than 44000000 babies have met the abortionists vacuum and scalpel Will a newly revived Republican Congress address personhood to the abortionist in chief in the White House Dont hold your breath After the right to life the next great freedom under siege is the freedom of speech Here too both parties in Congress have failed us When Congress in 2001 enacted the Patriot Act which permits federal agents to write their own search warrants in utter defiance and direct contradiction of the Fourth Amendment which commands that only judges may do so it also prohibited the recipients of agentwritten search warrants from talking about them At least a halfdozen federal judges have found this infringement of speech unconstitutional yet federal agents who serve their own search warrants continue to threaten the recipients against talking to anyone about them This too came about with the support of the leadership of both political parties in Congress Not content with commanding silence about search warrants the Democrats in the Senate attempted to offer an amendment to the Constitution last summer which if ratified would have weakened the First Amendment by permitting Congress and the states to punish the political speech of groups Three years ago the Supreme Court in a case called Citizens United held that free political speech is such a highly valued and constitutionally protected asset in American society that it may be enjoyed not only by individuals but also by groups of two or more persons such as labor unions foundations nonprofits think tanks partnerships and corporations Outraged that corporations can spend money to affect the outcome of campaigns rejecting the concept that buying an advertisement in a newspaper or on TV is speech and wanting to remove the word free from free speech the Democrats attempted to circulate to the states an amendment to the Constitution that would have made the government the arbiter of acceptable political speech Is Vladimir Putin consulting the Democrats Yet did you hear any Republicans in the recent elections call out any Democrats for this stunt The First Amendment has remained pristine since it was ratified in 1791 and the Democrats want to change that and the Republicans have gone mute A lame duck President Obama facing a Congress he hates and fears may become reckless We should expect that But if somehow he facilitates the killing of more babies in their mothers wombs or the suppression of more political speech from his critics what will a Republican Congress do What is its track record  Andrew P Napolitano a former judge of the Superior Court of New Jersey is the senior judicial analyst at Fox News Channel He joined FNC in

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/08/20/teen-births-down-in-most-us-states/,iStock Republican Gov Phil Bryant has said for years that one of his top goals is reducing Mississippis teenage pregnancy rate long one of the highest in the nation Now he says his administration deserves credit for chipping away at the problem Our fight to reduce teen pregnancy is  vital to our success as a state and preliminary figures from the Mississippi Department of Health show teen pregnancy has fallen more than 15 percent from 2011 to 2013 Bryant said July 31 in a speech at the Neshoba County Fair     However Mississippi is not alone in seeing a decrease of births to teenage mothers The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a report this month that shows the US birth rate among unmarried women including teen moms has declined steadily since its peak in 20072008 That raises some important questions Is Bryant any more responsible for the reduction in Mississippi than say Democratic President Barack Obama is for the reduction nationwide Did governmentsponsored programs make a significant difference How much did other factors such as the struggling economy social pressure or access to birth control influence peoples reproductive decisions  even the decision to follow through with an unintended pregnancy rather than end it with abortion A chart in the CDC report shows a steady increase in births outside marriage in the US since the 1940s peaking in 2008 The report says the recent decline of births to unmarried mothers is the steepest the nation has seen since the 1970s The largest percentage drop in nonmarital birth rates between 2007 and 2012 was for teenagers according to the CDC During those years the birth rate to mothers aged 15 to 17 dropped 30 percent while the rate for those who aged 18 or 19 dropped 26 percent Its widely acknowledged that teenage parents face plenty of challenges and that the responsibilities of raising a baby fall more on the young moms than the dads Compared to their peers without babies teenage moms are more likely to drop out of high school or college or to delay completion of their own education If you want to fail in life if you want to end up being on Medicaid  CHIPs and Medicaid and food stamps the rest of your life  if you never want to have a career then all youve got to do is drop high school and have a baby And I can almost assure you thats whats going to happen to you Bryant told about 200 young people at a teen pregnancy prevention conference in December 2012 CHIP is the state Childrens Health Insurance Program a government insurance program for children whose families earn slightly too much to qualify for Medicaid Mississippi has long been one of the poorest states in the nation Since 201213 the states public schools have been required to offer sex education courses There can be no demonstrations of how to apply condoms or talk about abortion to prevent birth Parents must give permission for a student to take the classes and boys and girls are taught separately More than half of school districts opted to teach an abstinenceonly sex education curriculum while a smaller number are teaching abstinenceplus which includes more detailed information about birth control Some chose abstinenceonly for younger students and abstinenceplus for older ones When he talks to teens Bryant tells them to abstain from sex until marriage He has also said frequently that he hopes to end abortion in Mississippi,2014-08-20T10:02-04:00,abortion

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/05/21/monica-wehby-wins-gop-primary-for-oregon-senate-seat/,Monica Wehby Republican Senate candidate in OregonFNC Dr Monica Wehby emerged victorious in the Oregon GOP Senate primary Tuesday to take on Democratic Sen Jeff Merkley in November in a race Republicans hope could help them take back the Senate Wehby beat Oregon state Rep Jason Congers and three other candidates with 51 percent of the vote Congers placed a distant second with 36 percent      Republicans are looking to Wehby a pediatric neurosurgeon and political newcomer to pull off an againsttheodds victory in territory where a Republican has not won a statewide election since 2002 However some believe that firstterm incumbent Merkley is vulnerable because he has enthusiastically supported ObamaCare The health care reform law is deeply unpopular in Oregon because the states exchange has been a disaster The state abandoned its plans for an independent online exchange after it failed to launch and Cover Oregon and its independent contractor Oracle Corp couldnt fix it Oregon then decided to switch to the federal portal the first state to do so On Tuesday federal prosecutors subpoenaed state records for a grand jury investigation into what went wrong with the website Wehby who has 30 years of medical experience was an early critic of ObamaCare She was on the board of the American Medical Association and was featured in a 2009 ad opposing the Affordable Care Act This early opposition to the law helped Wehby gain attention and support from influential Republicans nationally and she has been endorsed by GOP heavyweights like Mitt Romney Newt Gingrich and Dr Ben Carson Her challenger Conger raised far less money but was backed by influential social conservatives and groups including former senator and GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum Wehby might carry some baggage into the general election Late in the race police reports surfaced showing that two of her former companions an exhusband and a former boyfriend called police as their relationships were deteriorating and said Wehby had harassed them The boyfriend timbercompany executive Andrew Miller later helped fund a super PAC attacking Conger He said his accusations to police were exaggerated and he regretted them No charges were filed in either incident Wehby says the reports have nothing to do with her campaign and are being used as a political weapon Speaking to supporters Tuesday night Wehby said everyone makes mistakes but like a lot of Oregonians shes a working mother balancing a career with raising children I do have a message for those national Democrats who are willing to shred my family for their own political gain People are tired of your dirty tricks Wehby said We all know that the best way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him and that is exactly what we are going to do Wehby 51 has kept her focus on the general election portraying herself as a political outsider She largely ignored her Republican rivals and instead attacked Obamacare and Sen Jeff Merkley Shes staked out moderate positions on social issues  she says the federal government shouldnt get involved in abortion or gay marriage  and says her background as a doctor gives her the expertise to fight the federal health care law Wehby will face an uphill climb against Merkley a firstterm Democrat who narrowly defeated a Republican incumbent in 2008 The Democratic Party has an 8point edge in voter registration and Republicans have struggled for two decades to win statewide elections While strong in rural areas the GOP gets hammered in liberal Portland and has watched its influence erode in the citys suburbs in recent years If Republicans can put Merkleys seat into play however it would boost their efforts to rack up a net gain of six seats and reclaim control of the Senate Theres a clear choice in the race for Senate between Monica Wehby who will vote with national Republicans against Oregons priorities and Jeff Merkley who fights for Oregon and puts Oregon first Merkley campaign manager Alex Youn said in a statement Conger 45 ran to Wehbys right He said her stands on social issues are out of step with the Republican Party and pitched his experience winning elections in a Democratic district Conger emphasized his biography overcoming a hardscrabble childhood to graduate from law school From homeless to Harvard read the slogan on his campaign literature Big donors were key players in the race nearly matching the candidates own spending with about 1 million in independent expenditures Three super PACs and a traditional political action committee paid for television radio and Internet advertisements as well as mail and billboards supporting both Wehby and Conger Also in the race were Mark Callahan a Salem informationtechnology consultant Tim Crowley a Portland lawyer and Joe Rae Perkins a former financial planner from Albany Fox News Dan Springer and

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/10/21/november-midterms-why-single-white-women-and-minority-voters-are-dems-last-line/," The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHillcom Republicans have more women running for Congress this year than ever before They have five female Senate nominees one less than the record high set during the 2012 campaign They also have 50 female House candidates two more than in 2012     This highwater mark for Republicans is important because single white women along with minority voters are the last line of defense for Democrats hoping to keep the GOP from a wave election  Historically speaking minority voters are less inclined to go to the polls in midterm elections than in presidential contests That being so Democrats are focusing on pumping up turnout among collegeeducated young single women who are considered more likely to vote I havent seen gender gaps like this in any race until this year and were seeing them all over the place Nicole McCleskey a Republican who polls for Public Opinion Strategies recently toldNational Journal She pointed to particularly high levels of male support for Republicans as part of the reason for this years yawning gender gap The gender gap has averaged about 13 points in senatorial and gubernatorial races since 2004 But this year the same races are averaging a gap of 20 points ballooning to whatNational Journalcalled historic proportions across 2014s battleground states By way of comparison exit polls from the 2012 presidential election showed President Obama winning the support of 55 percent of female voters over Republican Mitt Romoney but only 45 percent of their male counterparts Helpfully for the president women made up 53 percent of all voters on that occasion The focus on women is glaring in the Colorado Senate race between two men Sen Mark Udall the Democrat and his Republican challenger Rep Cory Gardner The Republican is basically tied with Udall in polls He has a failed to pull away more convincingly because he cannot transcend his opposition to abortion rights including past support for personhood bill that outlaws abortion by equating a fertilized egg with a living child But the gender gap will also be pivotal in Senate races in Georgia Arkansas Michigan Louisiana Alaska That in term means it will also be at the core of whether the GOP is able to take the Senate majority One intriguing twist in this cycle is that Democrats have shifted from talking about a War on Women Instead they rely on references to GOP opposition to equal pay laws to renewing the Violence Against Women Act to increasing the minimum wage and to opposition to the Affordable Care Act including its increased access to contraception and preventive care including mammograms and care for pregnant women It is hard for even the best female Republican candidates to counter the fact that Republicans in Congress have repeatedly voted to repeal the health care law It is hard for anyone to ignore that Republicanmajority state legislatures are forcing the small number of redstate abortion clinics to shut down by passing restrictive antiabortion laws Stan Greenberg the Democratic pollster recently found that Democratic campaigns are succeeding in making the candidates positions on womens issues become the second biggest reason voters are planning to vote for Democrats  after the economy The headline on the press release for the polls results written by its sponsors Unmarried Women Support Democratic Candidates by 22 points in 12 Battleground States The poll led Rush Limbaugh the king of conservative talk radio to joke if single women vote Democrat then Republicans would be wise to start a dating service Short of having the maledominated GOP marry single female Democrats the partys best hope was to recruit strong women candidates for 2014 It did just that This years class of Republican candidates includes Joni Ernst in Iowa Shelley Moore Capito in West Virginia Monica Wehby in Oregon and Terri Lynn Land in Michigan It is a start for the whitemaledominated GOP even if this group is still outnumbered by female Democrats running for Senate In addition to recruiting more women and getting more of them through the primaries the party has also avoided ending up with politically inept female candidates such as 2010s Christine ODonnell I am not a witch and Sharron Angle Im tired of some people calling me wacky There is even more good news for the GOPs effort to cut into the Democrats advantage with women Older white married women are polling more strongly behind Republican candidates As a result some generic polls in this years campaign are making news by showing likely women voters with an overall preference for Republicans not Democrats to control Congress In Republican advertising the wives daughters and mothers of male candidates are being prominently featured this cycle And Republican female candidates are directly confronting the issue in advertising by speaking to women In Michigan the Republican senate candidate Terri Lynn Land has a television ad in which she looks into the camera and asks female voters if they believe she is waging a war on women Then she says of her Democrat opponent As a woman I might know a little bit more about women than Gary Peters It is a good ad Land is a good candidate But is it enough to overcome a GOP brand defined by decades of hostility on pay abortion and national health care  top issues for young women voters We shall see  Juan Williams is a cohost

 Problems so bad ObamaCare almost looks good
 Gran and Gramps Clinton hurry back to the trail
 Ryan urges Romney run would step aside
 Kansas tea party leaders to meet on Roberts race
 Worst job in China     PROBLEMS SO BAD OBAMACARE ALMOST LOOKS GOOD
Its been a year since the Obama administration presided over the crash landing of ObamaCare so what have we learned First the human beings remain almost uniformly bad at predicting the future at any distance Attitudes about the law are basically identical to this point in 2013 There has been no death spiral but neither has there been much change of heart about a law Americans do not like And while smartset reporters say that the issue is pass the truth is that while Americans have become inured to the law much as they have to their dreary economic circumstances it like the economy remains part of the background music for the electoral drama currently playing out But whats in the foreground is part of that too

In this latest study by the Brookings Institute only 36 percent of Democratic candidates have expressed support for Obamacare

Frying pan or fire  Part of the reason that ObamaCare is getting less attention these days other than voter and media fatigue is competition for attention It is good for Democrats that the current round of ObamaCare insurance disruptions arent getting the attention they were amid the If you like it you can keep it debacle But look at what stories are replacing those about ObamaCare victims The president blaming his intelligence team for failing to intervene soon enough against ISIS Russia is bristling with aggression Ebola has come to Texas The Secret Service is in utter disarray Immigration activists are furious over executive inaction after a border crisis froze the presidents pen Just imagine if someone a year ago had described the current situation It makes ObamaCares disastrous rollout sound like a walk in the park

GAO says bailouts need approval  Washington Examiner The Department of Health and Human Services cannot legally bail out the insurance industry for excessive losses through President Obamas health care law unless the US Congress approves language allowing the administration to do so according to a legal opinion released on Tuesday by the Government Accountability Office

ISIS alone  A year ago we hadnt heard about ISIS much and the president was still touting his handiwork against al Qaeda That Obama would be forced to resume the war in Iraq and then later admit fault or at least place it on a subordinate would have been unimaginable to most And the other big stories of this October sound more like movie plots than news stories Pandemics security breaches migrant surges at the southern border Russian territorial advances Sounds more like Tom Clancy than the rundown for the evening news So while Democrats are cheering that the Titanic of health care isnt still scraping the iceberg they may want to check the arrival schedule for the Hindenburg

GRAN AND GRAMPS CLINTON HURRY BACK TO THE TRAIL
After the briefest pause for grandparenthood the Clintons are hitting the road in force The Democrats 2016 frontrunner Hillary Clinton who cancelled two events in the Washington area Tuesday sent former president Bill as campaignerinchief to a fundraiser for Maryland Democratic gubernatorial candidate Anthony Brown that reportedly netted 12 million Hillary was the main draw at a highdollar Democratic congressional fundraiser in Manhattan on Monday and is slated to stump in Miami Thursday for Florida gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist The former secretary of State will return to the Big Apple this week according to the AP to fundraise for New Hampshire Democratic Sen Jeanne Shaheen While Hillary hasnt been in the critical primary state since her 2008 presidential bid her husband plans to stump for the Dems in New Hampshire on October 16

Bubba stumps  Before Bubba gets back to New Hampshire the former Arkansas governor is headed back home where vulnerable Sen Mark Pryor DArk is struggling to boost former Clinton driver and Rep Mike Rosss DArk bid for the governors mansion and the congressional campaign of former Clinton FEMA Director James Lee Witt Also hoping for more help in red states carried by Clinton in the 1990s are Kentucky Senate hopeful Alison Lundergan Grimes daughter of FOB Jerry Lundergan and Georgia Senate candidate Michelle Nunn

And how about the current president  The Clintons aggressive campaigning is in stark contrast to the anemic schedule of President Obama The president is heading to his home state today ahead of a Thursday speech on the economy in which the president will no doubt try to defend his claim that Americans are better off than they were six years ago Obama will also headline a bigbuck fundraiser for Democratic Gov Pat Quinns agonizing reelection bid But guess who elese is coming to dinner Illinois native Hillary will reportedly be in the state to stump for Quinn on Oct 8

The WaPo provides a useful timeline of the evolution of Romney and his inner circle about another presidential campaign

Buuuut  Tim Carney argues that the GOP cant connect to populist voters with Romney Republicans are never going to get back the White Bread vote They should instead go for the bluecollar vote That means new priorities And a new candidate

Christie headed back to Iowa  The Hill New Jersey Republican Gov Chris Christie will travel to Iowa later this week drawing increased attention to a potential 2016 White House run Christie who was already slated to headline an Oct 25 birthday party fundraiser for Republican Gov Terry Branstads reelection in Clive Iowa will travel to Cedar Rapids on Friday to campaign for Branstad and Republican congressional candidate Rod Blum Branstads campaign announced Tuesday

Conservative Super PAC Freedom Partners Action Fund is launching a trio of ads with sixfigure buys in Florida and West Virginia congressional races In the Sunshine State this ad touts GOP Rep Steve Southerlands efforts protect jobs at home and hits his opponent saying Democrat Gwen Graham would be one more vote for Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama Another Florida ad takes Rep Joe Garcia DFla to task on trust saying Florida families need a leader whom they can trust who can be held accountable and who will advocate policies that keep the states economy moving forward Rep Garca does not fit the bill A third ad calls out West Virginia Democratic Rep Nick Rahall for his alliance with President Obama in the administrations war on coal Whether its a carbon tax that would destroy thousands of jobs defending President Obamas EPA or voting with antienergy interests Rahall has shown that he consistently puts Washington over West Virginia the ad says

GOPs audacious House target  Can House Republicans gain 11 seats to reach the historic threshold of 245 seats Probably not but its looking more possible than previously thought Fox News By most accounts the odds lean against the party hitting that historic goal the GOP would need to execute a nearflawless performance on Election Day But political observers arent ruling anything out I think the Republicans winning 11 new seats is a possibility Its not a likely scenario but I dont think you can dismiss it entirely said Nathan Gonzalez managing editor of The Rothenberg Political Report

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/04/29/what-is-least-free-place-in-america-it-often-college-campus/,A screenshot of the Bowdoin College websiteBowdoin What is the least free place in the United States Prisons certainly but even prisoners enjoy the freedoms of mind and spirit The least free place for the freedoms of thought expression and faith is most likely the college campus Colleges have become pressure cookers of conformity Of course colleges dont see themselves that way They proclaim their commitment to academic freedom and to tolerance of differing views But when these declarations are put to the test they often dissolve     Recently the president of Brandeis University canceled an honorary degree that was to be awarded to Ayaan Hirsi Ali the Somaliborn former Muslim who has emerged as a leading secular critic of Islam The cancellation resulted from a campaign begun by a Muslim student who smeared Hirsi Ali as a purveyor of hate speech Last fall the lead story was the shouting down of New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly when he arrived at Brown University to give a speech The Brown administration forewarned of the plan to silence Kelly stood by and did nothing Cases like this create headlines but they only hint at the deeper problem In an effort to get a fuller picture my organization the National Association of Scholars spent two years examining Bowdoin College a small college in Maine from top to bottom We issued our findings in a 400page study What Does Bowdoin Teach How a Contemporary Liberal Arts College Shapes Students What we found is that Bowdoin teaches conformity Of course Bowdoin doesnt say that It tells its students that it celebrates diversity and offers an education that is rich with opportunities for students to become citizens of the world Buyer beware Bowdoin recently had its own Brandeislike moment when it found a pretext to terminate Robert and Sim Gregory a husband and wife who had served for nearly a decade as advisers to the campus InterVarsity Christian Fellowship The Gregorys are evangelical Christians who had gone about their work quietly There were no student complaints But Bowdoin was apprehensive that they might at some point discriminate against gays and decided to force the issue by presenting them with an agreement that would have precluded their teaching the orthodox Christian view of marriage as One man and one woman in a lifelong committed union The Gregorys asked for assurance that if they presented this view to their students in a serious study of the Bible Bowdoin would not charge them with discrimination or harassment or both Bowdoin declined to give this assurance The Gregorys also asked for a Reservation of Rights to Religious Beliefs and Practices that would have explicitly allowed them to continue their religious teaching Bowdoin said no At Bowdoin as at Brandeis some religious views are welcome and the rest are hate speech Students who express traditional religious views are particularly vulnerable to this treatment In our study we encountered a traditional Catholic who said When abortion is brought up I have to just keep my mouth shut We also spoke at length to a young alumna who recounted years of bullying by other students who taunted her and her fianc for their Christian views Ayaan Hirsi Ali is an atheist the Gregorys are Christians but another big story in American higher education earlier this year was the effort by the American Studies Association to orchestrate an academic boycott of Israel The furor that followed showed the considerable degree to which antiSemitism has also found a favored place on many campuses The latest variation on the theme of liberal educations hostility to freedom of thought is the decision of Azusa Pacific a evangelical Christian university to postpone a longscheduled lecture by Charles Murray who was going to speak about his book The Curmudgeons Guide to Getting Ahead It isnt Murrays current writing that riled the Azusa Pacifics administration but his reputation as the coauthor twenty years ago of The Bell Curve which included data on the correlations of race and IQ Jon Wallace the president of Azusa were told acted out of fear of hurting our faculty and students of color Murray promptly posted a reply that should haunt President Wallace for the rest of his days The biases in these cases have a common source Colleges today have become champions of progressive enlightenment which isnt quite the same as yesteryears political correctness A phrase that crystallizes this new attitude is Error has no rights which is a recipe for coming down hard on anyone who disagrees It is applied ruthlessly on every issue from gay marriage to climate change At Bowdoin this attitude is fostered by the faculty and administration and pervades student life Traditional liberal openness is gone so is a liveandletlive tolerance In their place aggressively enforced conformity has emerged Shut up is the new

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/10/02/nine-ideas-for-new-contract-with-america/,"Newt Gingrich speaking during an American Solutions rally in Las VegasAP Photo Thursday Reince Priebus the Dickensiannamed Republican Party chairman gave what he billed as a major address on Principles for American Renewal  No one can accuse our political class of opposing recycling amid paeans to the Constitution families and maximizing freedom Priebus wound through nine principles six examples and about 3500 other units of verbiage that easily could have been lifted from the DoleforPresident campaign      The performance brought to mind the vapid and subgrammatical motto of Jebediah Springfield fictional town father in Foxs The Simpsons A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man It wasnt always this way Twenty years ago the littleknown House minority whip Newt Gingrich stood on the steps of the Capitol with scores of congressmen and candidates to announce the Contract With America The pacts bold ideas helped make the 1994 midterms a wave election and paved the way for welfare reform balanced budgets tax cuts and stronger economic growth

Today the conservatives again need new bold positive ideas They cant count on congressional bosses who have decided to play it safe Those leaders believe that ObamaCare scandals foreign disasters and voter fatigue will drag down the liberals this November  This theory may be true but by running an ideafree campaign conservatives wont have a clear mandate if they win Furthermore they will sacrifice several tossup congressional seats where liberals can eke out victory with their money advantage

A new Contractlike campaign could leverage voter discontent and advocate commonsense economic and social policies to help the beleaguered middle class Here are nine suggestions

1 Conservatives should vow that a Congress under what we hope will be new leadership will pass revenueneutral tax reform Americans disagree over taxation and the scope of government but agree that the tax code is a jobkilling mess Eliminating most deductions and simplifying taxes to three or four lower rates is a winning issue that will boost the economy

2 Cut government payroll outside of the military  including offthebooks contractors According to the Labor Department federal bureaucrats pay and benefits have surpassed those of average Americansdespite cushy jobs for life The government hasnt tightened its belt even as private enterprise has been forced to slim down in the Obama economy A new Congress should vote to cut head count and benefits 10 across federal agencies

3 Recognize that a growing number of American workers  and potential conservatives  are independent contractors These contractors face an onerous selfemployment tax on top of income tax Lets eliminate this penalty and make up the lost revenue with a luxury tax on the goldplated pension funds that liberals have created for unionized government bureaucrats

4 Americans waste an average of 38 hours per year in traffic jams according to researchers at Texas AM Most US airports are also in terrible shape Antiquated laws and regulations that needlessly elevate the cost of new infrastructure are to blame The worst offender is the DavisBacon law Originally passed in part to suppress black labor the law today is used by unions to eliminate the cost advantages of their nonunion competitors A study by the Beacon Hill Institute estimated that DavisBacon requirements increase the cost of infrastructurerelated labor by 22 over the market rate The law should go

5 Lets limit the power of privatesector unions and curb rentseeking government unions Twentyfour states have banned forced unionism with righttowork laws and they exhibit more economic growth than the rest Lets make righttowork a federal policy and also enact a nationwide ban to prevent new government employees from joining unions that rip off taxpayers and support everlarger government

Culturally a new Contractlike pledge can also define conservatives favorably with middleclass Americans But conservatives need to frame these issues to their advantage not fall victim to the liberals culture war traps

6 Good schools are fundamental to a positive culture To improve them the sixth part of a new conservative Contract could be a federal requirement giving parents choice in schools combined with a ban on tenure Parents should be allowed to move their children out of failing schools and principals should be allowed to reward teachers for merit instead of longevity

7 The government should pragmatically help women turn to adoption as an alternative to abortion There is a middle ground on this issue Shifting government funding away from abortionproviders could pay for healthcare for women who opt to forgo abortion and make dreams come true for the long backlog of couples who want to adopt

8 We should defend our great Western culture by banning radical Islamists from immigrating to seeking asylum in or visiting the United States Lets welcome Muslims who support the rule of law and the American way and keep violent radicals out Lets also yank citizenship from those who join with violent jihadists abroad

9 Finally a conservative Congress should force our president to address the obviously unsecured border It can be hard for Congress to compel executive branch agencies to do their jobs but Congress can help states that want to defend themselves from being swamped by any future wave of illegals Send the president a bill allowing states to deport aliens charged with felonies directlywithout the need for a federal permission slip

Of course the president would likely veto all of these popular moderate reforms Let him  Senator Harry Reid set the precedent for limiting filibusters A Congress under new management should follow suit sending popular measures to the White House on simplemajority votes Let the liberals explain to the American people why they oppose reform  Christian Whiton is the president of the Hamilton Foundation He was a State Department senior advisor in the George W Bush administration and a policy advisor on the Giuliani and Gingrich presidential campaigns He is author of Smart Power BetweenDiplomacy and War Potomac Books 2013  FollowFoxNewsOpinion on Facebook",2014-10-02T12:30-04:00,abortion
Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/06/30/hobby-lobby-ruling-why-supreme-court-got-it-right/,A detail of the United States Supreme Court is seen at dawn in WashingtonReuters Mondays ruling in the case of Sebelius vs Hobby Lobby is an important victory for religious liberty for people of all faiths regardless of what secularists will argue in their criticism of the Supreme Courts decision Liberals have tried to obfuscate the real issue in the case by insisting that it was about the merits of employermandated healthcare the propriety of contraception or the right of a woman to have an abortion In reality Hobby Lobby already provided health care for its employees Additionally the companys insurance covers 16 of the 20 contraceptives required under the HHS mandate     Hobby Lobby has objected to providing four of the 20 required contraceptives because they prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a womans womb which the owners contend is tantamount to abortion and violates their religious beliefs There is no claim that Hobby Lobby has attempted to prevent women from exercising their constitutional right to obtain abortions  the company just didnt want to have to pay for them The real issue in this case is the free exercise of religion that is guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof Some might argue that religious freedom only applies to individuals not corporations such as Hobby Lobby Yet as John Samples at the Cato Institute points out the Constitution clearly indicates whenever rights are limited to individuals by using the words citizens or persons such as the Fifteenth Amendment which addresses the rights of citizens to vote Corporations cant vote in a general election only individual citizens can However the First Amendment does not limit its guarantee of freedom of speech or the free exercise of religion to citizens or persons The Supreme Court clearly indicated in the case of Citizens United v the Federal Election Commission 2010 that the First Amendments prohibition against abridging the freedom of speech applied to corporations just as it does to individuals The focus of the First Amendment is  abridging the freedom of speech regardless of who is doing the speaking The same principle that guided the High Courts decision in the Citizens United case is relevant here If the guarantee of free speech applies to individuals and corporations so should the free exercise of religion found in the next phrase of the same Amendment  regardless of who is doing the exercising Had the framers of the Constitution desired to limit the free exercise of religion to individuals they could have done so as they did in another amendments If our forefathers had wanted to restrict the sphere of the free exercise of religion to the home church or synagogue they could have done that as well Yet the framers purposefully omitted any such restrictions If the Supreme Court had ruled against Hobby Lobby Monday and upheld the Obama administrations argument they would have been saying You are free to be prolife in your home or church but on Monday morning when you go to work you have to be proabortion People of faith have never accepted a dichotomy between their faith and their work They believe that their relationship with God and commitment to obeying His commands should impact every area of their lives their family their finances and their vocation As Solomon wrote in the Old Testament In all thy ways acknowledge him God and he shall direct thy paths Proverbs 36 As tragic as the High Courts decision was to legalize abortion Roe v Wade 1973 at least that ruling was based on a womans choice to abort her child The Hobby Lobby case was not about an individuals right to choose to have an abortion but about governments right to coerce people opposed to abortions to become complicit in them by funding abortioninducing drugs or devices Does Mondays ruling mean that any person has an unqualified right to object to any governmental mandate that violates his religious beliefs No more so than the freedom of speech gives a person the right to yell fire in a crowded theatre Reasonable people realize that no rights are absolute and unqualified But the religious persuasion of the owners of Hobby Lobby that abortion is the taking of innocent life is not some fringe belief embraced by a handful of extremists but is a deeply held spiritual conviction of tens of millions of Americans Monday the Supreme Court reaffirmed the right of those Americans to both hold and live by that conviction  Dr Robert Jeffress is a Fox News Contributor and pastor of the 11000member First Baptist Church in

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/06/30/supreme-court-rulings-deal-blows-obamacare-unions/,This is a rush transcript from The Five June 30 2014 This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated DANA PERINO COHOST Hello everyone Im Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle Bob Beckel Eric Bolling and an annoying Greg Gutfeld     Its 5 oclock in New York City and this is The Five MUSIC PERINO Two big Supreme Court rulings this morning and  believe it or not  despite the hype and protests the republic still stands One dealt a blow to labor unions Were going to get to that in a bit But first to the highlyanticipated Hobby Lobby verdict which dealt a blow to Obamacare The arts and craft chain directly challenged the mandate that employers provide free coverage for four particular contraceptives even if it violates the companys religious beliefs In a	54 decision the court ruled certain forprofit businesses can optout Heres reaction from both sides BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS LORI WINDHAM SENIOR COUNSEL FOR HOBBY LOBBY Todays decision is a landmark decision for religious freedom The Supreme Court recognized that American families do not lose their fundamental rights when they open a family business Womens voices are heard standing up for religious freedom This case is about the freedoms of all Americans women and men and its something that all Americans should celebrate today ILYSE HOGUE PRESIDENT NARALPRO CHOICE Im disturbed that five male Supreme Court justices would essentially state in a ruling that discrimination against women specifically is not really discrimination in this country END VIDEO CLIPS PERINO No comment on the ruling today directly from President Obama	But his spokesperson offered this BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JOSH EARNEST WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY There are now a group of women of an indeterminate size who no longer have access to free contraceptive coverage simply because of some religious views that are held not by them necessarily but by their bosses We disagree and the constitutional lawyer in the Oval Office disagrees with that conclusion from the Supreme Court END VIDEO CLIP PERINO The White House says that its considering a range of options available to the president that he could take after this decision We have Kimberly Guilfoyle here today GREG GUTFELD COHOST Boo PERINO Youre going to set the stage for us because its slightly complicated But you can  KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE COHOST It is But everyone should understand from the outset that this is a very narrowly tailored decision That is the main point here It applies specifically to the case at hand And so what that means is this is going to generate other cases that are similarly situated because they will try to get different groups depending on their viewpoint get the court to expand the ruling further than they did here in this particular case So I like the way that the court carefully tailored it They did this so theyd be able to stand on strong legal ground and say that this only concerns the contraceptive mandate So its not something thats going to say that all insurance coverage mandates like vaccinations blood transfusions everything like that those will necessarily fail if they conflict with an employers  you know they INAUDIBLE for their employees of what they can receive or what they cant So here its just dealing with the Gregs favorite word the abortifacient and whether or not those can be covered PERINO This is definitely seen Eric as a win by people who were  there were chants outside of Hobby Lobby wins there are a lot of people that are upset about it But if you go back to 1993 with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act that was a bipartisan bill that was passed its really  that was the question here and then apparently they changed their mind a lot of the Democrats and were decrying it as a vicious attack against women by the court ERIC BOLLING COHOST Kind of interesting Also interesting that Josh Earnest says now women wont have access to contraceptives Boy talk about not being earnest there could be one of the least earnest things Josh Earnest ever say Victory for constitutionalist a victory for religious freedoms people belief that First Amendment rights of now the corporation and individual are protected and a victory for common sense I mean basically the Obamacare theory is abortion pills are preventative medicine post  when I say abortion pills I mean the four abortifacients right this is what Hobby Lobby said Were OK with the 16 we provided 16 but the four that would actually abort a fetus after its been brought into life they said they had a problem with those So they said those abortifacients Obamacare calls those preventive So Hobby Lobby pushed back on that But the fight was employers still should provide that PERINO Right So the government  BOLLING So a lot of people who followed the Constitution believed that was a win PERINO The government that is trying to force people of faith to abandon their principles was delivered a brushback pitch by the justices today GUILFOYLE Nice sports analogy BOB BECKEL COPHOST Then I dont know who has taken into account the 13000 people that work for them You know if you  PERINO I think Hobby Lobby is BECKEL If two people start a business who are Christian scientists and they grow it into a 10000 or 15000person employee company does that mean Christian scientists believe you cant be bled you cant take your kid to a hospital  PERINO I think that Kimberly was just explaining to you that no that is not the case GUILFOYLE No its not BECKEL What is the case then You say that they bring that case in front of  GUILFOYLE What Im saying is that others might try to bring another case to say listen will you expand this or this But the court said again this applies closely held corporations like Hobby Lobby So its narrowly specified to that  hold on  to that type of corporation which is very different than a different hype publicly held et cetera But let me tell you something else They also said very important there are viable alternatives and thats what Hobby Lobby maintained the whole time Look they can go out and get something else This is what were providing Were certainly not putting a blanket restriction or X on contraceptives or anything like that So it was  they werent overbroad in what they chose to exclude which is why this case was the best one to bring forward and why everybody predicted that it would have the  CROSSTALK BECKEL So in other words forprofit corporations can bring their religious views into the business and affect everybody who works for them right BOLLING Closely held GUILFOYLE Held BECKEL Closely held Corporations are corporations PERINO Lets get Greg in here because one of the things you dislike the most is fake outrage and there was plenty of it today with people suggesting that the republic was going to end GUTFELD Well no There were actually people that were suggesting burning down Hobby Lobby buildings The meltdown made Chernobyl look like a tea pot Its like they banned Pilates or something They were comparing a narrow ruling to Sharia law Some people on Twitter were Feminists used to reject the notion of hysteria as an attack on women	Now they embrace hysteria The media meanwhile is framing as religion versus the individual Thats not the case Its the individual versus government They are camouflaging coercion as choice Its not about religion at all Its about a private enterprise being told what to do by the government But the media likes to portray this rightwing Christians versus progressive women who are losing their right You can still get your pills The government will pay for those pills You dont even have to care about Hobby Lobby You dont even shop there This outrage is a symptom of a dependent society where no demand can be denied Were creating a nation of entitlement bots And they screech and they yell when they cant get your way every time Well get this  you cant get your way everyone Its called arts and crafts  its Hobby Lobby Its about arts and crafts Its not about abortion pills BECKEL But it is about religion  it isnt about government Its about religion  PERINO And whether you have the freedom of it BECKEL Now I have a right I think to have my Viagra pills covered They were not covered under this bill GUTFELD But why not Because thats a health concern for you BECKEL I  exactly right I think you know at 500 bucks for 15 of them thats pretty expensive GUTFELD And thats cost prohibitive Thats not like birth control pills which is 70 bucks a month So youre paying five to six times more for something But the problem is your Democratic Party doesnt care about you because you dont form the base Youre not a feminist BECKEL Well  CROSSTALK PERINO Let me ask let me just mention  let me mention something else Greg said that you cant always get what you want And President Obama one of the reasons Eric hes in this position is because instead of the Congress writing this into law they had the Health and Human Services Department write it as part of a rule So executive action is not as strong as congressional action and maybe the president thought that he had to do this on his own because he thinks Congress doesnt do enough Thats one of the reasons they are in this position So the answer by the government is to say well since we got this pushed back and the president again will not try to ask Congress to fix it hes going to try to do it on his own through executive action BOLLING Isnt it amazing the white house this afternoon the president may address this through executive I mean executive action correct me if Im wrong used to be things like lets declare I dont know next Tuesday national donut day or some important stature died and will fly the flags at halfstaff Now its like were going to revamp the whole economic system Were going to revamp you know how corporations are treated who gets religious freedom and who doesnt I think its really ridiculous that President Obama  you know weve been talk about it later hes going to do that with immigration too I mean what  BECKEL What president doesnt use executive action  PERINO Well I think a lot of presidents do but I do think there is a responsibility on behalf of the executive whoever it is in office to craft executive actions that can actually hold up in court GUILFOYLE Right PERINO And when they do not to accept that and say OK we disagree with the ruling but we accept it because the Supreme Court has spoken	Kimberly I want to get your take on the other thing The last day of a Supreme Court session is always a fire drill for the White House because there are a lot of decisions Before we go I want to touch base on this other one which is a Supreme Court again ruling 54 about public sector unions In Illinois  this is about home health care workers and whether or not they were going to be compelled to have to give a fee to the unions There are health care workers who say they didnt want and the unions said well we dont have to represent you when we do contracts The Supreme Court said were going to agree with the health care workers Do I have that right GUILFOYLE Yes you got it right exactly I mean were just going to send you to the Supreme Court and you hang out with Shannon Bream whos doing such a good job She did a great job today So yes I think this is something that obviously the unions arent going to be too happy about in my opinion you know But this has been I think a number of very consistent rulings coming out of the court in terms of what they have been doing If you see this as a steady stream here of consistency because the one off was Obamacare right PERINO The big one GUILFOYLE That surprised everybody It was just like shocking	Nobody kind of really saw that coming But with respect to what they did today I think it was in good keeping with sticking with the Constitution with really observing the laws and following them So thats what I like about it BECKEL So the home health care workers take advantage of what unions negotiate both in terms of fees and other benefits and yet they dont have to join the union or pay a fee PERINO Dont pay a fee right BECKEL So as far as Im concerned if youre a home hearth worker 	 screw you you go out there and get whatever you can get in the free market BOLLING Or theres no reason to be in the union BECKEL Why ride on the backs of the union Why ride on the backs  GUTFELD They dont want to be in the union BECKEL But they ride on the backs of them GUTFELD They dont want to ride on the backs of anybody I know thats hard to believe BECKEL They get the same benefits that the union negotiated PERINO Well I think also because the unions typically about 98 percent Greg of the union fees if they make political donations  GUTFELD Go to the Democrats PERINO  go to Democrats GUTFELD Thats why the Dems are upset because this is how you mug people and you get the loot and you give it to Democrats Thats all its about It would be awesome to be a Democrat Nobody wants to give you money You just take it from them CROSSTALK BECKEL Let the rest of them go to work for themselves GUTFELD Thats what everybodys wanted BECKEL OK dont ask for the same benefits the unions get GUILFOYLE Why arent they entitled BECKEL If they negotiated fine BOLLING Bob you want to let the unions play their union game  knock yourself out But then start taxing them because they have no reason to be taxexempt under 501 4 but they get the 501c4 tax exemption and meanwhile theyre  BECKEL And meanwhile they are political groups They are  98 percent 96 whatever percent is going to the Democratic Party That is a	 thats more of a super PAC than unions GUILFOYLE Well maybe people dont be subjected  BOLLING Then dont join the union if you dont want to do that But dont ride on their backs to take their benefits GUILFOYLE But Bob why are they not equally entitled to get good benefits as workers BECKEL Because they dont sit on the table and negotiated thats why GUILFOYLE My point is unless you subject yourself to the union shakedown then youre not entitled to good benefits and good wage CROSSTALK BECKEL Youre on your own and negotiated GUILFOYLE No Thats a bully tactic BOLLING INAUDIBLE saying if youre not participating in the economy like paying your tax part of spending in government then you shouldnt get government services BECKEL No I just say  if youre not willing to join collectively to negotiate your benefits and your salary  BOLLING And not willing to pay BECKEL Then go do it yourself Do it in your living room CROSSTALK GUTFELD And the union is really amenable to people not being in their union They are so nice about that PERINO Well if youre not in the union then you have to pay the fee which also goes to the union GUTFELD Exactly PERINO OK The Supreme Court always interesting and  GUTFELD Not really PERINO  the last stop on the line I think its extremely interesting and you  we appreciated ph your participation GUTFELD OK PERINO OK Some breaking news today overseas as well The Israeli military has found the bodies of three missing teens more than two weeks after they were abducted in the West Bank Israel blamed Hamas for this disappearance SPECIAL REPORT will have more information on that story at 600 pm Up next on The Five President Obama broke his silence on immigration reform this afternoon He says he will once again go around Congress when The Five returns COMMERCIAL BREAK GUILFOYLE President Obama took to the Rose Garden this afternoon to inform the public hes ready to act alone on immigration reform BEGIN VIDEO CLIP BARACK OBAMA PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES Today Im beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own without congress As a first step Im directing the secretary of homeland security and the attorney general to move available and appropriate resources from our interior to the border Ive also directed Secretary Johnson and Attorney General Holder to identify additional actions my administration can take on our own within my existing legal authorities to do what Congress refuses to do and fix as much of our immigration system as we can If Congress will not do their job at least we can do ours END VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE All right Well this latest move comes less than a week after the Supreme Court slapped down the president for overstepping his executive authority Speaker John Boehner released a statement in response to Obamas announcement saying he wont help the president move forward with immigration reform because quote the American people and their elected officials dont trust him to enforce the law as written So once again we have the president calling on my favorite person on the planet Eric Holder to help him Tell me what I can do Tell me  and he said specifically  to act within the law within his authority	Now keep in mind this is in the wake of a brushback from the Supreme Court saying listen youre confusing the whole separation of powers and what Congress does and what the president should do and you cant overreach or overstep repeatedly like this PERINO So when I watched the president today I saw something different It was not stilted I thought he was passionate and from the heart Now a lot of the things he said I said well wait those wont bear out after you reread the speech and all of this sinks in But for a presidential statement the only thing I wouldnt have done is have Joe Biden there because I liked that the president was not on the teleprompter and telling it like it is as he sees it I do think theres a couple of things that he can do In 2007 when President Bush wanted to do comprehensive immigration reform the one thing that he said that he could do from his standpoint was to send some of the National Guard down the border to try to enforce some things I think that President Obama did not go that far today but the Department of Homeland Security might end up asking for that because what the president failed to talk about today is the specific tragedy and the urgency at the situation that is on the border right now that is a direct result of inaction and also some action on his behalf of suggesting to people that if they came over they were going to be OK What I dont like about this I believe that the president if he goes forward with executive action it will not be strong enough It will not be good enough And we will continue in this realm of uncertainty which is not fair to citizens or to our businesses and the economy And its not fair to the immigrants either because they will continue to live with the uncertainty that he says that he cares about GUILFOYLE Well you know I think were going to end the block lets go to break Anyone else  Bob is taking a nap Bolling BECKEL No Im not taking a nap First of all brushback that youre talking about was one of the narrowest of executive orders Three day set of recess so that you cant compare that to this PERINO Were just talking about Hobby Lobby today BECKEL Huh PERINO Were talking about Hobby Lobby and the union one BECKEL I thought you were talking about the one where the court ruled 90 he couldnt make his appointment PERINO No on the executive OK BECKEL But you know heres a situation where you got thousands and thousands of children who are fleeing from the highest murder capital rates in the world or at least in the Western Hemisphere They are here They are here because I think their parents are trying to make them safe We have a responsibility as citizens and as human beings to take care of them And the idea of taking these children and putting them back in El Salvador where they can get shot and bludgeoned and raped is absolutely obscene GUILFOYLE Ay ay ay CROSSTALK GUILFOYLE No one is suggesting that You just make it sound so barbaric Thats not the situation Lets just think about it and do something BECKEL I heard Republicans say that we ought to send them back CROSSTALK GUILFOYLE All right Well theres one over here Lets talk to the guy in the center BECKEL Because its the law its the rule of law So Supreme Court says hey Obama cut the crap with the executive pen and a week later he comes back and he says Im going to subvert Congress 2 billion of resources and then Bob is hitting on something very important right here That  heres what the left wants to do President Obama wants to do and the left wants to do They want to declare these illegal immigrants refugees want to give them refugee status which means they want to say that they are fleeing from their home country for some religious or government persecution  what BECKEL Thats how most El Salvadorans got into this country under Ronald Reagan BOLLING But my point is you cant call all this  you might as well call 12 million people refugees now because once you do that theyll be more will come over and saying say heres my parents too heres my family too theyre refugees too Its not just for kids Youre opening up the floodgates GUILFOYLE Its never ending Thats the problem Its cyclical I want to get your thoughts on this real quick and then I want to move to the caliphate thats developed in a matter  GUTFELD Well I can help transition into the caliphate GUILFOYLE Thank you GUTFELD First of all this isnt about immigration Its about borders President Obama wants to take in borders rather than enforce borders Thats the problem And so what is happening is as we were about to talk about the caliphate that is intimately connected to our border Terror seeks the path of least resistance the hole in the fence The hole in the fence at	911 were the passports In this case it literally is a hole in the fence which we need to close If President Obama wants open borders and he wants to retreat from the world stage and he wants to end spy programs you might as well hand the suicide vest out at our border because youre making it incredibly easy for the people that flew into our buildings to just walk in and blow us up GUILFOYLE We need to play Thats the point So lets  this is the other imminent threat to the United States the Islamic extremists  BECKEL So lets get straight  children coming over here is opening the door for a bunch of people to bomb like 911 GUTFELD Exactly BECKEL God Almighty please CROSSTALK GUTFELD To accuse people who are worried about national security to hate kids I dont hate kids Well yes I do hate kids but I hate American kids But the fact is just because we want to have a safe border doesnt mean we want all these children to suffer We just want a process We want a process where we feel safe and then orderly immigration Were all for that Were for orderly immigration Not illegal immigration Theres a distinction Bob BECKEL There is a distinction youre right And I just want to be sure that if we get  look at the record and find out what Republicans said when Ronald Reagan let El Salvadorans come in here en masse PERINO Well I think that is worth looking at but I also think that looking at changes  the countrys changed and developed right Thats what you always want to look at the new context and have a living Constitution and change that I think that there might have been  there were a lot of merits for that in 1988 I also think the problem is that President Obama today is talking about executive action that would deal not with the urgency situation and the triage the executive action hes talking is a bigger comprehensive bill which is what John Boehner said thats what we dont trust you on because they dont have reason to trust him BECKEL Why dont they pass a bill I wonder PERINO Why doesnt Harry Reid call the bills that House has passed BECKEL Well I mean there seem to me to be somewhat general agreement on immigration reform Why not bring  seriously Im not fighting this I was wondering why dont we bring it up PERINO Make them vote So thats what the president is saying have an upordown vote GUILFOYLE All right Well that was interesting discussion Thats what we do here on The Five We take it where the conversation leads us Tomorrow were going to discuss more about Iraq and ISIS which as you know has seized much of northern Syria declaring a caliphate	Fascinating story how quickly this has evolved in a matter of weeks Coming up conservative Internet icon Matt Drudge gives a rare interview He thinks the news business has gotten a little psychotic and a whole lot more And later Megyn Kelly is going to join us on set to preview her exclusive interview tonight with Bill Ayers Back in a moment COMMERCIAL BREAK BOLLING The Drudge Report is a massively popular news aggregating website It has such a reach it actually shapes the debate from politics to popular culture Conservative media and politicians use Drudge to form their own opinions The liberal posse uses Drudge to put a face on their enemy the conservative voice Founder and editor Matt Drudge spent a few minutes with his hometown radio station WTOP in DC Heres a rare and brief look into the mind of the man who has the pulse of America at his keyboard just a few strokes away Drudge on Drudge BEGIN VIDEO CLIP MATT DRUDGE FOUNDEREDITOR THE DRUDGE REPORT I go where the heat is Im a heatseeking missile I will go where the action is sometimes before its cool to do it Thats why I get in trouble You know I make waves I dont surf them as I used to say Its a little psychotic right now the news business because everybody is doing everything But that still doesnt mean there are not important events Theres information coming all of the time This is a vibrant era of media Its not going away any time soon END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING So Bob let me start with you Matt Drudge clearly one of the most popular websites on the planet Liberals must get  must be shaking in their boots when they see their name with a red siren circling around them BECKEL Well you cant  I mean you cant deny what this guy has done I mean he was the first one out Hes done  he has an enormous following And hes got  he really set the tone for everybody else to come along So I dont  I mean I dont begrudge Drudge PERINO I like it BECKEL I dont begrudge Drudge But I think his point about sensing something was going to happen is I also have that feeling about it as well and he sort of points to the border And I think that thats  he may be right about that This may be a much bigger issue by the time the summer is over BOLLING Well get that in a second Dana when you were in the White House the siren PERINO I like that story GUILFOYLE Tell the story PERINO When youre in the press office or anywhere within the White House you like  even if you dont like it you have to go to the Drudge Report because if theres a siren and your name is attached to it you know your day has just changed dramatically often not for the better He has  Drudge has hilariously clever and biting headlines And then you can go there over and over again all day long like I used to do in England during  with dialup permanent service that I didnt know about I admit it I am a Drudge addict BOLLING Yes I am too PERINO Drudge it does drive the news BOLLING Not only the headlines But the pictures Drudge finds the most  the absolute perfect picture to the story where you go wow The pictures tell the story GUTFELD But sometimes you know it is  it can be misleading click bait I remember I clicked on the red siren and it was actually a sale on red sirens That just angered me so much The most vital people in society are the people that are demonized by academia the mainstream media and Hollywood They just hate it because he somehow polevaulted over this wall of interference that we all face to directly reach common people and the media at the same time Do you know what he did for a living before this PERINO I dont remember GUTFELD Nobody does He worked at a gift shop He worked at the CBS gift shop PERINO Spencer Gifts GUTFELD No CBS gift shop This guy is such a recluse he makes Greta Garbo look like an extrovert BECKEL His own  is there any original content I dont  Im just asking PERINO Every once in a while very rarely they might do a short editorial GUTFELD And its the ugliest website ever made GUILFOYLE Because its so simple BOLLING Between the headlines the siren the pictures and the placement of the story PERINO Right GUILFOYLE You know youre having a bad day when one of our divorces is on there That happened to me CROSSTALK BECKEL  they have a blog for that BOLLING The left also has to tune into Drudge GUILFOYLE Everybody has to Its like its appointment viewing	Just put your screen right in front And this is what I love about it It actually educates people OK Because instead of people wondering whats going on today they can go there and get it all and actually speak intelligently and understand whats going on in the political landscape I like it I think its very informative Its  I love the way he aggregates the stories And its interesting You feel youre in Washington Even if youre not on the Hill you feel like youre there PERINO Its one stop shopping BECKEL I think Ive turned Drudge on exactly two times BOLLING You know what Bobby Ten billion visitors over the last year Phenomenal success Still ahead comedian Chris Rock did a whole racial skit mocking white people last night at the BET Awards Would that kind of humor racial humor fly in reverse Next on The Five COMMERCIAL BREAK GUTFELD So the Black Entertainment Awards aired last night Im sure you caught our live coverage One highlight a black comedian named Chris Rock  I hear hes an upandcomer Im not sure  interviews Caucasians at a monster truck rally about their knowledge of the awards	It was like shooting whales in an aboveground pool BEGIN VIDEO CLIP CHRIS ROCK COMEDIAN Welcome to the BET Awards Yes Whats your favorite show on BET UNIDENTIFIED MALE It would help if I knew what BET was ROCK Well BET is Black Entertainment Television Do you think Macklemore should win a BET award UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE But its Black Entertainment Television so I dont know if he can be nominated ROCK Im going to pop some END VIDEO CLIP GUTFELD Pretty easy to do but also truthful and funny But I know what youre thinking if you did the opposite youd be vilified What if Jeff Dunham went to the BETs and asked about NASCAR or Jeff Foxworthy asked about Duck Dynasty or I showed up to ask about Nickelback I never would Who knows The fact is its called Black Entertainment Television which tells you what is it and who its for There is no White Entertainment Television because frankly thats most of television But even if it were not called BET would whites know most of these artists Probably not although Lionel Ritchie won an award and even Dana has danced on that ceiling Chris Rock illustrates a simple truth while there is some overlap we like different things different things that look and sound like us Well unless they dont then we like them even more BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ROCK Have you ever dated a black woman UNIDENTIFIED MALE I wish ROCK Have you tried to date a black woman UNIDENTIFIED MALE Yes ROCK What do they tell you UNIDENTIFIED MALE She didnt say much She basically just walked off ROCK You only tried it once UNIDENTIFIED MALE I was afraid after that She was scary ROCK Im afraid of black women too END VIDEO CLIP GUTFELD Ah unity See laughing at things that make us different is way better than crying about it Besides thats what white liberal entertainment television is for otherwise known as MSNBC So I want to  I want to just throw this out there What did everybody think of the BET Awards last night Just go around the table	What did you think of it PERINO I missed it You make a good point I didnt even know they were on until I heard you were doing a monolog about it  Bob BECKEL I was with a black woman I dont know what everybody else was doing GUILFOYLE Oh my God GUTFELD That actually was an honest answer GUILFOYLE Nineteen minutes left in the show BECKEL Its true I was GUTFELD You know Kimberly Chris Brown joined Lil Wayne to perform Loyal That was the surprise of the evening dont you think GUILFOYLE Obviously I didnt see it OK Call me out I was too busy producing the Puerto Rican Entertainment Awards also known as my apartment Do you want a frontrow seat GUTFELD I dont know All right Eric GUILFOYLE Bolling is holding his head down like this GUTFELD August Alsina performed his new single with Brown and Trey Songz Kissin on My Tattoos I know you told me you were looking forward to that BOLLING I was GUILFOYLE You know Macklemore BOLLING I do I do know Macklemore Look  look its funny Right Its comedy Its funny Im all for it I dont feel bad about that I just wish that the other side would feel the same way if someone else did it in reverse GUILFOYLE I like it Im with you I like it BECKEL I cant imagine a white comedian trying to pull that off at the Black Entertainment Television Awards BOLLING If it were funny would that be OK BECKEL Well it would be funny  look Just face the fact that were different cultures Theyve got  they like it  and weve got things that we like and I only crossed on certain things PERINO Thats what I love about America that we can actually laugh about our vulnerabilities and its funny Like you cant do that anywhere else in the world You cannot have this funny conversation and laugh about it GUTFELD Its changing though There are many people who PERINO Not on this show GUTFELD  who do not find things as funny as we do All right Next up Megyn Kelly  not sure who that is  is going to join us and tell us what its like to interview unrepentant domestic terrorist Bill Ayers Her full interview airs tonight Megyns going to be here in a minute COMMERCIAL BREAK BECKEL Finally a song I know Theres a big interview tonight on The Kelly File We played you a sneak peek of it on Friday and weve got another clip for you now Heres part of Megyns exclusive sitdown with former Weather Underground leader Bill Ayers BEGIN VIDEOTAPE MEGYN KELLY FOX NEWS ANCHOR You realize people could have been hurt You admitted that in an interview BILL AYERS FORMER WEATHER UNDERGROUND ACTIVIST They could have been but thank God they werent And we made every attempt not to and they werent KELLY Do you appreciate the recklessness of that AYERS I dont say it wasnt reckless KELLY Who are you to potentially endanger the lives of those individuals that were in or around the building AYERS And I dont say it wasnt illegal It was illegal We crossed lines of legality KELLY Its not about legality Its so much bigger than that AYERS We crossed lines of legality KELLY You could have murdered somebody with those bombs AYERS And we didnt But actually the people who were conducting the war in Vietnam did actually murder people KELLY And so the answer is then to make yourself a murderer as well END VIDEO CLIP BECKEL The host of The Kelly File is here with us now to tell us what else we can expect Megyn welcome to The Five KELLY Thanks Bob BECKEL Why did Bill Ayers pick out your show on the FOX network to do his first interview I dont get that KELLY He clearly had not done a Google search of Megyn Kelly GUTFELD It really bombed KELLY Bahdumbump You know what We invited him on to come on with Dinesh DSouza for a July 4th special that were going to air on The Kelly File about Dineshs new movie And in that movie Dinesh interviews all sorts of folks on the left about their ideology about America and he and Ayers had had a debate at Dartmouth College not long ago And I thought it was interesting I watched the whole thing Late in my office one night Im sitting there watching that which is why I have no life In any event I thought why dont we ask him Lets ask him if hell come on and debate Dinesh and talk to me about his own past and he said yes BECKEL What happened to Dinesh KELLY He sat out that segment GUILFOYLE You took his place KELLY It was interesting because listen weve done a lot of interviews so far but as I was saying before we got started that is the first one where 30 minutes straight no one on the team interrupted me	Everyone just watched You could hear a pin drop in that studio And when it was over the word was riveting because how often do you hear a guy who bombed America repeatedly sit and be held to account And heres the thing When I looked into Bill Ayers  and I have to give credit to my team because we spent weeks preparing for this getting all the brandnew information and everything he ever did All of his books and all of the books about him that was the key Because Ayers is very quick to accept responsibility for the stuff he wants to admit he did right Property damage as he says He bombed the US Capitol the Pentagon the New York City police headquarters the list goes on and on Thats all fine because no one was hurt But theres other information about times people were hurt and even murdered by people affiliated with his group and that we had some real tense exchanges GUTFELD Didnt you want to jerk that earring out of his ear and feed it to him the wrong way GUILFOYLE Oh boy KELLY I did it with my words GUILFOYLE Thats why youre better than I am PERINO Most people when you  when youre a public speaker like he is even if he is reluctant in some ways you usually have a goal when you go into an interview Like you want to accomplish something You want to sell something You want to explain something What  what do you think hes trying to prove KELLY Nothing I think he wanted to have the intellectual debate about America that we had between Ayers and DSouza which will air on the July 4 special And he doesnt really have a lot of problem talking about his past Hes written two books about it However this is the first time certainly hes been held to account in this way I mean I read all of his interviews in print I watched all of the ones he did in sitdown fashion And no one has ever  the problem with interviewing Bill Ayers is hes smart and hes very philosophical	And he has spent 40plus years talking about what he did So hes an expert at defending his actions But no one  so I went at it sort of as a lawyerjournalist and I just took him through point by point I didnt need to have a philosophical debate with this  with him about this The actions speak for themselves Lets go through and lets go through the proof and lets go through the allegations the things he admitted that we found that he had forgotten he admitted back in the 70s that I showed to him in some explosive exchanges BOLLING Megyn did you get into  and this is what I would love to see  did you get into his relationship with Barack Obama KELLY Of course Yes I had to ask about that BOLLING Where was that Because Barack Obama when he ran for president kind of distanced himself from Bill Ayers and now we found out BECKEL Hes EXPLETIVE DELETED with Bill Ayers BOLLING But apparently we find out since then that there was a lot more relation  there was a lot more boards they served on GUILFOYLE Interaction BOLLING They had a lot of ideology that was similar GUTFELD They got married in Vermont BOLLING Or that What was  give us a little take KELLY I will say that the part about Obama President Obama airs tomorrow night So I dont want to give too much away because its going to air in two parts Most is tonight but some for tomorrow And so I asked him what the relationship was like how close they were And I also asked him whether President Obama has ever contacted him since George Stephanopoulos infamously  well you have to tune in tomorrow GUILFOYLE I have a question for you Just the fact that to me when I see a guy like that and you know his crude bombs that he made how is he even any different How does he distinguish himself from like the Tsarnaev brothers with their pressure cookers To me they are one and the same KELLY I specifically asked him questions along those lines And the more he tried to justify them Kimberly and youll see this part tonight	I told him specifically You know who you sound like Osama bin Laden GUILFOYLE Yes KELLY You sound like Adolf Hitler trying to justify GUILFOYLE Was he BECKEL OK KELLY Yes he does Trying to justify the means by pointing to the ends His whole thing is 6000 people a week were being murdered in Vietnam and everything I did I did to call attention to that BECKEL OK We want to thank you Megyn for coming on and joining us Also everybody decide what the definition of friendship is when you watch Megyn tomorrow talking about the relationship with Barack Obama And well catch your full interview tonight with Bill Ayers at 9 pm Eastern One More Thing is up next KELLY Thanks COMMERCIAL BREAK PERINO Time now for One More Thing Greg is next GUTFELD Its time  I havent banned a phrase in a while Leaving that aside You know when you ask a question and somebody says leaving that aside that translate into what Im about to say next has absolutely nothing to do with your question because I actually dont have an answer PERINO I like that GUTFELD Banned Dont use it or I will come and kill you PERINO OK Leaving that aside Eric youre next BOLLING OK so I got a letter today I just want to do this right	I got this from a border agent Tom Former border agent Tom Just wanted to thank you again for sticking up for American values Stay the course You have an immensely strong backing out there He said If DC would just let us do our job the borders would be stronger and better GUILFOYLE Thats actually a very nice hat BOLLING Love this hat GUILFOYLE Nice fit I mean I thought we had budget problems Its gorgeous PERINO Kimberly Please amaze us with your One More Thing now GUILFOYLE You mean how Greg amazes us with his banned phrases GUTFELD I think youre being sarcastic GUILFOYLE You know banned phrases So Pippa Middleton look at that beauty huh At the wedding the whole big buzz became Pippa and her cute little bum Do you like it now GUTFELD Were in America GUILFOYLE I dont care GUTFELD We dont have royalty GUILFOYLE Were allies GUTFELD Our loyalty is to the Kardashians GUILFOYLE Can we go to the sound please BEGIN VIDEO CLIP PIPPA MIDDLETON KATE MIDDLETONS SISTER It was completely unexpected You know I think the gown was not really fit to be a significant dress really just to sort of blend in within the train And I found it flattering The dress was almost meant to be insignificant END VIDEO CLIP GUTFELD Oh Pippa GUILFOYLE They are mocking my Pippa We have a Pippa here too	Shes a little UNINTELLIGIBLE All right So heres the deal Do you like royalty watching Why not GUTFELD I like George Brett PERINO Bob youre next Save us BECKEL Well Pennsylvania had another gun show and the guy who ran it was Jeffrey Hawk 44 And this is one of the National Rifle Associations great ideas to keep these gun shows operating Nobody has to have any backup to buy a gun there A lot of these illegal guns get through there So what happens Mr Hawk rather was showing a woman how to use a concealed weapon and he shot her He just got indicted Good thing NRA you probably want to GUTFELD Feel safer at a gun show than  safer at a gun show than at a movie theater Feel safer at a gun show than on streets of Santa Barbara CROSSTALK BOLLING  in a gun show Yes you do BECKEL Thats right Sign up for the NRA GUILFOYLE Run for the border PERINO I had a great One More Thing Im going to

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/05/15/big-wins-tuesday-re-energize-tea-party/, The Tea Party movement would like to make clear that reports of its death have been greatly exaggerated Victories this week by Tea Partybacked candidates in Nebraska and West Virginia Republican primaries are helping to reinvigorate the movement which some had written off amid a difficult campaign season But as its own members point out whether the movement is winning primaries or not its hard to argue its smallgovernment message has faded     Famous or infamous Tea Partyaligned lawmakers in Congress continue to play a strong role in the direction of the party Polls of conservatives consistently show figures like Sens Rand Paul RKy and Ted Cruz RTexas as political favorites in a hypothetical 2016 race And it is those figures who keep the Republican Party something of an evolving force  Paul arguably made drones a bipartisan issue and also filed a lawsuit this year against the administration over NSA surveillance pushing the GOP to rethink the balance between security and privacy Political pundits love to roleplay as coroners but they arent very good at it Tea Party Express Executive Director Taylor Budowich said after wins Tuesday night in Nebraska and West Virginia The mainstream media has been pushing the recycled Tea Party is Dead headlines but tonights results show how again theyve got it wrong What these pundits dont understand is  the broad appeal of the Tea Partys message of fiscal responsibility and economic growth In Nebraska the primary victory by Republican Senate candidate Ben Sasse should help his party in November retain the open seat  he is immediately considered the favorite for the seat held by retiring GOP Sen Mike Johanns In West Virginia former Maryland GOP chairman Alex Mooney won the Republican primary with spending help from such outside groups as the Madison Fund the Senate Conservatives Fund and Tea Party Express The Tea Party is optimistic about winning both general election races  with Mooneys 2nd Congressional District being a Republican stronghold and Sasse a former Bush administration official rebuffing the kind of fringecandidate label that dogged some unsuccessful Tea Party candidates in 2012 In addition Tea Party leaders are touting the narrow victory Tuesday by Nebraska GOP Rep Lee Terry for a House seat he is expected to keep and Florida businessman Curt Clawsons victory last month in a special election for the House seat left by Republican Trey Radel Still it is becoming clear this year that the Tea Party will struggle to repeat its past record of ousting highprofile Republican incumbents in the primaries Hopes in the movement are fading that Kentucky businessman Matt Bevin will knock off Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell next Tuesday and that Mississippi state Sen Chris McDaniel will upset US Sen Thad Cochran first elected to Congress in 1973 Also last week its preferred candidate libertarianleaning physician Greg Brannon lost to establishment candidate and state House speaker Thom Tillis in a North Carolina Senate primary That loss made Tuesdays victories all the more important as the primary season kicks into full swing With the help of national groups like Tea Party Express the 42yearold McDaniel is trying to portray himself as a Washington outsider in his race against Cochran However recent polls show Cochran who remains popular in part for the billions in federal dollars he has brought home holds a doubledigit lead with the June 3 primary just weeks away On Wednesday the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund tried to bring the energy from the Mooney and Sasse wins into the race Cochran says he doesnt even know what the Tea Party is group Chairman Jenny Beth Martin said in a fundraising email to supporters McDaniel needs more help on the ground We need the funds to recruit more volunteers to get them to Mississippi Some in the socalled GOP establishment have been vocal about their desire to keep untested Tea Party candidates out of the November elections Republicans are looking for candidates with enough mainstream appeal to help them win a net six Senate races in November to take control of the upper chamber McConnell and other GOP candidates  including Idaho Rep Mike Simpson who next Tuesday is defending against a Tea Party primary challenge  also have deeppocketed outside support from such groups as the US Chamber of Commerce In January the Chamber vowed to back probusiness candidates against Tea Partystyle opponents  largely in response to conservative lawmakers fueling last years partial government shutdown fight In 2014 the chamber will work to protect and expand a probusiness majority in the House and advance our position and our influence in the Senate said chamber President and CEO Tom Donohue We will support candidates who want to work within the legislative process To be sure the Tea Party groups behind the 2010 wave election that helped Republicans take control of the House have also backed GOP candidates not quite ready for prime time  including Senate candidate Sharron Angle who unsuccessfully challenged Harry Reid in Nevada and Richard Mourdock whose statements on abortion and rape essentially scuttled his bid in 2012 Still national Tea Party groups sounded confident this

 Brown hits Shaheen Obama on ISIS in new ad
 The climate sure did change for the Obama presidency
 Baier Tracks Now for the tough part
 Landrieu Kegstands the way we roll
 Well that was easy     BROWN HITS SHAHEEN OBAMA ON ISIS IN NEW AD
In a new ad New Hampshire Republican Senate nominee Scott Brown ties border security the threat from ISIS and that Sen Jeanne Shaheen DNH and President Obama are confused about the threat from Islamist militants The campaign wouldnt provide details on the exact size of the buy a campaign spokeswoman told Fox News First that the spots would air on WMUR WBIN cable outlets and Boston stations

Hard words  Heres the script from Brown speaking directly to camera and interspersed with images of ISIS fighters and other scary scenes Anyone who turns on the TV these days know we faces challenges to our way of life Radical Islamic terrorists are threatening to cause the collapse of our country President Obama and Senator Shaheen seem confused about the nature of the threat  not me I want to secure the border keep out the people who would do us harm and restoreAmericas leadership in the world Im Scott Brown and I approve this message Becauseprotectingthe homeland is the first step in makingAmericastrong again

Sen Jeanne Shaheen has agreed to appear at four of the seven debate offers Brown has accepted Complicating matters for Shaheen is that Democrat Gov Maggie Hassan has accepted seven debates with Republican challenger Walt Havenstein

Risk or reward  Brown has gained greatly in the polls on the issues of border security and foreign policy New Hampshire is a hawkish state to be sure But with the spot coming just as Obama escalates the war with ISIS into Syria will the message sound like Brown is not rallying to the commander in chief Part of the calculation here may be that Shaheen has struggled with the issue and may not want to call attention to her support for or disagreement with the presidents policies

Politico The New Hampshire Republican Party adopted Saturday a socially conservative party platform that supports the preborn childs fundamental right to life and personhood under the Fourteenth Amendment  In an emailed statement a Brown aide made clear that the former Massachusetts senator does not agree with the personhood language

THE CLIMATE SURE DID CHANGE FOR THE OBAMA PRESIDENCY
President Barack Obama is speaking in New York today on what was supposed to be his number one foreign policy initiative for his second term global warming But despite a promise of more executive action this time in the form of requiring agencies to factor carbon emissions into all decisions the general concept is a bust None of the leaders of the other main carbon emitters are taking the meeting are scheduled to show up to meet with the president Instead of announcing penandphonebased progress designed to rouse liberal voters for midterms Obamas day instead will be dominated by something he surely did not foresee when he spoke of a carbonbased second term expanding the war against Islamist militants to yet another Middle Eastern nation Rather than catnip for his base Obama today is offering liberals a sour serving of promises that this latest conflict will not expand again and that he will limit US commitments for the future

Importantly climate change without being connected in that way to everybodys daily thinking in fact ranks right up there with every single one of the rest of those challenges You can make a powerful argument that it may be in fact the most serious challenge we face on the planet because its about the planet itself  Secretary of State John Kerry in remarks Monday comparing global warming to terrorism poverty and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction

Biden literally warned that Romney would go to war in Syria if elected  CBS News Two months before the 2012 presidential election Vice President Biden warned on the campaign trail that Mitt Romney wanted to go to war with Syria The video which was posted byBuzzFeed was of Biden speaking to supporters at a rally in York Pa on Sept 2 2012 He said it was a mistake to set an end date for our warriors in Afghanistan and bring them home He implies by the speech that hes ready to go to war in Syria and Iran Biden said in his speech In the speech Biden also accused Romney of wanting to move from cooperation to confrontation with Putins Russia

Theyll try not to rub it in too much  President Obama is set to speak today at the Clinton Global Initiative at the behest of former president Bill Clinton and 2016 Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton and the timing is awkward The former president reiterated Sunday his wifes previous chiding of Obama for not engaging in Syria sooner Obama will be obliged to speak more on the subject so it will be time for some careful tealeaf reading to see just how strained relationship is between the two rival powers in the Democratic Party

Politico Hillary Clinton will headline a fundraising dinner for Florida Democratic gubernatorial Charlie Crist next month putting her in a key presidential state in the midterms battle according to an invitation

BAIER TRACKS NOW FOR THE TOUGH PART
What looks like a successful first night of airstrikes inside Syria with the help of five Arab allies leads immediately to one question Whats next A senior US official who is involved in the mission offered me an assessment of the first sorties in Syria The strikes resulted in infrastructure damage to the groups unfortunately they can take over new buildings Assessing exactly who was killed at this time its too early to say definitively The unfortunate consequence of going after the enemy like this is that they will now adapt and targeting will likely become more challenging

That last line is very important While there are probably a few nights worth of hard targets to strike in the ISIS infrastructure what officials call the low hanging fruit  the real challenge will be to root out and target the members of the groups leadership as they go to ground and try to hide inside urban centers That next step will require whats called low flying tactical ISR or Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance flights  AND more importantly spotters on the ground who can pinpoint targets

That would be a pretty difficult task for the Free Syrian Army boots on the ground It will likely require US eyes and ears That is the tough part that lies ahead if the US is really going to degrade and then destroy ISIS  Bret Baier

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/05/08/ex-hgtv-hosts-if-our-faith-costs-us-tv-show-so-be-it/,The Benham Brothers The Home  Garden Television aka HGTV network announced Wednesday it has decided to pull the plug on an upcoming real estate reality show amid a firestorm of controversy from gay rights activists who accused the evangelical Christian hosts of being antigay and prolife Twins David and Jason Benham had been in production for Flip it Forward a show that was expected to debut in October on the nations seventh mostwatched cable channel According to Entertainment Weekly the North Carolina brothers would have followed families creating their dream homes from fixeruppers     After the network announced the show was on the fall lineup the militant lobbying group Right Wing Watch labeled David Benham son of wellknown evangelical pastor Flip Benham an antigay extremist and reported on comments he made about homosexuality abortion and divorce So now these militant groups are going to start judging us based on the past behavior of our parents I reached out the Benham brothers Wednesday If our faith costs us a television show then so be it they wrote in a statement to me The Benhams who are graduates of Liberty University said they were saddened to hear about HGTVs decision With all of the grotesque things that can be seen and heard on television you would think there would be room for two twin brothers who are faithful to our families committed to biblical principles and dedicated professionals they wrote Id be willing to bet thats what the Robertson family of AEs Duck Dynasty fame thought too HGTV refuses to say why they decided not to go forward with the show At 12pm ET they said this on Twitter HGTV has decided not to move forward with the Benham Brothers series But their decision was announced after Right Wing Watch published a scathing attack on the brothers They reported that David Benham led a prayer rally outside the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte in 2012 They also took issue with comments he made to Christian radio host Janet Mefferd about the rally We dont realize that okay if 87 percent of Americans are Christians and yet we have abortion on demand we have nofault divorce we have pornography and perversion we have a homosexuality and its agenda that is attacking the nation we have adultery we have all of the things we even have allowed demonic ideologies to take our universities and our public school systems while the church sits silent and just builds big churches Benham told the host We are so complacent we are so apathetic and we are very hypocritical in the church thats why the Bible says judgment begins in the house of God So when we prayed at 714 we asked God and our city to forgive us for allowing these things in the house of God Right Wing Watch also took issue with his support for a North Carolina amendment that protected traditional marriage and his support of the prolife movement Im shocked that

called to love our fellow man they wrote Anyone who suggests that we hate homosexuals or people of other faiths is either misinformed or lying Over the last decade weve sold thousands of homes with the guiding principle of producing value and breathing life into each family that has crossed our path and we do not nor will we ever discriminate against people who do not share our views they wrote Its too bad HGTV and those militant gay activists dont share similar guiding principles Salem Radio Network host Janet Mefferd told me this is a classic case of LGBT activists trying to marginalize and silence others This is an effort by LGBT movement to silence the voices of people who do not agree with them on this issue and to send a message to the American public that anybody who does not get on board with their point of view does not deserve a place in the public square she said Tom Tradup Salems vice president of news and talk programming denounced the attack on the Benham brothers In the 1950s Sen Joseph McCarthy terrorized Americans whose views differed from his  resulting in the infamous Hollywood blacklists and people losing their jobs in the radio and television industry he told me Sadly thanks to 2014style McCarthyism history appears to be repeating itself HGTVs statement is insufficient They owe it to their viewers to explain why Flip It Forward was canceled There may very well be another reason why they pulled the plug But right now it appears that they caved in to pressure from gay activists If thats the case it would make HGBT not only cowardly but also bigoted

not comment George 77 has been battling cancer and has said he believes the disease will end his life The popes choice for Chicago has been closely watched as his first major appointment in the US and the clearest indication yet of the direction he will steer American church leaders Cupich is a moderate and is not among US Roman Catholic bishops who have taken a harder line on hotbutton issues Francis has called for a greater focus on mercy and compassion instead of divisive social issues The Archdiocese of Chicago serves 22 million parishioners and is the thirdlargest diocese in the country Chicago archbishops are usually elevated to cardinal and are therefore eligible to vote for the next pope The Chicago church has long been considered a flagship of American Catholicism sparking lay movements of national influence and producing archbishops who shape national debate George is especially admired in the churchs conservative wing as an intellectual who took an aggressive stand against abortion gay marriage and other issues He had succeeded Cardinal Joseph Bernardin a liberal and hero to Catholics who place equal importance on issues such as abortion and poverty Cupich 65 is a native of Omaha Nebraska where he was ordained a priest He holds degrees from the Pontifical Gregorian University and The Catholic University of America He was appointed bishop of Rapid City South Dakota in 1998 and served there until 2010 when he was appointed to Spokane In a 2012 essay in the Jesuit magazine America Cupich said the US bishops rightly objected to the original narrow religious exemption in President Barack Obamas requirement that employers provide health insurance that covers contraception But Cupich called for a return to civility in conversations about religious liberty and society While the outrage to the government decision was understandable in the long run threats and condemnations have a limited impact Cupich said We should never stop talking to one another Cupich has also defended Francis views on the economy and emphasis on fighting poverty which some Catholics and others have criticized as naive and against capitalism Instead of approaching life from the 30thousandfeet level of ideas he challenges policy makers and elected officials   indeed all of us     to experience the life of everyday and real people Cupich said at a conference last June on the Catholic case against libertarianism Much like he told religious leaders Francis is saying that politicians and policy makers need to know the smell of the

Democrats strategy to survive a difficult 2014 midterm cycle was straightforward They would keep the Senate by nationalizing the failures of individual Republican candidates as they had done in 2010 and 2012 Democrats were searching for a candidate similar to Todd Akin Christine ODonnell or Sharron Angle to win a primary particularly in Georgia North Carolina or Mississippi Republicans though did not oblige them even amid a buffet of ideological bait on impeachment immigration and birthcontrol subsidies In fact it has been Democrats who have been delivering the weaponsgrade blunders in the home stretch of the midterm cycle We have been searching for this years Akin in the wrong party but now looking on the correct side of the aisle there are many many candidates Running away from the pink tennis shoes  The frontrunner for the Akin Prize for Undistinguished Campaigning would seem to be Wendy Davis Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Texas Her decision to run an attack ad about the accident that left her opponent confined to a wheelchair is probably the worst in a decade And like Akins musings on the female anatomy is easily transportable to other races In 2012 Democrats exploited Akins claim to clip other Republicans who supported the same abortion restrictions as he did Now it is all those like Sen Jeanne Shaheen DNH who once celebrated Davis in her heyday who are being asked whether wheelchair attack ads are appropriate And like Akin who initially refused to recant his claims on legitimate rape Davis is so far refusing to budge on her spot By the time Davis is eventually forced to back down who knows how much damage will have been done But thats not to say that Davis is the only nominee for the prize Lots of competition  Theres the guy running for Senate in Iowa who made fun of Iowa farmers a gaffe so heinous that it was still bringing down the house in a debate Sunday night Or theres the fellow who accused his opponent of being soft on Ebola and then vapor locked when asked about the topic Utterly Or the male candidate who opted to do a directtocamera ad talking about female reproductive health as part of a gynecological focus so intense that he would be dubbed Mark Uterus Speaking of bad ads how about the spot about a brutal rape and murder that was denounced by the victims family While Republicans have had their own residency problems the Democrats boast the only candidate who was forced to claim she lived with her parents in a bid to beat the rap And then theres the multistage catastrophe where Democrats engineered a candidate swap but discovered too late that their man was a plagiarist If Davis has a real rival for the prize though it is Alison Lundergan Grimes Kentucky wonder  Despite looking a bit spotty here and there Grimes was until last week a heroine for national Democrats She was keeping the wouldbe majority leader pinned down in a Kentucky shootout and leaving open the possibility a redtoblue flip She was a Clinton Democrat contending in a potently antiObama state and members of her party saw not just viability in this cycle but hope for a time beyond President Obama when they could broaden the electoral map But Grimes imploded last week as she stolidly attempted to not answer whether she had voted for the president It was bad How bad Ask The New Republic which declared Sunday that Grimes was running the worst Senate campaign of the year And given the competition thats saying something Make no mistake  Democrats though dont really need an Akin to struggle this year because they have Obama As the gloom deepens the blame is going straight to the top The chorus is growing for some kind of a shakeup in the woebegotten White House and in the postmortem on this years cycle it wont be necessary to find a scapegoat in an isolated Senate race The man in charge of the party will be held responsible especially as Clintonites look to outrun his legacy And if theres really one gaffe of the year the boss himself has to get the credit But make no mistake These policies are on the ballot every single one of them Thats exactly what Republicans have been saying for two years And Obama like Akin apparently doesnt see what was wrong with saying it WITH YOURSECOND CUP OF COFFEE

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/05/21/tea-party-over-lets-hope-not-gop-needs-movements-energy-balance/, Is the Tea Party washed up The country better hope not Like an unruly teenager the Tea Party movement got too big for its britches it has now been smacked into place Candidates who identified with the movement suffered bruising defeats in Kentucky Georgia and Idaho in Tuesdays GOP primaries on top of earlier thumpings in North Carolina and Ohio     The punditry and Republican leadership are applauding this smackdown pointless Tea Party efforts to shut down the government last year and equally useless assaults on senior party members like House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell put the fledgling group in establishment crosshairs with good reason Defeats suffered by Tea Party candidates should not be ignored The GOP needs the energy and conviction of the Tea Party After a crushing defeat in 2008 and with President George W Bush leaving office draped in some of the worst poll numbers in memory Republicans were on life support Just two years later the Tea Party produced an astonishing political turnabout  delivering to barelyelected President Obama one of the great shellacking in the countrys history Outraged over efforts to stem the financial crisis  the Stimulus TARP and Cash for Clunkers and so on  and the consequent damage to the nations fiscal picture the Tea Party took root ObamaCare was the potent fertilizer Rick Santellis memorable rant on CNBC about paying for losers mortgages and how the government was promoting bad behavior when it helped out homeowners who had gotten in over their heads hit a nerve across the country Hardworking men and women were fed up with the bailouts of banks and underwater homeowners they saw our nations debt and deficits soaring and rightly concluded that their kids futures were in jeopardy They wanted to know what the government was going to do for them Liberals including President Obama consistently underestimated the Tea Party even when that group engineered the almost unimaginable election of a Republican Scott Brown of Massachusetts  in the nations bluest state When thousands of protests sprang up around the country on tax day 2009 the president still didnt get it When midterm election time came Tea Partiers turned out in droves to make their voices heard Voter turnout in 2010 was nearly 42  the highest for a midterm election since 1982 The GOP captured 6 Senate seats and 63 seats in the House Liberals like to portray Tea Partiers as rightwing loons harboring extreme and dangerous views In some cases they are right Todd Akins legitimate rape comment Christine ODonnells forays into witchcraft or more recently Matt Bevins support for cock fighting delight latenight TV audiences and cause legitimate heartburn for the GOP But its important to remember that even the New York Times surveying Tea Party protesters found them wealthier and more educated than the general public These are middle class citizens who worry that their government is broken and that no one is standing up for their concerns and their values  The Tea Partys success in 2010 went to the collective heads of many involved in the movement or at least to the heads of those like Texas Senator Ted Cruz who believed he had won a mandate to shake up the Republican Party and to push for his views on social as well as fiscal issues Like an adolescent Cruz challenged the authority of his elders in a forum where tenure and hierarchy are respected He has won no friends but gained considerable notoriety His contributions to the government shutdown last fall hurt the Tea Party brand which recorded the lowest approval ratings in its short history and torpedoed Republican standing  all for naught  Cruz and others misread the success of the Tea Party Their blockbuster early results are not because they oppose abortion or samesex marriage voters were not rallying to their harsh views on immigration Their fame and winnings came from their stance against wasteful government spending and burgeoning deficits that threatened the countrys future They lit a flame of fiscal watchfulness  a flame that is flickering now as the crisis recedes but that will be fanned soon enough by growing deficits down the road The US needs that focus and the GOP needs that energy Why Because unhappily Americans see the Republican Party as too cozy with Big Business The Chamber of Commerce spent more than 12 million backing mainstream Republicans over Tea Party challengers attempting to snuff out its growing influence That unprecedented involvement in selecting candidates will only spur distrust While the interests of business leaders are often aligned with those of the average American  less regulation lower taxes a strong defense and so on  there are clearly instances where those paths diverge Americans rightly suspect the role of powerful corporations and unions in setting policy  why do we need tax breaks for NASCAR or guarantees for giant farms  The proliferation of lobbyists in Washington is alarming as is the selling of legislative favors It is also bipartisan but because Republicans tend to run candidates like Mitt Romney a successful and wealthy businessman instead of community activists like our current president the public identifies the GOP as more entrenched with the business community No one is going to leap from their Barcalounger to vote for Big Business They will however rally around average citizens trying to keep a lid on our governments spending and keep our country strong The Tea Party needs to return to its roots retrench and gather its momentum The GOP leadership in turn needs to work with leaders from the upstart movement The Tea Party brings muchneeded balance and energy to the table  Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNewscom She is a financial columnist who also writes for The Fiscal

 Global threats shredded Dem midterm playbook
 Q Poll shows Gardner stretching lead
 Vets group blasts Shaheen for reform brag
 Pryor crushed by Cotton in new poll
 Gross dude     GLOBAL THREATS SHREDDED DEM PLAYBOOK
How did Scott Brown push the New Hampshire Senate race from long shot to tossup Why did the Democratic plan to roil the election with an executive order on amnesty disappear What explains the shift toward the GOP among women Latinos and now even young adults When did the Democratic effort to make this an election about social issues fall apart The answer is as simple as a look at todays biggest story A series of national security catastrophes starting this summer reset the election and left Democrats in retreat instead of merely on defense Russian aggression chaos at the southern border Ebolas arrival in America and most of all the unraveling of Iraq and Syria at the hands of Islamist militants shredded the Democratic playbook When things got real a strategy based on micromarketing of wedge issues was untenable

President Obama campaigns today in Maine That probably sounded like a safer bet before headlines like this

Couldnt hear the siren  Republicans certainly seem to understand the dynamic of the election while Democrats couldnt quite wrap their heads around the issue set But if there is one thing that explains why the race is closing so poorly for Democrats it is the huge drop in Obamas handling of foreign affairs even after he reluctantly started a limited air campaign against the Islamists in Iraq and Syria And on Ebola while there is a partisan split on estimating the presidents handling of the crisis there is broad disagreement with his actual policies

The Judges ruling  Fox News Judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano weighs in on the constitutionality of the governments ability to quarantine Read it

Flipped  Given the difficulty of the overall environment it is not surprising that Democrats are getting desperate Like sweaty desperate Democrats are optimistic that nominating a hawkish former secretary of State in 2016 will help the blue team retake the high ground on foreign policy and national security It may work or we may be seeing a reversion to what was the political norm for most of the 50 years prior to the Iraq war Republicans are more trusted on national security while Democrats are more trusted on social welfare But for now Obamas handling of the crises of 2014 has left a party led by a man elected in large part for his foreign policy positions in the dumps

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/07/02/often-split-court-agrees-your-privacy-matters/,Supreme Court justices found more common ground than usual this year and nowhere was their unanimity more surprising than in a ruling that police must get a judges approval before searching the cell phones of people theyve arrested The term that just ended also had its share of 54 decisions with the familiar conservativeliberal split including Mondays ruling on religion birth control and the health care law     But the 90 cell phone decision last week may be the most consequential of the justices 67 rulings this term It signaled a high degree of skepticism about the governments authority without any need to satisfy an impartial judge to sweep up vast quantities of information that individuals store on computers and cell phones as well as other records that companies keep online The scope of that ruling will await future cases including possible challenges to NSAs surveillance and collection of massive amounts of Americans telephone records But the justices indicated that constitutional privacy protections embodied in the Fourth Amendment will apply strongly to cases involving computers and digital storage said Elizabeth Wydra the liberal Constitutional Accountability Centers chief counsel Chief Justice John Roberts opinion for the court was a broad and sweeping ruling in favor of privacy Wydra said The cell phone case was one of 42 in which the court was unanimous about the outcome either 90 or 80 in cases where a justice sat out That level of consensus is far higher than in recent terms The cases include highprofile disputes in which the administration could not attract a vote for its preferred result even from the two justices appointed by President Barack Obama Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor The court struck down Obamas recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board the 35foot buffer zone around Massachusetts abortion clinics and the criminal conviction under a chemical weapons treaty of a woman who tried to poison her husbands lover This was a huge rebuke for taking the very extreme positions the administration put before the court particularly for executive power grabs said Carrie Severino chief counsel of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network Yet as even Severino acknowledged the unanimity sometimes masked serious disagreement among the conservative justices about the grounds for the decisions In the recess appointments case Justice Anthony Kennedy joined with the liberal justices to endorse reasoning that preserved at least in theory the presidents authority to make the temporary recess appointments when the Senate takes a break from its work In the chemical weapons treaty case Justices Antonin Scalia Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito would have imposed serious limits on the federal governments powers relating to treaties In the case over abortion clinic buffer zones Roberts and the liberals banded together to preserve a 2000 high court ruling upholding a different kind of buffer In a pointed opinion that would have overruled the earlier case Scalia said I prefer not to take part in the assembling of an apparent but specious unanimity This division among conservatives led Supreme Court lawyer Andy Pincus to conclude that the term actually was a good one for the Obama administration Given the stakes for the administration these were significant victories Pincus said Yale Law School professor Heather Gerken said she has seen the Roberts court take small steps in voting rights and campaign finances cases only to return with landmark rulings a few years later Based on the current crop of cases Gerken said Its hard to know whether its a temporary reprieve for progressive causes or a sign that the court is moderating its positions Ten cases including the last decision of the term in favor of companies that hold religious objections to paying for contraceptives under the Obama health care law came out 54 And in these Kennedy was in the majority each time He sided with conservatives to strike down aggregate limits on campaign contributions and to uphold mainly Christian prayer at the start of town council meetings Joining the liberals Kennedys vote was decisive in forbidding states from relying solely on an intelligence test score for death row inmates in borderline cases of mental disability and in upholding a federal law preventing a straw purchaser from buying a gun for someone else When the justices return for their new term on Oct 6 they may find appeals asking them to take on several hotbutton social issues including samesex marriage abortion and guns New cases involving social media and digital privacy also are pending And questions of retirement will arise anew with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg approaching a birthday  her 82nd in March 2015  that she once set as a marker for leaving the bench Three other justices Stephen Breyer Kennedy and Scalia are older than 75 Some court observers already are looking ahead to 2016 It underlines the importance of the next election So many issues are in a 54 balance The next president could have as many as three nominations with the potential to alter the balance on the court for a generation Severino said,2014-07-02T10:01-04:00,abortion
Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/15/slavery-pregnancy-drove-california-professor-to-accost-teen-pro-lifer-say/,Mireille MillerYoung right an associate professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara is accused of attacking 16yearold Thrin Short not pictured during a March 4 antiabortion protest on campus YouTubecom Thrin Short 16 of Ventura County Calif told FoxNewscom she was pushed at least three times by associate professor Mireille MillerYoung during a March 4 antiabortion outreach event at the University of California in Santa Barbara Courtesy Thrin Short Supporters of Mireille MillerYoung cite the cultural legacy of slavery and even the effects of pregnancy to explain why the feminist studies professor at the University of California Santa Barbara would accost a teenager spreading a prolife message on campus The pregnant 38yearold who pleaded no contest to misdemeanor counts of theft vandalism and battery after stealing and destroying an antiabortion poster and injuring a a16yearold activist says shes sorry for some of her actions and hopes to makes amends through community service     An associate professor whose course work which includes pornography and sex work has gained her the nickname the porn professor Ms MillerYoung was set to appear for sentencing today August 14 before Judge Brian Hill in Santa Barbara County Superior Court  Eileen Boris Feminist Studies professor But the hearing got moved to another courtroom before being rescheduled perhaps Friday The NewsPress obtained Ms MillerYoungs apology letter which was part of a package of letters of support prepared by defense attorney Catherine Swysen aimed at getting the lightest possible sentence for her client Three months pregnant at the time of the March incident a portion of which was recorded on a cellphone camera Ms MillerYoung states I wish to apologize for my actions  The Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust group had a perfect right to come to UC Santa Barbara to express their views about womens reproductive rights As much as the images they displayed were offensive and distressing to my students and to me I had no right to take their poster or destroy it she writes But the letter says nothing about the battery charge which stemmed from Ms MillerYoung scratching teenage activist Thrin Short Thrins 21yearold sister Joan Short who also participated in the demonstration isnt buying the apology telling the NewsPress exclusively today I guess I would like to see her say to her students I did a really stupid thing You shouldnt follow my example  In the video posted online by Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust Thrin pleads with the associate professor to return the sign at one point calling her a thief I may be a thief a smiling Ms MillerYoung replies but youre a terrorist She told UCSB Police that she was pregnant at the time and was triggered by the graphic images of abortion on the poster After initially pleading not guilty she changed her mind and in July entered pleas of no contest Support letters submitted by defense attorney Catherine Swysen and obtained by the NewsPress laud the respect and admiration Ms MillerYoung has among her peers as well as her generosity when it comes to students Some of the letters were written on UCSB letterhead presumably on university equipment and university time Among them is one from history professor Paul Spikard who states that his colleague is the object of an energetic smear campaign that seems to have little to do with her person or her actions and a great deal to do with fomenting racial hatred and rallying rightwing political sentiment It would be tragic if Dr MillerYoung were sentenced to jail time or mandatory anger management classes based on the press portrayal of her as an Angry Black Woman He cites no reports or stories to back up the claim Another letter of support also on UCSB letterhead comes from Eileen Boris a professor in the Department of Feminist Studies Prof Boris seeks clemency for her colleague stating she was at the stage of a pregnancy when one is not fully ones self fully so the image of a severed fetus appeared threatening If she appears smiling on camera Prof Boris continues she is wearing the mask that is she is hiding her actual state through a strategy of selfpresentation that is a cultural legacy of slavery Pat Hardy a member of Santa Barbara Friends Meeting the Quakers and president of a group called Alternatives to Violence Project California urges Judge Hill to consider AVPs conflict resolution workshops as part of Ms MillerYoungs punishment These workshops are offered both in the community as well as 19 prisons throughout the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Ms Hardy says workshops in Santa Barbara are being offered to gang members and atrisk youth as well as a widely diverse group of adults I urge you to look beyond the recent act she writes to Judge Hill to explore the opportunity for Ms MillerYoung to make a change by exploring the world of nonviolence within this setting Joan Short said any punishment that doesnt include some sort of broader apology to students not just for stealing the poster but also for the physical nature of the confrontation does not go far enough Before some of the things she was saying was I had a right to do this I set a good example for my students I was showing them how to protect themselves  Joan said I think she should publicly say to her students I acted completely inappropriately

whether gay and lesbian couples have a constitutional right to marry  AP PhotoSusan WalshThe Associated Press A look at some of the noteworthy cases the Supreme Court will hear this term which begins Monday   Mistaken traffic stop A broken brake light led a North Carolina police officer to pull over a car in which cocaine was later found Turns out the state requires only one functioning brake light The court is weighing a case about whether a defendants constitutional protection against unreasonable searches was violated because of the officers mistaken understanding of the law       Prison beards An Arkansas inmate is challenging a prison policy that prevents him from growing a short beard in accordance with his Muslim religious beliefs Prison officials say the policy prevents inmates from concealing contraband or quickly changing their appearance in an escape   Teeth whitening The North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners is challenging a Federal Trade Commission order that said the dentistfilled board is trying to kill off competition from day spas and tanning booths that offer teethwhitening   Dishonest juror Claims that a jurors comments during trial deliberations over a South Dakota traffic accident raise questions about her impartiality and possibly could result in a new trial   Born in Jerusalem The case of an American born in Jerusalem who wants his passport to list his birthplace as Israel underlies a major dispute between Congress and the president with Middle Eastern politics as the backdrop The United States has never recognized any nations sovereignty over Jerusalem believing the citys status should be resolved in peace negotiations The administration says a 2002 law passed by Congress allowing Israel to be listed as the birthplace of Jerusalemborn Americans would in essence be seen as a US endorsement of Israeli control of the city   Alabama redistricting Democrats and black lawmakers contend that Republican leaders in Alabama drew a new legislative map that illegally packed black voters into too few voting districts to limit minority political power Republicans say they complied with the law by keeping the same number of districts in which black voters could elect candidates of their choice    Facebook threats A Pennsylvania man challenges his conviction for making threats on Facebook He says his online rants about killing his estranged wife shooting up a school and slitting an FBI agents throat were simply rap lyrics and that he didnt mean to threaten anyone    Pregnancy discrimination A United Parcel Service employee says the company failed to accommodate her pregnancy when it refused to give her lightduty work But UPS contends its policies are pregnancyneutral allowing lightduty assignments only in cases where employees are injured on the job or have certain medical conditions   Housing discrimination For the third time the court has agreed to hear a challenge from Texas to an important tool the government is increasingly using to fight discrimination in housing Two earlier cases settled before the justices could weigh in on the legality of determining discrimination from the results of a policy that disproportionately affects minorities rather than by showing any intent to discriminate   Religious discrimination Retailer Abercrombie and Fitch is defending its denial of a job to a woman wearing a Muslim headscarf by arguing that she did not say during her interview that she wears the hijab for religious reasons ___ Cases the justices could decide to hear before the term ends in late June   Gay marriage  Both sides want the justices to settle the question of whether samesex couples have the same right to marry as heterosexuals under the Constitution A court ruling in favor of samesex marriage would grant marriage rights to samesex couples in all 50 states up from 19 states and the District of Columbia A decision in favor of state marriage bans would allow states to continue setting the rules on whether to allow samesex couples to wed   Abortion Several states have passed laws in recent years aimed at limiting abortion by imposing hospital admitting privilege requirements on doctors who perform abortions forcing abortion clinic facilities to meet tougher standards and preventing doctors from prescribing pills for medical abortions later in a pregnancy and at a lower dose The court could take one or more cases that are winding through the courts   Voting disputes Identification requirements and limits on early voting are among state voting laws that could make their way to the Supreme Court this term The court already has jumped preliminarily into a case over early voting in Ohio and seems likely to want a fullblown review But a decision on hearing that case could come late enough in the term to push back the argument and decision to the following term that begins a year from now   Contraception The next fight over the new health care laws requirement that contraception be offered to women among a range of preventive services at no extra cost concerns the responsibilities of religious notforprofit universities hospitals and other institutions The Obama administration already allows those organizations to shift responsibility for coverage to their insurers but the groups say that socalled accommodation still is a burden on their religious consciences In June the justices said familyowned corporations with religious objections do not have to pay for contraceptives for women covered under their health plans   Health care subsidies Legal challenges to the health care law continue in several states that would drastically reduce the number of Americans eligible for subsidies to make health insurance affordable One appeal of a court ruling denying a challenge to the subsidies already is pending at the Supreme Court although the pace of the other cases suggests the justices are more likely to wait if they even are willing to undertake another highstakes fight over the health care law   Affirmative action The court could get another crack at the University of Texas admissions policy that takes race into account among many factors in filling some seats in entering freshmen classes Lower courts upheld the Texas policy following a Supreme Court decision in 2013 that ordered a new review The case currently is being appealed to the full 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans,2014-10-05T08:54-04:00,abortion
Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/05/27/how-did-white-house-out-cias-top-spy-afghanistan/,This is a rush transcript from The Five May 27 2014 This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated DANA PERINO COHOST Hello everyone Im Dana Perino along with Andrea Tantaros Bob Beckel Eric Bolling and Brian Kilmeade     Its 5 oclock in New York City and this is The Five MUSIC PERINO So how did it happen The White House has blown the cover of our top spy in Afghanistan a mistake thats left this official exposed in one of worlds most dangerous places The name of the CIA station chief in Kabul was accidentally included open a list of people who attended a military briefing with President Obama during his surprise trip to Afghanistan That list went out to journalists who accompanied the president By the time the White House recognized the error it was too late Jay Carney was expected to be talked about at the press briefing but that briefing was canceled when President Obama came out to talk about troop levels in Afghanistan earlier That did not go unnoticed by our White House correspondent Ed Henry BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ED HENRY FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT What the president does by talking today is he shifts the topic to were going to keep 9800 US troops in Afghanistan past the end of this year instead of the story being about the CIA END VIDEO CLIP PERINO Well Im back from a week away and Im glad to be back This is a good story an interesting story sad for the official This is what I thought was amazing So President Obama has a wonderful secret trip planned for the troops They pulled it off perfectly Brad Paisley is on the plane Hes going to perform for the troops I thought huge PR win for the White House and I was glad that the president took the time But Andrea people have sort of forgotten the fact that the president went on a trip because of an inadvertent  just a mistake that has overshadowed everything ANDREA TANTAROS COHOST Which is going to be  and is I think a huge fiasco This isnt a minor mistake in a press release that the White House put out This is the identity of a CIA station chief which is a closely guarded secret especially when that country is in a deadly war So what happens now that this has been outed right This creates problems with counterintelligence operations security operations This individual who spent months and months maybe even years trying to build this cover has now been blown so he cant move freely around that country I dont see how he continues in his job after this huge mistake Somebody should definitely be fired But the fact is this is a deadly war So this is even worse than some CIA agent being outed in a random situation Afghanistan is a deadly war and now everybody knows who he is And the real point Dana is its not just the media Its the Taliban Its the enemy that knows he is And they would love to know who the station chief was believe me PERINO Well one of the things that is important is not only his own safety but the safety of his family but also his career is changed And Eric I was thinking about how  if you are a pitcher for a Major League Baseball team this is like shattering that arm because then you are not going to be able to do that same job anymore You might still work in baseball but in a different capacity BOLLING Or give the other team the signals by accident and they could read your signals Look people make mistakes but this administration seems to have mistake after mistake after mistake Oops we didnt know about IRS scandal oops we didnt know about Fast and Furious oops we found out about Benghazi on TV And now oops we accidentally outed one of our CIA station chiefs Look everyone makes a mistake but you know what When you do make a mistake you man to it up You dont start blaming other people Thats why Jay Carney should have been at the briefing room answering the questions about that And by the way you know theres some other news  PERINO A few other things BOLLING Yes there were some other things  CROSSTALK PERINO But we just found out before we went to air Bob that the White House chief of staff Denis McDonough has said there will be an internal review and some recommendations he expects  BRIAN KILMEADE COHOST There are so many internal reviews CROSSTALK PERINO Well they have a spreadsheet of reviews But I mean really Bob how much review do you need that there was just a screw up they just got to you know tighten up the screws BOB BECKEL COHOST Yes this was a screw up extraordinaire But I will say the only thing I can say about this is somebody should be fired right away and probably on the NSC staff who approved it even though this came from the Pentagon But in terms of station chiefs theres not a station chief virtually anywhere in the world thats not known by the host government or the Taliban knows who our station chief is It is  TANTAROS Im not so sure about that BECKEL Its one of the  PERINO I talk to some guys at the CIA today that the argument that everyone knew his ID is a bogus one but there might have been people we dont know for sure But we do that his life has changed irrevocably BECKEL Hes not going to be able to be out in the field anymore He probably INAUDIBLE if he stays in the business he will be back at Langley PERINO One of the things Brian you covered several of these When a president goes on a secret trip to a war zone theres very few people who know about the trip so maybe the regular checks and balances that you would have were not necessarily in place because they had a limited number of people who were working on it KILMEADE You dont need the complicated Eric Bolling family tree to go back generations to find out what happened and whose to blame because so few people know I think sooner or later its going to be Scooter Libby   BOLLING Whose to blame about this LAUGHTER KILMEADE We all know that dating back to Ireland and Italy and maybe some Scandinavian roots Well look into that But Richard Armitage and we know and of course Scooter Libby will eventually take the blame for this For those people who say this is no big deal then you actually immediately say that the Valerie Plame thing was a trumped up charge and a threeyear investigation was not warranted because if you take a desk job agent in relation to her husband in relation to a story that exists in 2001 if you say well this is no big deal then my goodness you need a lot of apologies to a lot of people and a lot of money put back into the treasury over the investigation that took place during your rein in the White House PERINO As soon as I read this today when I talk about outing the CIA agents I kind of get hives I lived that story for a long time I looked up the David Brooks column from October 2005 where he writes after the investigation is finished that Fitzgerald the special prosecutor did not find evidence to prove that there was a broad conspiracy He has not even indicted the medias ordained villain He did not find evidence of windranging criminal behavior And yet for this I think that in some ways Im kind of proud of all of us and the media saying this was a screw up but it was inadvertent and   KILMEADE Right And it took a reporter to find out it was a screw up saying have you guys really want this on the list It was Washington Posts Scott Wilson PERINO Sometimes reporters  KILMEADE Do you want to  CROSSTALK PERINO Youre going to have the checks and balances do sometimes  KILMEADE Absolutely TANTAROS But also when you think about it I feel for this intelligence officer and for his career and his hard work KILMEADE And his family TANTAROS I also feel for us We are losing a very valuable intelligence asset  PERINO Or investment TANTAROS Exactly  at a time when we need him the most PERINO Thats a good point We have another reporter and a columnist Kim Strassel was on air over the weekend and she was talking about what she called a supposed scandal manual for how the White House is dealing not only the CIA situation but also many other things that are on their plate Lets listen to her BEGIN VIDEO CLIP KIMBERLEY STRASSEL WALL STREET JOURNAL Theres five steps that this administration keeps repeating every time a scandal comes up Step one is  well I didnt know about it Step two is to express great outrage When that doesnt work step three is to fire some low level bureaucrat CHRIS WALLACE FOX NEWS HOST Also were going to have a study The study has got to go into it STRASSEL The study comes next Then were going to wait and see what the IG says or the FBI investigation or whatever it is and when that doesnt stop six months later you say its either a done or b all the result of a partisan push by Republicans END VIDEO CLIP KILMEADE Smidgeon of corruption PERINO Thats right Bob do you think they need to update their playbook a little bit Because if there is a pattern here this would go back to almost all of these and you could see what she was talking about There is a step by step process that they seem to follow If it was equivalent of a football team and youve got the playbook and the same one every week my guess is you probably lose a lot of games But the fact is though that the  most of these scandals that do come up do come up from the press go back to Teapot Dome go back to Watergate The press is the one who broke those scandals So thats the not a  the idea that he finds out about it by the press most scandals are found out by the press By the way about Scott Wilson how did Scott Wilson know this guy was a station chief He was listed as station chief So he knew it because Scott Wilson knows who the station chief is and a lot of people do know the station chief is So its not  it was not a surprise to me that he would understand it Hes been around The Post a long time KILMEADE And just to follow an update Im not saying that  Im not worried about Scott Wilson knowing or anybody else knowing Im worried about the Taliban and al Qaeda knowing and they are  the CIA is concerned about that I dont care about the press knowing BECKEL But if Scott Wilson knows about it the Taliban knows about it KILMEADE Really He calls the Taliban and says youre not going to believe it BECKEL No no But how do you  how do you think a reporter for The Washington Post finds these things out PERINO Well these are intelreported I think  Im going to trust the CIA when she say please dont release the names of our individuals The CIA is saying lets not do that Theyre not just saying that to the reporters Theyre asking them not to do it It was the White House that released it The White House is taking responsibility and doing a review KILMEADE Its amazing named Wilson PERINO Yes I know  BOLLING Can I take it one step further Now Glenn Greenwald has said you know the guy who hook up with Ed Snowden he said that hes going to release a list of names  Americans who are being tracked and followed by the NSA Now is the Obama administration when he releases this and theres probably some names on there that likely arent terrorists or linked to terrorism and those Americans probably shouldnt be on that list when he releases that is the White House going to say boy we didnt know that was going on Gee I wonder how  I saw it on FOX PERINO Everybody in Washington is going to do like the Washington read They are going to get the list and say I hope Im on it because Im really somebody if Im on  KILMEADE You think so PERINO Yes The reporters would like nothing more than to find out that they are on the list that Glenn Greenwald  TANTAROS Can I go back to one thing that you said Bob When you said how do they find out about these scandals Its usually the media I disagree with that And I also would disagree with  the one thing thats unique about this president is he seems to learn about these scandals from the media And what shocks me is that hes willing to admit that They are willing to admit without embarassment or a shred of any kind of shame that they learned about it from the press I mean I guess they are OK with looking uninformed or looking incompetent Thats fine with them And Kim Strassel also adds  the last point Dana  to her scandal manual which was a after After a couple of months you say that was Republican politics She did forget one two years later youre supposed to say dude that was two years ago But I think theyre going to stick to the scandal manual because it works To your point Bob about running plays theyve been running the same plays and in their minds CROSSTALK TANTAROS I agree with you The VA is different but thats why they run the scandal manual over and over again BECKEL Ronald Reagans comments about Iran Contra were I read about it in the newspaper So I mean I think you have to be a little careful   KILMEADE Theres no cable news BOLLING What were the other four or five that Reagan have those other four or five scandals BECKEL Well you could argue  BOLLING My point is in five years you got five real legitimate scandals going on and they seem to find out about it in the news PERINO So if we could switch to our last topic for this block which is a little bit along those lines its the Veterans Affairs scandal  I dont like to call it that but thats what its being referred to One of things that they have said we found out about this problem with the waiting list from the press But interestingly in 2009 when the memos the transition memos are transitioned from the president of the United States President Bush to President Obamas team there is a line theres increasing concern about systemic problem about wait times not just for disability piece but for these additional concerns that are coming up you might want to keep an eye on that So they knew seven years ago and now we have this situation KILMEADE Ill add this too Jennifer Griffin was on with us on the radio today And she said it is so disingenuous of them to make an announcement over the weekend that were giving people the option on going to get private health care because its always been on the books its never been announced Its never been pushed never been explained for some odd reason to those who are leaving the military BECKEL Well also lets remember Harry Truman probably passed that same memo to Dwight Eisenhower Dwight Eisenhower to JFK go on up the list The VA has been under attack from the beginning Now that doesnt mean that somebody hasnt acted on it somewhere along the line Some presidents have Clinton did He made some significant moves But in this case the idea that there are monies available and are authorized to put people into private health care is something that I didnt know about I dont know you mentioned it the other day on the show as an idea but its there and in that regard  that bothers me more than anything else BOLLING Can I throw something else out there Do you know that 80 percent of the VA is unionized PERINO Im not surprised BOLLING Eighty percent I dont think people realize what that means That means its highly unionized and you wonder  when you think about other union organizations heavily unionized organizations the Post Office is there any wonder that there are veterans being put on waiting lists  BECKEL What the hell does that have to do with the fact that you have unionized workers TANTAROS It goes back to the plan about incentive BOLLING Really Bob BECKEL Yes really TANTAROS It goes back to the incentive because there is no incentive to work harder  BOLLING You cant get fired is what it is TANTAROS In order to perform better So  BOLLING Its impossible to fire a union employee Bob We know that CROSSTALK TANTAROS The charter school system is tremendously effective what I would like to see is that system be copied for the VA and have a charter hospital that can get funding from all different sources and get tax credits and tax break and get private funding Dana that sprouts up right across the street from these VA hospitals and just see how it goes KILMEADE I would just love to see someone take it by the reins and say this is my problem Im not investigating it Its my problem Im in charge This is it OK I dropped the ball for five years Now its going to change I would love to see that PERINO And I think also because  I dont see this as much of a partisan issue across the country Theres the Washington DC fight But across country everybody can agree we want our veterans to be taken care of so you could see a sort of a surge of doctors figuring out a way using private health care and vouchers or something like that to try to get a handle on this Its not just veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan but the aging veterans from World War II and Korea in particular that need help OK Im back Im happy to be here Ahead on The Five  new details are emerging about a students deadly rampage in California Did authorities miss the warning signs Thats up next COMMERCIAL BREAK TANTAROS Welcome back We want to talk now about that horrifying rampage in California by a college student on Friday night Twentytwoyearold Elliot Rodger killed three of his roommates and then killed three others at random in Santa Barbara More than a dozen victims are injured Rodger posted online videos and wrote a twisted manifesto before his murder spree They paint a picture of very deeply disturbed individual He ranted about being a virgin and seeking revenge against both men and women for it His family had warned police about him in the past and Dr Keith Ablow thinks that they could have done something to stop this BEGIN VIDEO CLIP DR KEITH ABLOW PSYCHIATRIST  FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR Bottom line is they screwed up OK Heres the thing Everything worked the parents called the therapist They said things have gone terribly downhill There are these YouTube postings They are very concerning The therapist calls a crisis team The crisis worker calls from the community mental health center or an ER calls the police and says go now theres a problem And the police for some reason they think they just can just talk to this kid in the hallway and they are going to determine if hes a threat No END VIDEO CLIP TANTAROS All right So a lot of people asking Eric whose fault was this because there were multiple warning signs even the parents flagging the police the police who had been notified he was being I guess treated by a number of psychologists and counselors So wheres the breakdown BOLLING I think right there I think right there because the parents flagged it to the counselors and doctors and there was never a doctor who actually said hes dangerous to himself and maybe other people and put him  even if they put him away for a short period of time and said look he needs intensive observation put him in hospital for a short period of time that would have trigger the things that background checks look for when you go to buy a gun and he wouldnt have been able to buy the gun Not to say that he wouldnt kill anyway Lets make it perfectly clear He killed the first three people with a knife all right It wasnt even a gun involved There are 300 million handguns in America Theres another 100 million probably unregistered handguns  Im sorry firearms in America another 100 million He would get his hands on it But if you want it find out what made that guy tick I think put him away a little bit and have him really really getting the medication he needed I think he was  he was a sick sick kid TANTAROS Dana do you know that on some level parents are hesitant to call somebody up call the authorities to have their son committed I mean if you listen to the father and well pay some sound from his later but this is his only son He did seem to have anger issues but Eric does make a good point family knows you best and if family is not going to be the one who sound the alarm who is PERINO And reading the article today  it sounds like the mother who had been see a couple of times she would follow her sons social media activities So she saw a posting on YouTube that she thought was concerning enough to her that she went to the police She tried to get some sort of help Im not sure what a parent  how a parent would deal with that and at what point do you decide that my son or daughter needs to be committed and also we did have the laws that say if you are an adult you cant necessarily be committed against your will TANTAROS There are some crazy stories about his behavior His college roommate coming out saying that he dared borrow a scented candle of his and he lost his mind Where do you think the breakdown is Because I mean even as Dana mentioned and Eric mentions you can take away the Second Amendment It still doesnt take away this mental illness issue of this boy BECKEL Well the fact of the matter he bought his guns legally from a gun store And he presumably had a background check because thats what the law says Now the law does not  says it would be triggered if you were institutionalized and that would stop them from buying a gun What the law does not say because the NRA have tried to stop it effectively is that if you are continual psychiatric care and if you are somebody who is a potential for violence that ought to be included in the law and you could find that out from  by looking at the guys background check have you been treated by a psychiatrist or counselor over the last five years If he says yes automatically triggers I think  no you cant buy this gun until we can talk to those people KILMEADE Heres the thing first off a number of things Usually side with law enforcement  Im not there Im not in Santa Barbara This is not an unfinanced police station Its one of nicest places in the country Santa Barbara I imagine the tax dollars support is strong The workforce is strong Theyre not going from gang to gang trying to somehow get Santa Barbara under control So to me you have a time to arrive at that house someone should have looked at the YouTube first and say wow this is serious The parents have called Weve got to take this kid over in a friendly way  I dont feel good leaving you by yourself right now and bring him over to the ER too and get you some observation  because youre a cop Youre not a psychologist You are not professionally trained to evaluate somebody on the spot when life and death is in balance Then Im wondering with a background check do you know if someone owns firearms If so do they own multiple If they got them all legal you could say Im concerned about this guy Is he a danger to himself or to somebody else And according to the background check he owns guns Can you show me those guns Where are they And if you want to go find those guns you would have evidently saw a little bit of a journey and a little bit of a plan to kill multiple people which would have been discovered He talked about saying that I was almost outed when these cops came to my place CROSSTALK TANTAROS He showed up at a fraternity party and pretended to shoot people and then he ended up falling off  CROSSTALK TANTAROS But he was actively trying to shoot people at a party Nobody thought  KILMEADE They come to his house  hey buddy just come for me for a while BECKEL A cop has the right to send somebody involuntarily for three days for commitment which they should have done I mean  BOLLING But it wouldnt have stopped this psycho from killing people He still killed people with a knife CROSSTALK BECKEL May be may be not BOLLING Theres no question  Bob is there any question in your mind that if you are that freaking crazy you are not going to get your hands on a illegal firearm and maybe kill people BECKEL My hope is if youre involuntarily committed for three days they got to figure out that you should be  not involuntary but just put in to psychiatric care PERINO One last comment is that I know a lot of people turn to Washington and say why havent you done something about this Taken aside the Second Amendment issue Congressman Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania has legislation proposed in Congress that would get immediate help to families who think they have a mental health crisis in their family and its been through a bill thats been held up but it should get another look immediately because thats where the help could hopefully try to prevent these immediate things from happening CROSSTALK BECKEL The NRA would never allow that to get out of committee TANTAROS Erics fastest seven is coming right up including a comedian who says that hes embarrassed or shes embarrassed because shes never had an abortion You got to hear this one Stay tuned COMMERCIAL BREAK BOLLING Welcome back to the fastest seven minutes in news  morning noon or night Three stimulating stories seven streaming minutes one steady host First up Mark Cuban made some provocative remarks regarding his own racial prejudices last week A firestorm of race debate ensued Sportscaster Stephen A Smith took Cubans thoughts and added his own opinion full of passion and flavor  and quite a bit of passion and flavor Listen BEGIN VIDEO CLIP STEPHEN A SMITH SPORTSCASTER I dont care who in the black community disagrees with me I do understand that to some degree theres a level of racism that we all have to overcome and I get all of that But that doesnt mean every single issue is racerelated Sometimes it is about how you  how you represent yourself When we talk about the American dream you know who I think about Myself Grew up poor The level of education that I had was a public school system I ultimately graduate from high school I go to a historically black institution like WinstonSalem State University I graduate with honors and Im on national TV every day This is the road youve got to climb END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Thats very refreshing Bob Would you agree with him BECKEL Yes I think hes got a good point I mean theres  I didnt have a problem with Cuban  how do you BOLLING Mark Cuban BECKEL Cuban said because I think hes right I mean if youre walking down the street and you see somebody that at least in your mind is threatening then you ought to cross the street He was talking about one black kid with a hoodie on and then he said you know an Aryan Nation guy with tattoos and a bald head he wouldnt walk there So I think it wasnt  it wasnt pinpointed to blacks And so I think thats a good point KILMEADE He also brought up the fact that hes been called since he said those remarks a sellout and an Uncle Tom not really black for supporting Mark Cuban Youve got to be kidding me He says you have a guy that comes out and speaks his mind you want to rip him for speaking his mind and lump him in with Donald Sterling Its outrageous BOLLING Dana your thoughts on that PERINO A lot of people talking about this in South Carolina over the weekend because they like what he had to say They thought it was very refreshing I like this part where he says  he says that P Diddy Jay Z LeBron whatever that those are just very unique You cant expect that everybody is going to be something like them that you have to work hard And then like hes done works hard and now hes on ESPN every night BOLLING And he was saying some of the things you were saying last week as well TANTAROS Well he was saying at some level  he said some level of racism is within us all that we have to overcome I disagree with that The word I would use is prejudice because of prejudging situations And my point was that we all prejudge situations If you see someone with a pocket protector and glasses with tape on them you prejudge that person as being a dork You prejudge someone on the other side of the street BOLLING Fenders  fenders ph  I understand  yes TANTAROS And another thing I think thats the point that Cuban was trying to make And I love that Stephan A Smith railed on people for leaving out the fact that he also said when theres a white guy on the other side of the street with a hoodie I also get nervous BOLLING Let me get this one in here Moving on now What do you get when you cross a slimy slug with a flesheating parasite The Bill Maher Show This weekend Sarah Silverman joined slimy Bill and had some rather provocative thoughts on abortion BEGIN VIDEO CLIP SARAH SILVERMAN COMEDIAN And the truth is and I dont like to admit this Ive never had an abortion and I dont know if I would But it doesnt mean that I wouldnt tell  fight to the death for women to make their own choices for their own human bodies BILL MAHER HOST HBOs THE BILL MAHER SHOW Thank you for being brave enough to admit youve never had an abortion here in Hollywood SILVERMAN That could really hurt a womans career out here END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING And trying to figure out Was  seriously was she joking What was that TANTAROS I mean if shes trying to be funny she wasnt very funny She has devoted her life outside of comedy to the prochoice cause OK Its like from V to shining V Shes out there trying out there to raise awareness I know that shes a clown in her daily life But she looks like an absolute fool I dont know Maybe she had this at an LA cocktail party or a party you know on the West Village here in New York And she clearly talks to people who dont disagree with her But I dont know if shes even read a newspaper because theres no issue of Roe v Wade being overturned in the courts I believe all the justices have referred to it as precedent So what the hell is Sarah Silverman talking about She looks like a complete idiot BOLLING OK Moving on PERINO Just in thinking about this I do think what she was trying to say was that just because she hasnt had an abortion doesnt mean she couldnt support the right of somebody else to and thats why she has fought for it So like  I support gay marriage That doesnt mean Im gay necessarily You could have public policy positions that are supportive of other people I think thats what she was trying to say Shes a comedian so I guess theyre trying to be funny Maybe BOLLING Can I do this one Theyre rushing me on I want to make sure we get this one BECKEL Theres not that many abortions in the West Village Go ahead BOLLING Some people love Montel Williams some people dont for those of you who dont take a listen to the Vietnam vet defending our nations heroes in a way not many celebrities could or would for that matter BEGIN VIDEO CLIP MONTEL WILLIAMS TALK SHOW HOST We are at war How dare this nation treat us this way Whether you agree with me politically or not I know you agree with me on this we can argue about whether you like football basketball it is time for us to come together END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Very emotional KILMEADE Officer in the military motivational speaker Great success story I like him Hes done a lot of good things for MS Somebody in my family as well that had it So I cant say anything Nor do I want to say anything ever negative against Montel Williams or what he just said BOLLING Right And again Vietnam vet BECKEL Yes Probably this story hits veterans more than anybody else and their families And that comes home because clearly it was emotional for him because hes been a veteran BOLLING Yes and And he points out that he spends a lot of time in veterans hospitals He said he used to see a lot of celebrities and politicians there Not so much lately TANTAROS Hes been I think 30 times or over 30 times so he really does back the cause And as Brian points out he is a veteran who struggles with multiple sclerosis MS in a very real way So he is the perfect person to stand up and fight BOLLING And also spent a lot of time ph going to Afghanistan and Iraq a bunch of times PERINO Part of that is through the USO which is an amazing organization that we should all support I like what he said about this is just time for us to come together I do think that people out in the country look at Washington and say OK so the VA has a lot of money So Obama might not have known about it So Bush knew about it So Clinton Who cares Lets just figure out a way to get it solved which is what I think Montel Williams is encouraging BOLLING Very good Theyre rushing me again Again next up on The Five some incredible advice from the Navy SEAL who led the mission to get bin Laden Stay tuned for some very wise words from an American hero coming right up COMMERCIAL BREAK KILMEADE All right Americas college grads from gotten advice from all kinds of commencement speakers this time of year The ones that werent protested against One address has gone viral and they say it goes viral on the Internet Its the one given by Navy Admiral William McRaven at the university of Texas Now The Five played some of you last week But since its so good and you want to hear more guess what Its time for you to hear more Heres McRaven focused on the ten most important lessons he learned from his basic training as a Navy SEAL that could change your safe  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ADMIRAL WILLIAM MCRAVEN US NAVY The 9th week of training is referred to as Hell Week It is six days of no sleep constant physical and mental harassment and one special day at the mud flats As the sun began to set that Wednesday evening my training class having committed some egregious infraction of the rules was ordered into the mud The mud consumed each man until there was nothing visible but our heads The chattering teeth and shivering moans of the trainees were so loud it was hard to hear anything and then one voice began to echo through the night And then one voice began to echo through the night one voice raised in song The song was terribly out of tune but sung with great enthusiasm One voice became two and two became three and before long everyone in the class was singing The instructors threatened us with more time in the mud if we kept up the singing but the singing persisted And somehow the mud seemed a little warmer and the wind a little tamer and the dawn not so far away If I have learned anything in my time traveling the world it is the power of hope One person can change the world my giving people hope So if you want to change the world start singing when youre up to your neck in mud END VIDEO CLIP KILMEADE And he did talk about making a difference making an impact and he opened by saying I dont remember who spoke at my graduation as commencement speaker I sense that these guys and these ladies are going to remember who spoke at theirs Am I right Dana PERINO Yes I agree One of points that he had that I like the most was make your bed every day KILMEADE Yes PERINO Thats the first task that you do and once you do one that makes you want to do another KILMEADE That one success PERINO At least get up and make your bed every day KILMEADE Eric he also talk about going  sometimes you have to go head first and take risks in your life You dont take risks in your life You dont know how its going to turn out but youd rather not think about the consequences TANTAROS Like putting you on the show Brian KILMEADE Right Which is a huge risk and its not going to pay off BOLLING So can I just make a very quick point about this Thank God we have these fellows protecting us protecting our freedoms fighting for our freedoms We hear Bill Maher and Sarah Silverman make those stupid comments and the reason why theyre able to do that and were able to hear them say that is because those fellows are there in the mud protecting our rights and our freedoms and our liberties And we have to thank them for that KILMEADE Lessons we all can learn Bob you get anything out of this BECKEL Well didnt think of that today let alone when I was younger So I guess I dont get the scale But Id really like to know what the song was Did anybody find out what the song was KILMEADE No But it was something that brought them all together and they defied people saying Stop singing PERINO It was 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall BECKEL Heres another thing He gives this speech in front of the University of Texas at Austin That is a liberal community there and he didnt get booed as far as I can tell and he got  he got through it fine KILMEADE Andrea youve overcome obstacles Do you think you appreciate something like this TANTAROS I can I wish I were as good as what hes saying Being your best in your darkest moments and singing when youre up to your neck in mud I still  I still have trouble doing that but the one thing  I watched it again over the weekend  that really jumped out at me was he was talking about some fields are bigger than others and they thought the big guys would last to the end He says do not measure a person by the size of their flippers Measure them by the size of their heart and find someone to help you paddle And I thought that is really PERINO I liked the paddle thing too KILMEADE Size of the heart How to beat the Munchkins he talked about That they called them in training I thought it was unbelievable Its even better than I thought it was when I heard how great it was Meanwhile coming up straight ahead Cleveland Browns rookie Johnny Manziel is catching a lot of flak for spending the weekend partying in Las Vegas Should they give the quarterback a break He wants one he said so on Twitter COMMERCIAL BREAK BECKEL Welcome back to the fastest two liberal minutes of the show Cleveland Browns rookie Johnny Manziel likes to have a good time And hes taking some heat for it after partying in Vegas this weekend Johnny Football kicked off the summer hanging out poolside with

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/08/08/rep-desjarlais-challenger-trade-leads-in-tennessee-gop-primary/,Scandalplagued Tennessee Rep Scott DesJarlais and challenger Jim Tracys race was still too close to call Friday as election officials in Tennessees largely rural 4th Congressional District tallied outstanding votes In unofficial results DesJarlais was ahead of Tracy by just 35 votes in their contest for the Republican nomination But that number could shift as possible provisional ballots are counted and the final result could drag out for weeks as election officials certify results and consider potential challenges     DesJarlais a physician won reelection in 2012 despite revelations he urged a patient he was dating to seek an abortion Tracy far outraised the DesJarlais campaign and had been expected to easily defeat the incumbent But DesJarlais tea party base appeared willing to overlook his past personal problems Tennesseans chose to judge me on my record in Washington DesJarlais said in a statement In the other highprofile Tennessee primary contest Republican Lamar Alexander became the latest US senator to fend off a tea party challenge defeating a state representative who had used a familiar tactic in trying to cast him as an outoftouch insider The former twoterm governor ended up beating state Rep Joe Carr of Murfreesboro by 9 percentage points in what was a far closer race than the 29point spread that Alexanders internal pollster had suggested late last month In both of DesJarlais previous elections he tried to cast doubt on reports of violent behavior toward his exwife and about multiple extramarital affairs before his divorce was finalized But court transcripts released the week after the November 2012 election revealed that he admitted under oath that he had eight affairs encouraged a lover to get an abortion and used a gun to intimidate his first wife during an argument And last year DesJarlais was fined and reprimanded by the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners in May for having sex with patients before he was elected DesJarlais dismissed those details as old news noting that he now is happily remarried while stressing familiar tea party attacks on President Barack Obama over issues like health care and the assault on a US consulate in Benghazi Libya Tracy a state senator and former college basketball referee stressed themes of integrity in his campaign against DesJarlais That message resonated with some voters like Linda Warpool of Murfreesboro who said she was tired of the incumbents scandals Too much sex Too many abortions she said But Tracy was unable to persuade enough voters in the more rural counties around DesJarlais home in the southeastern part of the state many of which voted overwhelmingly for the incumbent In the states majority black 9th Congressional District Democratic Rep Steve Cohen a white and Jewish Memphis native cruised to a 34point win over Ricky Wilkins who is AfricanAmerican And in the 3rd District in eastern Tennessee Rep Chuck Fleischmann defeated Weston Wamp the son of former Rep Zach Wamp by less than 2 percentage points Three Democratic members of the Tennessees Supreme Court survived a concerted effort by conservatives to deny them another eightyear term Republican Lt Gov Ron Ramsey had spearheaded the effort to oust the three justices appointed by thenGov Phil Bredesen a Democrat The defeat of even one of the incumbents would have given the GOP control of the highest court in Tennessee which is the only state in the nation where justices name the attorney general,2014-08-08T13:42-04:00,abortion

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/12/gay-marriage-opponent-perkins-calls-recent-supreme-court-move-on-gay-marriage/, Tony Perkins Family Research Council president and outspoken opponent of gay marriage said Sunday that the Supreme Court effectively deciding last week to allow states to handle the issue is a back alley maneuver and that the debate is not going away The Supreme Court on Monday denied appeals from five states seeking to retain their bans on samesex marriage     Perkins argued in a debate on Fox News Sunday with former Bush administration Solicitor General Ted Olson that the justices announcement was comparable to how those on the high court handled the landmark 1970s abortion case Roe v Wade The high court essential decided that state laws are unconstitutional if they say abortions are illegal if performed outside of trying to save the mothers life However the court also left states some authority to regulate abortions in the later stages of pregnancy The court did a back alley type Roe v Wade judicial decision by letting the lower courts do their evil bidding Perkins said This is an unprecedented decision  What we see here I believe is that the court has lit a fuse to a powder keg culturally that is going to have ramifications for years to come in this nation Right now at least 12 states have approved samesex marriage through voter referendums or legislative action while lower courts have approved them in roughly 15 other states On the argument that nonelected judges are perhaps unfairly making such decisions Olson said they protect Americans in states in which one political party controls elected government We have protection from majority he said an independent judiciary to protect the rights of citizens Olson also said nobody can say what the justices were thinking in their recent announcement but he speculated they decide not to weigh in after seeing the overwhelming trend of federal courts handling the issue in an appropriate and proper way Perkins when asked what impact gay marriage will have on his life pointed to a samesex couple perhaps living near his home which would create conflicts with the ideal of marriage  between man and woman  that he teaches his children You want the sky to fall because two people that are living next door to you  what court after court after court has said that allowing people of the same sex to marry the person that they love and be a part of our community and to be treated equally has  does no damage to heterosexual marriage Olsen responded Said Perkins If love is the issue what are the next boundaries Olson also argued that the nonappointed justices rightfully made clear in 1967 that bans on interracial marriages are unconstitutional Were talking about apples and oranges here Perkins responded There is a boundary between people of the same sex getting married They cant procreate Theres nothing in nature to say thats normal,2014-10-12T13:49-04:00,abortion
Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/05/05/24-day-worth-sex-propaganda-and-insanity-at-huffington-post/," Editors note The following commentary originally appeared on the Media Research Centers NewsBusters blog It is used with permission For eight years Jack Bauer and his elite team of agents fought against terrorists a drug cartel and wouldbe assassins Bauer overcame each crisis in just a 24hour period Now he has returned to face the realtime challenges of stopping a terrorist attack in 24 Live Another Day     But how would Bauer handle some of the worst denizens of the Internet Where would he start to combat the collection of lies disinformation hype and propaganda Why The Huffington Post of course HuffPost as it calls itself has eclipsed traditional liberal outlets like The New York Times and become the most influential leftwing website It is the envy of other news organizations with more than 300 editors writers and columnists just in its US operation The site is filled with bloggers and columnists that reads like a Whos Who list On any day readers can encounter Hollywood celebs like Jamie Lee Curtis and John Cusack to liberal figures like Education Secretary Arne Duncan and former Labor Secretary Robert Reich But to generate the traffic HuffPo as its detractors call it uses all the tricks the Internet has from linkbait to sex to celebrity pictures To give a better sense of what Huffington Post is really like the Media Research Centers Business and Media Institute analyzed the site for 24 straight hours  from Thursday May 1 at 8 am to Friday May 2 at 8 am Even Jack Bauer might not be that brave What we found ranged from liberal propaganda sex attacks on Christians on the National Day of Prayer more sex sympathy for executed murdererrapist Clayton Lockett attacks on Republicans still more sex and of course the gay agenda All in all a typical day at the lefts signature site 815 amTheres One Thing Missing From the Plan to Prosecute Big Banks
The left has almost exclusively blamed banks bankers and Wall Street for the financial crisis of 2008 since it happened It shouldnt shock anyone to see The Huffington Posts Mark Gongloff arguing for prosecution However Gongloff a chief financial writer for HuffPo is disappointed with federal prosecutors plans to file criminal charges against banks because unless some actual human beings are frogmarched out of those or other banks in handcuffs criminal charges probably wont do much to deter more crimes or make the public feel like justice is really being served 828 amCRUEL AND UNUSUAL BACK IN THE SPOTLIGHT
HuffPo spotlighted an AP story about Clayton Lockett a convicted killer and Oklahoman inmate who died of a heart attack following a lethal injection on April 29 The story took up the huge top spot on the home page from 828 am until 1207 pm The article said his botched execution was certain to fire up the debate over what constitutes cruel and unusual punishment The article focused on a number of execution attempts but didnt detail the horrific crimes prisoners like Lockett were found guilty of On HuffPo normal citizens dont matter 900 am12 MILLION REASONS TO BE ANGRY AT SENATE REPUBLICANS
That headline screamed in purple all caps from the top of HuffPos Business section Its part of a constant theme on the site to attack the GOP and always with hyperbolic headlines Jillian Berman of The Huffington Post supplied another attack on the GOP lashing out at Senate Republicans for blocking a proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to 1010 an hour Her 12 million reasons to be angry at them Thats the number of women in the US who have children three years old or younger and are working at jobs that pay 1010 an hour or less Berman wrote  citing data from the National Womens Law Center She noted that half of those women dont have a second income which also means that half of them do Berman also complained that 1010 an hour cannot support a single mother and child but she didnt say how many of the 12 million women are actually single mothers 904 am93 Of Straight Men In This Study Admitted to Doing This In Bed Together
HuffPo doesnt just push the gay agenda It helps manufacture it In the Gay Voices section the article made it sound like nearly all straight men have been doing more in bed with other men than is actually the case The headline with an accompanying photo of James Franco cuddling with another man made the British studies findings sound more gay than they were Emily Thomas began the article by saying Yes straight men sleep together She went on to detail a British study that found 98 percent of the participants have shared a bed with another guy While 93 percent said they had spooned or cuddled with another man However the bromance study only looked at 40 young male athletes in contrast the headline which made it sound like the majority of all straight guys are getting their cuddle on with other dudes Perhaps only at HuffPo 925 amUpgrading From Prayer to Reason The front page did mention that the National Day of Prayer was May 1 but in a disparaging way HuffPo likes its religion either leftwing nontraditional or not at all A featured blog post from Roy Speckhardt Executive Director of the American Humanist Association called it a peculiar day set aside for government to intrude in their private religious practices The story appeared on the featured blog posts section of the home page and was crossposted in the politics section Speckhardt argued that the existence of a National Day of Prayer as well as under God in the Pledge of Allegiance reduce our freedom He called them egregious violations of the First Amendment principle of churchstate separation and claimed they run afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee that all citizens deserve equal protection under the law 935 amEXCEPTIONAL The US Is Even More Unequal Than You Realized
The business section loudly warned of the exceptional inequality of the US as the liberal media frenzy over French economist Thomas Piketty continues to reign Stoking class envy is just part of a typical day at HuffPo The blaring headline at the top of the section was complete with a bar graph of multiple countries taking from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD It showed income gains from 1975 to 2007 that the sites Maxwell Strachan said showed that nowhere did the rich benefit as much as in America The story had been posted at 828 am but wasnt promoted to the top section until about an hour later The chart Strachan used made Denmark look good because as he noted the vast majority of income gains went to the bottom 90 percent in that country He failed to point out that the average households netadjusted disposable income in Denmark was far lower than that of the United States 25172 Denmark 39531 US according to the OECD Denmark also has a top income tax bracket of 602 percent in 2013 that kicks in onincomes above 55000 CNN Money reported 1003 amThe Magical World of Tarot
Whats a National Day of Prayer without tarot cards Rather than focusing on Christians gathering to pray for the US HuffPo dabbled in the occult on its religion page The top headline in the religion section was The Magical World of Tarot It remained there almost until noon when it was replaced by a story about Beltane 2014 a pagan May 1 festival Who cares about those pesky Christians The article by Antonia Blumberg focused on seven tarot readers shaping Brooklyns alternative spiritual community including a professional drag performer a BDSM educator if you dont know dont ask and a tarot reader whose mission is to bring these magical practices to the mainstream One of the featured readers was Damon who in spite of his Catholic upbringing was always fascinated by divination Blumberg didnt point out that the Bible condemns divination in Deuteronomy chapter 18 His own spirituality encompasses and witchcraft according to Huffington Post I self identify very strongly as a witch and I see my practice as a card reader as an extension of witchcraft Damon said Another of the tarot readers Bruno also came from a Catholic family To me it would be beautiful if everyone could learn tarot said Bruno who identifies as new age 1026 amLOOK Early 20th Century Gay Life Reveals in These Incredible Photos
HuffPo is blatantly progay Sometimes it seems like every section is hyping homosexuality This time the site promoted a new book The Invisibles Vintage Portraits of Love and Pride by Sebastien Lifshitz that seeks to provide a different perspective about gay culture during what is historically considered a harshly closeted era the early to mid20th century The Gay Voices section included James Nichols interview with Lifshitz about the photographs hed collected from several countries Lifshitz conceded that he doesnt know any of the people and cant really even say that each person photographed in the book is gay except when its obvious Apparently HuffPo even has historical gaydar 1100 amYou Can Now Sext In More Ways Than Ever Thanks To New Snapchat Features
Ever wonder what HuffPo staffers do all day Now we might have a clue The article only hints at the naughtiness of chat well just let you use your imagination as to how these can be employed when you know your words or video are going to disappear 1148 amIn God and Winnie the Pooh I Trust
In the featured blog posts of the Christianity section of Huffington Post journalist Greg Barrett compared Christian beliefs in God to his own devout belief in Winnie the Pooh No we arent kidding Writing of UFC heavyweight champion Jon Jones who thanked Jesus Christ after winning a fight Barrett said without his belief in a personal connection to a higher and omnipotent power Jones as well as other superstar athletes who say they are anointed with Gods blessing would not perform in ways that appear otherworldly But Barrett continued the same might be said of my devout belief in Winnie the Pooh I was born the same year 1961 that the rights to Winnie the Pooh were licensed to Walt Disney Productions and in no time Disney had worked its magic I became a believer Ultimately he argued that when I truly believe that the power of the universe resides within me  I act in such a way that I am able to tap it regardless of deity Jesus or the Buddha or Winnie the Pooh  Again this was on the National Day of Prayer Next up Tigger the Apostle 1150 am HuffPost Live WorldBrief Focuses on Russian Leaders Criticism of Obvious Transvestite
HuffPost Live is one of the magically entertaining parts of HuffPo Like the rest of the site its never far from pushing a gay agenda In this case Russian politician Vitaly Milonov wrote a critical letter to Eurovision over a music competition saying Even just broadcasting the competition in Russian could insult millions of Russians The participation of the obvious transvestite and hermaphrodite Conchita Wurst on the same stage as Russian singers on live television is blatant propaganda of homosexuality and spiritual decay HuffPo Live anchor said that Milanov was referring to Wurst an Austrian contestant who is a drag queen who wears makeup tight dresses and a full beard They showed part of a music video from Wurst Following that explanation HuffPo turned to tweets on the subject including one from Vincent who said Im going to watch every last minute of Eurovision this year just to spite Russias homophobic politician Vitaly Milonov 1159 amBeltane 2014 Facts History and Traditions The Beltane celebration was posted at 1110 am and updated at 1159 am which is when it became the front page story on the religion section Paganism got front page treatment from the Huffington Posts religious section complete with a photograph of a woman dancing with fire Beltane is a Celtic and neopagan festival held on May 1 Antonia Blumberg wrote As spring is underway and summer approaches many neopagans and Wiccans around the world celebrate Beltane It is possible some of those Brooklyn tarot card readers Blumberg already wrote about were among the celebrants Or perhaps just HuffPo staffers 1239 pmWhy It Took So Long for An Economist to Expose the Flaw In Capitalism The farleft French economist who thinks the US should adopt a top income tax of 80 percent and advocates for a global wealth tax to curb inherited wealth was promoted by HuffPos Business section It interviewed economist Thomas Piketty who argued the cold war prevented a true debate about inequality  capitalism Naturally HuffPo failed to point out his radical tax proposals in the article 1251 pmCongratulations Graduates Liberals have complained for years about equal pay claiming women are disadvantaged and there is a wage gap between genders HuffPo paraded it again as a top story for the Business section announced Congratulations Graduates and then beneath the image of college grads the words Equal Pay Is Already Out of Your Reach Because its not really graduation unless you get the gift of propaganda Jillian Bermans article focused on a new study from Economic Policy Institute a liberal think tank Berman didnt label EPI as liberal instead she just called it a think tank focused on lowwage workers Apparently honesty is already out of their reach 1259 pm100 Reasons Not to Have Kids That I Discovered After I Had One
Hating on the traditional family is one of the tenets of loony liberalism This blog was written by Anjali Joshi who is a mother and a blogger at TheAdventuresOfaNewMomcom Apparently she isnt too happy about her newfound family The 100 list includes You dislike children You like to sleep You like to have sex You like to have money You like your freedom Yes her response is a picture of her family complete with child but it seems forced 120 pmCan An Affair Help Your Marriage
Three letters keep HuffPo stocked with readers SEX Even when stories arent salacious headline writers do their best to pretend HuffPost Lives Alyona Minkovski who got her big start at the Russian propaganda outlet RT talked to four guests about the subject When Infidelity Make The Heart Grow Fonder Of course she included a couple who say their marriage became stronger as a result of infidelity Thats right for some couples a moment of infidelity can actually save the relationship Minkovski said to begin the segment Guest Ron Anderson wrote an article called My wifes affair shattered and saved our marriage He told Minkovski it was a wake up call Conventional wisdom is that the one who strayed is the bad actor Minkovski said as she asked Rons wife Nancy why she had an affair She said it was because she was selfish and bored at a time in their marriage when they were fighting and not communicating well Yes cheating being bad is only conventional wisdom There are no moral absolutes at HuffPo Guest Anne Bercht made sure to caution that she would never advise people to have an affair to improve their marriage But that was buried by the rationalizations 200 pm HuffPost Live Living Wage
People shouldnt just earn a decent living they should earn a decent life HuffPo hammers that point again and again Minimum is such a terrible terrible word for this Linda Tirado said people in general dont like to look at hard facts The difference between the middle class and the working poor is that the middle class has credit cards and theyll be OK for next week if they need to be The working poor we dont have that theres not a cushion not a great safety net and theres the problem Much like 24 only government can help at HuffPo 227 pm Huff Post Live Luther Campbell interviewed for comments on Donald Sterling
Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew was the expert HuffPost called in to talk about Donald Sterling sexism vs racism Because when you need an expert you go to the man famous for the song Me So Horny Campbell rambled fairly incoherently and even seemed to have a vaguely rational view of the topic but he was introduced by host Marc Lamont Hill as a man who knows the 1st Amendment very very well Hill went on to ask Campbell Do you feel any discomfort with what you went through with the 1st Amendment 20 years ago and people trying to ban you and silence you Do you worry about the fact that Adam Silver didnt base his comments on the long history of racism that Donald Sterling has  he based it on what was on that tape Like the rest of lefty media the Sterling case gave it a chance to use racism as a club against opponents 243 pmKids of Gay Parents Teach Us That Family is Family Love is Love
A bunch of little kids being interviewed about their gay families Each child was asked to talk about his or her house and what they wanted to be when they grew up Then they were asked to talk about their two moms The video is part of a campaign which argues that there is no such thing as a normal family 344 pmStephen Colbert Not Happy About Lesbian Throuple
HuffPo makes regular use of liberal comedians like Colbert Jon Stewart and others The short article ended with Good for you ladies It was published at 332 but got moved underneath the main story on HuffPost Gay Voices at 344 Colbert had mockingly called this lesbian wedding a slippery slope saying that Sodomy leads to gay marriage which leads to throupling which inevitably leads to threestiality and whatever word they come up with for one dude and 10 snakes in a box Im gonna say hissy fit Liberals who have long denied polygamy was an issue now laugh it off 401 pmSmall Town Mistakes Unity Sculpture for Giant Blue Orgy
The second story from the top in the Gay Voices section highlighted a bizarre sculpture According to the story Unfortunately some people missed the relying on each other forest for orgy trees HuffPo said that the sculptor Mark Chatterley was confused by the sexual reading of his piece he said it hadnt crossed his mind and the accusation showed you what people are really thinking about According to the sculptor the statue called Blue Human Condition represents the idea that living today we cant do it alone  we rely on other people  to try to survive Nowclick the linkand look at the picture and realize orgy is pretty accurate 414 pmExtreme Rainfall Events like Pensacola Florida Storm on the Rise posted at 1245 but moved to main page after 4 pm
This became the top story on HuffPo Green but it was originally published by Climate Central The story claimed storms in Florida and Mobile Alabama recently were caused by climate change The article quoted Kenneth Kunkel a climate scientist with the National Climatic Data Center who told Climate Central that Theres no place for the US where the models arent on average showing an increase in extreme precipitation One thing is certain if its extreme HuffPo pushes it  whether its environmental or social policy 418 pmCourtney Stodden Is Literally Busting Out Of Her Bikini
Its not HuffPos classic side boob story side boobs have theirown pageon HuffPo but anything involving sex and link bait gets the sites editors excited 509 pmHuffPost Live Kshama Sawant Seattle City Councilwoman McDonalds Doesnt Need Time To Phase In 15 Minimum Wage
Hyping wage increases remarkably similar to Democrat positions Hmmmm figure prominently on HuffPo and HuffPost Live In this case outspoken socialist Kshama Sawant has backed a move to make big business pay 15anhour to workers in Seattle The real goal is bigger its that workers everywhere will see whats happening in Seattle and try to do their own things in their own cities Host Alyona Minkovski finished the segment by saying that it was nice to see how much could be accomplished in so little time Now I think that probably it would be easy to say that there arent too many people who would be very sympathetic to McDonalds or other major corporations like that They have the profit to be able to cover the additional costs here Minkovski said before acknowledging that small business owners are afraid that they will have to fire workers in order to meet the higher minimum wage requirements This might have been a good point to mention thelawsuitthat unpaid bloggers hit HuffPo with The article that went with this story never once mentioned any opposition to the new minimum wage laws and neither the article nor the interview addressed Sawants political leanings beyond introducing her as an outspoken socialist Hard left policy positions are popular at HuffPo This article became the top story on the Huffington Post main page around 630 pm 524 pmHuffPost Live Dont Mock Rob Ford Treat him as if he has cancer
As long as you dont have an R after your name expect the HuffPo staff to be nice Even Toronto Mayor Rob Ford got gentle treatment The two guests Jeff Kreisler and Dr Howard Samuels a recovering addict who works with addicts both argued that the fascination with Rob Ford was harmful Kreisler argued that the attention was fueling Fords addiction because he craved more attention while Samuels said that he wanted people to treat this issue like theyd treat someone who has cancer When someone has cancer theyre not being made fun of 542 pmAP Survey on Faith and Science Reveals That Science is Often Trumped by Religious Belief
As usual HuffPo hyped a conflict between religion and science According to the article an AP survey 51 percent of US adults and 77 percent of people claiming to be bornagain or evangelical have little or no confidence that the universe began 138 billion years ago with a big bang The article went on to say that Nobel Prizewinning scientists expressed dismay at the findings It then quoted Duke University Biochemist and 2012 Nobel Prize winner Robert Lefkowitz as saying that when you are putting up facts against faith facts cant argue against faith 551 pmHuffPost Live The Catholic Church is hung up on sex
Its the National Day of Prayer so of course it is time to bash Catholics Guest John Hooper the Southern Europe editor for The Guardian suggested that the Catholic church was hung up on sex by continually discussing things such as celibacy for priests marriage and abortion HuffPost Live Host Caroline ModarressyTehrani decided to express her own distaste for the church ModarressyTehrani who by her own admission is a lapsed Catholic stopped Father Thomas Loya a Byzantine Catholic Priest who was responding to Hooper She then interjected Sorry to interrupt you but just this idea that the church hasnt been hung up on sex I think that the perception particularly among the laity particularly among people who have been following the news in the past couple of decades is the the church really is hung up on sex But hung up on sex in not just a very unhealthy way but in a very problematic way particularly on the issue of the sex abuse and sex abuse scandal Because you know really when people think of sex and the Catholic church the first thing that comes to mind isnt a healthy intimacy it really is kind of a pretty grim picture of sex abuse unfortunately Dont you think she asked with a disgusted look on her face Hooper also claimed that part of the reason that the church was holding out on allowing priests to marry was that it didnt want to pay for their families since once you start to have priests wives you have to have widows pensions Once you have priests children you have to provide in some cases for orphans pensions And in any case you are going to be paying for the upkeep of two people and not one And that is very rarely referred to in the debate over celibacy but when you talk to people in the Vatican theyll say that this is a major consideration Also noteworthy was that although the topic of discussion was Father Stefan Hartmann who petitioned Pope Francis to wave his vow of celibacy in order to raise a daughter he fathered in 1987 neither of the two guests was Roman Catholic 629 pmGET OVER IT Pelosi Mocks GOP Benghazi Fixation main story Politics
Time again to attack those folks with Rs after their names HuffPo highlighted House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosis comments calling the latest round of Benghazi hearings subterfuge According to the article what I will say is again diversion subterfuge Pelosi declared when asked at her weekly news conference about the emergence this week of emails related to the deadly attacks against a US compound on Sept 11 2012 Benghazi Benghazi Benghazi Why arent we talking about something else The article claimed that the new documents were pointless and that all information contained in them had been released before It added that Pelosi contended that there was no obstruction because House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa RCalif hadnt asked for those communications With complete contempt for the GOP congressman Pelosi added that the scope of the subpoena that whatever his name is Issa was putting forth did not include that email Sometimes all HuffPo does is parrot Democrat talking points This was one of those times 718 pmHELLO I LOVE YOU LET ME JUMP IN YOUR GAME
Nothing says were all a bunch of aging hippies like a headline that references 60s rock HuffPos tech page channeled its inner flower child The headlineHELLO I LOVE YOULET ME JUMP IN YOUR GAMEUsing a 1968 Doors song to draw attention to a story nearly 50 years later shows the Boomer influence of the HuffPo staff 723 pmKerry as Churchill
Sometimes HuffPo doesnt realize how ridiculous it really is This author argued that if there is a Winston Churchill of modern times who issues warnings and offers solutions it is Secretary of State John Kerry He even went so far as to argue that not just despite but because of Kerrys apartheid comments from April 30 since the founding of Israel in 1948 Israel has had no better friend than John Kerry This was posted at 359 pm but was then moved to the top of the climate change section later Churchill stood up to the Nazis who murdered 6 million Jews Kerry stands up to Israel the home for the survivors 800 pmWhat Drives Credit Card Debt
HuffPo loves the theme of income inequality Even a piece on why people fall into credit card debt quickly strays from analysis to hawk liberal policies The author argued that credit card debt correlates strongly with lack of health insurance touting how Obamacare will help get people out of debt The study concluded that companies shouldnt pay attention to credit when deciding whether or not to hire an employee or to give them insurance The piece ended by essentially decrying financial responsibility In terms of public policy efforts to increase health care coverage boost the creation of highquality jobs and shore up the public safety net so that households without assets have more of a financial cushion are likely to make a greater impact on our level of credit card debt than attempts to teach households to be fiscally responsible Arianna Huffington never expected people to be fiscally responsible especially those she refused to pay 851 pmHuffPost Live Rerun Supreme Court Upholds EPA Rule on Air Pollution
Even on HuffPost Live energy logic seeps through the cracks EPA regulations do burden industry and raise power prices for consumers Former EPA administrator Jeffrey Holmstead claimed that the EPA is hurting places like Texas In terms of future regulations Holmstead contended that Texas really is overburdened by these regulations and that a combination of EPA regulations is causing a number of plants to shut down Holmstead then focused on the regulations impact on power prices He said power prices have gone up and will continue to go up and emphasized the direct increase of the power bills Maybe thats another reason that HuffPo doesnt expect people to be fiscally responsible They cant when government keeps raising prices 901 pmIs This Warren Buffet or Thomas Piketty
Author Guy Rolnik compared the American capitalist with French Socialists Rolnik compared Obama supporter and liberal donor Warren Buffett as the American capitalist with ultraliberal French economist Thomas Piketty He accepted that America is an oligarchy because of capitalism based on Buffetts and Pikettys statements and claimed that American capitalists and French socialists are basically the same Because actual conservative capitalists dont exist despite constant liberal squawking about rich conservative businessmen and billionaires 1010 pmHuffPost Live Rerun Tennessee Chooses Jail Over Treatment for New Moms
HuffPost Live discussed personhood laws which attempt to recognize the individual lives of unborn babies In this discussion of pregnancy the value of the baby was largely ignored with Tennessee ACLU Director even calling babies embryos This segment showed HuffPo as part of the lefts permanent proabortion lobby To liberals all lives matter even a convicted murderer  except the unborn While host Alyona Minkovski and her guests discussed the laws impact on pregnant women their babies were left out of the discussion almost entirely 1126 pmHuffPost Live Rerun The Laws Holding Back Our Happiness
Even in a rather tame interview with an author HuffPo betrayed its liberal agenda Caroline ModarressyTehrani interviewed Philip K Howard author of The Rule of Nobody His book looked at how bureaucratic decisions instead of common sense ones are preventing people from being happy Instead of creating legal structures that support our values Americans are abandoning our values in deference to the bureaucratic structures Howard said in his book In the interview he called Washington dysfunctional yet claimed overregulation isnt the real problem We need most of the oversight we have Howard said But ModarressyTehrani pressed multiple leftwing pet issues with him including income inequality citing Maxwell Strachans Huffington Post article minimum wage increases the happiness of people in Denmark without noting their HIGH tax rates and the lefts current favorite economist Thomas Piketty 1221 am HuffPost Live Rerun Interview with HuffPost editor
Marc Lamont Hill and editor Paige Lavender played a clip of fundamentalist Sen James Inhofe ROkla and literally laughed at him and mocked him for decrying the decline of traditional values Inhofe called out the Obama administrations suppression of JudeoChristian values and emphasized the need to submit to Gods authority and foster objective morals Lavender responded by laughing sarcastically and saying God forbid we change while the two proceeded to mock Inhofe and other Christian conservatives 124 amBig Tech Fights Back
In the wee hours of the morning Huffington Post used a Washington Post article as its frontpage headline Ironically the headline praised big businesses for working against government surveillance HuffPo regularly attacks corporations so is this sudden praise because they happen to oppose government surveillance Or is it just that tech companies like Google are major Obama supporters Regardless the story was moved down the page by the morning before anybody could see HuffPo actually praising business 201 amTweet The only time its acceptable to sleep with someone other than your spouse
In the wee hours of the morning HuffPos Twitter feed turns to sex to get latenight readers attention This classic HuffPo headline mixed the prospect of sex and Rickrolled readers into a piece that showed owners who get replaced by pets as soon as they get out of bed Hardly salacious 200 amRapist Gets Light Sentence Because Judge Says 14YearOld Wasnt The Victim She Claimed To Be
Irony alert HuffPo is justifiably upset that a rapist gets a light sentence Of course this happened in Texas so that probably explains the anger Yet in the next hour their true colors show  sympathy for the murdererrapist Not for the victim HuffPo has been a big supporter of the push to give exfelons voting rights too HuffPo editors see every criminal as a victim The actual victims rarely get this attention 324 amClayton Lockett Botched Execution Killers Collapsed Vein Wasnt Noticed For 21 Minutes
There is nothing the left loves more it seems than murderers Even though Lockett was also a rapist his death is still bemoaned by the site The HuffPo feeding frenzy on the Lockett execution is just a hint at the national crusade against the death penalty So every Lockett story was injected with hyped headlines and large photos Unsurprisingly the site showed little concern for the victims and their families 432 amTweet Is this the sexiest workout EVER
Never let it be said that The Huffington Post isnt willing to exploit women for clicks The site promoted videos for Brukwine the Dancehallinspirired sic workout is a bodymoving sweatinducing twerkfilled class and after watching nearly every video on the companys Instagram account brukwineaddiction we cant wait to try The videos included dancing jiggling thrusting scantily clad women  almost all in high heels Again HuffPo latenight has taken on a Cinemax feel 501 amTweet James Franco says Lindsay Lohan is delusional if she thinks they ever had sex together
Its late at night and though there are a few signs of life at HuffPo the Twitter feed is still dwelling on sex One wonders if they have some metrics for how many sex stories the site needs to have at different times of the day Throw in a few celebs and this nonstory is classic Actor James Franco denied having sex with Lindsay Lohan Hopefully for Lindsays sake its true 620 amWhat Kind Of Game Of Thrones Fan Are You
Time for HuffPo to juggle the front page so why not a rape quiz The Quick Poll included two separate Game of Thrones rape questions Did Jaime rape Cersei in Breaker of Chains and What do you think about the writers changing the rape scene from the book Imagine HuffPos reaction to conservatives debating whether a rape actually happened or not But liberal sites dont need to be consistent 630 am The Great Headline Switch
In the middle of the night Eastern Standard Time Ukraine launched attacks at separatists in the eastern part of its nation Someone at HuffPo moved that story to the story just under the main article That only lasted a short while It was switched back to highlight a piece attacking President Bush of course The story BushEra Controversy Back In The Spotlight focused on who has responsibility for abuses of immigration detainees in the immediate aftermath of the Sept 11 attacks Hardly breaking news  you know like a war Even HuffPo called the other story First Major Assault Against ProRussian ForcesThe assault returned to its spot about an hour later as the Bush story moved down the page 654 amFox Hosts Freak Out After Editor Exposes Big Secret
Life is never complete at Huffington Post without an attack on Fox News This story moved to the front page early in the morning as the site promoted a war of words between Fox hosts and a climate change alarmist who had actually been on Fox That wasnt enough for him apparently After his appearance he complained about the subjects discussed Tweeting out several nasty comments HuffPos Freak Out meant that Fox hosts actually responded to the attack 746 amTweet Genderbending nudes show a different side of the human body NSFW
What an unsurprising way for HuffPo to start the morning promoting genderbending nude photos HuffPo wrote Polish photographerMaciek Jasikreveals that a clear image doesnt automatically equal a true image especially in a world where so much is never certain Gender bending is just one of the many lefty um positions promoted at the site And its an ideal one to end 24 hours with HuffPo Julia A Seymour Mike Ciandella and Sean Long contributed to this report  Dan Gainor is the Media Research Centers Vice President for Business and Culture He writes frequently about media for Fox News Opinion He can also be contacted on Facebook and Twitter as dangainor   FollowFoxNewsOpinion on Facebook",2014-05-05T15:46-04:00,abortion

Fox,http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2014/10/23/food-companies-spending-millions-to-fight-label-requirements-in-colorado/,DENVER  Farms and fields dominate Colorado ads opposing a ballot measure to require labels on some foods that have been genetically modified with farmers telling voters the labels will damage their businesses But farmers and agriculture groups are just bit players in the 11 million campaign to defeat Proposition 105 The real money is coming from biotechnology giant Monsanto Co which has given more than 47 million and food giants like Pepsico and CocaCola which sent a combined 19 million to fighting the proposal Hormel Foods Kraft Foods Kellogg Co and The Hershey Co are also outspending farm groups to fight the proposal Food companies are pouring big money into fighting a similar ballot measure in Oregon too Colorado and Oregon are battlegrounds in a national war over genetically modified organisms or organisms that have been altered at the molecular or cellular level Socalled GMOs now make up almost the entirety of many staple crops such as corn and soybeans which are used in many items on grocerystore shelves Were not saying GMOs are bad Were saying we want them to be labeled said Tammi DeVille Merrell campaign manager for Right To Know Colorado which has raised less than 500000 and has no TV or radio ads to promote its campaign Short on funds the campaign is relying on bigname endorsers to take their side Chipotle along with Ben  Jerrys ice cream company has backed GMO labeling Former Democratic presidential hopeful Dennis Kucinich has planned a visit to Colorado next week to talk up the measure Labeling opponents in Colorado feel confident theyll be able to defeat the proposal Theyve spent just about 3 million on television ads according to campaign finance data analyzed by the Center for Public Integrity The ads call the labeling measure misleading because it doesnt cover many foods in the grocery store including eggs meat dairy and beer Those foods arent currently genetically modified though animals are often raised on feed that has been modified Labels also wouldnt be required on foods and drinks sold for immediate consumption by grocery stores restaurants or delis Proponents said those foods are regulated in different code sections making them impossible to include in a single ballot question But opponents say the differences would confuse shoppers Labels on food are very important to me They need to be very reliable and not leave people making assumptions said Mary Lee Chin a registered dietitian who volunteers for the opposition campaign Chin said GMOs can help the environment by producing foods that require less water or fewer pesticides Genetic engineering techniques theyre a more efficient way of growing foods said Chin who has worked as a consultant for Monsanto in the past but no longer works for the company Colorado and Oregon could become the first states to adopt mandatory GMO labels through public votes Washington and California rejected GMO ballot proposals in recent years Vermont lawmakers have approved GMO label requirements but the matter is still being fought in the courts Publicly available polling is limited on GMO label requirements Colorado State University looked at the question 14 years ago and found mixed results In that 2000 survey shoppers along the Front Range were asked about genetically modified potatoes A whopping 78 percent supported mandatory labeling   but respondents were not willing to pay a premium for such labeling Farming groups opposed to mandatory labeling argue it would make food more expensive though the sides disagree on how much Proponents are hoping Colorado is now ready to make GMO labels mandatory This issue is really resonating with people They want to know whats in their food said Kelly Erb spokeswoman for Right To Know Colorado The GMO question is one of four statewide ballot measures Coloradans will decide next month Dozens more ballot questions are pending in other states on everything from guns to marijuana to gambling More than 1 billion dollars will likely be spent on campaigns this year for ballot measures according to the Center for Public Integrity Thats more than the Republican and Democratic parties have raised collectively this cycle CPI looked at television ad spending on all ballot measures nationwide Other highlights from Colorado    A measure to allow casino gambling at a horse racetrack in suburban Denver Amendment 68 has attracted more TV spending than any ballot question outside California Supporters have spent about 64 million on 5582 television ads Opponents have spent about 57 million on 6390 ads    A measure to add unborn human beings to Colorado criminal code is as lopsided as the GMO measure Opponents are the only ones on TV Abortionrights groups that fear the measure could harm reproductive rights and had spent about 477000 on television ads through Oct 20

he set out to do when he was elected four years ago Hes logged improvements in the states economic health presided over the creation of 250000 privatesector jobs and confronted many of Detroits worsening financial problems Thats more than many governors achieve in a single term But instead of cruising to reelection on the fulfillment of his 2010 promises Snyders bid has been met with ambivalence by parts of his own party Some Republicans dont know what to make of his neutrality on social issues and his reluctance to bash Democrats And hes made plenty of enemies among Democrats and organized labor You know Im not a great politician I dont want to be a great politician the former venture capitalist and corporate executive recently told a crowd of approving business leaders Snyder who never held public office until he became governor won the job with a campaign as a tough nerd and an outsider The business community adores him for overhauling the tax system and delivering many cuts for private enterprise He also signed ontime state budgets and other commercefriendly measures But conservative activists are angry about his embrace of the Medicaid expansion in the health care overhaul Common Core education standards and proposed higher gasoline taxes to improve roads Snyder also defied fellow Republicans by committing state money to help Detroit emerge from bankruptcy and vetoing GOP gun abortion and voter ID bills I expect someone with an R by their name to promote the Republican Partys platform at the very least said Joan Fabiano a Lansingarea tea party leader Snyder has incensed voters on the left too Labor leaders were enraged that he made Michigan a righttowork state and toughened a law giving the state more control over financially distressed local governments Unions have targeted him for defeat The Democratic Governors Association has spent more than 5 million on TV ads to help opponent Mark Schauer a former oneterm congressman Snyder remains the favorite and most polls have shown him ahead of Schauer who is still unknown to many voters No firstterm Michigan governor has lost reelection in 52 years But the former accountants jobapproval and favorability ratings are lagging And an EPICMRA poll conducted in midJuly showed the candidates about even among 600 likely voters Snyder with 46 percent Schauer at 43 percent with a sampling error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points This is a governor who is stuck in the mid40s in the polls Schauer said There is a combination of anger and motivation for change Some observers question whether independents will stay in Snyders corner and whether the GOP base will be excited enough about a second term to vote in large numbers There are a lot of people out there who dont like what hes done said Bill Ballenger a political analyst and former Republican state lawmaker I dont think theres visceral dislike of Snyder personally I dont think hes got any great visceral passion for him either A tea party candidate plans to run against Snyders running mate Lt Gov Brian Calley at the GOPs state nominating convention in August threatening party unity before November Snyder 55 beat much betterknown Republicans in the 2010 primary His rivals split the conservative vote and he also appealed to Democrats and independents Once in office he delighted conservatives with the elimination of Michigans longstanding requirement that unionized workers pay union fees as a condition of their employment Then he moved back toward the middle That shift included decisions that alienated others in

updated Watch The OReilly Factor weeknights at 8 pm and 11 pm ET     OREILLY Thanks for staying with us Im Bill OReilly in the What the Heck Just Happened segment tonight New poll again from the Pew people asking young people what they care about In the group 18 to 29 they care about the World Cup at a rate of 24 percent The Supreme Court decision six percent Violence in Iraq 13percent IRS losing emails ten percent VA scandal 15percent They dont really care very much about anything Here now to analyze the young folks two old guys Bernard McGuirk and Greg Gutfeld author of the book Not Cool which is a young persons expression Gutfeld And why dont they care about anything GREG GUTFELD COHOST OF THE FIVE AND HOST OF THE REDEYE Its no surprise Soccer is probably the greatest thing ever in the world OREILLY Yeah GUTFELD This is a sport that is so interesting it doesnt need scoring Now imagine if you took all the scoring out of an NBA game took away all those baskets How much faster it would be By the way in Italian soccer means sleep OREILLY Yeah I know that GUTFELD But its not surprising our country is in the toilet So we will look at anything even soccer to take our minds off it I actually took up nude Pilates with me and Dobbs in the park OREILLY You and Lou Dobbs GUTFELD Yeah in the park OREILLY What park is that GUTFELD Brian Park about 300 am LAUGHTER OREILLY Yes GUTFELD I pretend to walk a dog Just got me off OREILLY All right now weve got absolutely nothing out of that answer Do you have any reason at all that young people dont care about anything BERNARD MCGUIRK EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF IMUS IN THE MORNING Of course because we raised a bunch of common denominator nitwitz ph So I mean you say  you have Jesse Waters goes out and he documents the fact that he can tell a young person that the French bombed Perl Harbor and they believe it I mean them you know they think a misogynist or somebody who can give you a back rub You know they dont know Ghana from your momma Its unbelievable OREILLY So you think its the collapse of the educational system thats just driven the apathy MCGUIRK And that and the way we raised them We didnt tell them  OREILLY Challenge them MCGUIRK Exactly right OREILLY In any way MCGUIRK If its not trending on Twitter they dont care about it I mean maybe if we had something  OREILLY I think its the machines I really do Because it is out of  and 24percent CROSSTALK OREILLY No the machines that these people carry that we had to take away from you right before the segment began GUTFELD That was a neck massager OREILLY Because they  you can just blot out the whole world You can just blot it out Create your own insipid world that means nothing and still be functioning GUTFELD But its all good at  its also has enabled more conversation and communication so you could argue the opposite that it has gotten people more in touch with politics and pop culture OREILLY And then would you have the poll that says they dont care anything about politics What are discussing that I dont care about politics That Im not cool GUTFELD Thats a fair point OREILLY I dont know I dont want to overwhelm either of you with logic so lets go on to the next deal This is a reaction to the Hobby Lobby Supreme Court ruling that said if you are a corporation that has strongly held religious believes we are not going to force you to buy a birth control device that may be you consider to be abortion Here is how CNN commentator Ashleigh Banfield reacted BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  ASHLEIGH BANFIELD CNN COMMENTATOR I started to think yesterday as I was trying to sort of digest everything I was hearing at rapid pace what if this were a Muslim family that owned a company and they were very strict in their religion they did not believe that women should be coming to work unless they had permission slips from their husbands Is this the kind of thing that they now could mount a case and take this all the way to the Supreme Court and heavens to Betsy there is actually precedent for a religious issue trumping civil rights laws Alex UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE Well this is exactly the danger in this case END VIDEO CLIP  OREILLY Is it really MCGUIRK Heavens to Betsy Bill Hey Im glad to see I havent seen that lady for a while The woman with the hot glasses Ashleigh Banfield Im glad she landed on her feet But the way she is talking it sounds like she might have landed on her head I mean this is just  thats outrageous She is engaging in Islamophobia in order to justify her religious bigotry OREILLY Its the slippery slope that if you give a Christian concern this window that you dont have to do an abortion mechanism that they consider to be one The morning after pill that then everybody of the Muslim religion will be wearing burqas in the market place And you know theyll force them to do that MCGUIRK Yeah Im for that I would like to see burqa Fridays the opposite of casual Fridays OREILLY Burqa Fridays GUTFELD I dont need to see you know khaki shorts I dont need to see peoples knees But you know this is the first time Ive seen mainstream media concern about sharia law It used to be if a conservative brought it up they were nuts They didnt care about Hirsi Ali being banned from Brandeis for being a victim of sharia law By the way she talks about Muslim businesses She should give us a specific example of a Muslim business that might do this because it also the case specifically says this does not apply to other religious exemptions So this is a completely bogus point OREILLY OK So you think that its fabricated GUTFELD Yes OREILLY For the sake of what MCGUIRK For the sake of just for politics Political reasons OREILLY Political MCGUIRK Of course it is OREILLY To make the Supreme Court look like a bunch of fascists MCGUIRK To make  GUTFELD Old men MCGUIRK The people who support the decision look like a bunch of fascists so that they can win at the ballot box OREILLY Right And I hope that Ms Banfield isnt going for the younger market because only six percent of the 18 to 29 Americans cared about the Supreme Court decision GUTFELD Yeah OREILLY Not a lot All right There is Gutfeld and McGuirk everyone Dennis Miller will return in this slot next week And he would like you to know that the Bolder Fresher Show in Rapid City South Dakota on July 25 95 percent sold out Fargo North Dakota the next night July 26th 90 percent sold out So if you want to see us in the Dakotas you have got to get on it Also in the fall we see everybody in Boston Philadelphia Las Vegas West Virginia BillOReillycom has info on

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/04/16/aclu-challenges-arkansas-voter-id-law/,LITTLE ROCK Ark  A civil liberties group filed suit Wednesday to block a new Arkansas law requiring voters to show photo identification at the polls before it is enforced for the first time statewide in the primary election next month The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas filed the suit in Pulaski County court on behalf of four voters it says will be harmed by the law which was approved by the Republicanled Legislature last year Democratic Gov Mike Beebe vetoed the measure but lawmakers overrode his objection with simple majority votes in the House and Senate     The Arkansas Constitution specifically outlines the qualifications needed to vote The state should be ashamed of making it harder for eligible voters from exercising this most fundamental right than our own Constitution requires Rita Sklar executive director if the ACLU of Arkansas said in a statement The new law is being challenged when the state is in the national political spotlight because of a hotlycontested race that could tip the majority in the US Senate Democratic US Sen Mark Pryor is being challenged by Republican US Rep Tom Cotton Neither faces an opponent in the primary but outside money is pouring into Arkansas for advertising months before the general election in November The lawsuit which names Secretary of State Mark Martin and the state Board of Election Commissioners as defendants says the voter ID law violates Arkansas constitution The lawsuit which also was backed by civil rights advocacy group Arkansas Public Law Center says the requirement placed additional qualifications and impairments on Arkansas citizens before they can exercise their state constitutional right to vote The voters cited by the lawsuit include Barry Haas a Pulaski County resident who refused to show ID when casting a ballot in a March 11 special election According to the suit Haas cast a provisional ballot that wasnt counted since he didnt show ID While the law was used in some local elections earlier this year it will be used statewide for the first time during early voting beginning May 5 and on primary election day May 20 Thirtyone states have laws in effect requiring voters to show some form of identification according to the National Conference of State Legislatures Seven states have strict photo ID requirements similar to Arkansas Voter ID laws have been put on hold in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania because of court challenges The lawsuit asks the court to prevent the state from enforcing the ID requirement which took effect on Jan 1 in the primary Under previous law election workers were required to ask for photo ID but voters dont have to show it to cast a ballot Under the new law voters who dont show photo identification can cast provisional ballots Those ballots would be counted only if voters provide ID to county election officials before noon on the Monday following an election sign an affidavit stating they are indigent or have a religious objection to being photographed Arkansas Republicans had pushed for voter ID requirements for years but the measure failed to reach the governors desk under Democratic majorities Republicans in 2012 won control of the Legislature for the first time in 138 years and have enjoyed a number of successes including the passage of stricter antiabortion laws and broader gun rights The lawsuit is the second related to the new ID requirements The Pulaski County Election Commission has sued the state Board of Election Commissioners for adopting a rule that gives absentee voters additional time to show proof of ID The Pulaski County Election Commission claimed in a lawsuit earlier this month that the state panel overstepped its bounds with the new rule The rule allows voters who did not submit required identification with their absentee ballot to turn in the documents for their vote to be counted by noon Monday following an election It mirrors an identical cure period that the law gives to voters who fail to show identification at the polls,2014-04-16T14:58-04:00,abortion
Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/10/12/same-sex-marriage-becoming-law-land-plus-rove-and-trippis-midterm-predictions/, This is a rush transcript from Fox News Sunday October 12 2014 This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated CHRIS WALLACE ANCHOR Im Chris Wallace     Another person in Dallas tests positive for Ebola And with the Supreme Court deciding not to weigh in is samesex marriage becoming the law of the land BEGIN VIDEOTAPE UNIDENTIFIED MALE This is the outcome that we have hoped for It is the outcome that the Constitution requires UNIDENTIFIED MALE Id hoped we had a Supreme Court that decided this I think it deserved a hearing at that level WALLACE Well have a debate between two leading advocates Ted Olson the man who won Bush versus Gore and the case to overturn the ban on same sex marriage in California and Tony Perkins president of the Family Research Council Then there are now just 23 days until the midterm elections with Washingtons balance of power at stake Well break down the key races with our election night team Karl Rove and Joe TrippiPlus is President Obamas ISIS battle plan working JEN PSAKI STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON Let me just tick through these and then we can go to your next question Some of the successes weve seen on the ground by the Iraqi security forces WALLACE Our Sunday panel weighs in And our power player of the week taking you inside the White House like never before UNIDENTIFIED MALE You can drag around to see the entire state dining room Up on the ceiling look at the chandelier WALLACE All right now on Fox News Sunday END VIDEOTAPE WALLACE And hello again from Fox News in Washington A health care worker at the Dallas hospital that treated the Ebola patient who died has now tested positive for the virus But that preliminary test will now be checked by the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta Lets get the latest on this and rampedup screening at US airports from FOX News correspondent Leland Vittert  Leland LELAND VITTERT FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Chris theres still a lot of questions to be answered about this new case in Dallas including how this health care worker came into contact with Thomas Eric Duncan known as patient zero and for that matter how this worker contracted Ebola despite all the precautions although officials in Dallas say they were ready for this BEGIN VIDEOTAPE DR DAN VARGA TEXAS HEALTH RESOURCES This health care worker had been until the selfmonitoring regimen prescribed by the CDC The entire process from the patients self monitoring to the admission into isolation took less than 90 minutes The patients condition is stable VITTERT The new patient reported a lowgrade fever Friday night and was isolated and tested This will be the first case of Ebola treated from start to finish in the United States which could give doctors new insight into the virus at the same hospital where records show they apparently badly bungled the first case Thomas Eric Duncan who died Wednesday had arrived in the United States without a fever but with Ebola The Associated Press reports that he went to the emergency room in Dallas with a high fever of 103 Despite that doctors sent him home a few hours later On the 28th he returned in far worse shape Soon official put family and friends of the Liberian man in isolation for fear they contracted the virus as well Now 15 days into the 21 days of possible incubation other than the health care worker no one has reported a fever or other symptoms But the fear remains that the 150 or so travelers arriving daily to the United States from the hot zone in West Africa could also be infected with Ebola Pictures provided by Customs and Border Protection show their officers wearing protective gear while checking the temperature of and interviewing those arriving from the hot zone in West Africa By later this week about 140 passengers a day will get checked at the five gateway airports equipped with screeners and quarantine rooms END VIDEOTAPE VITTERT In Dallas right now they are not only trying to treat this health care worker but also isolate those the person had contact with and try to stop any more infections  Chris WALLACE Leland thank you When this week began samesex marriage was legal in 19 states Now because of the Supreme Courts decision not to review the ruling of several appeals court samesex marriage may soon be legal in 25 states We want to drill down into the legal status and merits of same sex marriage with two top advocates leading conservative Ted Olson represented the plaintiffs in the Virginia case and is coauthor of Redeeming the Dream The Case for Marriage Equality Tony Perkins is president of the Family Research Council Gentlemen welcome back to Fox News Sunday Mr Olson let me start with you Why do you think the Supreme Court decided not to intervene in these cases and can we take from that theres now a majority in the court who feels there is a constitutional right to samesex marriage TED OLSON FORMER SOLICITOR GENERAL No one knows what goes on in the United States Supreme Court when theyre deciding to take a case or how they decide the case But what the Supreme Court was looking at on Monday when it rendered its decision not to review these pending cases is a record of something like 25 federal judges at the district court and at the appeal level which had consistently ruled that same sex marriage bans were unconstitutional I think the justices saw was a trend  overwhelming trend in the same direction and felt that the federal courts were handling this issue in an appropriate and proper way and decided not to weigh in WALLACE Mr Perkins let me go a little further than Ted Olson because he has to argue before the court If the majority felt there was no constitutional right  actually it takes a minority only four of the nine justices to decide to review a case  why would they make a nonruling in this case which would allow thousands more to have samesex marriages TONY PERKINS FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL Well I mean Ted is more of an expert on the Supreme Court You still have two circuits that have decisions coming up that look favorable toward natural marriage But I think the effect here is what we need to look I think the effect of this is the court did a back alley type Roe v Wade decision by letting the lower courts do their evil bidding And the result of that is such  you go back to 1973 when the court imposed abortion on the nation it was to resolve the issue 41 years later That issue is now a political issue in every election from the president on down This issue is not going away despite what the court may say WALLACE I have to allow you to responds  back alley Roe versus Wade OLSON Yes I think the analogy would be to the 1967 decision of the United States Supreme Court that struck down bans on interracial marriage We now understand and the American public believe that that was a right decision and right for America Over 59 percent of Americans now believe that marriage equality should be the law of the land Individuals should be allowed to get married to the person that they love The individuals involved in these cases have been together for decades They now want to be a part of the community and be part of our society by marrying and living with the people that they love WALLACE Let me pick up on one of the central concerns that people have about all of this In all 16 of the states that because of the Supreme Courts nondecision may not have say legal samesex marriage there was a ban on those same sex marriage either approved by the state legislature or popular referendum Mr Olson you have a long record of opposing what you call or people call judicial activism Here is what Senator Ted Cruz said this week Take a look BEGIN VIDEO CLIP SEN TED CRUZ R TEXAS We shouldnt have unelected judges striking down our marriage laws trying to impose their public policy notion on the state of Texas and on states where the elected legislatures have made the decision to preserve and protect traditional marriage END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE Question  why should judges overrule the demonstrated will of the people either through referenda or through state legislature action OLSON We have a Constitution and Bill of Rights precisely because we want protections from majority rule When the majority in a legislature or a popular vote take away rights of individuals that are protected by the Bill of Rights then we have an independent judiciary to rectify that situation Its happened again and again and again throughout this countrys history We have an independent judiciary to protect the rights of individuals like gay and lesbian citizens who only want respect decency and equality along with the rest of us WALLACE Mr Perkins let me go back to the case where there were bans on interracial marriages In the number of states the Supreme Court simply ruled those bans were unconstitutional as Mr Olson  PERKINS Apples and oranges CROSSTALK WALLACE Mr Olson says  and its an argument we dont get to vote on the Bill of Rights Why is it apples and oranges PERKINS Apples and oranges because were talking about an arbitrary boundary created by man between the races That doesnt exist in nature There is a boundary between people of the same sex getting married They cant procreate They cant  theres nothing in nature to say thats normal But to go back this is unprecedented decision Voters in two thirds of the states have affirmatively gone out to protect the definition of marriage This is the only time in a period of two decades in which voters and their elected representatives have affirmatively embraced the definition of marriage in their state policy and now you have the courts overturning that robbing the people of their vote and their voice What we see here I believe is that the court has lit a fuse to a powder keg culturally that is going to have ramifications for years to come in this nation WALLACE All right Lets talk about the merits of this and obviously different people have different views What is your single strongest argument against allowing samesex marriage PERKINS Well Id like to ask Ted whats the purpose of marriage OLSON The purpose of marriage is what the Supreme Court has said 14 times Its a fundamental right that involves privacy association liberty and being with the person you love and forming a part of the community and being treated equally with the rest of society Now over if you look at people under the age of 30 youre talking about a powder keg People under the age of 30 its like 80 percent of people agree  PERKINS Thats not true OLSON Well that is true WALLACE Wait a minute You answered his question Now whats your answer to him PERKINS First off marriage is not to affirm adults Its for the protection of children And if love is the only factor where you do you draw the boundary OLSON Well what the Supreme Court said in the cases that it decided last year involving the defense of marriage case striking that down is that children do matter There are thousands and tens of thousands of children in samesex households They deserve the right to equality and the same respect and decency that other people have that are living right next door  WALLACE Mr Perkins PERKINS Well we know from the social science that children do best with a mom and a dad Thats why our policies in this country have preferred marriage and given benefits to it But let me  if love is the factor what boundaries are there OLSON You want the sky to fall because two people living next door to you  PERKINS No I  OLSON What court after court after court has said that allowing people of the same sex to marry the person that they love to be part of the community and to be treated equally does no damage to heterosexual marriage CROSSTALK OLSON And court after court after court has said children living in a samesex relationship do as well or better than people in other communities PERKINS The court doesnt study this social  OLSON The court heard evidence PERKINS Let me ask you what are the boundaries though If its just love what are the boundaries Where can we go with marriage WALLACE What are you suggesting That theyre going to be polygamy That people will be marrying their pets CROSSTALK PERKINS No I didnt say that If we remove the natural established boundaries for marriage the union of a man and woman we have removed those boundaries those guardrails Theres no arbitrary boundary  CROSSTALK WALLACE What about the argument that Ted Olson makes which is all right you and your wife live happily in this house theres a samesex couple living here Whats the damage to you PERKINS Lets talk about that Lets talk about the wedding vendors that have been put out of business Lets talk  WALLACE Im not talking about that Thats a different issue PERKINS No its  CROSSTALK WALLACE Its a different issue Im asking you whats the impact on you and your family to have these people living next door PERKINS Lets talk about it Lets talk about my children all of a sudden in school are taught values and morals that contradict what I teach as a parent at home Thats happening already across the country in those states that have recognized and forced samesex marriage on the states Lets talk about the business place lets about Aaron and Melissa Klein a bakery in Oregon forced out of business forced to pay 150000 in fines simply because they didnt want to participate in a samesex marriage WALLACE Were gong to get to that in a second But your argument as to whether somehow this damages the Perkins to have another couple next door OLSON Well everyone who has ever talked about this says theres no heterosexual couple that is going to decide to get divorced or not to get married or not to raise children just because another couple next to them is treated equally and with respect and decency under our Constitution That is why we have courts The same argument Mr Perkins was making was made with respect to interracial marriages in 1967  30 some states at one point prohibited interracial marriages And talk about the color of the skin People were making the same arguments Marriage is wrong between people of different races We have to stop that When the Supreme Court finally acted 16 states were still prohibiting interracial marriages As far as the marriage vendors the people in the flower business or in the  in the cake business or whatever it happens to be we have a civil rights law that say if youre going to engage in commerce youre not going to discriminate against people on the basis of their religion sex or race Thats a simple solution to the problem Massachusetts  PERKINS Driving them out of business OLSON Massachusetts allowed samesex marriage 10 years ago Nobody has been put out of marriage  CROSSTALK OLSON Its a canard PERKINS Its not WALLACE Mr Perkins Im going to give you the final word In your answer Id like you to talk about what role you think this will play in the 2016 Republican presidential battle PERKINS Well look adoption agencies have been put out of the business in Massachusetts Parents have been denied the right to determine the values their children are taught It affects families It affects all of Americans and its wrong for the court to take away the voice of the people I think its an issue not only in 2016 Like Roe v Wade the court wanted it to go away 41 years ago Its still here This issue will be here for decades to come if the court does not allow the states and the people to deal with it WALLACE Mr Perkins Mr Olson I want to thank you both so much for coming in today I thought it was going to be interesting It was indeed And we will stay on top of this issue both in and outside of the courts Thank you gentlemen OLSON Thank you Chris WALLACE Up next the presidents new war plan to defeat ISIS faces early setbacks A Sunday group will assist where we stand Plus what would you like to ask the panel about the Obama strategy Just go to Facebook or Twitter FoxNewsSunday and we may use your question on the air COMMERCIAL BREAK BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JEN PSAKI STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN There have been certainly gains made by the Iraqi security forces in Iraq I can go through some of those for you if that will be helpful One moment Sorry Um  END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE Well State Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki this week struggling for more than 40 seconds to come up with successes of the Iraqi army in the fight against ISIS And its time now for our Sunday group Brit Hume FOX News political analyst Amy Walter from the Cook Political Report Republican advisor Carly Fiorina former CEO of HewlettPackard and Bob Woodward of The Washington Post While Psaki may have trouble because the Iraqi army hasnt had many successes so far Lets put up this map ISIS is continuing its march through Anbar province all the way to the infamous town of Abu Ghraib which is in Baghdads western suburbs Meanwhile Brit so far the Obama administration has failed so far at least to train up and equip the Iraqi army or the Kurdish Peshmerga BRIT HUME FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST You know when this strategy was first outlined it seemed dubious to many people that it could ever accomplish its goal of defeating destroying ISIS It looked like it was designed more to contain ISIS especially in Iraq Now it looks like it may not succeed in doing that At least the airpower alone is failing to do that You can see the advances continue Obviously its hindered to some extent by the airstrikes which are not massive Theyre in fact minimal  one would have to say that It may be because they dont have the knowledge to be able to target effectively for a larger more robust air campaign But so far this is going badly even if the goal were meanly to contain ISIS in Iraq WALLACE By Friday the State Department was doing a better job of describing the successes by the Iraqi but not much better Take a look at this BEGIN VIDEO CLIP MARIE HARF STATE DEPT DEPUTY SPOKESWOMAN Iraqi security forces in and around Baghdad are strong theyre under constant assessment The embassy remains open We continue to conduct business END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE Bob is that what its come to that the fact that the US embassy in Iraq and open and it is a success BOB WOODWARD THE WASHINGTON POST Well this is a mess and it is the countrys mess not just President Obamas mess WALLACE Which country Ours WOODWARD Everywhere The whole world And you know this  this  Obama is clearly going through a wakeup call Hes got to come up with something to do here thats going to work He said its going to take years He said hes going to destroy these people A mighty ambitious goal and were going to see I think the big question is can  you know the war power is a shared power between the executive and the Congress and can the president and the Congress get together and say OK this is how were going to do it This is going to be the strategy If that could be done were in for a calamity WALLACE Then there is the battle in Syria which is centered around the town of Kobani on the border from Syria and Turkey There have been a number of air strikes by the US but the Turkish army refuses to intervene And even our allies among the Syrian rebels are turning against our refusal to go after the Assad regime Carly were seeing in Syria what happens when you dont have any ground forces as a partner When were doing our bombs but the Syrian rebels are not able to fight and the Turks refuse to intervene CARLY FIORINA FORMER CEO HEWLETT PACKARD Were also seeing in Syria the fact that weve never had a strategy So for several years President Obama would say Bashar al Assad has to go but he clearly doesnt believe that I think our inconsistency there is inexplicable there now I mean why not set up a buffer zone Why not arm the Kurds Why not establish a nofly zone Why not reach an agreement with the Turks about what needs to be done in Syria Its simply theres no explanation for it And meanwhile meanwhile things continue to go from bad to worse in Syria WALLACE So are you saying that we should at this late date intervene Because if we set up a new fly zone we set up a buffer zone were taking sides against the Assad regime FIORINA Well gee I thought that was the strategy Thats why I started with President Obama saying Bashar al Assad must go Did he not mean that Do we not think hes a tyrant who has to go Thats where I think this is all falling apart because there clearly has been a pattern of inconsistency here Yes we need to defeat ISIS Yes if Bashar al Assad is under pressure as a result of our strategy to do so isnt that good Isnt that what President Obama told you need to happened that he should go WALLACE We ask you for questions for the panel and we got several like these on Facebook David Mansfield writes Is every decision the president makes on how to best deal with ISIS based on political considerations than what is best for the security of our country And Ellen Klage asks After the elections will Obamas strategy change Amy how do you answer them Is this  this fight ISIS this war against ISIS is it all politics AMY WALTER THE COOK POLITICAL REPORT Well theres politics going on in both countries When we talk about Turkey thats internal Turkish politics going on What the prime minister wants is not necessarily whats best for the Americans Its whats best for him and his hold on power And the American public too is really ambivalent about this They cant quite figure out what they want to see On the one hand they dont want to see troops going onto the ground by Syria but its not by a big percentage its about 44 percent who favor troops going in Even Republicans are a little bit divided on this issue 36 percent of Republicans say they dont want troops going in And yet you ask the next question which is do you think troops will go in And Americans say of course we do We know its going to happen We dont like it but we know its whats going to have to happen And they want Congress to take action and right now what Congress has done is punted They dont want to talk about any of these issues before an election They dont even want to talk about it when the election is over And that  I agree with Bob there  thats what needs to happen next If were going to get more involved in this if were going to be talking about troops if were going to be talking about any of these other issues besides targeted airstrikes Congress needs to weigh in And theres not even a consistency in that issue HUME Its unmistakable in a situation this if the president wants the support of Congress and its always useful to have it its unifying to have it he needs to seek it And if theres a goal here and the goal really is the destruction of ISIS he needs to make the case before Congress and the public that the destruction of ISIS is an indispensable national security objective that must be achieved for our safety as a nation He needs to make that case he needs to make it with some force and he needs energetically to per sue a resolution of support from Congress My guess is if he did that hed get it But you know to speak of Congress divided as it is between the two parties as a place from which the idea the support for this is going to emanate I think is unrealistic It just doesnt happen  WALTER I think they dont want to vote on it  CROSSTALK HUME I cant remember when it never has WALLACE Wait guys lets not talk about Congress The key is the president And youve written at great length about this president and his feelings towards war Is he committed to defeating ISIS destroying ISIS as he says he is Or was this simply a case of you had those beheading videos it was political pressure on him he had to do something you had the midterms suddenly security was becoming an issue and once the midterms end so will his commitment WOODWARD Well thats a great question And as Carly points out you know what is the strategy here Go back to 2009 I mean its really interesting This was the moment when the Obama administration in its early months said were going to reach out to Assad Were going to reach out to the Syrians And this has not been reported but the people in the intelligence community were so worried that they kept putting items in the top secret daily brief to the president showing how bad Assad was what a barbarian he was so you cant try to work some deal with them  And so then theres finally reality descended here but you know weve had a series of realities and you need a strategy that will go and  you know you do need Congress you do need the public and say the president  WALLACE The president is fully on board WOODWARD Yes so hes got to figure out and making a decision Hes made it very clear very public hes going to destroy ISIS Well see WALLACE Well see All right panel We have to take a break here Well see you all a little later So what do you think Is the presidents plan working or is it already in trouble Let me know on Facebook or Twitter FoxNewsSunday and use the fns Up next with three weeks to the midterm election well take a look at the races that will make or break Republican efforts to take over the Senate Our election swamis Karl

Washington Weve brought back our campaign gurus INAUDIBLE Our election night space cowboys or swamis to take us inside the hottest races Karl Rove was the architect of George Bushs two presidential victories and Joe Trippi has run a number of Democratic campaign Gentlemen welcome back Karl I asked you to give us  your  all right show it Oh my gosh  it looks like a snow globe Its supposed to be  KARL ROVE REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST It says were swamis so these are our crystal balls WALLACE Crystal balls OK JOE TRIPPI It has all the Republicans winning I mean its just like  WALLACE Here we go I ask  oh my gosh I asked Karl to give us gentlemen your path to how the Republicans will gain control of the Senate on election day and here is your list of the top nine by the Democrats who can see flipping from Democrat to a Republican for most likely in the upper left and least likely in the lower right Most folks agree Montana and West Virginia on the top of the list are going to go Republicans But lets stop at South Dakota former GOP governor Mike Rounds is suddenly in a much closer race against Democrat Rick Weiland and former Republican Senator Larry Pressler whos running as an independent Karl is South Dakota suddenly up for grabs ROVE Well I think at the end of the day for the Republican column its a sign of the desperation the Democrats that they are plunging 25 million into South Dakota here in the next 3 12 weeks in order to try and navigate their way through  for candidate primary There are three major candidates and a lesser candidate I think at the end of the day Rounds survives but this is going to be a  barn burner and the Republicans have retaliated with at least a million dollar for the advertising on Rounds behalf WALLACE Lets keep going lets go to the next three races and all of this and yes Im bringing out the peepers to help me with all these numbers Alaska where former Attorney General Dan Sullivan is pulling away from Democratic incumbent senator Mark Begich Louisiana where Republican Congressman Bill Cassidy now has a lead over Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu and Arkansas where Democratic Senator Mark Pryor now trails Republican Congressman Tom Cotton Joe do you see all three of those flipping to Republicans And whats the best chance for Democrats to hold on JOE TRIPPI DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST All three of those are moving in the wrong direction for Democrats and all three of them the Democrat incumbents are sitting in the very low 40S or even 40 in Mark Pryors case So look they are tough I think probably the best shot is Begich in Alaska and maybe Mary Landrieu but year right now youve got to start  if you are Democrats those three start to look ph the wrong way WALLACE Just to follow up quickly If you have a Democratic incumbent senator whos at 42 43 percent  TRIPPI No Its  Look if youre under 50 its a problem If youre incumbent This is  this is  this is one of the problems that may hurt Republicans in other states but in these three states to be this low to be this far under 45 is a huge problem Undecideds are either going to stay home or break away from the incumbents in these races There isnt a race I know of where the Undecideds break to the incumbent Theyve already made their decision WALLACE All right Then there are what I would call the three tossups Iowa where Republican state senator Joni Ernst has a narrow lead over Democratic Congressman Bruce Braley this is an open seat Karl its awfully close there Why do you think this is going to go GOP ROVE Well first of all the fact that she came through a bitter primary and has united the party in it so close is one thing The second thing is look at the ground  the Democrats in Iowa have historically hit terrific ground game And they beat the Republicans badly in early voting In 2010 at this point they had 27759 early ballots  an advantage in early ballots requested Today it is 21924 At this point in 2010 they had a 22352 advantage in returned ballots This year they have under 12000 Cut it almost in half And remember 2010 is a year where they lose the governors race 5443 and lose the Senate race to the Republicans 6433 so they are doing worse than they were doing in 2010 when the Republicans took the state WALLACE All right Lets turn to another one of the very close races and thats where Colorado where Republican Congressman Cory Gardner is barely ahead as you can see just a point 13 points barely ahead of the Democratic incumbent senator Mark Udall Joe Udall only has made this one so much about womens issues that some people in Colorado are calling Mark Udall senator uterus Is that going to work TRIPPI That may work for him because like more women are likely to vote in this election down there but look this is another race  where incumbent below 45 The thing with Gardner is you have got a member of Congress running against the senator Its probably a tough decision who hates Washington most of the  I mean you know youve got Republicans putting up a congressman there And I think its like  its like tying him  Udall to Obama and trying Gardner to the crazy Republicans in Washington And its this one is going to go down to the wire there I think I would look out for a huge turnout here I think this is going to be a bigger turnout than even possibly in a presidential  because the mail ballot and the fact that the Obama test bed for getting out its vote in 2012 happened in this state in 2010 Theyre going to put that to work for Udall WALLACE Then theres North Carolina which early on was seen as an almost sure pickup for the Republicans but Democratic Senator Kay Hagan as you can see is hanging in there against Republican State House Speaker Thom Tillis Heres a clip from their debate this week BEGIN VIDEO CLIP KAY HAGAN D NORTH CAROLINA SENATOR Speaker Tillis wants to make this race about the president This race is about who is going to represent North Carolina in the US Senate THOM TILLIS R NORTH CAROLINA SENATE CANDIDATE When you vote with the president 96 percent of the time you represent the presidents policies END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE Karl they dont like the president in North Carolina but they also dont like their own state legislature ROVE Yeah but at the end of the day the question is do you want to send a message to Obama or not And in this election I thought it was interesting the president is in the same shape he was in 2010 in a Gallup 22 percent of the people in 2010 said they want to send a message of support for the president 20 percent this year  30 percent in 2010 said they wanted to send a message of opposition to the president 32 percent this year WALLACE So why is Kay Hagan hanging in there ROVE Shes been spending  outspending Tillis by two to one as we come down the final stages you notice the most recent polls three recent polls now have it at two point race Since in the modern era only one incumbent Senator of the presidents party in the midterm election has one reelection if they are  if they are at 45 percent or below She is barely above 45 percent in the real clear politics Shes going to be  there is going to be a barn burner right down the edge Heres how close it is In the early voting Democrats lead by 548 early voters In 2010 at this point the Republicans led by 275 and they won the Senate race by 300000 votes WALLACE Karl also gave us a list of Republicans because there are some Republican seats which are in jeopardy Lets put those up on the screen These are from most likely to least likely that Republicans could lose  Kansas Georgia and Kentucky Lets focus on Kansas where Independent Greg Orman has a small lead over incumbent Pat Roberts They also had a debate this week BEGIN VIDEO CLIP GREG ORMAN I KANSAS SENATE CANDIDATE Ive tried both parties and like a lot of Kansans Ive been disappointed PAT ROBERTS R KANSAS SENATOR He doesnt want to answer the tough questions If he cant answer them here how is he going to answer them in Washington WALLACE Joe if we take your rule of thumb about incumbents in the low 40s being in trouble Pat Roberts I saw this 423 percent how much trouble is he in in Kansas TRIPPI I think hes gone I just think he is What part of the problem here  WALLACE So you see that as a Republican loss Democratic pickup TRIPPI Well I dont know  we dont know if it will be a Democratic pickup with Orman yet But I just think  WALLACE Yes we do TRIPPI But I think  but I think the thing is once  the more you run against the Independent the more the party establishment rallies around you the more it actually helps the  helps Orman in this race So all the Republicans INAUDIBLE rushing in to save Roberts I think hurts him I think Orman wins this one WALLACE Karl youve said that Republicans  Youve kept saying Republicans have to come up with an alternative positive agenda for where they want to take the country over the next few years but frankly they seem to be running on everything is falling apart under Obama and the Democrats Is that enough to get them through the next few weeks ROVE I disagree with you that thats what theyre doing If you look at like Cassidys laid out a pretty robust healthcare plan a lot of these people arent emphasizing the things it will do Dan Sullivan energy development and were seeing this across the board but it gets subordinated by the fact that in the television advertising each side has an easy simple and significantly negative message If you are a Republican you point out how often your Democrat opponent is with Obama and if youre a Democrat you find out every personal foible or you know you accuse them of wanting to push granny over the cliff or whatever you know or antiwoman whatever the theme of the week is for Democrats WALLACE Joe about a minute left There are a lot of trends favoring Republicans unpopular president sixyear of a twoterm president Despite that if you look at these races particularly as we get to the socalled tossup races Colorado Iowa North Carolina Democrats are hanging in there how do you explain it TRIPPI Look hanging in again I think part of this is you know Republicans in Congress have the lower ratings than the president so youve got those two things fighting but in the end here look this is an antiincumbent year Thats why I think someone like Mitch McConnell do not count that race in the Republican column I think he could go out the window too You know if you are seeing it in the race after race here theres an antiDemocratic thing going on because of the Obama presidency but there is an anti incumbent fervor thats what you think Pat Roberts  I wouldnt count out Mitch McConnell not even Kay Hagan seat in North Carolina WALLACE The bottom line three weeks out things can change Ill ask you again  Who takes the Senate TRIPPI I think  I still think its a jump ball right now I really do WALLACE Thanks for that That was very helpful TRIPPI Today you have to give the edge to the Republicans Absolutely Ive been saying five to eight seats and its still  that much is still in play WALLACE Karl ROVE Its going to be close but I think look second midterm elections are about the presidents party The presidents job approval in Gallup is 39 percent in virtually all of these states with exception of Michigan which we didnt touch on But with all of these states the presidents job approval is below the national average in many of these states For example in West Virginia its in the 20s I think if the Republicans take the Senate it will be a close it will be a long night it will take us until November it may take us until January but its going to be I think 51 52 53 WALLACE Thats because there could be runoffs If people dont get their will  50 percent ROVE There will be a runoff in Louisiana and because its a  WALLACE And where is it Georgia ROVE And Georgia  Georgia requires statewide election officials to win with a majority not a plurality WALLACE So that may be in January ROVE All right Karl Rove and Joe thank you both Thanks for coming in I expect better crystal balls maybe even swami hats by  CROSSTALK ROVE Only if you wear one TRIPPI He brought in two faulty crystal ball ROVE Only if you wear one WALLACE Well all be together election night to see just how right both of you are When we

COMMERCIAL BREAK BEGIN VIDEO CLIP UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE Did you vote for President Obama in 2008 2012 ALISON LUNDERGAN GRIMES D KENTUCKY SENATE CANDIDATE You know this election isnt about the president Its about  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE I know LUNDERGAN GRIMES The making sure we put Kentuckians back to work UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE Did you  END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes who is trying to unseat Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky refusing three times to answer whether she voted for President Obama either in 2008 or 12 And were back now with the panel While Grimes could certainly have handled it better you can understand why she wants to distance herself from President Obama and why a bunch of Democrats want to Take a look at this These are the approval ratings for President Obama in a new Fox News poll in five states including as you can see Kentucky Even in the purple state of Colorado his approval rating is only 36 percent Brit how big a drag is the president on these Democratic candidates HUME Hes a huge drag in an election which historically that is the second midterm of a presidency turns on a presidents popularity which means that the key elements are in place for a big Republican year There are some things that point in the other direction One is that  that Republican brand is in bad order with the public In the House where you know you might expect to have major pickups all the lowhanging fruit in the House was already picked in 2010 and in the Senate races the wild card in the deck is the turnout situation If I were viewing this election before 2012 from a pre2012 lens I would say its going to be a Republican washout across the board and even those candidates who are behind INAUDIBLE win But the Democrats did something in 2012 to elect the president which is to say the greatest voter mobilization effort in history That is not at all clear that they can replicate this year But if they can it changes the equation and I think its the main reason why so many of us are not prepared to say that theres going to be a Republican wave WALLACE Amy is the one of us who is INAUDIBLE those time looking at politics one its one thing to turn out Obama voters for Obama than it is to turn them out for some Democratic senator or congressman they may not care about What do you think are the chances that they can recalibrate that repeat that turnout And why isnt this given all the factors why isnt this more of a wave election for Republicans at least as it looks so far WALTER Well if you look at the averages the average seat in a bad year in the sixyear election would be a sixseat loss in the Senate And that would be the Senate majority So I think look we knew from the very beginning there were seven seats in trouble for Democrats There were seven states that Mitt Romney had won They just needed to win six of those That hasnt changed at all Whats changed is the fact that the map actually got bigger And so I think if were looking for a wave it would be that Republicans dont just win those states that Mitt Romney carried but they win a Colorado or an Iowa So I think the day after the election thats what were going to be looking at Because thats a bigger take not just on 2014 but going to Brits point about turnout and mobilizing voters can Republicans crack that code turn out the voters in purple states like Iowa like New Hampshire like Colorado in a year where everything is going right for them If they cant if they lose those states that suggests they do have bigger problems Because  WALLACE Advisedly its 23 days out How does it look to you Does it look at this point like theres  WALTER I do think that Republicans have the advantage now When theyve got  you put up those numbers Youve already got five seats that are leaning towards Republicans right now they have got to find one more without losing any of their own And you know when you have to get one out of four states those odds certainly with Republicans right now And the Democrats dont like the idea that what we have just talked about on this show its  and were not talking about how bad Republicans are were talking about Ebola and ISIS not things Democrats wanted to talk about 23 days out WALLACE Carly I had a little bit of a disagreement with Karl about the question of whether there is a Republican agenda about individual candidates Cory Gardner Colorado has an agenda But there certainly is not a national Republican agenda Is that a problem FIORINA Well I do think that Republicans if  and I think when  we take control of the Senate are going to have to demonstrate that they can govern And I think thats why you see Reince Priebus coming out with an 11point plan think its why you see people like Senator Ron Johnson working with others on both the Senate side and the House side to put together an agenda Yes I do  CROSSTALK WALLACE If you asked the average voter whats the Republican plan for 2015 I dont think they can say it FIORINA But they couldnt answer it for Democrats either with all due respect Whats the Democratic plan to get the economy back growing and growing again Theres no answer to that So I think no one is talking about a national plan right now but I think Karl is absolutely right In these individual races I think were going to win Colorado for example I think were going to win Iowa I think both Cory Gardner and Joni Ernst have very clear platforms about what they think the priorities of this nation should be WALLACE Three weeks out what strikes you about this election WOODWARD I think the question is whats on voters minds And I think it is the economy still shaky the stock market drop causes a lot of anxiety foreign policy ISIS to say the least Ebola and so that brings you to the leadership question in the White House and people are going to make an assessment on that And those polls show that whether people are  if as Karl Rove says and hopes people are going to send a message to Obama for  by voting for Republicans we dont know It still is three weeks away and you know Obama knows its a leadership test and I think in that three weeks he might try to do something in some of these areas that shows hes in charge WALLACE At this point would you agree that rather than the economy where there doesnt seem to be a clear different path between the two parties its more just a sense of things seem out of control As you say whether its Ebola whether its ISIS whether its the secret service failing I mean some of this you cant blame on the president but just a feeling things arent working in Washington WOODWARD Yeah and the deep anxiety and the polls show that And the question is how do you mobilize the voters But also in the next three weeks you know every potential voter is going to be watching candidates to a certain extent but what is Obama doing And how does he further define or fail to define himself We will see WALLACE So not only an October surprise a late October surprise WOODWARD Possibly WALLACE Thank you panel See you next Sunday Up next our power player of the week taking us behind the scenes of the White House COMMERCIAL BREAK WALLACE If youre thinking about coming to Washington anytime soon you may want to plan for another stop on your tour of the nations capital It features historical treasures on display for the first

the White House is special to the world WALLACE Stewart McLaurin is president of the White House Historical Association And hes talking about the new visitors center for the presidents home MCLAURIN You can spend time here and really get behind the scenes and understand what it was like to live there as a family or work there as the president WALLACE Theres the Chief Ushers desk where Woodrow Wilson signed the Declaration starting World War One and the Gold Eagle that sat atop the White House flagpole for almost a century There was an interactive program that allows you to four dimension past and present MCLAURIN You can drag around to see the entire state dining room You can look on the ceiling look at the chandelier and you can see where this  how this room looked differently under different presidencies in 1870s in 1903 when Theodore Roosevelt redid this  CROSSTALK MCLAURIN In 1948 the Truman renovation much different WALLACE Theres also a movie where former residents like Barbara Bush talk about what it was like to live over the store BARBARA BUSH I remember looking out the window in the upstairs end room and looking over at Georges office And it was very cozy WALLACE Since 911 its harder to get a White House tour Now you have to go through your member of Congress or for foreign visitors through your embassy WALLACE on camera Is this center for people who are going to the White House or for people who arent going to the White House MCLAURIN Its for both It enhances the experience for people who go to the White House and it creates an experience for those who dont have that opportunity WALLACE voice over A couple of blocks from the White House the visitors center used to look like this But after a twoyear renovation it now looks like this Theres a display where you can learn what presidents liked to eat MCLAURIN Do you know whose favorite food was squirrel soup WALLACE on camera Abraham Lincoln James Garfield voice over Well I was off by 21 years Theres even an unintentional reference to recent security breaches MCLAURIN This is the replica of the door knob of the front door to the White House on the north portico WALLACE on camera Wait Wait Wait This one is locked LAUGHTER WALLACE voice over The Historical Association has committed more than 12 million to the center in partnership with the National Parks Service Association funding is all private mostly from selling White House Christmas ornaments It also uses the money to preserve the state rooms and buy more treasures for the White House collection The point to get people more engaged in the peoples house MCLAURIN This visitors center puts all of that in context and brings it to life for the visitor so you can go behind those iron gates and experience and understand what the White House is like for the president and the first family END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE McLaurin estimates more than 1 million people a year will tour the new visitors center and most wont be able to

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/05/25/younger-republicans-splitting-from-gop-because-social-issues/,"TAMPA Fla AP  At a recent meeting the Tampa Bay Young Republicans recited the Pledge of Allegiance prayed and then tackled the nights topic marijuana Their guest Personal injury lawyer John Morgan a huge Democratic Party donor campaigning to legalize medical marijuana in Florida Months earlier the same group supported a Supreme Court opinion that was a victory for gay marriage advocates even as Republican leaders insisted marriage should be between only a man and a woman The group illustrates a growing generational divide in the GOP as younger Republicans increasingly break rank from the establishment on social issues In Alabama a college Republican group leader was nearly kicked out of the party for supporting gay marriage The successful push to legalize gay marriage in Minnesota was backed by several prominent younger Republicans And in Colorado the spokesman for a group that pushed to legalize marijuana was a Republican activist Perhaps only in opposing abortion are most young Republicans nationally as conservative socially as older members Weve grown up in a time where everythings much more open We want to talk about more things Tampa Bay Young Republicans president Anibal Cabrera said Were willing to listen to the other point of view Were willing to have an opposite opinion Whether the split on social issues forces the GOP to change its platform or risk alienating younger voters probably wont be answered until after the 2016 presidential election said Matthew Corrigan a University of North Florida political science professor He said one thing to watch is support for Kentucky Sen Rand Paul the son of former Texas Rep Ron Paul who is mixing a libertarian message with a more moderate outreach to Republicans Its unsettled Corrigan said If the nominee of the Republican Party signals less of an emphasis on social issues than in years past that leaves an opening for these young Republicans who may have more libertarian leanings but theres a lot of seniors within the party that I dont think are ready to give up on those positions While Republicans nationally have struggled to recruit younger voters women and minorities the Tampa group says welcoming socially liberal as well as conservative members has helped swell its ranks from seven to 200 members in less than a year Executive director Lacey Wickline said the party establishment could learn from the approach but instead has largely ignored the group Were doing something right Weve got the energy were trying to do whats right by our party and wheres the support Wickline said If youre really trying to target the under 40 demographic theres only one place to turn  thats us Part of the shift among younger Republicans is growing up in an era where gay rights pot smoking and other issues are more acceptable even among conservatives We grew up on Will and Grace and our parents grew up on All in the Family said Stephanie Petelos the chairman of the College Republican Federation of Alabama who was almost banished from her party for supporting gay marriage Alabama Republican Party Chairman Bill Armistead said there may be some differing opinions among younger Republicans but he still feels most support the party platform Those interviewed noted even young Republicans tend to be antiabortion And Armistead pointed out that the man elected to replace Petelos after she graduated firmly supports traditional marriage It was very disruptive for the previous college chairman to advocate a position thats contradictory to our state position and our national platform Armistead said It did not represent the majority of college Republicans yet she used her position to advocate her personal opinions which is unfortunate Beyond being a generational issue young Republicans say their positions stem from the partys belief that government shouldnt intrude on peoples lives Ron Pauls 2012 presidential campaign got most of its following from younger Republicans attracted by his libertarian message that allowed for gay marriage and the legalization of marijuana When it comes to issues like gay marriage or marijuana legalization younger Republicans often find themselves asking Why is government involved in this at all said Alex Holzbach a Tallahasseebased Republican political consultant who served as president of the Florida State University College Republicans before graduating this year Its really just a realization that the partys current status quo against some of these issues is in direct conflict with our belief in smaller less intrusive government  He and Petelos said they are Republicans because they believe the party is stronger on economic issues and both said the GOPs position on social issues made it harder to recruit college students Its just a little bit harder to get into what the Fed did last week than it is for equality for one of your best friends from high school Petelos said The economy is especially relevant when recruiting students staring down college loan debt and a tough job market said Young Republican National Federation Chairman Jason Weingartner Its often the Democrats that are trying to shake the narrative so that we go back to discussing predominantly social issues so it will distract from the current economic climate he said Follow us on twittercomfoxnewslatino

Denver Post A new poll by Quinnipiac University has Republican Cory Gardner ahead of Democrat Mark Udall by a striking 8 percentage points in their race for US Senate  the challengers largest lead todate among public polls The survey of more than 1200 likely Colorado voters favored Gardner 48 to 40 percent to the incumbent Udall with independent or unaffiliated candidate Steve Shogan taking home 8 percent A new Gallup survey released this morning finds Republicans are now viewed just as favorably as Democrats rebounding from their low of 28 percent during last falls government shutdown Respondents held equal favorable views of both parties at 40 percent Buuut  Quinnipiacs findings depart significantly from a Denver Post poll conducted last week that found Udall leading Gardner by 4 percentage points Similarly Gardners biggest advantage over Udall before the latest Quinnipiac results was 2 percentage points according to a tally of more than dozen polls of both likely and registered voters recorded by Real Clear Politics Other recent polls have shown the Udall and Gardner in a statistical tie or even a Udall advantage LANDRIEU SINKING FAST
The latest batch of Fox News battleground polls show close contests in several pivotal Senate races including the showdown for the Republicanheld seat in Kansas as well as Democratic defensive efforts in Iowa and North Carolina But the stunner is in Louisiana where Republican Congressman Bill Cassidy leads Sen Mary Landrieu DLa 35 percent to 31 percent The best news for the GOP seems to be that the Sarah Palinbacked candidate in the race Rob Maness hasnt been able to gain traction despite relentless attacks on Cassidy

Welcome to the jungle  If no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote on Election Day the top two finishers head into a Dec 6 runoff In a twoway match up Cassidy topples Landrieu 51 percent to 38 percent Landrieus best hope to survive is to win in the first round which would require Maness drawing Cassidy into a firefight that drives voters away from the GOP This result suggests thats not happening

IF YOU LIKE YOUR WAR PLAN YOU CAN KEEP IT
President Obamas strategy to combat ISIS faces tough scrutiny from the House Foreign Affairs Committee today as Secretary of State John Kerry tries to sell the plan which seems to require a daily redefinition from the White House Committee Chairman Ed Royce RCalif has accused the administration of sending mixed messages about the threat posed by the Islamist militant group Wednesdays performance of the administrations semantic circus featured the White House acknowledging that Obama would consider putting US troops in forwarddeployed positions to advise Iraqi forces in the fight against the Islamic State  even while insisting US troops would not be sent back into a combat role in Iraq The House voted to fund the his request to train and arm Syrian rebels but with his generals telegraphing the need for more decisive action political pressure from the right and left and sinking poll numbers the presidents ability to defend his evolving strategy is very much in doubt

Issues of this magnitude should not be rolled into an unrelated mustpass spending bill for the sake of expediency  Rep Robert Hurt RVa in his statement on his vote opposing the funds for Syrian rebels

BAIER TRACKS COMBAT BY ANY OTHER NAME
Whats in a phraseA lot First of all boots on the ground is a term most members of the military hate But lets stipulate that its the phrase du jour for describing troops in a combat zone When President Obama and his administration continue to adamantly insist that the US will NOT put combat troops on the ground in Iraq or Syria many people might start hearing Hamlet and think that the president doth protest too much Wednesday brought a caveat to the presidents pledge Gen Martin Dempsey chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff provided the asterisk in remarks to Congress Now administration officials concede that forward deployed advisors may consult with Iraqi forces in their fight and may call in US air strikes If you talk to some of those advisors  aka US Special Operators or US Special Forces  they will tell you that if they are sitting next to an Iraqi Peshmerga or a Free Syrian Army fighter as theyre taking fire from the enemy and the advisor is directing a laser guided GBU a laser guided bomb to be dropped from an F16  they are IN COMBAT no matter what the administration says

So now the question is what are the rules of engagement for these advisors The officers I talk to can already see the shackles being placed on their ability to bring the fight to ISIS Thats a serious issue no matter what words are used  Bret Baier

LEW TOUTING WHOPPER OF A PEN PLAN
Speaking at UCLA Wednesday Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told his audience that he was hopeful that well be able to take action very very soon on what tax lawyers call inversions  which is when USbased companies move their headquarters overseas to beat Americas enormous corporate tax rate This is part of President Obamas effort to put the focus on his executive action on issues to rally the Democratic base Obama was forced to table his plan for ordering amnesty for illegal immigrants until after Election Day But Lew sounds committed to busting some corporate chops

Out of ink  National Journal Americans are afraid The White House is afraid Democrats are afraid President Obamas Year of Action has turned into a Year of Fear The country seems mired in dread And that could have mortal consequences for midterm Democrats

Base drum or a snare  Tax havens are a fraught topic for Lew and others in the administration as well as Senate Democrats who seem to have scrapped a symbolic vote on the subject Worst though is Warren Buffett a key Democratic patron and Obamas oftinvoked exemplar for socially conscious billionaires Buffetts company last month orchestrated a corporate tax flight for Burger King something the president a month earlier called unpatriotic The question Will Lew go for a risky move that might get blocked in court as well as risking serious backfire or just make a symbolic gesture to placate ornery liberals

Grimes ditches Buffett  Kentucky Democratic Senate Candidate Allison Lundergan Grimes disconnected her billionaire backer Warren Buffett from a conference call with her donors at a San Francisco Bay Area fundraiser on Wednesday Grimes hung up on one of her partys most important benefactors after the campaign of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called her out over the fact that one of the companies owned by Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway is laying off 600 workers at a Kentucky underwear plant and moving its operations to Honduras Grimes campaign blamed the host of the event for Buffetts involvement

The A24 Films release stars former SNL star Jenny Slate as a Brooklyn comic who gets pregnant after a onenight stand and elects to have an abortion

Other networks had no problem airing an ad that included the word abortion in it a source said adding the films distributor wasnt trying to purchase ads during Today or daytime but during SNL  and primetime sitcoms

A source close to NBC denied the claim saying the network was given a rough cut of a trailer but after feedback was given a final spot wasnt submitted

But a different source countered that NBCs feedback was that the subject matter was inappropriate for viewers and to cut the word abortion

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/04/15/playing-race-card-deflect-criticism/, This is a RUSH transcript from The OReilly Factor April 15 2014 This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated Watch The OReilly Factor weeknights at 8 pm and 11 pm ET     OREILLY Impact Segment tonight as we have been reporting both President Obama and Attorney General Holder now using their skin color to deflect criticisms The race card is being dealt right up front BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  CANDY CROWLEY CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT Do you think your Republican colleagues are racists ISRAEL I think to a very  not all of them no of course not but to a significant extent the Republican base does have elements that are animated by  by racism END VIDEO CLIP  OREILLY By the way Mr Israel is my congressman out of Long Island Weve invited him to come on THE FACTOR any day this week and we hope he does Joining us now from Columbia Missouri  Fox News analyst Dr Ben Carson So the message the President and the Attorney General and the Democratic Party are putting out does resonate among some AfricanAmericans perhaps most  correct BEN CARSON JOHNS HOPKINS PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF NEUROSURGERY Well there is no question that it does resonate with people and which is the reason that they use it But the real big issue here is there are some major philosophical differences going on in our country right now There is a group of progressive people who believe that government is the answer to many of our  our problems and theres a group that feels that this country is inaudible by the people that rugged individualism is important and selfdetermination and responsibility So those are huge philosophical clashes CROSSTALK OREILLY But whats happening though  CARSON And naturally people  OREILLY Whats happening Doctor is this  I think its quite clear that in his sixth year in office President Obamas policies have largely failed If you look at all of them together all right Now its still jump ball over Obamacare but you see what Putin is doing We just covered it you see you know trouble almost everywhere The economy is not nearly what it should be Wages continue to go down after six years So in order to obscure that it becomes personal So Holder and the President making it personal so is the Democratic Party Theres a war on women Women are getting hosed Hispanics they are getting hosed too CARSON Right OREILLY And you black people  they just dont like us because were black Now Im saying this could be effective This could work CARSON Well it works very effectively if you dont really analyze the situation OREILLY But how many people will do that How many of the folks and the voters will do that CARSON Well I think they actually can do it if they realize that theyre being manipulated The fact of the matter is you are going to have deep clashes with the two categories of people that I just described and to ascribe those clashes to something as superficial as race means that youre obviously not investing much in the way of analysis And you know so overall big problem thats going on in our nation You know you cant oppose anything that a progressive black person is doing if you are white without being calling a racist You cant oppose abortion on demand without being called antiwoman You cant uphold traditional marriage without being called homophobic You know this is really a state of sadness immaturity and I think the solution to it is for the people to become much more sophisticated in their analysis and not simply accept what the manipulators are trying to pull over OREILLY Ok but thats pretty wishful thinking youre almost like Juan Williams about Putin CARSON Its happening Its happening OREILLY All right let me just pose this Holder goes to the National Action Network ok A grievance group and he gives a speech to the grievance group thats picked up by everybody in the United States All right No attorney general is treated this way Brit Hume is going to deal with it in a minute Now are you telling me Doctor that the people in the National Action Network dont believe what holder is saying They do CARSON Well a lot of them do I agree But here is what we have to concentrate on Its a fact that there are tens of millions of people who have disinvolved themselves with the political process Who havent sort of been drinking the KoolAid you might say And there are a lot of minorities I talk to them all the time who really are seeing through this whole thing and know that they are being manipulated And Im much more optimistic than a lot of people are about whats going to happen in the future OREILLY All right so its anecdotal with you though because the polling and thats what I rely a lot on my analysis shows that still 85 percent of AfricanAmericans think President Obama is doing a good job I mean his overall approval rating is 40 percent But then you go into the AfricanAmerican community its 85 percent I mean it just seems to me like they know they being the Democratic party they know where the votes are for them and theyre going to do whatever they have to do to motivate these people though come out in November CARSON I would not give up on them I think there is a lot more analysis going on than we might think And I think sometimes respond to polls the way they expect think they are supposed to respond OREILLY Ok Now were you personally as an AfricanAmerican offended by what  what Holder says because I believe Holder believes what he said I dont think hes a charlatan I think hes genuinely indignant that a white congressman called him out on the contempt and he ascribes it to race CARSON Yes well you know I was a psychology major and I can tell you people tend to see what you are looking for So if you expect that somebody is racist then everything that you hear coming from them will be interpreted in that light OREILLY All right so do you believe Holder believes that he is being treated differently because of his color CARSON I think he probably does believe that yes I believe thats what he is looking for thats what he expects OREILLY I think he does  right and he is just saying hey CARSON But I think a lot of other people can see through it A lot of black people a lot of other Hispanic people I think they can see right through that OREILLY The record is the record if people voters bother to look And I dont know Doctor I dont know if they will or not but we appreciate your time as always thank you Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network LLC ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Copyright

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/08/04/alabama-abortion-law-that-restricts-doctors-is-unconstitutional-judge-rules/,July 30 2014 Reproductive Health Services is shown in Montgomery AlaAP A new Alabama law restricting doctors who perform abortions would force several womens clinics to shut down placing unconstitutional restrictions on a womans right to obtain one a federal judge ruled Monday Several doctors live outside the state and would be unable to gain the privileges to admit patients to local hospitals required by the law US District Judge Myron Thompson wrote in a 172page opinion and an accompanying order Furthermore its unlikely that local doctors would begin performing abortions because of a history of violence across the South that includes bombings shootings and arsons against clinics the judge said     That would effectively force three of the states five abortion clinics to close the judge wrote Those clinics are in the states three largest cities The resulting unavailability of abortion in these three cities would impose significant obstacles burdens and costs for women across Alabama he wrote Thompson extended an earlier order blocking enforcement of the law and said he would issue a final order after considering more written arguments from lawyers Similar laws about admitting privileges have been blocked by federal courts in Mississippi Kansas and Wisconsin while they have taken effect in Missouri North Dakota Tennessee Texas and Utah A federal appeals court struck down Mississippis law last week ruling that it would effectively close and unconstitutionally force women to seek abortions in neighboring states Meanwhile a judge began hearing arguments Monday over Texas strict abortion law which abortion rights advocates say would force nearly threequarters of the states clinics to close Susan Watson executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama said the law wasnt designed to protect women as supporters maintain Major medical organizations including the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology oppose them she said of the Alabama law and similar ones In a statement Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange said he disagreed with the ruling and would appeal after Thompson issues a final order Republican Gov Robert Bentley a physician by trade who signed the law criticized the decision and called abortion a fundamental assault on the sanctity of innocent human life Clinics in Birmingham and Mobile run by Planned Parenthood Southeast and the Montgomery clinic operated by Reproductive Health Services filed the lawsuit saying they would have to close because they use outoftown doctors without admitting privileges and have been unable to get local doctors with privileges to serve their clinics The states other two clinics in Tuscaloosa and Huntsville use local doctors with admitting privileges The laws sponsor Republican Rep Mary Sue McClurkin of Indian Springs said the measure would make the clinics safer while clinic operators said it was an attempt to shut them down through a regulation they could not meet Thompson agreed with the clinics In his opinion Thompson said evidence showed doctors wouldnt be able to gain admitting privileges in Birmingham Mobile and Montgomery the states three largest cities should the law remain in place Two doctors who perform abortions in Montgomery live in Nigeria and Chicago and couldnt meet residency requirements and other rules set by hospitals Thompson said The doctor who lives in Nigeria used to practice in Alabama and now stays in Atlanta during periodic trips to perform abortions Thompson wrote Similarly two Georgia doctors who travel to Birmingham and Mobile to perform abortions also couldnt meet the requirements for staff privileges in those cities he said New doctors are unlikely to begin performing abortions in the state because of the detrimental professional consequences of being associated with procedure and a history of violence that includes bombings shootings and arsons against clinics across the South the judge said In Alabama Thompson wrote a clinic in Tuscaloosa was firebombed and workers have been followed in their cars Eric Rudolph killed a police officer and critically injured a nurse when he detonated a bomb outside a Birmingham clinic in 1998 Two of Alabamas five licensed abortion clinics are temporarily not performing abortions but not because of the physician requirement Planned Parenthood Southeast closed its Birmingham clinic in January after firing two employees for selling an abortion medication to a person in the clinics parking lot The clinic has replaced its staff and plans to resume services after an inspection by state health officials Alabama Womens Center for Reproductive Alternatives in Huntsville closed in late June because it couldnt comply with another part of the 2013 law that took effect July 1 It requires clinics to have wide halls and doors and improved fire safety systems like a surgical treatment center The Huntsville clinic is trying to move to a new location that meets the requirements said Brian Hale attorney for the state Department of Public Health The Department of Public Health reports that 8485 pregnancies were terminated in Alabama in 2013 with 16 done at hospitals and the rest at abortion clinics Thompson said the states legitimate medical reasons for imposing the law were weak Serious complications were rare and a woman was more likely to die from a penicillin injection than an earlyterm abortion performed in a clinic he wrote While women could simply go elsewhere for abortions should clinics shut down Thompson said that could harm patients health by forcing them to make road trips for the procedure While not ruling on the issue of whether the state can justify the law by claiming women could go to other states for abortions Thompson cited the recent 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals decision that said Mississippi could not shift its legal burden to provide access to abortion to another state,2014-08-04T16:06-04:00,abortion

 Power Play Cassidy makes his case
 Whos next Donald Duck     VA FIX BORDER BANDAID PUT PRESSURE ON CONGRESS
With one eye on the clock and the other on the priming the pump for the home stretch of this years midterm elections Democratic and Republican lawmakers are scrambling Both sides are vying to reap the maximum political benefit from what does and doesnt get done in the next few days before Congress adjourns for a fiveweek recess The pressure to repair the broken Veterans Affairs healthcare system exposed by scandal and to stem the continuing flood of immigrants across the southern border is immense Over the next few days the action or perceived inaction in Washington on these fronts will have a huge impact on the summer debate and major consequences for candidates moving into November As of today the prospects of a deal on the VA are brighter while the border crisis may well go unresolved With President Obamas approval ratings in the tank and the likelihood that Democrats will lose control of the Senate increasing dont be surprised if the blue team squelches a border deal and engages in heavy fingerpointing complete with claims of Republican inaction VA a done deal  Fox News The leaders of the House and Senate Veterans Affairs committees reached a tentative deal Sunday to improve veterans health care  a potential solution to help fix such ongoing problems as delays for benefits and long waits for medical treatment concealed by secret lists The tentative deal would also end speculation about whether Congress would indeed begin a fiveweek summer recess without a legislative solution amid widespread national outrage over problems within the Department of Veterans Affairs The committee chairmen Rep Jeff Miller RFla and Sen Bernie Sanders IVt worked through the weekend and have scheduled a press conference for Monday to talk about the tentative dealThe pair said in a joint statement that they had made significant progress toward an agreement on legislation to make VA more accountable and to help the department recruit more doctors nurses and other health care professionals Sanders proposed a bill last week that would cost about 25 billion over three years Millers proposal would approve 10 billion in emergency spending Those proposals would have scaled back separate House and Senatepassed bills after lawmakers in both parties expressed shock at price tags totaling more than 35 billion The proposals would still allow veterans to go to private doctors if they face long waits for appointments at VA hospitals and clinics or if they live more than 40 miles from a VA site Watch Fox Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel will have the details of the compromise Border deal stuck on Dems about face  Washington Examiner While the border bill has stalled there is still a small chance for a deal by Thursday which is the last day the House is in session until Sept 8 Democrats and Republicans are at odds over a 2008 deportation law that is preventing the fast deportation of the thousands of child migrants who have come here from Central America President Obama initially backed a move to change the law in order to speed deportation of Central American minors Federal officials say 61000 unaccompanied children have crossed the southern border into Texas since October But under pressure from immigration rights groups Obama has since backed down and Congressional Democrats now say they oppose changing the law which currently requires the government provide immigration hearings for Central American youth a process that can take years This week Democrats will have to decide whether a provision to change the 2008 law is a deal breaker since Republicans in the House are unlikely to pass a border spending bill without it Both White House officials and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi DCalif hinted Democrats might give in on allowing a change to the provision If Congress agrees to pass a spending bill it will likely be smaller than Obamas 37 billion request Scalise may stay until immigration plan passes  Incoming House Majority Whip Rep Steve Scalise RLa said he will stay in Washington until Congress agrees to an emergency spending plan for the borderimmigration crisis but declined to say whether he will cancel the lower chambers August recess Im going to stay until its done said Scalise on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace BOEHNER OBAMA LAWSUIT PRESERVES CONSTITUTION

This weekend leading Democrats blasted their base with multiple emails fundraising off Republican calls to impeach President Obama Washington Examiners Byron York calls this a farcical twist since Dems now are campaigning to encourage the GOP to do exactly what they are fundraising to stop The Democrats impeachment fundraising extravaganza In the past 48 hours first lady Michelle Obama White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer White House spokesman Josh Earnest House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and others have raised the specter of an Obama impeachment There are some Republican backbenchers who would indeed like to impeach the president just as there were more senior and more organized Democratic lawmakers who hoped to impeach George W Bush after Democrats won control of Congress in the 2006 elections Back then Pelosi the new Speaker said flatly Impeachment is off the table Now Boehner has said he disagrees with former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palins call for impeachment and many observers see his lawsuit against the president as an effort to placate GOP lawmakers while stopping far short of impeaching the president But Boehner has not made a farreaching definitive statement comparable to declaring impeachment off the table He might now be driven to do so making the Democrats impeachment fundraising festival appear even more ridiculous than it already does

The couples newborn twin daughters are just six days old but already a medical miracle born with separate identical faces and separate brains in a single skull and sharing the same body The two girls aptly named Faith and Hope arrived last Thursday after a short labor with Young first being taken to Blacktown Hospital before being rushed by ambulance to Westmead Childrens Hospital

Faith and Hope are the result of an extremely rare condition known as disrosopus where a baby is born with two faces

Fewer than 40 human disrosopus cases are known to have been born Even fewer survived beyond birth

The couple said even though the baby only had one body they still referred to them as their beautiful baby twins

I think theyre beautiful and Simon thinks theyre beautiful so really thats all that matters Youngsaid in an interview with A Current Affair     The parents who already had seven children together prior to the girls arrival discovered the abnormality during pregnancy but decided against an abortion

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/04/22/new-concerns-over-admins-plan-release-more-drug-felons,  This is a rush transcript from The Kelly File April 21 2014 This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated     MEGYN KELLY HOST Breaking tonight as the White House once again flouting the law New fallout tonight just hours after the Obama administration announced his plans to release thousands of convicted convicted drug offenders from prison They had their trial and they are about to get out Welcome to The Kelly File everyone Im Megyn Kelly Hours ago President Obamas Attorney General Eric Holder announcing plans to dramatically increase the number of nonviolent criminals eligible for presidential clemency meaning a get out of jail early card Attorney General Holder says it all comes down to fairness but what exactly is fair about telling the justice system that President Obama knows best Andy McCarthy is a former federal prosecutor and contributing editor to the National Review Thats what it is I mean there has been a trial ANDREW MCCARTHY FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR Right KELLY There has been a detective and a prosecutor who decided charges ought to be brought under the law that was passed by the peoples representatives and sign into a law by a president theres been a defendant a defense attorney a prosecutor a prosecution and a conviction MCCARTHY Right KELLY And now the president is going to step in and they are saying thousands of cases MCCARTHY Right KELLY Hundreds of thousands and say I know better MCCARTHY Right just as the president uses prosecutorial discretion as a pretext for changing a whole bunch of laws he doesnt like Hes now moved onto the pardon power So the pardon power is going to be his way of rewriting the federal narcotics laws which he personally thinks are too severe So it evidently doesnt matter both that Congress has written these laws that trials have taken place under these laws and that his core constitutional responsibility is to take care that those laws be faithfully executed Hes going to rewrite them unilaterally KELLY What about all the stuff that hes a constitutional law professor and hell be following the law and hell be doing an end to round Congress However Andy he does have the pardon power MCCARTHY Right KELLY I mean unlike other things weve discussed this one is clear he has the pardon power Is this an abuse of it MCCARTHY Yes Its a massive abuse of it Look he has a lot of raw power the president has enormous power And the  power is there for good reason If in individual cases injustice has been done if there are mitigating circumstances in a case that warrant a correction thats why the president has the power But hes not taking about individual cases here Hes talking about a category of federal law that he philosophically disagrees with So hes essentially going to rewrite Congress laws by springing everyone This is not about doing individual justice in cases and mitigating mistakes or hardships This is about rewriting federal law KELLY Uhhm And does it have to do with race Because the non violent drug offenders who are most likely to benefit from this tend to be people who went to prison for dealing crack correct Crack as opposed to cocaine And there has long been an argument that the laws are racist  MCCARTHY Right KELLY In terms of the outcome on those  because you know you go to prison more likely if youre black and youre dealing cocaine than if youre white  sorry black and dealing crack versus white doing cocaine MCCARTHY Right Its a disparity impact theory They cant conceivably say that Congress design was racially motivated because white crack defendants get treated just like Black and Hispanic crack defendants KELLY Right MCCARTHY What they say is because more people have been harshly sentenced under the crack laws and sentencing guidelines that they are racially  the racial element of it is in the impact rather than  KELLY Why is that not legitimate That sounds legitimate MCCARTHY Well because racism is about the intent to use race in order to achieve  KELLY So not a racist intent MCCARTHY Right KELLY But shouldnt something be done to right that wrong you know the disparity between the prosecutions and prison sentences that come down on those two crimes MCCARTHY Well but the disparity the problem with the disparity is not racism The problem with disparity is racism only if race is the reason for the disparity in the first place The problem with the disparity here is that sensibly I think you can make a good argument that crack shouldnt be weighed like 100 to one against powder cocaine but thats what we have Congress for And in fact Congress has rewritten these laws to make the disparity somewhat smaller I think he can still make a good argument that there is work to be done in this area but in our system the president doesnt get to do this by decree KELLY What will happen if this stands as it appears that it will than when we have a republican president who wants to come in and say you know what Im in the mood to pardon every single protester who stood outside of a Planned Parenthood and shouted down on a woman going in for an abortion MCCARTHY Well I guess that will depend on whether the media decides to participates in the criticism of the president again once we no longer have President Obama in office I think that if he thought he was being watched responsible by the media he wouldnt do these sorts of things He does them because he thinks he can get away with them and in fact he has gotten away with them KELLY He talked about overcrowding of prisons Well thats how they justified the release of illegal immigrants who had been caught on violations of US law separate from the illegal immigration aspect They had violated our law once they got here And weve been releasing them saying well we dont have room for them and now releasing these drug offenders we have in prison saying well we dont have room for them MCCARTHY And what did we have in the last 40 years we had the biggest dip in crime really in history Its been a cultural upheaval in terms of the dropping of the crime rates To argue that the dropping of the crime rates is unrelated to the fact that we have all these people who commit crimes in jail is really kind of silly I think KELLY Well continue to watch it Andy McCarthy good to see you MCCARTHY Thanks Megyn Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network LLC ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Copyright 2014 CQRoll Call Inc All materials herein are protected by

Hillary Clintons public outrage at the abduction of hundreds of schoolgirls by a Islamist Nigerian rebel group ignores the role the 2016 Democratic frontrunner had in preventing the group from being designated as a terrorist organization From The Daily Beast The State Department under Hillary Clinton fought hard against placing the al Qaedalinked militant group Boko Haram on its official list of foreign terrorist organizations for two years And now lawmakers and former US officials are saying that the decision may have hurt the American governments ability to confront the Nigerian group that shocked the world by abducting hundreds of innocent girlsOn Wednesday Clinton said that the abduction of the girls by Boko Haram was abominable its criminal its an act of terrorism and it really merits the fullest response possible first and foremost from the government of Nigeria Clinton said that as Secretary of State she had numerous meetings with Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan and had urged the Nigerian government to do more on counterterrorism What Clinton didnt mention was that her own State Department refused to place Boko Haram on the list of foreign terrorist organizations in 2011 after the group bombed the UN headquarters in Abuja The refusal came despite the urging of the Justice Department the FBI the CIA and over a dozen Senators and Congressmen He did it  Clintons successor Secretary of State John Kerry designated Boko Haram as a terrorist organization in November 2013 Hillary No reason to continue Benghazi probe  WaPo During a QA session held at the Ford Foundation in New York City ABC News Robin Roberts asked former secretary of state Hillary Clinton about the Benghazi attacks Were you satisfied with the answers and are you content with what you know what happened Absolutely she said I mean of course there are a lot of reasons why despite all of the hearings all of the information thats been provided some choose not to be satisfied and choose to continue to move forward Thats their choice and I do not believe there is any reason for it to continue in this way but they get to call the shots in Congress

Regional Justice Center in Las VegasAPLas Vegas Sun LAS VEGAS  A former Las Vegas Strip performer was found guilty Thursday of seconddegree murder for killing and dismembering his dancer exgirlfriend in a closely watched case that offered a lurid glimpse behind the scenes of the Sin City stage community Jason Omar Griffith sat motionless as the verdict was read in Clark County District Court but blew a kiss to his mother Charlene Davis as he was handcuffed to be taken to jail     Defense attorney Abel Yanez characterized Griffiths reaction as numb Not upset not happy The jury deliberated for about 14 hours over two days after hearing nine days of testimony about the strangulation death of Deborah Flores Narvaez during a Dec 12 2010 argument at Griffiths home Flores sister Celeste Flores Narvaez sobbed into her mothers shoulder as the verdict was read She had said she wanted Griffith to be convicted of firstdegree murder The family left the courthouse without speaking with reporters Griffiths defense attorneys said they will appeal and Yanez added that his client was not the person the killing suggested he was Prosecutor Marc DiGiacomo said he respected the verdict and understood it was difficult for jurors to decide guilt in domestic violence cases He also said he expected Griffith to receive the maximum 10 years to life in prison at sentencing July 23 You dont get to dismember a body and not serve life in prison DiGiacomo said Griffith could also get a definite 10 to 25year sentence He could have faced up to life in prison without parole for firstdegree murder Deborah Flores disappearance in midDecember 2010 drew intense attention for almost a month before Griffiths housemate Louis Colombo led police to her dismembered remains in tubs of concrete in a vacant house The trial was a tale of sex lies betrayal and violence between two passionate and ambitious Las Vegas Strip dancers Griffith spent four days testifying that Flores death was selfdefense He said he grabbed her from behind with his arms around her neck when he thought she was reaching for a purse that may have contained a gun No weapon was found He said he panicked afterward and asked Colombo to help dispose of the body DiGiacomo derided Griffiths selfdefense claim as a fabrication and said he did nothing to resuscitate Flores Griffith 35 is originally from Brooklyn New York He went by the name Blu as a performer in the Cirque du Soleil show Love based on Beatles music at The Mirage resort He testified that he juggled girlfriends and sexual acquaintances before and after he met Flores at a football halftime show in November 2009 Flores who went by Debbie moved to Las Vegas from Maryland She worked her way from gogo club work to a stage role in the racy Fantasy revue at the Luxor Evidence showed that by the time they became intimate in early 2010 Flores thought their relationship was monogamous But Griffith was meeting several women for casual sex and pursuing Agnes Roux a performer in the Cirque show Zumanity at the New YorkNew York hotel Griffith testified that his relationship with Flores had moviestyle Fatal Attraction characteristics He said she stalked threatened harassed and assaulted him when he tried to limit their time together and that no one took him seriously despite more than a dozen calls to police for help Prosecutor Michelle Fleck said Griffith fanned Flores anger by deceiving her about his sexual relationships pulling away after accompanying her to an abortion clinic in May then resuming their intimacy about the time of her 31st birthday in early July The two continued an offandon relationship until her death Flores had a temper and several of Griffiths friends and coworkers testified that she became violent when she was angry  drawing stares and sometimes security officers during outbursts in public places Roux testified that she broke up with Griffith after learning that he was sleeping with other Cirque dancers She said she told Griffith in early December 2010 they couldnt be together if he was still seeing Flores On the witness stand Griffith testified the fatal argument developed after Flores told him she was pregnant for the second time in about six months and wanted another abortion He said it escalated after Flores demanded he quit seeing Roux and devote his full attention to her Flores arm hit his face Griffith said as she reached past him toward her purse Griffith said he grabbed her from behind fell backward to the floor and held tightly until she stopped struggling Colombo testified he helped entomb and move the remains He received immunity from prosecution before leading police to the tubs of concrete on Jan 8 2011 Griffith was the one who sawed Flores legs from her torso Colombo said Griffith said it was Colombo,2014-05-22T21:14-04:00,abortion

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/05/14/candidate-backed-by-sen-ted-cruz-wins-gop-primary-for-nebraska-senate/,"WASHINGTON AP  The Tea Party scored a win in Nebraska on Tuesday as university president Ben Sasse captured the Republican nomination for US Senate in a bitter race that highlighted fissures within the GOP Two women set the stage for historymaking in West Virginia Sasse who had the backing of outside conservative groups as well as Sen Ted Cruz and Sarah Palin grabbed 48 percent of the vote in a fiveman primary Sid Dinsdale the president of Pinnacle Bank surged to second while former State Treasurer Shane Osborn finished third We were never doing this because we need another job Sasse told supporters Tuesday night We were only going to do this if we were going to talk about big bold conservative ideas Outside groups pumped millions into the race for Sasse while allies of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy tried to propel Osborn to the nomination With little to celebrate to date conservative groups immediately trumpeted Sasses victory Ben Sasse won this race because he never stopped fighting for conservative principles said Matt Hoskins executive director of the Senate Conservatives Fund The group spent more than 12 million to help Sasse Cruz said Sasses win is a clear indication that the grassroots are rising up to make DC listen Voters in Nebraska and West Virginia decided their lineups for the November elections in the latest round of spring primaries The fall midterms will determine control of Congress for the last two years of President Barack Obamas second term with Republicans expected to hold the House and cautiously optimistic about winning control of the Senate The GOP needs to net six seats to grab the majority In West Virginia Republican Rep Shelley Moore Capito and Democrat Natalie Tennant cruised to primary wins and will square off in a Senate showdown in November that will give the state its first female senator Capito is a seventerm congresswoman and daughter of former Gov Arch Moore Tennant is the states secretary of state Democratic Sen Jay Rockefeller is retiring after 30 years West Virginia has become increasingly Republican and Capito entered the general election contest as the heavy favorite If elected she would be the first Republican senator from West Virginia since 1959 In Nebraska Sasse who heads Midland University had the backing of the Tea Party Patriots and FreedomWorks in his bid to replace Republican Sen Mike Johanns who is retiring after a single sixyear term Sasse had focused on his conservative credentials opposition to abortion support for gun rights and goal of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act In one 30second ad Sasses two young daughters Alex and Corrie talk about how much their dad opposes the Affordable Care Act He wants to destroy it says one daughter He despises it says the other While Sasse won over tea partyers he offered voters some significant establishment credentials He served as an assistant secretary in the Health and Human Services Department in President George W Bushs administration studied at Harvard and Yale and was a visiting scholar in economics at the Brookings Institution Sasse is a heavy favorite against Democratic nominee Dave Domina in the Republicanleaning state The National Republican Senatorial Committee which had remained neutral called Sasse a problemsolver who will be a conservative voice to repeal the health care law The tea party has struggled this year as candidates have lost to establishment favorites in Texas North Carolina and Ohio and Nebraska stood as the insurgent movements best remaining shot Looking ahead to upcoming primaries the tea partys chances to upset incumbents have been diminishing in Kentucky Kansas Idaho and Mississippi The Republican establishment has a lovehate relationship with the tea party It welcomed the movements energy that propelled the GOP to control of the House in the 2010 elections but it blames tea partyers for lessthanviable general election candidates in 2010 and 2012 Senate races in Indiana Colorado Nevada and Delaware Republicans in the capital remain convinced they could have won control of the Senate if only their establishment candidates had won more primaries and some in the party have been determined to defeat the movements candidates this election In Nebraskas GOP primary for governor Omaha businessman Pete Ricketts narrowly defeated Attorney General Jon Bruning Term limits prevented Republican Gov Dave Heineman from running again In West Virginia Democratic names like Byrd and Rockefeller dominated politics for decades but since 2000 the state has voted Republican in presidential elections The transformation is widely expected to continue this fall as Republicans capitalize on voter antipathy toward Obama who lost all of the states 55 counties in 2012 Capitos planned departure from the House created a messy GOP primary in her 2nd Congressional District that stretches across the state Alex Mooney the former chairman of the Maryland GOP who moved to West Virginia captured the nomination in a sevencandidate race and will face Democrat Nick Casey the former state party chairman of West Virginia in the fall In his appeal to voters Mooneys campaign said he moved to West Virginia to live in freedom and hell fight Obama to preserve it One of the most endangered House Democrats is 19term Rep Nick Rahall who easily won his primary and will face DemocratturnedRepublican

AP Christian radio broadcaster James Dobson has won a temporary injunction preventing the federal government from requiring his ministry to include the morningafter pill and other emergency contraception in its health insurance A federal judge in Denver issued the injunction Thursday Dobson sued in December saying the Affordable Care Act mandate to provide the contraception violates the religious beliefs of his Colorado Springsbased ministry called Family Talk The US Supreme Court is considering similar challenges from Hobby Lobby and other employers Dobson is founder and president of Family Talk which has a nationally syndicated radio show newsletter and website The lawsuit says the ministry has 28 fulltime employees Hes best known as founder of the conservative Focus on the Family ministry He left that group and launched Family Talk in 2010 Flashback  From Dobsons original announcement of his challenge I believe in the rule of law and it has been my practice since I was in college to respect and honor those in authority over us It is my desire to do so now However this assault on the sanctity of human life takes me where I cannot go I WILL NOT pay the surcharge for abortion services The amount of the surcharge is irrelevant To pay one cent for the killing of babies is egregious to me and I will do all I can to correct a government that lies to me about its intentions and then tries to coerce my acquiescence with extortion It would be a violation of my most deeply held convictions to disobey what I consider to be the principles in Scripture The Creator will not hold us guiltless if we turn a deaf ear to the cries of His innocent babies So come and get me if you must Mr President I will not bow before your wicked regulation DOCS RATION CARE AMID HEALTH PRICE SPIKE
NYT Saying they can no longer ignore the rising prices of health care some of the most influential medical groups in the nation are recommending that doctors weigh the costs not just the effectiveness of treatments as they make decisions about patient care The shift little noticed outside the medical establishment but already controversial inside it suggests that doctors are starting to redefine their roles from being concerned exclusively about individual patients to exerting influence on how health care dollars are spent In practical terms new guidelines being developed by the medical groups could result in doctors choosing one drug over another for cost reasons or even deciding that a particular treatment  at the end of life for example  is too expensive In the extreme some critics have said that making treatment decisions based on cost is a form of rationingStill it is unclear if medical societies are the best ones to make cost assessments Doctors can have financial conflicts of interest and lack economic expertise Medicare Advantage cuts 1500 per beneficiary  National Journal Obamacares Medicare Advantage cuts will lead to benefit reductions of about 1500 per beneficiary according to a new analysis from a conservative think tank The American Action Forum founded by former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas HoltzEakin said almost all Medicare Advantage beneficiaries will feel the effect of cuts to the programAccording to AAF though seniors who use Medicare Advantage are facing an average benefit loss of about 1500 per year compared with preObamacare rates From 2014 to 2015 the average cut is about 300 or 3 percent Pricey pop  WISTV Officials with the VA Medical Center in downtown Charleston say a North Charleston man who was initially federally charged with a 525 fine for an 89 drink refill will instead be given a warning Pacific Research Institute Fellow Sally Pipes compares Americas and Canadas health care systems and The false promise of singlepayer healthcare Singlepayers cheerleaders cite Canada as proof of the systems superiority Its a foolish fetish Our northern neighbors healthcare system is plagued by rationing long waits poorquality care scarcities of vital medical technologies and unsustainable costs Thats exactly whats in store for America if we follow Canadas lead FOX NEWS POLL VOTERS WANT ANSWERS ON IRS CORRUPTION

VIDEOTAPE BREAM And hello again from Fox News in Washington There have been arrests in the apparent murder of a Palestinian youth which was blamed on Israeli extremists as a revenge attack for the deaths of three Israeli teens whose bodies were found in the West Bank earlier this week Clashes between Israeli police and Palestinian protesters continue this weekend We will talk with Israels ambassador to the US and two key senators in just a moment But first FOX News correspondent David Lee Miller is in Jerusalem with the latest  David DAVID LEE MILLER FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Shannon there are reports now of six arrests in connection with the death of that Palestinian teenager The six are described as Israeli Jews They are described as having quote nationalistic motives The question now will these arrests tamp down the violence or only increase it BEGIN VIDEOTAPE MILLER Palestinians and Israeli Arabs continue to voice their anger on the street Demonstrations this weekend taking place in East Jerusalem the West Bank and Arab communities in the northern part of the country Protesters hurled fire bombs and rocks at Israeli police In some instances Israeli Jews were targeted for attack Police fired tear gas stun grenades and rubber bullets Palestinian anger erupted last week following the murder of 16 yearold Mohammed Abu Khdeir According to Palestinian officials the teenagers autopsy shows he was still breathing when a fire burned 90 percent of his body Immediately following the attack Palestinians blamed rightwing Israelis The recent wave of violence began when three Israeli teenagers including one with dual US citizenship were kidnapped in the West Bank and found murdered last Monday Further heightening tensions amateur cell phone video appears to show Israeli police beating the 15yearold cousin of the murdered Palestinian boy The cousin Tariq Abu Khdeir an American citizen who goes to school in Florida was taken into custody by Israeli police during street demonstrations shortly before the funeral Police said Tariq was carrying a slingshot for lobbying stones No criminal charges have been filed but the teenager has been placed under house arrest The boys parents say their son did not take part in the violence and accused police of abuse Israels justice minister who says the incident caught on camera is a very brave act committed by men in uniform and has called for an investigation of the police allegedly involved in the beating END VIDEOTAPE MILLER In another development so far this weekend at least 29 rockets have been fired by militants in Gaza At least two of those rockets went beyond border communities targeting the city of Beer Sheba that is a city of some 200000 Israelis Analysts say the situation now has reached the boiling point If the situation on the ground does not improve they say it is very possible there could be a very serious escalation of the violence  Shannon BREAM David Lee Miller reporting from Jerusalem  David thank you Lets now bring in Israels ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer Ambassador welcome back to Fox News Sunday RON DERMER ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE US Thank you BREAM The prime minister vowed quick response and a quick investigation into the death of that Palestinian teenager Sounds like this morning there have been some arrests I know theres a gag order in place for some of the information But what can you tell us DERMER Well we have strong suspicions there are nationalistic motives behind these crimes We just have to wait In the next few hours all the facts will be given to the public But as you said the prime minister said he was going to bring the perpetrators to justice very quickly and he has One thing I can assure you Shannon that if these are Jews who are going to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law if they perpetrated these crimes they will not be hailed as heroes by Israeli political leaders They will not be public squares in Israel that will be named after them Little schoolboys and schoolgirls in Israel will not emulate them as heroes And thats exactly what we have on the Palestinian side where you have terrorists who are hailed as heroes by political leaders of the Palestinians public squares named after murderers children who learn to emulate murderers who are taught to emulate murderers Thats the difference between our society and its a difference we should never forget BREAM I want to ask you as well about some of the videos that you saw there purportedly of a cousin of a dead Palestinian teenager who his parents he was beaten by police A bit of reaction from the US State Department Jen Psaki saying We are profoundly troubled by reports he was severely beaten while in police custody and strongly condemn any excessive use of force We are calling for a speedy transparent and credible investigation and full accountability for any excessive use of force I understand at least according to some reports this morning hes been sentenced to house arrest at this point for several days Can you tell us anything about what happened DERMER Well we condemn excessive use of force Its unacceptable in our system if police use excessive force I will tell you from what I understand about the facts of the case  this is not just an innocent bystander who was pulled off a schoolyard He was with six other people They were masked They threw petrol bombs and Molotov cocktails at our police Three of them had knives from what I understand That does not excuse any excessive use of force and our justice ministry is opening an investigation Just in the case of Arab boy we will bring the perpetrators to justice And no one in uniform can employ excessive use of force in Israel Were a democratic society run by laws and we dont tolerate it BREAM Any update into the investigation of the three young Israeli men who were found dead earlier this week DERMER Unfortunately not We hope that the Palestinians will treat that crime with the seriousness my prime minister treated this crime of the Arab boy this heinous crime where he was killed If they would  if the Palestinian leadership would treat it in the same way then maybe we could get faster to a good outcome of this investigation Unfortunately half of the Palestinian leadership is run by Hamas which is a terror organization openly committed to our destruction They fired thousands of rockets at our cities As you heard in your report in the last couple of days they have fired about 50 rockets at Israelis And the southern part of Israel right now is under rocket fire as we speak BREAM All right I want to turn to Iran because the talks are ramping up again in Vienna Theres a July 28th deadline for an agreement that deals with easing international sanctions against Iran in exchange for getting some kind of control or assurances from them regarding their nuclear program Our Secretary of State John Kerry wrote an oped this week Quote Iranian officials have stated repeatedly and unambiguously that they have no intention of building a nuclear weapon and that their nuclear activities are designed solely to fulfill civilian needs Well Irans deputy foreign minister says no matter whats agreed to he says its only going to be temporary Is there ever a point at when youre OK with Iran having a nuclear weapon DERMER No and the world should not be OK with Iran having a nuclear weapon Its a threat  a direct to my country an existential threat to the state of Israel its a threat to the whole region and its a threat to the world I think that the secretary of state made an important point that they do not need nuclear weapons Theyve said they dont need nuclear weapons So then the question becomes why do they have 19000 centrifuges Why do they have thousands of kilos of enriched uranium They dont need a single kilo of enriched uranium They dont need a single centrifuge to have a peaceful nuclear program A lot of people dont know this There are 17 countries around the world that have peaceful nuclear energy programs but they did not enrich uranium on their soil Iran should not be allowed to keep centrifuges They should not be allowed to keep enriched uranium And we hope that the US administration and the P5plusone will stand very firm in the talks and ensuring those capabilities are removed from Iran BREAM So those who are supporting these talks and feel like there can be a good outcome are also relying on inspectors Do you think they have the capability to really be sure they know everything they need to know about Irans capabilities DERMER I dont think so Look I is a country thats half the size of Europe An inspection regime relies on unfettered access Thats a big country to search And the second thing it relies on good intelligence And our intelligence agencies and your intelligence agencies did not catch many things that Iran was doing right away For instance in Qom where they built an enrichment facility in the side of a mountain it was four years before our intelligence agencies knew about it So the last thing we want to do is leave Iran parked as a threshold nuclear power a few months away from getting the fissile material necessary for a bomb and to rely on inspectors to do the job If the only thing between radical ayatollah getting nuclear weapons is UN weapons inspectors then thats a huge problem for the entire world BREAM And quickly how concerned are you about Irans role  whats its doing what its playing in Iraq and with the advent of ISIS there DERMER Look Iran is the foremost sponsor of terrorism around the world In the last four years they have perpetrated terror attacks on five continents in 25 different countries Theyre the reason right now why Syrias regime why Bashar al Assad has killed nearly 200000 Syrians Theyre there working through their proxy Hezbollah Theyre in Iraq Theyre responsible for the murder of many American soldiers in Iraq over the years Theyre not your friends Theyre not your partners Theyre not going to help you in Iraq Theyre not going to help you in Syria Theyre not going to help you anywhere in the region Theyre an enemy of the United States Thats how they see themselves And I think enemies have to be treated as enemies BREAM Ambassador thank you very much for your time today DERMER Thank you BREAM Well the crisis in Israel is just the latest in a number of troubling situations overseas In Iraq and Syria the militant group ISIS continues to hold a broad swath of areas across both countries The Iraqi military which stood by as ISIS moved closer to Baghdad has now launched a series of targeted air strikes aimed at pushing ISIS back In Syria where President Obama asked Congress to provide 500 million to train rebel fighters the rebel chief has warned of a humanitarian disaster without more assistance in the face of fierce in fighting Now to cover all this from Philadelphia we have Senator Bob Casey joining us And here in studio Wyoming Senator John Barrasso Welcome to you both SEN JOHN BARRASSO R WYOMING Thank you Thanks for having me Shannon BREAM Lets start here SEN BOB CASEY D PA Its good to be with you Shannon BREAM Senator Casey thank you very much I want to start by asking both of you for your reaction Well start with Senator Barrasso to the events in Israel BARRASSO Well obviously our hearts go out to all of those families involved There will be justice I believe that We hear that from the ambassador Theres obviously emotions There is  theres been revenge senseless violence And you worry about it spiraling downward BREAM And Senator Casey CASEY Shannon whether its the killing of three Israeli teens or the killing of a Palestinian teenager in both instances we have to condemn acts of violence in the strongest possible terms number one And number two the justice systems in both places have to take care of this now And you heard from the ambassador the commitment the Israelis have to bringing their own people to justice I have no doubt now that we see the news of six arrests that they will do that because Israel is a place where the rule of law still prevails I would hope and I would expect that the Palestinians would do the same thing but that remains to be seen But were heartened by the news that at least arrests have been made and the justice system is proceeding BREAM All right I want to turn to new video that purports to show the leader of the group ISIS now calling itself the Islamic State Hes speaking at a mosque in Mosul And this is a bit of what he had to say translated of course to English BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ISIS LEADER through translator The mujahidin had been rewarded victory by God after years of fighting They were able to achieve that aim in hurry to announce a caliphate and choose the imam END VIDEO CLIP BREAM Senator Barrasso this was a man who was in custody When he left reportedly said Ill see you in New York Obviously been very successful across Syria and Iraq How concerned are you BARRASSO Very concerned  concerned for the safety and security of the American people Obviously he feels emboldened by what this Islamic State has been able to accomplish He must feel safe in that large area theyve taken control of which shows you that when the United States leaves a vacuum others will go in others will fill it Bad actors will show up And were seeing that right now And my greatest concern is for what he intends to do and I think they have the capability and intent to attack the United States BREAM And by the way Iraqi officials say theyre working to confirm this is indeed al Baghdadi So he purports to be Well see if it is I want to play something Ryan Crocker former US ambassador to Iraq had to say on Wednesday about the situation BEGIN VIDEO CLIP RYAN CROCKER FORMER US AMBASSADOR TO IRAQ The Iraqis are not politically developed to the point where they can run the train on their own Were wired into their system And our effective disengagement in 2011 I think led to a downward spiral that has brought us to where we are END VIDEO CLIP BREAM Senator Barrasso how much fault does the US bear with what were seeing happening now BARRASSO I believe that President Obama is projecting worldwide US weakness And I think that its hurting us all across the Middle East but other places worldwide as well including Russia and the Ukraine So I think that the US withdrawal has created this vacuum which has allowed for this to happen And it just emboldens others and invites them to act in a belligerent way so that our friends no longer trust us our enemies dont fear us and when the United States says to our friends you know youre on your own what that allows to others is they come and get it BREAM All right Senator Casey Iraqs current prime minister has taken a lot of heat of this Nouri al Maliki says he intends to run for a third term It sounds like hes not stepping down although there are  a lot of calls for that Hes been accused of making the situation worse there in Iraq by not being more inclusive This is what General Martin Dempsey chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had to say earlier this week BEGIN VIDEO CLIP GEN MARTIN DEMPSEY CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF Unless the Iraqi government gets the message out that it really does intend to allow participation by all groups everything were talking about makes no difference END VIDEO CLIP BREAM So Senator Casey do you think that al Maliki is capable of that or do you think its time for him to go CASEY No I dont think hes capable of it Shannon I think the last couple of years are testament to that In retrospect I think probably both administrations put too much confidence in him So we would hope  although we cant dictate  we would hope that the Iraqi people would choose a new leader to lead them forward Hes not had a government thats been inclusive Hes not taken the steps that are necessary to have a government of national unity But I do think the president  I would disagree with John about the presidents leadership I think hes shown strong leadership in the region I think the steps hes taken so far as it relates to Iraq and focusing on ISIS as a threat not only to the Iraqi people but to the region and ultimately to us if theyre going to try to form a caliphate So I think the president has taken the right steps so far We dont know what will happen next in terms of additional steps We dont know if there will be any other direct military action but I think putting our personnel on the ground to protect our diplomatic interests to protect our embassy and our personnel as well as to get an assessment from an intelligence point of view of whats happening on the ground is appropriate and prudent but other steps may need to be taken BREAM Well  and Senator Casey to that point we have ramped up the number of US personnel we have on the ground there We know the Defense Department confirms there are drones flying over although no authorization for airstrikes at this point I want to ask you both and Ill start with you Senator Casey at what point do you think the president needs to come to Congress to authorize any further level of involvement in Iraq CASEY Well Shannon I dont think were at that point yet And I hope  I hope that the president will continue to on the path hes been on which is to assess the situation make sure our national interests are served But an interesting development in the last couple of days where the president I think appropriately asked Congress for support for the Syrian opposition the wellvetted Syrian opposition to make sure that we can change  have an impact I should say changing the dynamic on the battlefield in Syria because as we know the moderate opposition in Syria is fighting in a sense a twofront war Fighting Assad and the barrel bombs and brutality that he has  the he has put forth as well as the Syrian opposition fighting ISIS So I think its very important that the wellvetted Syrian opposition has the resources to be able to fight and to change the dynamic on the battlefield If that changes that will have a positive impact not only in Syria but in Iraq as well BREAM And Senator Casey I want to come back to you on that point but first give Senator Barrasso a chance to weigh in Do you think at some point the President Obama needs to come to Congress regarding our involvement in Iraq And what would that point be for you BARRASSO Well if the president wants boots on the ground  yes he must come to Congress in that situation But a strong foreign policy means that when a president says something that those words have meaning followed through on Like there was this  we talked about Syria I arming the rebels training them And you know there are 30 different groups moderate groups six larger groups within that with different interactions So youre not exactly sure who to help and who they attack You right now have Assad attacking ISIS So who do they fight Where do you train them I think the president does have to come to Congress for additional authorization And the president I think really has not been leading I want to know what the presidents plan is He drew a  he bluffed with his red line in Syria I think he was slow to recognize what was happening with ISIS And we need a plan from a president whos engaged not who seems to be just running out the clock BREAM Well and as Senator Casey mentioned he has asked for this 500 million that would be aimed at appropriately vetted opposition forces in Syria Senator Casey youve been calling for that for a long time Do you think we missed our window of opportunity there even if Congress goes along with this request is it too little too late CASEY I dont think its too little too late I would have preferred it happened earlier but I do think in response to what John said I think that the presidents request for support for the opposition in Syria is the beginning of a new approach and a strategy to have better success on the ground I would also say that when it came to the debate last fall and the red line and the use of force Im not sure that that transpired as I would have hoped But I do think we should  we should commend the administration for the result that they got The removal of chemical weapons out of Syria is a substantial accomplishment Not to say that were certain that every single chemical weapon is out of there but to have by one estimate 100 percent of the chemical weapons secured and taken out of Syria diminished the threat to Israel diminished the threat to the region and I think thats an accomplishment Weve got to have I believe much more of a bipartisan approach to Syria and to Iraq and some of that will involve the president coming to Congress as it relates to Syria as well as Iraq but I would agree with John when he said that theres no reason for combat troops in Iraq BREAM And Senator Barrasso I want to pivot to Iran Theres been some skepticism on the hill about dealing with Iran There was bipartisan legislation proposed by Senator Menendez Both you and Senator Casey signed on as cosponsors of that It would have some teeth for going after Iran if it doesnt comply with the deals and the deadlines The White House immediately threatened to veto it So for you how will you define success with regard to the talks and that July 20th deadline BARRASSO The July 20th deadline is for the talks to be finished by then This is now the end of the sixmonth period It seems to me at this point Iran has gotten everything that theyve wanted The sanctions have been released Theyve gotten the freeze of the 7 billion in assets lifted And theyve given nothing so far So if youve seen the YouTube video of the foreign minister of Iran he seems like hes setting up to either blame the United States if it doesnt work or try to take credit if it does work Theres a letter signed by 83 senators that says how we define success which is no ability to enrich at all and significant inspections A level of being able to see what theyre really doing and getting around And I think its going to be very difficult for Iran to comply with that BREAM All right Senator Barrasso Senator Casey we thank you both for joining us today BARRASSO Thanks for having us BREAM All right How concerned are you at home about the fighting in the Middle East Join the conversation on Facebook with other FNS viewers And does the terrorist threat to Iraq mean Americans will be in danger here at home Our Sunday panel weighs in next COMMERCIAL BREAK BEGIN VIDEO CLIP GEN MARTIN DEMPSEY JOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN ISIL itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant goes by other names but they are a regional threat today that over time could become a transregional and global threat And so thats why were there END VIDEO CLIP BREAM Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey warning of the potential farreaching threats of the al Qaeda inspired group that is taking control of regions of Syria and Iraq Its time now for our Sunday group Nina Easton of Fortune magazine Mara Liasson from National Public Radio FOX News contributor Liz Cheney and Charles Lane of The Washington Post Welcome Good to see you all this Sunday UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE Good to be here BREAM Nina Ill start with you General Dempsey saying there is a real longterm threat to the US So what do we do next with regard to Iraq NINA EASTON FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR Well actually its not just longterm Its actually the White House now is worried about short term threat I think it kind of got buried this week that security measures at airports internationally are being increased The White House is really worried these American passportholding jihadists can come in legally And by the way they have the ability now to produce bombs that can get through our security measures So were on the case trying to look for ways to stop those kinds of bombs to get on airplanes This whole rise of ISIS which is now by the way calling itself the Islamic State has become a national security threat It was a long time ago but its a clear and present danger right now to the United States BREAM Yes Mara how does the administration balance that against the president being very clear he wants us out of Iraq That was all part of his campaigning and hes carried that out But now we do have interests that are involved there with the rise of ISIS the Islamic State How does the administration thread that needle MARA LIASSON NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO Well hes already sent up to 750 American military personnel to Iraq He says thats not re occupying Iraq or going there to help the Iraqi military The problem is that the new vision that the president laid out at West Point was about helping partners around the world Were not going to do this ourselves Were going to shore up the terrorist fighting capabilities of our partners Well that cant happen We just saw what happened to our partner the Iraqi military who pretty much collapsed in the face of ISIS So the question for the administration is is there a strategy short of reoccupying Iraq that can prevent this Islamic State whatever were calling it from becoming a safe haven like Afghanistan pre911 for terrorists who can threaten us And the administration says well there are ways to do this You know look at Somalia or Yemen or the territories on the border of Pakistan with drones with  you know intelligence were able to contain them It might be a little harder to do that in Iraq BREAM And were seeing poll numbers overall the president is suffering with regard to public perception of his performance But when we talk about foreign policy Liz hes hitting alltime lows Is there a chance here for him to come up with a strategy that redeems his credibility in that area LIZ CHENEY FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR You know its difficult I think the American people are looking at whats happening sort of seeing the region in flames And looking at the extent to which  you know there are a lot of debates about Iraq which people have gone over and will continue to go over But at the end of the day when this president took over Iraq was stable You saw our Ambassador Crocker there talking about the extent to which al Qaeda had really been defeated And so for the president to then decide hes going to walk away and to have this be the aftermath I think people are very worried about it and theyre worried about whats happening in Afghanistan and the fact he may well be  he says hes going to go down essentially the same path there So I certainly hope that he will turn things around because I think that turning around the poll numbers would be a sign that he actually was exercising some leadership and moving in a direction that was going to keep us safe but Im not optimistic BREAM Well and Chuck we have the request now in from the administration for the 500 million to help in Syria where ISIS has taken many strongholds as well And there are questions about whether its going to make a difference at this point Is it too late CHARLES LANE THE WASHINGTON POST Well that 500 million assuming its all well spent and it works and it goes to the purposes its intended to if you really think about it is money that will go to prolonging the war in Syria by creating a force strong enough to counter ISIS Thats the  thats the theory of it So I dont even think anyone is claiming that that money is going to bring this all to a conclusion What we have is a giant sort of strategic vacuum that goes almost all the way from Aleppo in Syria to Baghdad in Iraq and everybody is fighting over it The Saudis are involved Assads regime the Iranians are huge players these guys from ISIS Its a complete mess And the United States unless it wanted to get in a huge way with all kinds of hundreds of thousands of troops which were not going to do were kind of reduced to this kind of measure of attempting to manipulate the balance from a long distance through proxies we dont entirely trust going to Maras point and so far ph its on I think its  at best its a prolonged difficult struggle and I wouldnt bet on any outcome of it BREAM Well and Nouri al Maliki says hes staying He wants a third term Does he survive Can he be helpful in any way LIASSON Well hes not helpful And part of the reason we dont have troops there with pressure on him from Iran not to allow the security agreement that we keep troops here And I think Chuck is right There are no good options but one option has to be  and this was run by the White House by his own advisers including Hillary Clinton and Panetta two years ago is to vet and arm the pre Syrian army because they have gone toe to toe with the ISIS in Syria So youve got to  theres a lot of fronts that you have to work on LIZ CHENEY FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR The problem youve got with the situation with Maliki now though is a priorities issue Because youve got a number of people saying Maliki needs to go Maliki needs to form a government thats more representative Thats not our big problem right now Our big problem right now is ISIS And we need to be able to say were going to separate out everything else and we are going to go forward in a way that frankly we ought to have been doing air strikes already that defeat ISIS And after weve been in there defeating ISIS well then have the credibility to go back to Maliki and say OK look you know you need to be much more representative Perhaps we need another prime minister But that shouldnt be the issue were focused on today CHARLES LANE THE WASHINGTON POST Or if at that point if Maliki feels secure because ISIS is no longer the threat that he can tell us we dont care about your demands that Id be more inclusive CHENEY But ISIS is the threat to us LANE Its true and I think the most were going to be able to accomplish if anything maybe is deny that space to ISIS But to build something positive in that space Im not so sure BREAM All right We are going to leave it there on this topic But panel stick around Were going to see you a little bit later When we come back though the questions over Lois Lerners missing e mails continue Congressman Darrell Issa joins us live to discuss whats next in this ongoing investigation COMMERCIAL BREAK BREAM The IRS continues to turn over new documents after claiming to have lost two years worth of emails belonging to exIRS official Lois Lerner Republican and Democratic staffers are reportedly scouring tens of thousands of pages of newly provided material on a holiday week no less Joining us now the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and a key leader in the investigation Darrell Issa Chairman Issa welcome back to Fox News Sunday REP DARRELL ISSA RCALIF Good to be back Sorry to be still talking about the same issues month after month as we get dribbed and drabbed documents as you said in the opening BREAM Well and to that point in a letter dated June 27th the commissioner IRS commissioner John Koskinen wrote to your counterpart that came over at House Ways and Means and he said quote We are working to complete our production of Ms Lerners emails for the tax writing committees by the end of next week as promised Of course that puts that smack up against a holiday Now weve been told tens of thousands of pages of material were turned over What can you tell us if anything about that ISSA Well you know he said tax writing committees Because theres been a double standard The taxwriting committees they could have pushed one button taken everything that came out of this surge and handed it to taxwriting committees in hours not over a year In the case of my committee they redact and they check to make sure that Im not getting any of your personal tax information especially if you were a conservative targeted by Lois Lerner So theres an understanding of why theres a little delay for us But the commissioner has had  three commissioners have had these delays since the beginning of our investigation when in fact there should be no looking at these documents They should simply hand them to the taxwriting committees Do I expect that there are more documents to come well after this week Absolutely BREAM All right You also wrote a letter to the commissioner this week inviting him to clarify some discrepancies in testimony that he gave sworn testimony before the committee and comments that weve now had publicly from Lois Lerners attorney What are the discrepancies Will he take you up on that offer ISSA Well hes asked to come back for a committee hearing that we didnt ask him to come to related to improper payments at the IRS And we presume hed like to use that opportunity to correct the record and he should Because either Lois Lerners attorney is outright not telling the truth which hes played fast and loose with the truth several times or the commissioner was inaccurate in his testimony before Congress Now the lawyers Mr Taylor is not under oath The commissioner is So hopefully hell clarify it support it and it probably will make us understand that Lois Lerners attorney continues to profess her innocence when were long past the question of guilt She broke rules she broke the law and she continues to hide under the Fifth Amendment which is her right but lets understand shes in fact a person whos been referred for criminal prosecution BREAM She has And the Justice Department is doing an investigation It said its you know a year or so ago that it announced that it was going to do that The Attorney General Eric Holder says thats ongoing I know that you and others in the House have concerns about exactly whats happening One of the committee staffers said that the committee is going to take a quote closer look at what the DOJ is or isnt doing What does that mean Whats the plan ISSA At some point after youve produced  and I brought my props But this is all about the targeting of conservatives not progressives targeting of conservatives for their political beliefs This is a pretty definitive document on Lois Lerner And theres more to be done And this is separate from the indictment referral Now we have to ask how long will the Justice Department not take on this case My ranking member Elijah Cummings continues to say this case is over and has been saying it for more than a year But its amazing that until the Justice Department actually does a criminal investigation hopefully with a special prosecutor the American people arent going to believe for a moment that in fact nobodys at fault here this was just an accident some rogue people in Cincinnati as Lois Lerner and the president would have had you believe BREAM So what can you do to push the DOJ or to dig into what they are or arent doing ISSA We actually think the pressure of an upcoming election the pressure of the Attorney General wanting to leave at the end of this year may cause them to at least go through the motions of presenting the contempt before a grand jury and coming back with some responses to these rather scathing indictments of Lois Lerner that came out of the Ways and Means Committee BREAM I want to read you something that her attorney said just a few days ago This is a quote Shes been made to be a villain in a way thats very very unfair Shes a person who did everything she thought was right and now shes being blamed for things which arent really even scandalous Does she make a perfect villain for you for the committee ISSA Well you know Bill Taylor is doing a really good job for his client but hes just not telling the truth Let me just take it as the truth She did everything she thought she should do Thats right She agreed with the president in opposing Citizens United a Supreme Court decision that he was scathing in the House opposing And she agreed She agreed with the progressive movement She disagreed with conservatives So she did what she thought was right She went after and tried to stop conservatives from expressing their beliefs held up systemically along that some of her coworkers just paused ph on others held up their applications until well after the election two years and more She did that And shes  in her email I remember one of them said she didnt want to look per se political Yes she hid the fact that she was politically biased and that she was using the power the great power of her position against conservatives and in support of the presidents opposition to Citizens United Her attorneys right in that sense BREAM OK Its no secret that you and the ranking member Democrat Congressman Elijah Cummings are not the best of friends Youve had some differences ISSA Just a bit BREAM He says that youve released things selectively and that youve  thats given a false impression at times Seemed like he took a swipe at the committee this week as well I want to read something he was quoted in USA Today saying this Our committee and all committees should use taxpayer dollars to help better the everyday lives of our constituents not inflate the press operations to basically run political campaigns out of government buildings Your response ISSA Well he should tell that to the president who has the large political campaign and Air Force one to do it We have a small staff that work on new media and when I say small you know its less than a handful The fact is that he talks about selective release He is free to release the counterpoint of anything we do When we do these reports hes free to produce a minority report But back to the question of releasing selectively Of course you shouldnt show your whole hand Did you ever see a US Attorney hand out an entire case or throw out all the transcripts We do try to keep the American people informed Were doing  partly doing that by being on with you today because its important they understand Conservatives were targeted for their political beliefs Progressives werent Lois Lerner broke rules She broke the law And now two years of her e mail are missing And we may never know all that she did BREAM All right Chairman thank you for your time today We know this is far from over So well continue to follow it Thank you sir ISSA Thank you BREAM All right when we come back the Supreme Court this week sided with Hobby Lobby ruling that companies can cite religious objections And off that of the Obamacare contraception mandate Well bring back our panel to discuss that Plus what would you like to ask the panel about that monumental decision Just go to Facebook or Twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your questions on the air COMMERCIAL BREAK BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ADELE KEIM LEGAL COUNSEL BECKET FUND The court issued a careful ruling it issued a narrow ruling and it squarely rebuked the administrations groundless position that Americans lose their religious freedom when they go out and open a family business Were thrilled with this decision END VIDEO CLIP BREAM One of the attorneys representing Hobby Lobby in its case before the Supreme Court celebrating Mondays 54 decision We are back now with the panel to talk about that Mara I want to start with a question we got via Facebook from Tom Johnson He says What will be the political and legal fallout from the decision Will another set of religious objection cases start winding their way through the court And of course we know we have the religious groups now separately fighting this as well MARA LIASSON NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO Yes I think you will have more cases winding through the courts As far as the political fallout you heard it just in that clip of tape Its really important for Republicans and conservatives to say this is an issue of religious liberty not contraception And thats what she was trying to do there The lawyer saying no no this is not about contraception Its really important for Democrats and womens groups to make this about contraception Because that is the fault lines along  that the midterm elections are going to be fought Democrats desperately need to energize single women unmarried women This is a very important issue for them So its important that they see this as a threat to contraception UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE I would ask  EASTON And we have seen this already play out So in 2012 when the White House looked like a frontal assault on the Catholic Church which at first seemed really stupid Like why would you take on the Catholic Church over this issue Well it turned out that that contraception issue got into the table water table excuse me of the presidential election and it suddenly became Republicans want to take away your contraception Thats how it got contorted And Romney won married women He lost single women LIASSON By 29 points EASTON Yes And Mara is right And keep in mind single women are a growing portion of the vote So this could really hurt Republicans in 2014 And I think you know you have to look at races like Kay Hagan and Mary Landrieu Both Democrats both potentially  both vulnerable Democrats but this could actually help them LIASSON And the court didnt help with the Wheaton decision CROSSTALK BREAM Right To catch everybody else on that there are religious groups that the administration has created an accommodation for them They can say Im a nonprofit religious group I have objections This is different than forprofit Hobby Lobby Theres the form they want them to sign which would then absolve them of any connection to the contracept  this is third party that handled that A number of these groups dozens of them across the country are challenging that saying we dont want to sign a permission slip for something wed never agreed to and never give permission to Wheaton College was among those who filed for an emergency injunction at the Supreme Court And they got one And there was a very lengthy dissent I want to read a little bit of it Because this came from Justice Sotomayor and Justices Ginsburg and Kagan signed on as well And she said you know we feel like theres been a switcheroo with the Hobby Lobby decision She said Those who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us on our word Not so today after expressly relying on the availability of the religious nonprofit accommodation to hold that the contraceptive coverage requirement violates RFRA that Religious Freedom Restoration Act as applied to closely held forprofit corporations The court now as the dissent in Hobby Lobby feared it might retreats from that position Liz how does that complicate the conversation now CHENEY You know I think both of these cases  I mean with respect to Wheaton the court was doing something that was very straightforward was saying essentially Wheaton doesnt have to fill out the form that theyre bringing suit about until the case has been heard BREAM Right now CHENEY Yes Now Justice Sotomayor if you look at her dissent at the end of it she basically says this is just not the way we normally grant an injunction but theres a huge amount of passion in the beginning of that dissent I think that both of these cases show particularly if you look at the dissent the court was saying Religious Freedom Restoration Act says that governments got to have a compelling interest if its going to burden your free exercise of religion and it has to choose the least restrictive means to do that And they said in the case of Hobby Lobby this isnt the least restrictive means It was very straightforward The dissents of both of these cases though show the passion thats there but also frankly a legal theory that we havent seen before which is essentially a theory that says abortion rights trump everything else Abortion rights are more important than the free exercise of religion This isnt about Republicans blocking access to contraception This is about the court saying this is the law And dont forget that RFRA was passed unanimously in the House only yes three votes against it in the Senate and signed by Bill Clinton BREAM Right CHENEY So this is very clearly a defense of the free exercise of religion not trying to somehow prevent women from getting access to contraceptives BREAM Well and already were now seeing fullpage ads calling for the repeal of RFRA because people are still upset which theres always a backlash whenever the Supreme Court does anything controversial And when its 54 its always controversial Chuck I want to give you the question that we got from Twitter Jackie Brooks she asks will this lead to more challenges of the ACA that makes the full implementation and enforcement of the law impossible And this was a regulation of course that stemmed from the law it wasnt the law itself But is it the first bite of the apple Will it open other opportunities LANE I dont think so If shes saying would it make it the full implementation impossible I think were past that point We had the big health care case at the Supreme Court the statute was found constitutional But do I think it can kind of you know sort of nip at the heels so to speak of this law and create a lot of controversy Yeah And the Wheaton case is a good example of that I guess I have to say that I view this as a very difficult issue right This is not an easy question where religious liberty ends and the federal governments legitimate authority to put a welfare program in starts But one thing you can be sure of Shannon is were not going to have a nuanced calm discussion of this over the next eight months we are going to have  BREAM The dust is still settling LANE Were going to have a battle because Maras right The ads are already started in the North Carolina race against Tom Tillis but over in Arkansas where Mark Pryor is running for reelection as a Democrat theyre using these cases against him because you know apparently the ruling is more popular in Arkansas and people are saying well Mark Pryor wouldnt have put Sam Alito on the Supreme Court The Supreme Court is more politicized and polarized than ever Its a reflection of whats happening in the broader electorate And you know I dont think thats a good thing because I think the Religious Freedom Restoration Act itself is a token of an earlier more bipartisan time when Congress was capable of getting together and attempting to strike a balance on these very emotional subjects And that time that was 20 years ago Thats over BREAM Well and within minutes of the ruling coming out and people sort of digesting it we heard not only  well you heard from the White House eventually later in the day They said the constitutional lawyer in the Oval Office does not approve Not surprising But again putting that emphasis on well he understands the Constitution and how this all works Although you know hes taking a lot of heat from not necessarily adhering to it at all times LANE Well it wasnt a constitutional ruling by the way It was a statutory ruling BREAM Right They stayed away from the  LANE The statutory ruling So  CHENEY Well and his constitutional interpretation has left a lot to be desired in many instances in this administration So I think the fact that he opposes this ruling you know it was a ruling based on what the Religious Freedom Restoration Act says And its a very practical ruling BREAM All right Weve got to leave it there panel Thank you very much See you next week Well up next bringing Americas heroes to the highest courts in the land COMMERCIAL BREAK BREAM The Supreme Court is our nations highest court and the Pentagon a symbol of the US Military One woman has made it her mission to unite the two by thanking our wounded warriors BEGIN VIDEO CLIP MARTHAANN ALITO Well Im very lucky BREAM MarthaAnn Alito has led a life full of unexpected adventures living all over the globe as the only daughter of parents who both served in the US Military ultimately landing in our nations capital when her husband Samuel Alito was nominated to the US Supreme Court Not long after she started putting down DC roots a friend invited her to Friday appreciation day at the Pentagon MARTHAANN ALITO WIFE OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ALITO You walked through the Pentagon all of the members of the service who had been in whatever capacity wounded were walking through the corridors of the Pentagon and everyone came out and applauded It was so moving At that point it occurred to me well the military theyre fighting for the rule of law Lets bring them to the court BREAM Savvy connected and determined Alito worked to arrange visits which now happen twice a year most recently in early June on camera What does it mean to you when you see them getting off the bus and you know theyre about to have something very special MARTHAANN ALITO Well my heart just swells I cannot tell you how much I love this country I believe fully in American exceptionalism and the fact that these young people understand the concept of what our country is about that it is for all of us that they are willing to sacrifice themselves for all of us really makes me think what have I done lately BREAM voice over Though she spearheads the visits which include behind the scenes tours of the court an afternoon tea and visits with the justices Alito deflects any praise noting the scores of volunteers who get involved in everything from transporting the wounded warriors to making sure their every question is answered MARTHAANN ALITO The warriors themselves will run around to each justice Justice may I have your picture may I have your autograph Justice would you mind Would you mind Could we discuss this BREAM Alito says she used to be surprised at how complex some of the questions from the soldiers were showing a deep understanding of the Constitution and intricate legal issues MARTHAANN ALITO I would go back and talk to Sam and say to him you wont believe the question that came up and Im still amazed that this happened BREAM Thats important to her because all along her hope has been that the soldiers and justices would see their shared link in defending Americas foundations Alito says many of the justices send her notes after the visits telling her how humbled they are on camera What experience do you want them to have How do you want them to remember that both the justices and the wounded warriors and their families who visit What do you hope all sides get out of it MARTHAANN ALITO The biggest plus is that indeed their country and the justices value their service END VIDEO CLIP BREAM The wounded warriors next visit to the court is in November A special thanks to the Marines Army and the Supreme Court for allowing us to share the story with you And thats it for today Have a

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/08/senate-debates-focus-on-obama-economy/,President Barack Obamas policies national and local economic issues and womens rights sparked clashes Tuesday night as Senate candidates debated in five states with just a month left before Election Day The debates were part of races both parties are counting on for victories  in Virginia for Democrats and in West Virginia for Republicans  and races where both parties are hoping to win a seat from the other Democrats from Republicans in Georgia and Republicans from Democrats in North Carolina     The race in Colorado figures to be among those that will decide whether the GOP will gain the six seats overall it needs to take control of the Senate in the next Congress Highlights from the debates  VIRGINIA ITS THE ECONOMY In his second debate with Republican challenger Ed Gillespie Virginia Democratic Sen Mark Warner touted his record of promoting economic development while trying to counter criticism thats he marches in lockstep with President Barack Obama Everything in my career has been about creating jobs said Warner a former Virginia governor and cell phone entrepreneur Warner said he was proud of his work to promote economic development and job growth in distressed parts of the state as well as his support to spread broadband Internet access Gillespie said Warners voting record hasnt matched his rhetoric and criticized the incumbent for supporting Obama policies that he said have hurt Virginias economy Sen Warner voted for the failed stimulus 1 trillion wasted money He voted for the excessive regulations in the DoddFrank bill that are making it hard for small businesses to get capital and get loans He voted for 7 trillion in new debt and nearly 1 trillion in tax increases Gillespie said And of course last but not least he voted for the Affordable Care Act Gillespie said he would work to repeal the presidents health care law Warner said he would work to improve it  WEST VIRGINIA COAL AND ENERGY POLICY In the only debate in this years race for an open Senate seat in West Virginia GOP Rep Shelley Moore Capito stuck with her campaign theme of tying Democrat Natalie Tennant to Obamas energy policies The debate in Charleston focused on the coal industry and the president is wildly unpopular in the state among those who view his administration as hostile to fossil fuels Every single mining job thats lost is attributable to the policies of President Obama and Harry Reid who is supporting my opponents election said Capito referring to the Senates majority leader Throughout the debate Capito constantly pointed out Tennants support of Obamas 2008 and 2012 campaigns Tennant is a twoterm secretary of state and she pointed to the support shes received from the United Mine Workers of America and called her candidacy procoal miner She criticized Capitos multiple votes for the House Republican budget which calls for cuts to domestic programs They trust me that Ill save their jobs Tennant said of the miners union Both candidates said they oppose federal limits on carbon emissions from coalfired power plants which Obama supports Tennant said she doesnt disagree with scientists about climate change which Obamas energy policies aim to curb Capito said she doesnt necessarily think the climate is changing but told reporters afterward that she misspoke and does think people contribute to climate change Capito and Tennant are vying to replace Democratic Sen Jay Rockefeller who is retiring  NORTH CAROLINA OBAMA POLICIES VS STATE CONSERVATIVE TURN The second debate between Democratic Sen Kay Hagan and Republican challenger Thom Tillis in North Carolina centered on whether voters should think more about Obama or the conservative direction taken by the states government during Tillis time as state House speaker Tillis said the presidents policies  every single one of them  are effectively up for a referendum If you want the same failed policies of President Obama you vote for Kay Hagan If you think its time to change the direction of this country and make it great again I hope youll vote for Thom Tillis the Republican said Tillis repeated 10 times that Hagans record shows she backs positions favored by Obama 96 percent of the time The figure comes from recorded rollcall votes on measures on which the president took a public position Hagan focused repeatedly on the sharply conservative direction of the state Legislature which Tillis has helped lead after Republicans won vetoproof majorities two years ago She said GOP lawmakers have rejected a federally funded Medicaid expansion that would provide more people with health coverage made cuts to education funding and reduced state taxes in ways that disproportionately benefit wealthier families He has campaigned on an agenda to take that destructive agenda to Washington Hagan said Speaker Tillis feels that those who have the most they should get the most help  COLORADO A FOCUS ON WOMENS RIGHTS Colorado Democratic Sen Mark Udall and his challenger GOP Rep Cory Gardner clashed again over womens rights and reproductive issues In a state where female voters have helped Democrats win every topoftheticket election in the past decade Udall has tried to emphasize Gardners support for socalled personhood measures that would give fertilized eggs the same rights as people  outlawing all forms of abortion and possibly some forms of birth control Rep Gardner has a long history of trying to limit womens reproductive rights Udall said Gardner has disowned a personhood measure thats on the Colorado ballot this year saying he does not want to limit contraception But he is still the cosponsor of a similar law in the House He said he has remained a sponsor as simply a statement that I support life He said he wasnt sure if he would sponsor a similar measure were he elected to the Senate He also laughed off Udalls repeated jabs on womens rights recalling that when his wife saw the first television ad accusing him of trying to limit birth control she said Didnt you used to pick up my prescription The debate at The Denver Post was the second of three the candidates will have this week  GEORGIA COMPETING CHARGES OF FALSE HOPE Democrat Michelle Nunn and Republican David Perdue accused each other of offering false hope to voters during a rowdy debate in which they traded charges of not being able to advance anything if elected to Georgias open Senate seat Also at the debate was Libertarian Amanda Swafford who said neither Nunn nor Perdue offers voters anything new Perdue the former chief executive of Dollar General dismissed Nunns call for bipartisanship as unrealistic She is the daughter of former Democratic Sen Sam Nunn a moderate who represented Georgia in Congress for years My Democratic opponent was handpicked by President Obama Do you think she is going to go against his policies Perdue said Nunn chief executive of the volunteer organization Points of Light argued that Perdue does not have the leadership necessary to be effective in Washington and cited his support for last years GOPled government shutdown We need principled efforts and ideals but we also need to send people to Washington that are not about attacking and paralyzing and polarizing our government she said,2014-10-08T09:18-04:00,abortion

poor parents and other relatives thronged outside the home Wednesday as a garbage truck finished hauling away an estimated 20 tons of trash from what Mexican authorities said was an insectinfested shelter that had housed 607 adults and children often against their will     Maria Valdivia Vasquez 65 waited to be allowed in for a brief visit with her 17yearold grandson Jose Antonio Martinez She said his mother sent him to The Great Family group home a decade ago because of behavioral problems Relatives were allowed to visit him only twice a year and shelter employees had recently been sitting in on the visits apparently to monitor residents comments she said Valdivia Vasquez said that when she decided to ask that the boy be released to her shelter founder Rosa del Carmen Verduzco known as Mama Rosa demanded 70000 pesos 5400 for his release She said Jose Antonio often barely spoke in front of the shelter employees but said once that he wanted his mother to suffer the same thing he was suffering there Officials have said the homes residents were kept in deplorable conditions fed rotten food and made to sleep on the floor among rats ticks and fleas Raquel Briones Gallegos a 44yearold housewife said she tried to get her 20yearold son Luis Oropeza Briones out of the shelter in April They ran me out of the house and said insulting things Briones Gallegos said He would call her on the phone in recent months saying that he wanted to leave to please get him out of there she said Shelter residents were still being kept at the home while officials look for places to transfer them Federal authorities said they were ensuring that the residents were being fed properly and youngsters were also being checked by doctors Police and soldiers standing guard outside let small groups of relatives in for brief visits For some families it was their first time inside in months Prosecutors said early statements given by residents contain harrowing tales of sexual abuse beatings

the residents were so malnourished police couldnt even determine their age Victim No 4 said she had been held in the group home against her will since she was 18 said Tomas Zeron federal chief of criminal investigations She was sexually abused by one of the administrators and got pregnant as a result of the abuse The same person beat her to cause an abortion beating her in the stomach on several occasions Two boys told investigators a male staff member had forced them to engage in oral sex and warned one of the boys that he would kill him and sell his organs if he refused Zeron said In total the police raid on Tuesday freed six babies 154 girls 278 boys 50 women and 109 men from the filthy shelter Nine employees of the shelter in Zamora a town in the western state of Michoacan have been detained and are being questioned Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said some other employees apparently tried to protect the children There are statements that truly hurt that make you angry he said But there are others that save your faith in humanity about those who truly converted themselves into protectors of the children Authorities have said the shelter had been highly regarded and the government sometimes gave money or even entrusted children to the shelter It was often visited by politicians and local media published photographs of the owner with former President Vicente Fox former Michoacan Gov Leonel Godoy and other officials Murillo Karam said the home was subject to government oversight but the institutions prestige may have made the inspections less intense The investigation began after five parents filed complaints last year with authorities because they werent allowed to see their children at the home One was a woman who grew up and gave birth

Emporia Kansas Gazette A key contest in the fight for control of the Senate could turn on the outcome of an arcane legal argument Monday over whether Democrats must field a candidate against struggling Kansas Republican Sen Pat Roberts The case centers on whether a state election law requires Democrats to pick a new candidate after exnominee Chad Taylor withdrew earlier this month or whether the party can choose not to replace him Some Democrats pushed Taylor out viewing independent candidate Greg Orman as the stronger rival for Roberts and hoping to avoid a split in the antiRoberts vote that would help the GOP incumbent stay in officeTaylor had to petition the Kansas Supreme Court to force Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach a Roberts supporter to remove the Democrats name from the Nov 4 ballotKobach has said the case must be resolved by Oct 1 so that counties can print thousands of ballots and people can begin early voting from Oct 15 He said his goal is enforcing state election law exactly as its writtenA threejudge panel in Shawnee County District Court must decide whether the language means all vacancies must be filled or whether the law simply spells out who fills a vacancy if a party wishes to do it

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/09/20/pope-chooses-blase-cupich-for-chicago-archbishop/,Sept 20 2014 Newly appointed Archbishop of Chicago Archbishop Blase Cupich speaks to the media after it was announced that he would replace Cardinal Francis George retiring leader of the Chicago Catholic Archdiocese during a news conference in Chicago AP As the leader of two American dioceses Roman Catholic Bishop Blase Cupich has staked out a firm position in the middle of the road He has spoken out against samesex marriage and against conservative hostility toward gay rights advocates He has opposed abortion while urging parishioners and priests to have patience not disdain for those who disagree And he has criticized fellow US bishops who threatened to shut down religious charities instead of pursuing a compromise with the White House over health care policies that go against Catholic teaching     On Saturday Pope Francis named Cupich as the next archbishop of Chicago sending a strong signal about the direction that the pontiff is taking the church Cupich will succeed Cardinal Francis George 77 an aggressive defender of orthodoxy who once said he expected his successors in Chicago to be martyred in the face of hostility toward Christianity I think what Francis is trying to do with his appointments in both the United States and around the world is to moderate the conversation and get us past the culture wars and the ideologues said Christopher Bellitto a church historian at Kean University in New Jersey Francis is not trying to balance a lurch to the right with a lurch to the left Hes trying to build up the big middle so we can have conversations and not arguments The Chicago appointment is Francis first major mark on American Catholic leadership George is two years past the churchs retirement age and is suffering from cancer The Chicago archdiocese is the nations thirdlargest and among its most important serving more than 22 million parishioners Chicago archbishops are usually elevated to cardinal and are therefore eligible to vote for the next pope Both George and his predecessor Cardinal Joseph Bernardin had served as presidents of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops Cupich will be installed as archbishop in November A native of Omaha Nebraska and one of nine children the 65yearold Cupich has served in a wide range of roles within the church He has been a parish pastor a high school instructor and president of a seminary After earning degrees in the US and in Rome he worked at the papal embassy in Washington and as a bishop has led several committees for the US bishops conference For a few years he led the bishops committee on the child protection reforms adopted amid the clergy sex abuse scandal In his current posting as head of the Diocese of Spokane Washington Cupich inherited the fallout from a previous bishops decision to seek bankruptcy protection over sex abuse claims He started a mediation effort that has drawn praise from local attorneys for victims At a news conference Saturday in Chicago he cited his familys immigrant history  his four grandparents were from Croatia  in a call for immigration reform Every day we delay is a day too long he said As bishop in Rapid City South Dakota starting in 1998 then in Spokane he has worked extensively with immigrant and Native American communities About 44 percent of parishioners in the Chicago archdiocese are Latino Cupich first became a bishop as the American church leadership began taking a more combative approach to culture war issues under St John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI Yet he struck a tone that reflects what Francis has emphasized for the church a focus on mercy over hotbutton policies that the pope says has driven away Catholics In 2011 Cupich told the antiabortion committee and priests in Spokane that he wanted an educational not confrontational approach to the issue He warned for having disdain for those who support abortion rights The next year during the runup to the Washington state referendum that ultimately recognized gay marriage Cupich repeatedly underscored church teaching that marriage should be between a man and a woman But he also wrote at length to parishioners about the suffering of gays and lesbians because of antigay prejudice He condemned violence and bullying that has led some gay teens to suicide I also want to be very clear that in stating our position the Catholic Church has no tolerance for the misuse of this moment to incite hostility toward homosexual persons or promote an agenda that is hateful and disrespectful of their human dignity Cupich wrote After the Obama administration issued a requirement for birth control coverage for employers Cupich said faithaffiliated charities should never be forced to provide services that the church considers morally objectionable However he condemned threats by some US church leaders that they would shut down social service agencies over the Affordable Care Act These kind of scare tactics and worsecase scenario predictions are uncalled for he wrote in a letter to diocesan employees I am confident we can find a way to move

 Leave em laughing     DEMS LOOK TO NEW COLORADO VOTING LAW TO SAVE SENATE
Colorado is the key to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reids firewall It along with Democratheld seats in Iowa and North Carolina is part of the last line of defense against Republican majority If they lose any of these three seats it would be hard to imagine Reid  Co holding the Senate And right now things arent looking good for the blue team in Colorado After an abysmal campaign by Democratic incumbent Sen Mark Udall Republican challenger Rep Cory Gardner holds a lead of nearly 3 points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls And any incumbent polling at an average of 44 percent the week before the election would ordinarily look like a sure loser But Colorados election is going to be anything but ordinary The combination of sameday registration and mailin ballots also has many on the right worried about outright fraud in what could be a razorthin vote to decide a razorthin Senate majority Even without fraud though Republicans have reason to worry

The latest NBC NewsMarist Poll gives Rep Cory Gardner RColo 46 percent to Democratic Sen Mark Udalls 45 percent

Wild West  Colorado is making its first foray into voting by mail leaving just a handful of inperson polling places around the state Similar moves in Washington and Oregon have helped cement those states as Democratic bastions after decades of dabbling in occasional Republicanism Instead of having to physically take unenthusiastic voters to the polls in vans Democrats could just catch them at home and get them to sign on the line and mail in their votes But the specifics of Colorados law as David Drucker explains go far beyond even whats been done in the Northwest As Democrats work hard to fire up Hispanic voters with talk of a mass amnesty granted by President Obama after the election Colorado also remains the only state on the midterm map to boast a large enough Latino population to provide an opportunity for Obamastyle demographic dicing to be successful As Democrats demonstrated in 2010 for Reid an organizing surge can help save an incumbent down in the polls

Not flatfooted  Republicans though have learned some lessons in Colorado Aside from actually competing for Latino votes the GOP has also gone all in on the votebymail system With over a half million ballots received according to the most recent figures from Colorados secretary of state election offices have tallied 62000 more ballots from Republican voters than Democrats That puts the GOP in the lead with 44 percent to Dems 32 percent hardly where anyone expected the race to be given the incredible sums that Democrats have spent on advertising and organization Remember that Udall unlike some other endangered Dems is actually very liberal Hes not running against the president hes mostly been talking about ladyparts But Republican operative remain very nervous that despite a new focus in the party on pushing early voting the state is just too friendly to Democratic base turnout efforts with the new law One top GOPer told Fox News First that he thinks Garner needs to be up by more than 3 points in preelection polls to actually pull out the win

AP Former President Bill Clinton is headlining an evening rally in Aurora today Hell be promoting Udall along with Gov John Hickenlooper and congressional hopeful Andrew Romanoff

Knock knock  Whatever the case the new voting regime provides Democrats unprecedented opportunities to drive turnout even when their voters are not feeling enthusiastic Its one thing to have to go wait in line to vote but quite another to just sign on the dotted line when the party canvasser comes to your door

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/07/18/latest-bill-clinton-papers-show-concerns-over-bin-laden-response-to-haiti-in-14/,WASHINGTON  President Bill Clinton asked advisers for more information on Osama bin Laden in 1998 after flagging a newspaper story according to records from the Clinton White House that were released Friday The records also detail consideration of military action in Haiti in 1994 and preparations for Supreme Court nomination hearings The National Archives released about 1000 pages of previously restricted documents from Clintons two terms part of about 20000 pages of Clinton records that have been disseminated since February The papers which are stored at the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock Arkansas have received interest as former first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton considers another presidential bid     The latest batch also covers the Supreme Court nominations of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer the appellate court nomination of future Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor security planning for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta and the 2000 presidential campaign of Al Gore the then vice president A look at the documents ___ BIN LADEN In one file referencing bin Laden Clinton urgently asked his top national security aide whether the CIA overstated the involvement of the terrorist leader in the August 1998 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania In his April 1999 scrawled note Clinton referred to a New York Times story from that month that suggested US intelligence officials had gathered no firsthand evidence of bin Ladens involvement If this article is right the CIA sure overstated its case to me   what are the facts Clinton asked national security adviser Samuel Sandy Berger Clintons note prompted a flurry of replies from Berger counterterrorism coordinator Richard Clarke and aide Daniel Benjamin but those responses were withheld apparently for national security concerns Government prosecutors later indicted bin Laden among a group of alQaida leaders and operatives for their involvement in the simultaneous bombings which killed 213 people in Nairobi and 85 in Dar es Salaam Six terror associates were convicted and are serving life terms in US prisons Bin Laden the mastermind of the Sept 11 attacks was still under indictment when he was killed by US forces in Pakistan in May 2011 ___ HAITI In 1994 Clintons team weighed taking action in Haiti to restore democracy and to remove military leaders who staged a coup Congress opposed any intervention and Clintons aides debated how to act without lawmakers The operation is likely to involve low intensity and short conflict Given the consent of President JeanBertrand Artistide and the limited capability of the Armed Forces of Haiti such action does not intrude upon the power of Congress to declare war national security aide Tony Lake wrote to White House counsel Lloyd Cutler In another memo Lake Cutler and Pat Griffin urged Clinton to take action without congressional approval They said that simply informing Congress immediately before military strikes was sufficient Clinton deployed armed forces in September 1994 As some US military members were in the air en route to the island Haitian military leaders agreed to step down and they left the country in October Aristide resumed power ___ BREYER and GINSBURG NOMINATIONS The files show the behindthescenes planning that took place to win Senate confirmation of Ginsburg and Breyers Supreme Court nomination After Justice Byron White announced his retirement in 1993 Clintons team noted that Senate leaders particularly Chairman Joe Biden have previously made strong statements about their desire to be consulted on Supreme Court nominations Ginsburgs papers include a list of recommended witnesses    sent by her husband Washington attorney Martin Ginsburg    along with talking points for an unnamed adviser playing Sen William Cohen a Maine Republican in preparation sessions Before the hearings White House aide Ron Klain wrote that Ginsburgs preparation showed she viewed the White House as having a stake in presenting her as a moderate and in getting along well with the Senate she sees her interests as being herself preserving her dignity and promoting her independence When Clinton nominated Breyer in 1994 White House aide David Dreyer suggested the confirmation process could be used as a vehicle to put the President and his staff in the best possible light Dreyer also recommended shutting down critics such as Sen Howard Metzenbaum an Ohio Democrat Both Ginsburg and Breyer were confirmed with broad support ___ SOTOMAYOR Clinton nominated Sotomayor then a federal district court judge in New York to the appellate bench in 1997 In one letter Sotomayor thanks White House associate counsel Peter Erichsen for their spring 1996 meeting writing It may appear strange that a meeting of our type could be described as enjoyable but I do describe it as such Sotomayor was recommended by a group of White House aides in a March 1997 memo describing her as well known and well respected not only for her compelling life story but also for her legal acumen and work ethic She was eventually confirmed in 1998 and joined the Supreme Court in 2009 ___ 1996 SUMMER OLYMPICS A June 1996 memo from top aides to Clinton and Gore detailed White House efforts to oversee security in Atlanta for the Summer Olympics Games    as well as to lay plans for Clinton administration efforts to tap into the heavily televised events successes Saying the federal government had a considerable stake in the events the aides wrote that the Olympics will be a daily focus at the White House In a nod to the growing importance of instant media and communication responses the aides devised daily meetings of communications aides to respond to goodnews developments The key is to be able to be spontaneous in celebrating successes at the gates by planning for such spontaneity wrote White House chief of staff Mack McLarty and Gore aide Ron Klain The 1996 games proved to be a mixed success A record 197 nations participated but there were complaints about crowding and commercialism A bomb set off in Atlantas Centennial Olympic Park caused two deaths and 111 injuries Eric Rudolph an antiabortion activist pleaded guilty in 2005 to the bombing and is serving a life prison term ___ GORE CAMPAIGN In July 2000 White House deputy chief of staff Steven Ricchetti    now Vice President Joe Bidens chief of staff    wrote to colleagues that they would have to take vacation or unpaid leave if they wanted to attend that years Democratic convention Added White House counsel Beth Nolan With few exceptions you must attend the convention on your own time Senior White House staff members were stern in warning aides that they should not use their official positions to help Gores campaign Specifically no staffers could make fundraising calls or have political events at the White house The simplest rule to follow is the commonsense practice that anything obviously political that involves the use of resources should be done by the campaign even if doing it here can be legally justified senior White House lawyers wrote to colleagues ___ Associated Press writers Stephen Braun Philip Elliott and Connie Cass contributed to this

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/06/26/gary-oldman-apologizes-defending-gibson-baldwin/,This is a rush transcript from The Five June 26 2014 This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated ANDREA TANTAROS COHOST Hello everyone Im Andrea Tantaros along with Bob Beckel Eric Bolling Dana Perino and a carrot     Its 5 oclock in New York City and this is The Five MUSIC TANTAROS Apologies are hard to come by in Washington But in Hollywood its become a new trend to say Im sorry The latest celeb on an apology tour is after Gary Oldman He defended antiSemitic rants by Mel Gibson and some ugly words from Alec Baldwin Baldwin was lashing out at hypocrisy and political correctness in Hollywood to Playboy magazine Activists and the media now pressured him And within 48 hours he	was apologizing on Jimmy Kimmel BEGIN VIDEO CLIP GARY OLDMAN ACTOR I said some things that were poorly considered	And once I had seen it in print I could see that it was offensive From my heart I am profoundly profoundly sorry And Im deeply apologetic Im a public figure I should be an example and an inspiration And	Im an Ahole and Im 56 and I should know better END VIDEO CLIP TANTAROS OK I understand the point he was trying to make Greg about the political correctness But he did try and defend the indefensible with the Mel Gibson rant So do you think it was smart for him to come out and apologize GREG GUTFELD COHOST I dont see how this was offensive at all It was in Playboy Nobody reads playboy How did that  LAUGHTER DANA PERINO COHOST Speak for yourself GUTFELD Well yes except for you Yes you know what it is I said this before Its important to be right but its more important to be persuasively right And I think he ruined a good point which is that we all have unsavory politically incorrect thoughts And the fact that were very preoccupied with attitudes and not action and feeling and not fact is very dangerous and every apology somehow reflects a hapless timid America that used to be bold But he went too far and his outrageousness ruined what was a good point So even though you hate the politically incorrect it doesnt mean you have to defend him Im tired of these apologies We need to start a business called mix	sorry which does it for you Like McDonalds but for apologies PERINO You can pay for it TANTAROS What about an app You could make a lot of money with an app that apologize  GUTFELD Exactly Or just preemptive apology TANTAROS And your first customer is sitting to my left literally and figuratively BOB BECKEL COHOST You know Im thinking about that Steve McQueen never would have apologized There are a lot of people who  think about the actors back in the 50s and 60s They would  Elvis Presley wouldnt have apologized for something like that But the point  TANTAROS But why do you think he did Bob Your brothers an actor	in Congress BECKEL I think he got a lot of pressure  I mean being in Hollywood when youre talking about antiSemitic remarks there is a very very acute reaction to it Its happened to people I know I think people said look 75 percent of the studios here have ownership is Jewish and you better be careful what you say if you want your own career TANTAROS Why do some people get away with it Alec Baldwin has made homophobic allegedly statements that have been inflammatory Some actors are perceived as getting away with it and others are not Why BECKEL I dont  Gibson went through pretty much hell when he did that You can carry this over into politics in a way It always amazes me why I think apologies in politics makes sense because they always try to cover themselves up by saying  and get themselves out so far theyre	screwed The best politician just say Im sorry TANTAROS But they never say it Dana We were talking about this	Can you think of an example of working for any candidate or any politician I couldnt do it today anyone I worked with that actually came out and said Im sorry Whats so bad about saying Im sorry What happens when they do say Im sorry like in sex scandals PERINO Well if youre up for reelection and you probably think that as soon as you say youre sorry especially if you say it on tape or on video that that is going to be the campaign ad that runs against you for the next two or six  every six years if youre in the Senate But I think that this all goes back to that you remember the book that everything I need to know I learned in kindergarten By the time youre 5 years old youve been taught by your parents if you do something wrong and you say youre sorry that absolves you of any more berating about it Then your parents are not going to continue to beat you over the head with it So I think in some ways our instincts are to apologize because we are taught and maybe thats a good thing right just for civility sake there is a way for us to get past comments that are said even if theyre said in Playboy or Esquire like Phil Robertson Remember This is an interesting for me theres parallels here where people do interviews they must be very good interviewers because they get people comfortable They start saying whats on their mind They talk  GUTFELD Get them drunk PEIRNO  they use their inside voice Now all a sudden four months later its like that didnt look so good in print and they end up having to apologize TANTAROS The difference too Eric is typically when most people apologize and they do it as sincerely as say Gary Oldman did I think that was sincere they dont repeat the behavior But in Washington with the IRS you have a woman who has a history of targeting conservatives dating back to when she was running an elections board Lois Lerner in Illinois Never apologize She keeps doing the behavior Is it arrogant Is it that she thinks its justified I mean people in Washington they dont even apologize this they just keep repeating the	bad way ph ERIC BOLLING COHOST Right I think thats  there it is right there in a nutshell If its repeated you know theres something there there If its done once or twice  I mean there are a lot of  Ive had to apologize on air Bob weve all had to kind of apologize But you dont do it again You learn from your mistakes and move on	And if you forgive if someone says something thats offensive and they apologize accept the apology The thing with Alec Baldwin and we  you know took him apart here because it kept happening It wasnt once it wasnt twice it was five times He was consistently going after female reporters saying derogatory remarks about gays and whatnot So it was a repeat offender Can I just make something out You make a very good point Matt Lauer today did you see the interview with the CEO of GM Female CEO of GM He asks her hey if youre a CEO of such a big important company do you still have time to be a good mother Now everyone kind of looked back but again its NBC its Matt Lauer and it kind of went away If I had done that interview or Greg had done it or anyone at this table had done that with a female CEO of GM a conservative host asking that question to a female the Republican war on women here it is again in the media Will he retract that or clarify what he meant What you cant be a mother and a CEO TANTAROS I agree I think thats a fair question to ask and a lot of people are asking it because of Marissa Mayer the Yahoo CEO falling asleep and missing a meeting A lot of people buzzing I mean its a	different topic but can women be mothers and CEOs GUTFELD But can I  TANTAROS Yes GUTFELD But this thing about what is offensive I dont think  I 	 maybe Im in the minority Im not offended by anything Im not offended by anything that is said to me I guess except that the fact that people are offended or outraged by words But they arent offended or outraged by actions The symbolic rage is easier and more attainable than sincere rage about horrible things that are happening A feminist in America will come out about something that you said like that Theyll be mad about that But they will completely ignore female circumcision in Islamic countries because that  they ignore action because thats too hard So they go after words That to me is actually an act that is offensive	Words were so hurt you dont die from words PERINO I thought of another reason why in politics its different than for somebody like Gary Oldman So hes dealing with his career and fan base and possible you know recriminations for his words But on Capitol Hill or in Washington the IRS lets take Lois Lerner as an example what happens if she says shes sorry instead of pleading the Fifth That means she could be prosecuted and could end up either doing some jail time or maybe you know paying some sort of outrageous fine that would prevent other people from doing it again So I think in Washington that might be a little bit of the	difference that theyre afraid of prosecution BECKEL Let me say very quickly I had a candidate for Congress she was an incumbent Ike Andrews from North Carolina He had gotten sober for a year and he got on this thing about highway drunk driving that was his big issue Hes driving back to North Carolina and he stops at the liquor store and gets drunk gets picked up for drunk driving The story came out that he had seven DWIs I said youve got to apologize He said no What are you going to do He finally got in front of the camera and apologized and won People said that was a sincere apology and he did the right thing Where other	politicians for some reason they talk their way out of it TANTAROS Dont you think from a political standpoint if politicians like say a Bill Clinton came out and said I am sincerely sorry  because youre right when they sincerely apologize were a very forgiving country especially about sex scandals and that type of thing but they dont do it It would be an interesting way to turn it around on the Republicans to say dont you preach forgiveness I mean a lot of Christians thats what its based on wouldnt that be as a political strategy a way for people to say I said Im sorry youre not going to forgive me BECKEL Thats an example you could come up with Clinton I mean if Clinton had said Im sorry I made a mistake Ive embarrassed my wife my	daughter end of the story But he couldnt bring himself to do it BOLLING A week thing weve been doing  Ive been doing every Friday the first one was Chris Daughtry Now I put him out there for he did something up that I thought was kind of egregious on FOX  FRIENDS	that morning Let me tell you he did a four or fiveminute apology video put it out there I think it went viral for a while And it was a sincere apology You know something Hes more popular now after making what I perceive as a mistake apologizing hes got a huge fan base who say that was standup That was great Its OK to say youre sorry Just we have to also be forgiving too when you hear it too GUTFELD The thing is though what makes you say youre sorry is pressure So when  whether youre a conservative whether youre a celebrity the pressure is applied on you to say youre sorry There is no pressure to apologize in many of our modern political leaders like President Obama Mainly because the media is so pliant it makes pizza dough look like granite Theres nobody actually asking for responsibility in our government TANTAROS Thats true GUTFELD But if Alec Baldwin does something stupid or if Mel Gibson or if this British guy whose name escapes me  Gary Oldman if he says something that everybody will jump on it but not jump on the IRS  TANTAROS But why Greg because to your point what theyre doing in Washington is far worse Theyre doing  I mean youve used puns before you know theyll apologize for sexual acts that theyve committed against their family but they wont commit against legitimate crimes against the people who elect them that theyre elected to serve Is it because no one cares I mean Dana  GUTFELD The  TANTAROS Yes I mean  GUTFELD If the modern culture is more aroused by personal infractions than by bureaucratic force Bureaucratic force is boring which makes it more dangerous The things that kill you are the things that are boring The things that are exciting

like people failing BOLLING Or we want to see how they handle being called out right	Some people do it well Some people dont do it well BECKEL You know I promise I would never talk about this subject so I wont use the word But heres a classic example If Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama came out and said we blame this on a film and it turned out to be wrong end of story GUTFELD Thats my point All they had to do was admit it TANTAROS But they did apologize to the Pakistanis remember They made those commercials Dana and they apologized to the Pakistanis not the American public They do apologize sometimes its wrong BECKEL Its taught by consultants almost automatically never admit	youre wrong which is crazy TANTAROS Dana you said earlier from a PR perspective it stops the	bleeding I mean think about when someones truly apologized to you PERINO To apologize the headlines  theyre going to stop It does tend to go away I would say also if people are going to do interviews with these big magazines that their staff or they themselves need to listen to your inner instincts and not say stupid stuff GUTFELD I dont want an apology  PERINO It really shouldnt be that hard GUTFELD I dont want an apology from the IRS I want action I want jail time BECKEL You guys know when Tylenol came out in the shelves theyve got that poisoned Tylenol and their CEO gets every piece of advice from public relations got on the air and said Im sorry about this Were	going to pull every one of them off the shelves and it went away PERINO Except for Harold Burson who run that the head of Burson Marsteller and that was his advice to the CEO BECKEL Was it PERINO Yes TANTAROS And now I have to apologize to the control room because	theyve been yelling at me to tease So Im sorry Next this is not a joke the

decision in Iran whos not following Iranian soccer PERINO Well hopefully its not Iran that hes talking about Like the Germans possibly the Germans BECKEL Yes TANTAROS When I read that tweet the first thing I thought is oh boy the Clintons have officially declared war on President Obama George Stephanopoulos knew what the president was getting at But the fact that the former attack dog for the Clinton machine tweets out something that we are talking about making the president if you dont assume the goodwill that Dana and Bob have given him or I have given them is true theyre saying I think the Clintons are saying listen this is a presidency that is sinking And we are going to distance ourself from it And youre going to start to see the Carvilles the Begalas the Stephanopoulos  CROSSTALK PERINO I dont think George put that much thought into it TANTAROS Oh I definitely do And you saw the Ed Klein excerpt from his new book basically saying that Hillary Clinton personally blames Benghazi on the president I predict youre gong to see Hillary Clinton start to distance herself not just on immigration like we saw but on the VA scandal the IRS scandal and Ill bet you see some Clintonfriendly	Democrats start the investigation PERINO Can I point something on the Hillary and the Benghazi thing and that Ed Klein excerpt where it says that shes blaming him and distancing I dont think it will bear out because its several days later when she goes to Dover and she repeats the lie to the families  TANTAROS I agree but theyre going to try I agree But theyre	going to try BOLLING

know people like that BOLLING You do Your thoughts on the moral decay of America soccer TANTAROS Well just think about how  and I dont mind soccer But think about how unAmerican what happened today is They lost but yet they win So even if you lose you get to advance to the next round Its so different In our sport if you lose you lose youre done BOLLING Greg we lost to Germany but we moved on So this is a great day in the Obama administration We get to move on and we dont have	to apologize to another country GUTFELD Its beautiful The World Cup should be called the rest of the worlds cup For America its like NASCAR goes But I will say this Ive got to defend soccer and you have to defend soccer because it exists because all you need is a ball which is why there are so many countries that find joy in it because its not like America where you can afford yachts and race cars and football helmets	All you need is a ball So thats why the world stops Theyre watching it because they grew up playing it because all they needed was a ball Or in some countries like Pakistan or Afghanistan a goat head BOLLING Or in some radical Muslim countries a human head GUTFELD Yes BOLLING Dana you want

Bills worked a days work Sos Martha sos Brian all right Steve Hayes I guess hes not doing SPECIAL REPORT if he was tossing some back we wont out Steve Hayes But my problem is he was encouraging the German coach people to play hooky and not go to work and watch the World Cup which I think it is	disturbing in New York to walk by bars and watching people not working PERINO But theyre buying stuff TANTAROS It reminds me of Europe  CROSSTALK PERINO Theyre having a little bit of fun Fun killers GUTFELD We do this with the Super Bowl and World Series Come on BOLLING Yes its great for business

really deep tease here Are you ready All right Only 70 days until real football starts BECKEL Yes BOLLING Coming up some controversial rulings handed down by the Supreme Court this week Were going to weigh in on them when The Five continues COMMERCIAL BREAK BASH The Supreme Court handed down some major decisions this week including a unanimous one striking down President Obamas recess appointments Yesterday the high court also ruled that police dont have the right to look through a suspects cell phone after an arrest unless they get a warrant Privacy advocates are happy but law enforcement is not BEGIN VIDEO CLIP UNIDENTIFIED MALE What value is a cell phone if someones arrested ANDREW SMITH LAPD COMMANDER Youre thinking about gang members or you know gang members with guns Sometimes well find out  be able to find out who their associates are Maybe find out some information about the crimes that theyve just committed If we arrest someone for robbery and hes got some associates it would be helpful to know who he was talking on the phone with earlier that day who he was texting and what the content of those were END VIDEO CLIP BASH Chief Justice John Roberts defended the decision writing that a cell phone search would typically expose to the government far more than the most exhaustive search of a house A phone not also contains in digital form many sensitive records previously found in the home it also contains a broad array of private information never found in a home in any form And Andrea I can see the policemans point of view because their job is to get bad guys But I also think that the court made the right decision here that the phone has changed Its no longer just something that you use to make a call Your whole life is on here which is why you guard it with your life TANTAROS I think the court what it did today should be very encouraging to most citizens Because the Fourth Amendment is very clear in the Constitution Its designed to be a hand tied behind the back of big government And this is at a time when progressives  progressives are trying to seize more control more control So the courts doing its job Its reaffirming peoples civil rights And weve seen this with the court I mean its actually doing the job that it was intended to do And big issues Not just little small due process cases This is high school history stuff thats going to be in history books going forward And I dont think its a coincidence that this is happening If you look Dana also at the other decisions today too where they allowed people to protest outside of abortion clinics in Massachusetts weve seen the court ruling on the Citizens United case This court more and more is reaffirming peoples civil liberties reaffirming the Bill of Rights and I think people should be very excited at the direction that the court is doing Its doing its job Its enforcing the Fourth Amendment Otherwise we would have the government kicking down our door They would be able to do unlawful searches and they would be able to search through your phone They would love to be able to do it but the courts there to stop them BASH Bob you run hot and cold on the Supreme Court What are your feelings today BECKEL I give them a lot of credit I think Roberts is right	First of all if they get into my cell phone PERINO I cant imagine BECKEL  it would be GUTFELD They would actually catch something BECKEL Probably But you know it is true What this policeman was saying was it may have been a gang member he may have  well if you have that information then go get a warrant Right Otherwise you dont have any right to get in somebodys cell phone Its ridiculous Again he said maybe hes got friends whove got guns Well fine	If hes got friends and known associates who have guns maybe get a warrant for it BASH I think that the polices point Eric is that they want  theres an immediacy of trying to get something done immediately to try to prevent other bad things from happening But I assume youre happy with the decision BOLLING And I am Youre right Dana Listen Id like to give the law enforcement all the tools that they constitutionally deserve and can use and important what is constitutionally I think the court did a great job of upholding saying You cant go into the cell phones I just wish and they say you need a warrant I just wish they would kind of relook at what the NSA is claiming to do saying its a blanket warrant for everyone who is a Verizon customer or a TMobile customer and that accounts for everyone I think the individual is important and being violated with the blanket BASH Anyone here have a  you dont even have a dissenting point of view on this do you GUTFELD No Its the right call legally But you have to be ready to handle the consequences Judges have to be ready to handle lots of search warrants A phone is no longer a phone anymore Its your sock drawer diary locked basement Your video library So I get it It just means although youve added another hurdle its probably right to add this hurdle but youve got to be ready to handle the consequences because we make laws often in a vacuum And they arent in a vacuum TANTAROS Are you ready to handle the consequences when they penetrate your locked basement what they will find GUTFELD Well the things theyll find  well they wont leave TANTAROS Or the people the coworkers they will find GUTFELD Its a trap Yes PERINO Ahead the EPA has an internal pollution problem And it takes the term government waste to a whole new level GUTFELD Oh PERINO Im going to leave it there Ill let Greg fill you in on the dirty details COMMERCIAL BREAK GUTFELD So in some places like Asia The Five airs during the dinner hour so I must warn you that the next topic is unsavory So if you have a weak constitution I urge you to kill the volume and look to my left at soothing footage of slow loris eating rice Adorable So this monologue is about the EPA or rather the EpoohA The Denver office is urging employees not to use its hallways as a place to do a dodo Yes the people in charge of fighting pollution are propagating poohlution The website called Government Executive discovered an email sent to its staff which mentions incidents including clogging toilets with paper towels and a hallway littered with human waste The agency actually called a workplace violence expert who says this is a health and safety risk Behold our government a bureaucracy so burdened by idiocy that they must call in an expert to tell you that defiling a hallway is bad No wonder we went from No 1 to No 2 And how  why did they call it workplace violence I guess if the shooting at Ft Hood is workplace violence why not pooping in a hallway	This is also yet another agency that lost subpoenaed emails due to a computer crash Sound familiar The IRS the ATF the DOJ the VA the EPA its an eye chart of incompetence Everywhere you look in the Obama administration you realize so much of it is crap In this case however you can even step in it Maybe they should appoint a poop czar PERINO That was a good job GUTFELD That would be a good job I would be really good at it Dana PERINO Although I would call it somebody else GUTFELD Yes you would Dana how can they police our environment when they cant police their own PERINO Well I think its because government is clearly too big unmanageable and its quickly losing the confidence of the American people whose taxpayer dollars are going to pay for people that actually would do that in a hallway and then just incredibly they call in a workplace violence expert Im glad you made the point of Ft Hood I mean this is  they said Ft Hood was a workplace violence GUTFELD Yes PERINO  situation That basically means that theyre equal GUTFELD Yes Exactly Eric the EPA also lost these emails that were belonging to a former employee due to a crashed hard drive PERINO Doodoo GUTFELD Due to The guy  by the way the guy that lost his e mails hes in New Zealand now Hes gone PERINO Im surprised not in Moscow BOLLING Maybe he has Lois Lerners hard drive or emails GUTFELD Yes BOLLING The EPA besides spending tens of billions of dollars of our money they regulate businesses and they cost us hundreds of billions of dollars in our economy The GSA remember that scandal where the guy is drinking wine at PERINO Conferences BOLLING  conferences How about the IRS making videos of Gilligans Island on whether  why you should pay your taxes I mean youre right its just bureaucratic  when you have a 3 trillion mess going on youre going to find stuff like this So look defund them GUTFELD Yes BOLLING If theres one to defund defund the EPA That would be  that would be No 1 GUTFELD Yes Bob BECKEL If you dont mind me saying because of the EPA and because of the Clean Air and Water Act we have cleaner water in this country and cleaner air than we had TANTAROS Thank you Richard Nixon Thank you Richard Nixon	Right GUTFELD Theyre not flushing BECKEL Thats right Richard Nixon did do that He created the EPA And I congratulate him on that Now that hes dead I guess But heres the point I dont know how Dana you equate a bunch of poop in a hallway with big government That  I know big governments a problem for everybody But theres probably a lot of places  maybe not a lot but Ive been in some joints that theres been that stuff around PERINO My point is when Greg runs through the list of all the places where theres complete mismanagement and corruption and questions of how they are spending taxpayer money that that is when government has become too big BECKEL OK GUTFELD See it  weve talked about bloated government over and over again They must be bloated if theyre doing this TANTAROS Theres so many puns GUTFELD I know TANTAROS  that are running through my brain GUTFELD I know TANTAROS  that Im just resisting When Bob says how can you not compare bloated government to pooping in a hallway How can you not	There are so many ways to do it And to Danas point they compare Ft Hood workplace violence GUTFELD I did TANTAROS Oh you did GUTFELD Im saying that was workplace violence and then they get	workplace TANTAROS But thats the problem They compare something as atrocious with pooping in a hallway And then people hear the pooping in the hallway story and they just assume that everyone in Washington is bad and thats why people dont care and theyre busy taking Buzzfeed quizzes and watching soccer But I do sympathize with the EPA on one thing Every workplace has a bathroom terrorist GUTFELD Yes thats TANTAROS And its a problem I mean its not a workplace violence situation but its a problem BECKEL You probably havent been in one of these places but theres a lot of crack houses where you could find GUTFELD Thats great Bob OK PERINO Youre so right Andrea TANTAROS Right BOLLING Theres an easy face to this GUTFELD Theyre yelling at me TANTAROS Am I right Im right BOLLING  a paper trail GUTFELD Ive got a paper trail Nice A father of a missing boy finds out about the fate of his son on live TV and is stunned to learn where he was found Thats up next COMMERCIAL BREAK BECKEL The old saying goes if its live TV anything can happen	Just look at us Last night that adage was proven true While conducting a live interview with Nancy Grace Charles Botheull was informed that his son had been found after missing for 11 days Exciting news right Well heres the twist BEGIN VIDEO CLIP NANCY GRACE HLN HOST Charlie we are getting reports that your son has been found in your basement Sir Mr Botheull are you CHARLES BOTHEULL FATHER OF MISSING SON What GRACE Yes we are getting reports that your son has been found alive in your basement BOTHEULL What END VIDEO CLIP BECKEL Thats unbelievable And the father denies any knowledge of his sons whereabouts BEGIN VIDEO CLIP BOTHEULL For anybody to imply that I somehow knew that my son was in the basement is absurd and its wrong I love my son END VIDEO CLIP BECKEL All right Well this is  first of all I think it was a Saturday Night Live scene with somebody playing Nancy Grace But maybe its just true Maybe the kid was running around within the basement got out of the basement I mean you know GUTFELD How long was the kid gone BECKEL Eleven days GUTFELD Eleven days Yes this aint right Theres something stinky going on here By the way Nancy Grace is a human car alarm BOLLING So you know GUTFELD I dont know BOLLING Everyones like pointing the finger at this guy like oh maybe hes doing this so he could be on TV What if Nancy Grace set it up BECKEL Let me ask you about this If you had to tape a gut reaction about what happened do you think the old man knew he was down there PERINO Not necessarily I think maybe the kid was hiding BECKEL Yes thats right GUTFELD For that long BOLLING I cant believe they brought dogs in BECKEL And they couldnt find him PERINO Or maybe he really wanted to be on TV I mean I can understand BECKEL The kid was down there right And the Detroit police came in with dogs The FBI came in with dogs Nobody found the kid down there	And then they found him a few days later He was behind a barricade where they had a bunch of food So maybe the kid was pulling a scam TANTAROS It sounds like  I agree with Greg theres something more sinister at play here Because this kid ran away from home two years ago	It sounds like hes hiding from his father which makes me wonder why	What is the father doing to him The one twist though is the barricade he put up Police say it doesnt look like he could have formed it himself That to me doesnt make any sense But I have to say I love Nancy Grace I do GUTFELD That makes one of you TANTAROS I know But I just think shes really funny and good at her job BECKEL She appeared PERINO Good interview BOLLING No shes all good I think she headlines Shes fun I just dont love her drama though Sir youve just been informed Weve found your son in your basement TANTAROS Sir Sir BECKEL That must have been a really  I mean this guy  he looked to me like he was shocked Honestly He didnt look to me like he knew his kid was in the basement Did he GUTFELD I dont know Can you imagine whats in Nancy Graces basement Thousands of human  thousands of wigs made of human hair BECKEL Youre about the last person making that statement GUTFELD That is true PERINO About wigs GUTFELD No BECKEL I want to go around the table and get out of here Do you think the father was involved in this GUTFELD I think somebody was involved and probably him BECKEL OK Dana PERINO Im going to give him the benefit of the doubt No BOLLING Yes I think the father was somehow involved TANTAROS I think the father instigated the child to hide from him	For some nefarious reason BECKEL Im ducking this I have no idea Maybe it was his old lady One More Thing is up next COMMERCIAL BREAK TANTAROS Now its time for One More Thing And I will kick it off So remember Triumph the Insult Dog from Conan OBrien Well hes back to make fun of the World Cup And hes not sparing any ethnicity poking fun of Colombians and Greeks Take a listen BEGIN VIDEO CLIP TRIUMPH THE INSULT DOG Only if the teams are done jogging and warming up they are going to start the game Oh wait Ive just been informed that this is the game and Ive actually been watching soccer for the past two hours Drinks for all these guys on me  if your last name has fewer than five syllables Youre drinking in a bar in the middle of the day When did you two realize that you didnt have any goaaaaaaals END VIDEO CLIP TANTAROS Its very very funny He came out with another video today You should watch it if you want to laugh Very funny stuff  Dana PERINO I discovered something on WallStreetJournalcom that if youre a history buff or not and you want to learn more

wanted to learn more about the war Lots of fun facts and figures Fun facts  I mean there are facts And theyre kind of fun to know GUTFELD Youre a harsh person PERINO Facts about war arent necessarily fun but you get my point	I really urge you to go to WallStreetJournalcom GUTFELD War monger War monger You have upset my carrot BOLLING What TANTAROS I love that Dana just said facts are fun PERINO Facts are fun TANTAROS Actually facts are fun GUTFELD Why dont I keep finding these things TANTAROS Greg would you and like your carrot like to go next GUTFELD Oh yes please So today I had an interesting afternoon	I went to Kathie Lee Giffords home to record a podcast with her It was absolutely amazing I have some pictures Here is Kathie Lee and I having glasses getting ready for

after that It was disgusting And actually had a lovely time So anyway this podcast is going to be Wednesday I believe July 2	And you can get it  or it will be released on July 2 on Wednesday on iTunes Podcast 1 PERINO Do you say anything youre going to have to apologize for GUTFELD I think six things PERINO OK GUTFELD Six things PERINO You want to get ahead of any of those BOLLING Gorgeous home

grateful to the military Im very proud of our military That has never changed I hate terrorists They killed a lot of my friends And lastly Im uber conservative I believe in small government free markets capitalism drilling our own oil But do me a favor Listen to Iraqs Special Forces captain who was in Iraq This sums up my thoughts perfectly Listen BEGIN VIDEO CLIP UNIDENTIFIED MALE I dont think there is a military solution particularly in taking sides  to this UNIDENTIFIED MALE So let the Sunnis and the Shias sort it out UNIDENTIFIED MALE I think Iraqis have to be the one to sort this out Were trying to piece something together when theres nothing to piece together UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE Were at square one Were at square one UNIDENTIFIED MALE Thats exactly right Theres no military solution to it END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING I want to say thank you to Captain Lewis Moore ph for his service and his honesty By the way Captain Moore is a special advisor to Kanye West BECKEL Hmm TANTAROS

RIO DE JANEIRO  With its Carnival reputation and skinbaring beach life Brazil may look like a liberal bastion But unease over a worsening economy and deteriorating public safety plus a backlash against recent gayrights gains are propelling a conservative rise that will shape the next administration regardless of who wins the presidency The general election held earlier this month saw a greater share of Brazils National Congress seats go to various conservative caucuses which now control nearly 60 percent of the 513 seats in the lower house They include evangelical lawmakers who oppose gay marriage or access to abortion ruralistas whose proagriculture positions counter environmentalists and indigenous groups and a lawandorder faction that demands a crackdown on crime     Ahead of the presidential runoff Oct 26 theres no doubt such conservatives are giving greater support to centerright challenger Aecio Neves over leftleaning President Dilma Rousseff But its also clear that neither presidential candidate is as socially conservative as the increasingly powerful elements of Congress Brazil is one of the very few Latin American countries where the parliament is more important than the president in terms of overall power in the decisionmaking process said Thiago de Aragao a political analyst for the Brasiliabased Arko Advice consulting firm The parliament in an armwrestling contest against the presidency would win  because the parliaments main weapon is just crossing their arms and not voting on matters that are of strong interest to the government Despite its anythinggoes appearance Brazil is like many predominantly Roman Catholic nations in Latin America socially conservative In recent opinion polls for example more than 80 percent of Brazilians said they oppose loosening their restrictive abortion laws or legalizing marijuana and just over half oppose gay marriage However since Brazils return to democracy in 1985 the nations presidents and its judiciary have pushed through progressive projects either by decree or rulings   such as protecting huge swaths of jungle as indigenous reserves a highcourt ruling permitting samesex civil unions and the creation of Bolsa Familia a program that gives monthly cash payments to Brazils poorest families Some predict such changes could be rolled back by the growing conservative forces The evangelical caucus votes in lockstep on hotbutton social issues and is willing to block projects put forth by the presidency because its members know they represent a growing segment of the electorate While Catholics remain the majority in Brazil since 1970 their portion of the population has fallen from more than 90 percent to 65 percent while those identifying as Protestants have grown from 5 percent to 22 percent according to the Pew Research Center In Rousseffs first term the evangelical caucus blocked her effort to promote gaytolerance teaching in schools and managed to have their most outspoken antigay legislator Deputy Marco Feliciano named head of the bodys human rights commission    a move that provoked condemnation from Amnesty International and other activist groups In the Oct 5 election Feliciano was reelected to his Sao Paulo district with nearly double the votes he won four years ago The ruralista caucus also grew and now has about 200 members who support its agenda These lawmakers showed their strength in 2012 forcing weakening of environmental protection laws which critics say contributed to a 29 percent jump in the number of Amazon acres deforested over the last year And while the lawandorder block is small with only about 20 members it wields influence on security issues The caucus members defend tougher penal codes for young offenders and want to block the sort of drug liberalization seen in neighboring countries even as Brazil copes with overcrowded prisons and years of failed efforts to suppress powerful drug gangs But its the evangelical lawmakers who are at the heart of Brazils growing conservatism and theyve shown an ability to rally the other groups behind their main cause defeating any attempt to legalize gay marriage or advance protections for LGBT communities Toni Reis who heads the gay rights advocacy group Dignidade noted it took a landmark Supreme Court decision to legalize samesex civil unions in 2011 following years of congressional stalling on the matter Now he said gay rights groups are focused not on gay marriage but on advancing legislation to criminalize discrimination against gays Given the new legislative reality Reis acknowledged it will be an uphill battle Were going to have to work twice as hard he said Jean Wyllys Brazils first openly gay congressman said progressive lawmakers wont give up Theres no doubt its going to be more difficult said Wyllys who represents Rio de Janeiro state But I also have my allies  We are a political force capable of blocking their the evangelicals legislative projects But Brazils most influential evangelical pastor Silas Malafaia who campaigned for several Pentecostal politicians says the conservatives dont intend to impose stances out of step with the electorate I am against gay marriage Lets hold a referendum and let society decide Malafaia said in a recent interview If the people decide that they want abortions to be legalized I will always be against it but I will respect those decisions Were not evangelical extremists trying to impose what we think with an iron fist ___ Associated Press writer Brad Brooks contributed to this report ___

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/05/16/republicans-eye-senate-pick-up-in-unlikely-territory-oregon/, As Republicans look to pick up Democraticheld seats in their bid to gain control of the US Senate some are targeting an unlikely state  Oregon The Beaver State has not elected a Republican in a statewide election since 2002 But some believe firstterm incumbent Sen Jeff Merkley is vulnerable partly because of his enthusiastic support for ObamaCare in a state that had a disastrous rollout of its failed health care exchange Cover Oregon     The Republican primary will be held Tuesday and it appears to be a twoperson race between Dr Monica Wehby and Jason Conger two candidates with compelling personal stories who are quite different on social issues Wehby is a pediatric neurosurgeon with 30 years in the business of saving young lives She was the first woman to graduate from UCLAs neurosurgery program But her claim to fame in this race and a big reason why shes getting support from influential Republicans nationally is she was an early critic of ObamaCare She was on the board of the American Medical Association and was featured in a 2009 ad opposing the Affordable Care Act Its a 2700 page law 20000 pages of regulations now  its impossible to work with this law Wehby said I think the best way is to repeal and replace with a plan that will actually work Conger is a twoterm representative in the Oregon State House Hes also a practicing lawyer While that might not seem so unusual Congers path to the legal profession was anything but ordinary His mother abandoned the family when he was young So he lived with his father often staying in trailer parks and for stretches was homeless sleeping in the back of his family truck From those humble beginnings in northern California he graduated from Harvard Law School I feel extraordinarily blessed to have been able to go from barely graduating from an alternative high school to graduating from Harvard Law School and living what I would consider the American dream Conger said Dr Wehby has been endorsed by GOP heavyweights like Mitt Romney Newt Gingrich and Dr Ben Carson She also received a major boost in the form of a 400000 advertising campaign funded by the New Republican super PAC Founded by Alex Castellanos New Republican is attempting to pull the party more to the center The groups ads highlight Wehbys credibility on ObamaCare her sensitivity to issues important to women and her own professional background  including a spot titled Trust which features the mother of a child whose life she saved with surgery many years ago Conger has raised far less money and polls suggest hes trailing But he does have plenty of support especially from social conservatives Oregon Right to Life endorsed his candidacy and former presidential candidate Rick Santorum recently endorsed him in a radio ad Conger also has wide support among Republican lawmakers in Oregon He is strong on the Second Amendment is staunchly prolife and opposes gay marriage Wehby who was raised Catholic says she is personally prolife but would not work to take away abortion rights for other women Wehby is divorced with four teenage children She says she is not opposed to gay marriage She believes the GOP can grow if it becomes a little more libertarian on social issues We dont want the government interfering in our business in our personal lives in our private lives in our personal decisions Wehby said As Republicans we want as little government interference in our lives as possible The Republicans have been on a losing streak in Oregon ever since Merkley defeated Gordon Smith in 2002 Mike Riley of the Portland political consulting firm Riley Research said gender politics do matter in the state Republican men particularly senior Republican men have a very hard time attracting votes in Oregon he saidAmong Democrats of course but independent women as well But Conger believes moving to the center is the wrong strategy You dont have to be moderate you dont have to abandon your principles he said You have to offer an alternative to voters to the incumbent an alternative that is more attractive that is credible and speaks to issues that they care about Wehby might carry some baggage into the general election if she wins the primary A number of recent stories raise questions about her relationship with a Republican donor who runs a large Oregon lumber company Andrew Miller owner of Stimson Lumber donated 31000 to a super PAC that helped fund ads attacking Conger Its been widely reported that Miller and Wehby dated The Oregon Democratic Party filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging there must have been coordination between Miller and the Wehby campaign which would have made the donation a violation of campaign finance laws Wehby told Fox News there was no coordination Politico is also reporting Miller accused Wehby of stalking him and harassing his employees as the couple was breaking up in 2013 No charges or restraining orders were ever filed  Dan Springer joined Fox News Channel FNC in August 2001 as a Seattlebased

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/05/21/establishment-gop-candidates-beat-tea-party-opponents-in-tuesday-primaries/,"In a race considered key in Tuesdays primaries Kentuckys US Sen Mitch McConnell a Republican handily beat his tea party challenger Matt Bevin  another sign many political experts say that the most rightwing faction of the GOP is losing steam For socalled establishment Republicans who hope to win six seats in the US Senate and gain control of that chamber this year has been one of trying to beat back tea party candidates viewed by the GOP as a hindrance to winning general elections in November On Tuesday McConnell who as a 30year senator and party leader is about as establishment as they come predicted that he and other mainstream Republicans would crush tea party candidates this year Bevin initially excited antiestablishment Republicans but his campaign eventually collapsed under rookie mistakes and McConnells overwhelming advantage in money experience and organization One of the issues both Bevin and McConnell sparred over was immigration with Bevin casting the senator as proamnesty and the senator at one point assailing Bevin saying hed insulted the people of Kentucky when the candidate said that US citizens did not want to do certain hard work that immigrants do The Kentucky victory for establishment Republicans reflected the best evidence yet that Republicans are avoiding previous mistakes and improving their chances of controlling the Senate during President Barack Obamas final two years in office GOP voters again chose solidly conservative nominees while rejecting the most extreme and outlandish types who led the party to painful losses in 2010 and 2012 While McConnell and Bevin criticized each other over immigration they actually both harbor largely conservative views on the issue supporting stricter enforcement In fact the differences between tea party and nontea party Republicans seem to be shrinking Often its merely tone and experience that separate them Tone and experience matter however and Tuesdays GOP voters chose the less bombastic and unpredictable conservatives in most cases Kentucky Democrats who are trying to guard against losing the majority in the Senate are planning a tough offensive against McConnell with their candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes McConnell is mindful of this taking aim at her in his victory speech on Tuesday night according to The Hill The Senate Minority Leader called Grimes a partisans partisan whos been practicing party politics since she learned to talk Barack Obamas candidates preach independence but they practice loyalty above all else McConnell said according to The Hill Im confident of this Kentuckians will not be deceived Alison Lundergan Grimes is Barack Obamas candidate Grimes has not missed a beat meanwhile responding that she is not an empty dressnot a rubber stampnot a cheerleader Mitch McConnell would have you believe that President Obama is on Kentuckys 2014 election ballot Grimes said Senator McConnell this race is between you and me Tea party candidates fared poorly in other Tuesday primaries as well In Georgia Republican voters rejected the two most outspoken tea party proponents Reps Paul Broun and Phil Gingrey They set up a July 22 Senate runoff between two men who constantly emphasize their conservative credentials but leaven their rhetoric by wooing corporate support Dollar General CEO David Perdue and Rep Jack Kingston claimed the top two spots Tuesday and now begin a twomonth runoff campaign Establishment Republicans once feared that Broun who called embryology and evolution lies straight from the pit of hell would win the nomination and become the type of gaffeprone overthetop candidate who killed great GOP Senate chances in Delaware Indiana Missouri and other states in 2010 and 2012 In Oregon Republicans chose pediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby who supports abortion rights to run against firstterm Democratic Sen Jeff Merkley this fall Her opponents included state Rep Jason Conger who was endorsed by the Tea Party Nation and former presidential candidate Rick Santorum Arkansas two uncontested Senate primaries officially set up a fierce November showdown between twoterm Democratic Sen Mark Pryor and freshman Republican Rep Tom Cotton Tuesdays Republican elections continued earlier trends from states such as North Carolina There Republicans nominated state House Speaker Thom Tillis for the Senate rejecting a tea party leader and a Baptist minister who were making their first runs for office North Carolina Democrats scoff at the notion that Tillis is moderate citing his selfdescribed conservative revolution in the closely divided state There and in many other states Democrats will say the GOP Senate nominees are too conservative They are happy to see Republican leaders play down the differences between themselves and tea party activists as House Speaker John Boehner ROhio did Tuesday Sometimes Boehner told reporters theres not that big a difference between what you all call tea party and your average conservative Republican Before mainstream Republicans get too excited about Tuesdays Senate results they might note that Democrats have solid wellfunded nominees waiting Oregons Merkley and Arkansas Pryor  like North Carolinas Sen Kay Hagan  have proven they can win statewide elections In Georgia and Kentucky where Obama hardly campaigned in 2008 and 2012 Democrats are banking on two women with wellknown political names Michelle Nunn of Georgia is the daughter of former Sen Sam Nunn Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes is the daughter of a longtime Democratic Party leader Republicans need to gain six net Senate seats to control the chamber Losing either McConnells seat or the Georgia seat which Saxby Chambliss is vacating could kill those chances Nunn would rather have drawn Broun as her opponent And Grimes would have been ecstatic to face Bevin rather than McConnell So far Republican primary voters arent handing those types of gifts to Democrats That suggests theyve learned the hard lessons of 2010 and 2012 when nonmainstream nominees lost winnable races Now the question is whether all Republican candidates  not just Constitutionquoting tea partyers  have moved too far

gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf Sunday Nov 2 2014 at Temple University in Philadelphia AP PhotoMatt Rourke President Barack Obama gestures toward the crowd after participating in a roundtable discussion with working parents small business owners students and faculty Friday Oct 31 2014 at Rhode Island College in Providence RI AP PhotoStephan Savoia Well if it wasnt a wave it sure was a shellacking The GOP is now in control of the Senate and of Obamas last two years in the Oval office The midterm elections were a convincing repudiation of President Obamas policies they were also for Democrats a worrisome sign that the presidents fabled voter coalition has frayed badly The question is  will blacks Hispanics single women and young people return to Democrats in 2016 or are those voters now up for grabs     Though Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu D managed to force a runoff in December barely hanging on to her seat and incumbent Democrat Sen Jeanne Shaheen beat former Senator Scott Walker in New Hampshire GOP wins in Colorado Kansas Georgia Iowa South Dakota Kentucky Arkansas North Carolina and West Virginia certainly sent President Obama a messageAs did Governor Scott Walkers reelection in Wisconsin and Republican Rick Scotts victory over Democrat Charlie Crist in Floridas governor race The last contest in particular is a slap to Mr Obama the Crist campaign began airing a radio spot just the day before the election in which the president encouraged black voters to vote Apparently it had little impact Mr Obama and his wife worked hard in the weeks leading up to the election to boost black turnout considered essential in Florida North Carolina Louisiana and Georgia That Republicans in those states either won or came close suggests that even blacks who recently polled 85 in favor of the president were uninspired Like blacks women appear to have defected from the presidents party It turns out  thank heavens  that women are not oneissue voters after all In Kentucky for instance Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell made the election all about coal  and the gender gap disappeared even though his challenger was female  Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes Not to mention just 35 years old Mark Udall Senator from Colorado became the Poster Boy for going allin on the GOP War On Women meme Females in the MileHigh state returned the favor by voting for Republican victor Cory Gardner Some days before the election polls showed Udall nicknamed Mark Uterus because of his singleminded attention to abortion and reproductive rights trailing in the polls and also losing ground with women though they still tilted toward the Democrat Not only were women apparently turned off bored silly by Udalls onetrack playlist the Denver Post surprised everyone by endorsing Gardner describing Udalls thrust as an obnoxious oneissue campaign Gardner helped himself by anticipating Udalls attacks on his conservative stance on abortion he countered by abandoning his support for personhood legislation in Colorado and by advocating for overthecounter sales of oral contraceptives  an approach taken up by Republicans in North Carolina and Virginia as well The good news here is that Republicans have learned a trick or two about not alienating the 53 of the electorate that is femaleNo candidate fed the liberal frenzy by talking about legitimate rape a la Todd Akin in 2012 candidates by and large remembered their mannersBut make no mistake Republicans may have handled womens issues better than in the past couple of election cycles but the gender gap is alive and well and will surely be a factor in 2106 especially if Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee  It might help the GOP to push education reformThe country is increasingly critical of the shortcomings of our public schools even if still largely supportive of teachers Arguing for a change in tenure rules and demanding more accountability could also appeal to Hispanics who like women have drifted away from Democrats No wonder To court the Latino community President Obama promised to push immigration reform but failed to deliver His politicallymotivated balk last summer on protecting more people here illegally from deportation infuriated Hispanics  To make amends the president has pledged to broaden the 2012 DACA program  in essence providing temporary amnesty for possibly millions of families by executive order  in coming weeks Unhappily the move is sure to infuriate some GOP members of Congress whose bellicose resistance could undermine efforts by others in the party to reach out to the Hispanic community New Jersey Governor Chris Christie made a highprofile visit to Mexicos president in September while Senator Rand Paul visited Guatemala with a team of medical experts providing eye treatments to the poor Similarly Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has been pushing for a Mexican consulate noting the growing crossborder trade in his state That Mitt Romney only garnered 27 of the Hispanic vote  and that it might have cost him the election  has not gone unnoticed And the youth vote They defected from Democrats too according to a poll from Harvards Institute of Politics Obamas job approval rating among Millenials has sunk to 43 from 47 last April and is at the secondlowest level ever Worse news for Dems likely voters in this crowd favored Republicans over Democrats 51 to 47 In 2010 Dems won the survey 55 to 43 Lack of enthusiasm from these core voter groups helped the GOP take over the Senate It is encouraging  Republicans need a bigger tent But these gains could prove fragile Hardliners on abortion and immigration need to be reminded that winning the White House requires a convincing positive message that can appeal to the entire country A message about growing the economy and reforming our dismal public schools about reducing red tape and improving our infrastructure  commonsense popular measures that will help

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/10/27/political-unknown-familiar-name-george-p-bush-expected-to-win-powerful-texas/,He is the Lone Star states bestknown political enigma George P Bush the 38yearold scion of yes the countrys most enduring transgenerational political dynasty is running for the post of Texas land commissioner and is widely expected to win by a large margin Unlike his rival  Democrat John Cook a 68yearold who served on the El Paso City Council for three terms and as mayor for two terms Bush has never before held a political office Not that that seems to be hurting him much People know his name they know about him but they dont know him said Alfonso Aguilar a GOP strategist who was chief of the US Office of Citizenship in the George W Bush administration Hes at a perfect age to start his career Hes running for a very powerful position in Texas The job of land commissioner is said to be one of the most powerful in Texas and has proven to be a stepping stone to bigger and better positions If Bush wins he would be continuing a family tradition His father Jeb was governor of Florida and is widely expected to run for president in 2016 his uncle George W was Texas governor and US president his grandfather George HW was CIA director vicepresident under Ronald Reagan and then president himself and his greatgrandfather Prescott was a US senator But George P is entering the political arena as talk centers on whether his father will run for president He appeared on Sunday on ABCs This Weekbut the interview made headlines only because of what he said about the likelihood of his father running for president in 2016 I think its more than likely that hes giving this a serious thought and moving forward George P said Asked if that meant it was more than likely that hell runhe responded That hell run If you had asked me a few years back  I would have said it was less likely But even though his father has the spotlight right now political observers say this is just the beginning of what many consider to be George Ps own very bright future To generate buzz someday about a higher national political office Aguilar said the younger Bush will have to audition  so to speak  while in the role of land commissioner After he wins obviously he needs to do a good job as land commissioner then he has to travel outside Texas give speeches talk to different audiences meet with different groups around the country Aguilar said Oddly George P Bush who has been endorsed by various major news outlets including the Dallas Morning News would make family history if he is victorious on Nov 4 He would be the first in his family to win an election in his maiden run for office Cal Jillson a political scientist at Southern Methodist University in Texas says that although Bush is unproven as a politician the states residents are generally welcoming to him People like the idea of a next generation of Bushes in Texas politics Jillson said Hes seen very positively across the board by Republicans and Democrats However Jillson said People know the name it has very positive resonance in Texas even more positive than George HW Bush or George W Bush Hes young hes goodlooking but theres nothing substantive yet about him Jillson added Hes an empty vessel As he develops hell flesh out the substance of his political character The likely next land commissioner of Texas is a lawyer and founder of a political action committee called Hispanic Republicans of Texas He often has sounded like someone who is trying to cast himself as more than just a local political figure  weighing in on national issues praising the virtues of the Republican Party while echoing many GOP talking points when criticizing Democrats and the Obama administration He has taken decidedly conservative Republicans stancessometimes departing from more moderate ones embraced by his father and unclesuch as opposing abortion and samesex marriage and supporting the defunding of the Affordable Care Act On the other hand he has expressed support for more liberal immigration proposals such as giving undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children a chance to legalize their status and attend public universities paying the same tuition rate as state residents In his campaign for land commissioner Bush has pushed for expanding oil and gas exploration arguing that it could generate funding for public schools Bushs campaign senior advisor Trey Newton said George P Bush is a new generation conservative leader who is building a new and enduring coalition of Hispanics young people small business owners and working class families around his conservative message of freedom and family As land commissioner George will fight to improve public schools create more energy sector jobs and provide better service to our returning veterans His rival Cook the former El Paso mayor has criticized Bush as running on his name and lacking in political experience Cook who says hes running to win even if others have written the race off as a certain Bush victory concedes the challenges of running against a state political brand Its more difficult because everyone recognizes the name Cook told Fox News Latino Any marketing strategy is name recognition whether its trying to sell Coke or Papa Johns pizza or a candidate But if you look at the Bush name there are both positive and negative parts to it he added The two elder Bushes got us into wars that were still involved in one was obviously because of oil another was for weapons of mass destruction that didnt exist That creates Bush fatigue there are people who arent going to vote for the name because they dont want another Bush Cook says hes been an underdog before and triumphed When he ran to be mayor of El Paso he said Nobody except my wife thought I could win We spent a lot less than my opponent and I won  and among every demographic including Hispanic Cook said What Cook has to offer he says is less dazzle and more experience than his rival I have a better resume than my opponent he said I have business experience and municipal government government experience Bushs lack of experience he argued is worrisome with a land commission job that involves 13 million acres of public land and 2200 miles of coastline going slightly more than 10 miles into the gulf he said If theres an oil spill the state agency thats responsible for that cleanup being done properly is the land office Cook said You need a land commissioner who is environmentally conscious His opponent he said cares more about big business than about the environment and Texas residents Bush speaks Spanish His mother Columba is from Mexico and his father Jeb speaks Spanish fluently Bush has released a Spanishlanguage ad urging Latinos to vote for him for land commissioner In an interview with Univisions Jorge Ramos Jeb Bush said that George P identifies himself as a Latino Earlier this year George P mocked Democrats in a speech for suggesting that they are better representatives of young people and Latinos I happen to know a little something about these two groups he said In fact I am these two groups We dont want the Obama model it doesnt work In press interviews Bush has admitted that he has long entertained a career in politics When he was a teenager he shared his political plans with his grandmother former First Lady Barbara Bush But she gave him a reality check She told him not to ride on his name She urged him to have a career in something else to marry and start a family then to enter politics when he was truly ready to be a public servant In a 2012 interview with FNL George P Bush said I am drawn to public service Im intrigued by being in public office Im feeling the bug the bug to jump into it Its in my genes I cant get it out  Elizabeth Llorente can be reached at elizabethllorentefoxnewslatinocom Follow Elizabeth Llorente on

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/28/abortion-battle-shapes-up-in-colorado-as-voters-weigh-personhood-amendment/,Colorado voters are weighing whether to approve a firstinthenation personhood law which would extend legal rights to the unborn in a move critics say could effectively ban abortions The measure called Amendment 67 would have farreaching consequences in the state changing the Colorado constitution to protect pregnant women and unborn children by defining person and child in the Colorado Criminal Code and the Colorado Wrongful Death Act to include unborn human beings     Political analyst Eric Sonderman notes this is not the first time the personhood question has been on the Colorado ballot Its gone down to overwhelming defeat on past occasions he said Similar attempts in other states also have failed This time in Colorado though supporters have tied the measure to a tragic accident in July 2012 Heather Surovik was eight months pregnant and on her way back from a prenatal visit when her car was struck by a drunk driver When she woke up in the hospital she was told that her baby had not survived Amendment 67 backer Jennifer Mason recalled But not only that there would be no charges filed in relation to his death because under Colorado law he was not considered a person Heather Surovik said They cant tell me thats not a baby He was eight pounds two ounces Brady was the second victim and nobody recognized it Fofi Mendez campaign manager of Vote NO 67 sympathizes with Heather Suroviks loss but warns that redefining the words person and child to include the unborn would have the effect of banning all abortions and even some forms of birth control You end up giving legal and constitutional rights to a womans fertilized egg and when you apply that definition to the criminal code and the wrongful death statute you end up making criminals out of women and their doctors Mendez said When asked if doctors should be concerned that they would be committing a crime for performing abortions if Amendment 67 passes Mason said Well they could be If an unborn child is a person and we recognize that they are a person should we say that some children should be protected and some shouldnt Opponents also point out that in 2013 legislation inspired by Suroviks case was signed into law that criminalized the unlawful termination of a pregnancy If the same accident happened today the drunk driver who crashed into Suroviks car would be charged for the loss of her unborn child Even if Amendment 67 does not pass  and recent polls suggest it probably wont  the biggest impact of its presence on this years midterm ballot could be on the US Senate race between incumbent Democratic Sen Mark Udall and his challenger US Rep Cory Gardner The contest is one of the tightest and mostclosely watched in the country If Cory Gardner ends up losing this Senate race which is probably right now a flip of a coin Sonderman said you might be able to track it back to one word that word being personhood Gardner supported personhood amendments in previous years that went down in defeat in Colorado His support came while he represented one of Colorados most conservative districts in the US House Gardner who now is running statewide in this very purple state announced early in the race that he will not support Amendment 67 He is taking hits from both sides for his decision I think that Cory Gardner has shown himself to be untrustworthy to the voters Mason said,2014-10-28T03:00-04:00,abortion

 Talk about an expert witness     STUNNER 44 PERCENT NOT PROUD TO BE AMERICAN
For all of the red white and blue on display in honor of Americas soccer exploits this week an exhaustive new Pew poll shows that actual patriotism is in the dumps An amazing 44 percent of all respondents said they didnt often feel proud to be American Only 28 percent said that America was the greatest nation on earth So how do you unite people to save the country if theyre not invested in its success And how do you reverse a belief that is searing in its selffulfillment We talk a lot in America about economic demographic and other tipping points but the patriotism gap is arguably the most important of all Liberals care less  Pew divided their sample into different categories across the leftright political spectrum When asked if respondents often feel proud to be American a majority of strong liberals 60 percent said no The only group that solidly agreed with the statement was conservatives ranging from 72 percent to 81 percent About half of the respondents in the middle of the spectrum  essentially libertarians to socially conservative fiscal liberals  said they were proud to be American Taking exception with exceptionalism  When asked if the United States ranks above other countries fewer than three in 10 overall said the US stands above all other counties while 58 percent said the US is one of the greatest countries along with some others And 12 percent of respondents definitively said there are other countries that are better than the US When broken down into groups conservatives are tops on exceptionalism at 46 percent Close behind are members of the ethnically diverse ranks of socially conservative fiscally liberal Americans who formerly made up the Democratic base before the Obama era at 39 percent Strong liberals and libertarianleaning young adults were least likely to see America as the greatest 11 percent and 16 percent respectively And 19 percent of strong liberals the leader in this ranking said other countries were better Why it matters  If the individuals in a disagreement dont at least agree that they are trying to preserve a common endeavor spirited debate turns into acrimony Splitsville man If America is just another country with a soccer team the extraordinary doses of patriotic grace forbearance and sacrifice that have been required of citizens since our countrys founding dont make sense Its not that the 44 percent who arent proud are all moving to Costa Rica its that they feel less obliged to do the hard work necessary to make a system this demanding work Politicians and public figures who intentionally exploit and deepen divisions and resentments are doing more than just creating gridlock theyre undercutting the very idea that has lit the lamp of Americas greatness for nearly three centuries NO BALONEY OBAMA STILL SAYS SCANDALS ARE PHONY

 Conservatives push McConnell to keep Reid rules on appointments
 Odds against Begich
 Podesta departure will cue Clinton campaign
 Congress defeating hosers one Wikipedia post at a time      OBAMA STILL UNMOVED AFTER ASSWHUPPIN
President Obama was determined not to provide a descriptor for his partys midterm election rout this week using verbal gymnastics worthy of Alison Lundergan Grimes to deny headline writers an adjective akin to 2010s shellacking or 2006s thumping So West Virginia Democratic Sen Joe Manchin did the job for him describing 2014s bloodbath as a real asswhuppin In a perfunctory press conference held to face an almost taunting press corps Obama tried to invalidate the outcome The president suggested that there was no clear message from voters beyond inexplicably a perceived desire for his agenda to be implemented More pointedly Obama said To twothirds of voters that chose not to participate in the process yesterday I hear you too What were they saying The president believes that they were also urging his agenda enacted Funny how that works

Devil of a duck  The presidents refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of Tuesdays result bodes ill indeed for the months to come Republicans had hoped that a loss especially one as large as this would chasten the president on the use of executive action and open him up to compromise The presidents message was that he intends to give little ground previewing what could be a very raucous close to 2014 as Democrats prepare to hand over power in the Senate Spending bills and other mustpass measures are likely to mingle with rushed appointments including an expected clash over the appointment of a new attorney general in the Senate And from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue Obama will be preparing to launch his promised temporary amnesty for illegal immigrants Washington shouldnt plan on a very merry Christmas this year

Uncomfortably numb  Dana Milbank Fox Newss Ed Henry pointed out the obvious I havent heard you say a specific thing during this news conference that you would do differently Obama restated his passive stance saying it would be premature to talk about changing personnel or policiesNPRs Scott Horsley gave a last try asking Obama whether he saw some shortcoming on your part because Democratic policies fared better than Democratic candidatesObama replied in the conditional If the way we are talking about issues isnt working then Im going to try some different things But after Tuesday its no longer a question of if

Turnout not the problem  NYT Low Democratic voter turnout has been blamed for the decisive Republican victory in Tuesdays midterm elections It has quickly become the scapegoat even though the Democrats invested millions of dollars in an expansive effort to persuade young and nonwhite voters who do not usually participate in midterm election to head to the polls There is no question that turnout among core Democratic groups was lower in 2014 than it was in 2012 or even 2010 Many Democrats would have won if turnout had resembled a presidential election year But Democrats also lost in states where turnout surpassed 2010 according to an Upshot analysis of preliminary returns and voter turnout data

War on women loses steam  WaPo The gender gap was not wide enough to save Democrats Sen Mark Udall in Colorado Bruce Braley in Iowa or incumbent Sen Kay Hagan in North Carolina Astute and wellfinanced campaigns honed a Republican message that worked spectacularly And women who did show up at the polls let it be known that they hardly walk in gender lockstep on issues of education the economy and abortion and choice

NYT breaks down the substantial gains Republicans made among Hispanic voters in the midterms

Steyer miscalculated climate  LAT California hedge fund titan Tom Steyers 74million bet  most of it from his own wallet  yielded little payoff On Tuesday voters elected the most hostile Congress environmentalists have faced in years The Republicans who won control are already making plans to roll back President Obamas signature emission reduction efforts greenlight the controversial Keystone XL pipeline that would transport Canadian tar sands oil to the US Gulf Coast and cancel subsidies for renewable energy He chalked up Tuesdays results to that part of the world we dont control

Where did the money go  While Steyerbacked efforts sometimes used nonglobal warming issues to attack Republicans the pure weirdness of his campaign shone through the brightest when discussing the topic

Pollaxed  mediaBuzz host Howard Kurtz looks at coverage of the midterms and why the media were stunned by huge Democratic defeat Its clear now that most prognosticators underestimated the depth of the Republican triumph in the midterms by slavishly hewing to the polls some of which were wildly off the mark

CONSERVATIVES PUSH MCCONNELL TO KEEP REID RULES ON APPOINTMENTS
Conservatives are pressing Republican Senators to keep the nuclear option rule change rammed through by Democrats last year to grease the skids for President Obamas judicial nominees In a letter the group of academics and advocates says they see very little upside to restoring the old rules which had allowed the minority party to require 60 votes to confirm nominees The Hill reports They say the rules would help Republicans put committed constitutionalists on the bench if the White House changes hands in 2016 The decision by Senator Harry Reid and his Democratic colleagues to deploy the socalled nuclear option was transparently designed to facilitate the confirmation of judicial nominees who would insulate ObamaCare and other aspects of President Obamas agenda from meaningful judicial review the letter says Regardless of their motives we see very little upside and significant downside in reviving the judicial filibusterSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to discuss the nuclear option in a Time magazine interview published Wednesday Oh well discuss that when we get back he said

If Republicans refuse to hold Democrats to the new nominations rules they set for the Senate Democrats will have no reason to fear that they may someday bear the costs of their own tactics The Senate can and must be restored as a check on executivebranch overreach a forum for true legislative debate and a bulwark for liberty But unilateral disarmament on nominations would only invite further damage to the institution  Sen Orrin Hatch RUtah in a WSJ OpEd

ObamaCare an early priority  The Hill Sen Mitch McConnell RKy is planning to make ObamaCare a priority in his first weeks as leader of the Senate vowing a sustained effort to dismantle the law piecebypiece Instead of a full repeal McConnell said the GOP will tackle unpopular aspects of the law such as the individual mandate the medical device tax and the 30hour workweek requiring employers to provide insuranceThe newly reelected senator isnt giving up on full repeal however He does support full repeal and will continue to push for it McConnell spokesman Brian McGuire told The HillHe also promised no more government shutdowns asserting that the Senate would pass a budget and appropriations bills on time

On health care there are certainly some lines Im going to draw Repeal of the law I wont sign President Obama during a press conference Wednesday

McConnell Boehner lay out agenda  From a WSJ oped from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner These bills provide an obvious and potentially bipartisan starting point for the new Congressand for President Obama a chance to begin the final years of his presidency by taking some steps toward a stronger economy These bills include measures authorizing the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline which will mean lower energy costs for families and more jobs for American workers the Hire More Heroes Act legislation encouraging employers to hire more of our nations veterans and a proposal to restore the traditional 40hour definition of fulltime employment removing an arbitrary and destructive government barrier to more hours and better pay created by the Affordable Care Act of 2010

Changing of the guard  WaPotakes a look at who could potentially head key committees in the upcoming Republican controlled Senate including Sens John McCain RAriz at Armed Services Sen Ron Johnson RWis at Homeland Security Jeff Sessions RAla at the helm of the Senate Budget Committee Orrin Hatch RUtah at Finance and James Inhofe ROkla at Environment and Public Works which oversees the administrations energy regulations Among GOP women Sen Lisa Murkowski RAlaska will likely take the reins of the Senate Energy Committee

IRS hearings are on the docket  Fox News Attorneys for the IRS have told a federal court that they have not searched various other sources for the missing emails of former agency official Lois Lerner claiming that doing so would be fruitless The attorneys made the assertions in a court filing last month as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit over the missing emails that was filed by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch The IRS has said that potentially thousands of emails belonging to Lerner a central figure in the agencys targeting of conservative groups were lost in a hard drive crash in 2011

Oh you can bet on that Sen Mitch McConnell RKy asked at a press conference if the Senate would hold hearings looking into the IRS scandal

ODDS AGAINST BEGICH
Alaska Dispatch News Numbers released by Alaska elections officials Wednesday morning showed Sen Mark Begich DAlaska facing daunting odds He needs to win a substantial majority of as many as 50000 uncounted absentee and other outstanding ballots to catch up with Republican Dan Sullivan With 100 percent of precincts reporting early Wednesday Sullivan led Begich by about 8000 votes State elections officials said there were nearly 24000 uncounted absentee and early votes which wont be tallied until next week  In 2008 when Begich beat Republican Sen Ted Stevens  who was more popular than Sullivan in rural Alaska  Begich trailed by 3000 votes on election night and he ended up winning by 4000 votes swinging the results about 27 percent But that year more than 100000 votes were counted in the weeks after the election and this year there appears to be only about half that total outstanding with Begich trailing by 36 percent

GILLESPIE MULLS OPTONS AS FINAL COUNT FIRMS UP FOR WARNER
WaPo With all but one precinct reportingSen Mark Warners DVa margin of victory settled at nearly 17000 votes out of more than 2 million cast in his race for a second term against Republican Ed Gillespie according to results compiled by the Associated Press Warner held 492 percent of the vote just slightly ahead of Gillespies 484 percent  Gillespie may ask for a recount once the votes are certified by state election officials a process that election officials expect to complete Nov 24 In Virginia the loser can ask for a recount if the margin is less than 1 percent of the total number of votes cast  which it is so far in the Senate race But the state would pay for the recount only if the margin falls below onehalf of 1 percent of the votes cast  a threshold that the current results do not meet

Ed Note Since Virginia is still technically undeclared I wont declare victory in my bet on the outcome with Dana Perino And though Im not worried about having to start finding a silkscreen shop to make my Jasper for President shirt Dana deserves lavish praise for seeing potential in Gillespies race when I saw none I thought she was just following her heart but I should have known better than to dismiss any insight from one of the sharpest minds I know

LANDRIEU DEFENSELESS WITHOUT GAVEL
The Hill Sen Mary Landrieu DLa didnt lose her reelection race Tuesday but she did lose her powers as chairwoman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee leaving her with little leverage going into a December runoff Landrieu will square off against Rep Bill Cassidy RLa in a Dec6 runoff but now she cant wave her committee gavel as a symbol of the influence she wields in Washington DC and offer its benefits to Louisiana voters heading into a runoff makes the race an entirely different story as Democrats have long admitted their best bet at a win in Louisiana was on Election Day The narrative has certainly changed J Bennett Johnston Jr a former Louisiana Democratic senator who held the same chairmanship when he was in office said

 Better to have scorched earth than scorched bacon     DEMS LAST DITCH HOPE FORCE A SHUTDOWN TO SAVE THE SENATE
Can Democrats troll their way to survival in the coming midterm elections Its what Marc Ambinder calls the last best hope for Democrats to save the Senate The plan calls for broad executive action by President Obama to legalize illegal immigrants to goad Republicans into a similar fight as last years failed effort to strip funding from ObamaCare The next shutdown deadline comes on Sept 30 and if the president drops his executive action on immigration on schedule end of the summer it would be just in time to chum the water ahead of votes on a shortterm budget measure Ambinder writes Go big on immigration Wait for the GOP counterreaction Quietly pray for the government to get shut down Use it like a cattle prod to wake voters up just before the midterms

Rep Luis Gutierrez DIll who says hes been listening very carefully in meetings at the White House hinted to Sean Hannity that he believes over six million undocumented workers will be granted amnesty by the president

Hitting the sweet spot  The president would need to find a sweet spot in which his allies in big business and his liberal base both like the action but it doesnt create further uproar among Democratic Senate candidates who are taking increasingly harsh lines against Obamas vaunted pen power Georgia Senate nominee Michelle Nunn Alaska Sen Mark Begich North Carolina Sen Kay Hagan Arkansas Sen Mark Pryor and Louisiana Sen Mary Landrieu have all raised warnings about executive overreach Its not surprising If Obama goes too far the voter backlash could be intense Fashioning the kind of action that can please business activists and red state Democrats is no easy task especially since Obama will need some legal defense in order to not have a court toss it out before the plan can even get started

Daily Caller Close to 80 organizations including the National Council of La Raza and the AFLCIO are asking the administration to allow illegal immigrants who are granted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA status to seek health coverage on Obamacare exchanges

Fantasyland  Obama could hit a holeinone in  please his businessactivist coalition but still manage to enrage conservatives enough to demand a shutdown to block the president Thats the scenario that is providing some comfort to Democrats these days but as we see on other issues Democratic unity is no sure bet these days The most likely scenario seems to be that Obama comes up with something unsatisfying to most involved and that Speaker John Boehner can convince his members to deny Democrats a shutdown just ahead of the election but stranger things have happened Not many though

ENDANGERED DEMS NAME AND SHAME OBAMA ON GLOBAL WARMING EXECUTIVE ACTION
Washington Examiner Sen Mary Landrieu DLa chairwoman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is warning the president against agreeing to any climate pact that would negotiate away the nations growing energy sector And Rep Nick Rahall DWVa pledged to work with Congress to do everything we can to stop executive branch moves that hurt the coal industry It is important that all nations do what they can to reduce carbon in the atmosphere Landrieu said in a statement But the president should not take any action that undermines the American Energy Revolution currently underway that is creating thousands of highpaying jobs for middleclass families in Louisiana and across the country

Bad timing  Politico today rhapsodizes about how Rep Gary Peters who is struggling to hold a Senate seat for Democrats in Michigan is an outlier in his party on the issue of global warming Peters is under fire for investments that dont match his environmental rhetoric and for doing the bidding of political patrons

A new ad launched by the National Republican Senatorial Committee seeks to paint Peters as out of touch for supporting the Wall Street bailout that benefitted his old company Democrats meanwhile are returning to abortion attacks on Republican nominee Terri Lynn Land

DEMANDS GROW FOR SYRIA AUTHORIZATION
While Democrats are pinning their hopes to save the Senate on a government shutdown they may not have noticed the growing fight over whether the president needs congressional authority to expand his air war against Islamist militants across the Iraq border to Syria AP reports that one way around congressional authorization for the escalation would be to obtain backchannel consent to American attacks from the genocidal dictator Bashar al Assad If the administrations claims are as reedy as that count on serious bipartisan blowback 

Rand smacks Hillary on Syria stance  In a WSJ OpEd Sen Rand Paul RKy argues that interventionist like 2016 frontrunner Hillary Clinton have aided the rise of the terror group ISIS To interventionists like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton we would caution that arming the Islamic rebels in Syria created a haven for the Islamic State We are lucky Mrs Clinton didnt get her way and the Obama administration did not bring about regime change in Syria That new regime might well be ISIS

Chillax  The indispensable Sean Trende of RCP has a message for all those who are discounting the idea of a Republican wave election Chill Trendes point is that its too soon to say and that defining a wave is subjective anyway A gain of five seats for the GOP the lowend expectation for Republicans would be huge by historical standards but if the media metric sets the bar at eight seats this cycle then the wave is called a ripple So to a certain degree I think the question of why we dont see a wave today involves a false premise We see evidence of one right now I suspect our expectations for a 2014 wave were simply set too high during the Obamacare rollout

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/11/03/is-kentucky-poised-to-be-newest-right-to-work-state/,Nov 3 2014 Phinis Hundley a labor organizer for Kentucky Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes puts out a campaign sign in front of the United Auto Workers hall WASHINGTON  As the hardhitting contest between Mitch McConnell and Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes hogs all the attention in Kentucky another potential battle is brewing at the state legislative level that could change the labor landscape in Coal Country Kentucky is one of the last remaining prounion holdouts in the South that does not have a socalled righttowork law  or law allowing workers not to pay union dues if they dont want to     But if Republicans do well in the state legislative races in Kentucky the Bluegrass State could become the new face of the righttowork movement The GOP holds a majority in the Kentucky Senate and needs to win only five House seats to secure a majority in that chamber If that happens Republicans are poised to push through a list of stalled conservative measures  including a right to work bill telephone deregulation and antiabortion legislation Kentucky Senate Majority Leader Damon Thayer has already gone on the record to say if both the state House and Senate go Republican the first order of business will be getting a righttowork bill passed This possibility has pro and antiunion groups pitted against each other in Kentuckys legislative contests With more than 194000 union members if the state flips on righttowork it would deal a big blow to the power of organized labor in Coal Country In a state like Kentucky you have a lot of union money coming in Patrick Semmens spokesman at the National Right to Work Committee told FoxNewscom adding that union bosses are trying to send a message by spending money on the elections According to the Center for Responsive Politics unions accounted for 17 percent of all outside spending in the 2012 elections The Bureau of Labor Statistics says unions represented 11 percent of the nations workforce in 2013 down from 20 percent in 1980 Kentucky has a Democratic governor but that may be no obstacle for a GOPled Legislature Kentucky law allows the state Legislature to override a gubernatorial veto with a simple majority in both houses The last time Republicans held a majority in the state House was in 1921 Currently 24 states have passed Right to Work laws Labor unions still operate in those states but workers cannot be forced to join as a requirement of their job according to the National Conference of State Legislatures All we want is a fair wage decent benefits and respect on the job Shannon McMurray a member of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 227 wrote in an opinion piece in The CourierJournal Our employer is making profits and I happen to think a happy healthy unionized workforce is a big reason why Right to work assumes that business and labor are unable to bargain a fair contract without the assistance of a bureaucrat I think in Kentucky we do just fine on our own Prounion Democrats across the state have been targeted for their opposition to righttowork laws An August Bluegrass Poll sponsored by the Lexington Herald Leader the CourierJournal WKYTTV and WHASTV showed 55 percent of registered voters were in support of righttowork laws while only 28 percent wanted to keep Kentuckys laws the way it has been McConnell has sponsored a federal righttowork law His opponent Grimes has publicly come out against the righttowork campaign calling it the righttoworkforless measure The first righttowork laws were passed in the 1940s and 1950s predominantly in Southern states according to the National Conference of State LegislaturesMost of those laws were enacted by statute but 10 states adopted it via constitutional amendments Interest in the issue surged in the 1970s and again in the 1990s,2014-11-03T15:16-05:00,abortion
Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/24/narrow-path-to-victory-dems-fight-to-keep-control-senate-in-final-week/, Amid all the predictions of a Republicanled stomping on Election Day Democrats and the outside groups supporting them still see a path to victory and are planning a blitz in key states that could act as a firewall against a GOP Senate takeover As the campaign enters its final full week Democrats also are trying to keep Republican attacks at bay by focusing on local issues  as opposed to President Obama  and are training resources on getting out the vote including with early voting     Republicans continue to voice confidence about their chances and political prognosticators largely predict the GOP will control Congress next year But Democrats are staying focused  Justin Barasky at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee pointed to key races where despite what Republicans are saying about Obama being an albatross the numbers appear to be improving for the Democrats That includes Democrat Michelle Nunn in her race against Republican David Perdue for the open Senate seat in Georgia Recent polls have shown her up by a few points though the race still is very close  and the winner needs over 50 percent to avoid a runoff Another open question is Kentucky where Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes has endured a rough few weeks in her race against Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell But the DSCC after letting its previous ad buy expire now is going back on air in the state in support of Grimes with a 650000 purchase The race is closing Barasky said I think Kentucky voters are sick of Mitch McConnell He added that in every state the message will be different but it invariably will concentrate on Democrats fighting for the middle class while painting their opponents as subservient to outside interests McConnells campaign has pushed back hard on the contention that Grimes may be gaining releasing its own numbers showing the incumbent well ahead Grimes lately had been tripped up on the campaign trial after refusing to say if she voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012 reflecting the mine field that Democrats everywhere are facing over their ties to the president The Obama factor alone is one of the biggest challenges for many Democrats in battleground states Bill Scher senior writer for the progressive Campaign for Americas Future acknowledged they are not asking him to stand with them on the stage together However he noted even though there is dissonance going on personally with Obama its not like they are abandoning what they believe This is nothing new at the end of President George W Bushs term he was so much of a drag on GOP tickets that he was barely mentioned during the Republican National Convention in 2008 The Obama factor though is used as a bludgeon in almost every competitive Senate race this year by Republicans Sen Mark Begich DAlaska who is in a tossup race with Republican Dan Sullivan told the Washington Examiner the presidents not relevant to his race Hes gone in two years he said When asked in a recent television interview if he is a strong leader endangered North Carolina Democratic Sen Kay Hagan couldnt seem to think of any issues where the president has shined Hes got a lot on his plate she said before stumbling through the rest of her response Barasky insists these races will be won on local issues and not on any national narrative driven by the GOP To advance their message in critical states some candidates have brought in the big guns  not Obama but figures like Bill and Hillary Clinton  who have been barnstorming across the country stumping and fundraising on Democrats behalf In just the last week this included stops for Grimes Sen Al Franken in Minnesota Sen Mark Udall in Colorado Sen Mark Pryor in Arkansas and a number of gubernatorial candidates Mrs Clinton is scheduled to make appearances this weekend for Hagan and Sen Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire Shaheen though is seeing Republican Scott Brown make significant gains in the polls Hillary Clinton recently raised 35 million in California for the campaign committees of House and Senate Democrats including 21 million at a Hollywood event with Democratic megadonors Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg In close races like Arkansas Bill Clinton is as good a trump card as they can play to inoculate Mark Pryor from Obama there points out political strategist Dan Gerstein Clinton makes the race more about Arkansas Most importantly appearances by Alisters can help not so much draw undecided voters to the Democratic candidate but mobilize the troops Gerstein said Getting out the vote in a typically sluggish midterm election is critical Traditional constituencies like black and women voters are being targeted with television and radio ads to make sure they turn out Particularly with women Democrats are feeling the heat as recent polling shows Republicans closing the gender gap in Colorado New Hampshire and Iowa despite attempts to rally women on issues relating to contraception and abortion rights With black voters The New York Times reported that Obama had also launched an undertheradar campaign including video ads and outreach to reporters to ensure that millions of black voters go to the polls in states where they will make a big difference specifically Georgia and North Carolina On Fox News Sunday the heads of the two parties each voiced confidence about their chances Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the GOP absolutely will take the Senate We feel really good about our chances of taking the Senate And its partly because number one the president has taken the country in the wrong direction These lieutenants out there across the country have followed the president off the plank he said His Democratic counterpart Debbie Wasserman Schultz claimed Democrats would hold their ground and not give the GOP the six seats it needs to take control The one question that voters are going to ask themselves  is who has my back And on issue after issue Democrats have stood up for jobs for the economy for investing in education and health care those are the issues that voters are talking about she said She cited Georgia and also South Dakota and Kansas  where independent candidates have caused problems for the GOP nominees  as battlegrounds in the final stretch But even Democrats acknowledge Republicans appear to have the enthusiasm edge  something that recent polling underscores The side with the more energy is going to have an advantage and at this rate in the states that are in play the Republicans have the advantage because there is so much negative energy toward the president Gerstein said So the Democrats are doing whatever they can do to get their base out plus whatever they can do to prevent Democraticleaning voters and independents from voting Republican,2014-10-24T13:39-04:00,abortion

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/04/16/will-census-changes-obscure-truth-about-obamacare/,This is a rush transcript from The Five April 16 2014 This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated DANA PERINO COHOST Hello everyone Im Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle Bob Beckel Eric Bolling and Greg Gutfeld     Its 5 oclock in New York City and this is The Five MUSIC PERINO After more than two decades the Census Bureau is significantly changing how it will survey Americans on health care The New York Times is reporting that the changes are so thorough that they could mask the true effects of ObamaCare on insurance coverage You might remember back in 2009 the White House shifted control over the census from the Commerce Department to the West Wing At the time conservatives like Karl Rove INAUDIBLE the move created a dangerous political precedent Remember this BEGIN VIDEO CLIP KARL ROVE FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR The Census Bureau thing is a very bad thing For the White House to step in and first time in Americas history say that the president of the United States his chief of staff is going to have direct oversight and supervision of the census raises questions about its politicization END VIDEO CLIP PERINO But those concerns were dismissed repeatedly by the administration BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ROBERT GIBBS FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY The president understands the benefit of an accurate and independent census count and I think the American people can be assured thats what theyll get UNIDENTIFIED MALE You wont politicize the census DAVID AXELROD FORMER SENIOR WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR Absolutely not	Absolutely not We are interested in the best census ever and a census that reflects as accurately as possible the true population of this country END VIDEO CLIP PERINO So Greg were conservatives wrong to be paranoid GREG GUTFELD COHOST Census more like noncensus Am I right America Look this is purely a coincidence Surely the census wouldnt change its questions to help Obama I mean a government agency trying to preserve government power The next thing youre going to tell me is the IRS targeted groups or the media pushed off news on Benghazi so Obama would be reelected This is about as intentional as a moon landing They didnt cook the books for Obama They actually nuked them PERINO And why Eric why did it matter to policymakers who are trying to make decisions or business decisions Why would something like this matter if the census professionals think they need to change the questions so they are more accurate why not do it ERIC BOLLING COHOST Because you can get the result you want based on how you asked the question Bob is a big pollster He knows exactly how to get the result he wants right from the very beginning or at least skew it as much as you can So they skew the books they cook the books on that they cook the books on whos paid they cook the books on who is young whos signing up they cook the books on whos Medicaid versus an actual enrollee They cook the books on everything and the audacity of the political chicanery that got going on the only loser ask why it matters is American people	American people at the end of the day are paying so much more money and we havent talk about When all is said and done Im not sure if its done or not if someone is going to have to pay for all those Medicaid recipients and the few people who signed up theyre certainly not going to be able to pay for that So what do you do You have to write the check The Treasury Department is going to have to write the check to pay for all those health care costs that run through ObamaCare Thats why it matters PERINO Bob its unusual for the counsel on the economic advisers that the White House to actually meddle with and create questions for the census to ask I mean does that cross a line in your world BOB BECKEL COHOST Well first of all Im amazed how many cooks there are in the White House that Eric refers to They must be working overtime This issue has gone back the question about insurance  a number of other questions about the census have gone back and been debated for years and years well before Obama was in office This issue about insurance people who re insured and uninsured goes before Obama was in office I think the idea that the census would be on the Commerce Department originally it was meant to be there because it was used exactly for that for business purposes If they had a much more widespread use and the Office of Management and Budget would be the proper base to write it off and thats what it should be PERINO OK Let me ask Kimberly on this issue In particularly theres the census one of the things that we argue in the leadup to ObamaCare was about the 40 million to 45 million people that were uninsured that will then all of a sudden get insurance because of ObamaCare implementation Thats actually the number that apparently were never actually going to be able to determine with specifics And the White House says thats not exactly true But I think that theres enough concern here for  thats warranted on the merits KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE COHOST I think you are absolutely right and they should be concerned actually The concern shouldnt be coming from the outside It should be come from within And they should be invested in making sure that they get numbers that are accurate that can be helpful for the future of this country so they were not trying to play games especially where finances are concerned because we will pay the price later on and thats whats most disconcerting  PERINO Yes and actually the numbers  GUILFOYLE The cause from this administration to worry about them PERINO And apples to apples comparison actually could end up working in their favor actually I mean I think its unlikely but it could BECKEL What was your assumption that it was right to begin with BOLLING May I BECKEL Yes please BOLLING President Obama went to the American people and said this will not cost one single dime will not add one single dime to the deficit GUILFOYLE Back it up BOLLING Do you remember that Well the latest numbers are almost	2 trillion over ten years That sounds like more than one single dime BECKEL Didnt the CBO just come out and  BOLLING Yes they dropped it from 18 trillion the 17 trillion 	 BECKEL Arent the insurance companies very happy with ObamaCare BOLLING That I dont know about that Im not so sure I know the American people cant be thrilled about 2 trillion BECKEL Well we have to look on the road 10 years and find if this cost them more money GUTFELD But you cant PERINO Thats the point Bob Theyre changing  GUTFELD The Census is helping to bury the rotting corpse of ObamaCare and the media will be the accessory to this by saying oh theres nothing to see here This is the only way government can win is by obliterating any metrics for success If you cant keep score theres no way you can lose PERINO Thats true OK Lets do a second topic thats ObamaCarerelated So last week we talk about the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius Shes from Kansas Theres rumors today that she actually might decide to run for Senate there Bob I think thats probably unlikely You are closely to the Democrats what do you think BECKEL I think its  thinking about it Its a pipe dream Her favorability there is 35 percent  PERINO She did win She was a governor  BECKEL She was the governor Lets remember there hasnt been a Democratic senator in that state for four decades GUILFOYLE What have you done for me lately Oh Im sorry destroy the world I mean shes not exactly If Roberts were to get upset whos the incumbent senator get upset by a Tea Party candidate she cant wait for that to happen because she has to file before it happens I cant imagine its true PERINO Eric is this a good example of how ObamaCare is actually affecting Democrats and might affect the 2014 races and maybe even all the way to 2016 BOLLING I think what shes doing is she got asked to leave shes saying you know what OK fine Im going to leave Im going to run for the Senate Every Democratic is going now oh no Kathleen Sebelius is going to run for the Senate Let me guess  everything Shes going to ObamaCare right to the table GUILFOYLE Shes an albatross Shes going to bring everybody down with her BOLLING The single race is going to be about ObamaCare again and thats what they dont want They thought they got a win with the 71 million enrollees And they were hoping that would just go away What she did  look what were talking about	PERINO Yes its back on the front page Would you encourage her to run in Kansas GUTFELD Yes because shes got such an amazing personal She just glows No Sebelius is Irish for incompetent so bad  GUILFOYLE Hey GUTFELD  you should seek shelter immediately Shes not a politician Shes a tornado of stoic failure It makes  it raises the question what does it take to be considered not eligible for politics We need a term called the Sebelius curve If you actually approach her level of idiocy you get a resort You get beach front property in Boca Raton And we just make sure youre in constant  PERINO OK But is she getting more heat than they deserves because she didnt write ObamaCare That was President Obama and Speaker Pelosi	I mean she was an implementer of what turned out to be  GUILFOYLE Of disaster I mean shes like her own hurricane right contain in one body Problem is Bob this was her job She was supposed to oversee it It was supposed to be ready for prime time So it does rest on her shoulders That was her job description So now if you want to reward failure again which seems to be like sort of the fun weird thing to do these days  go ahead In my opinion run Forrest run Run Kathy BECKEL The problem with you antiObamaCare people is that you are bearing it already As if theres no chance of being successful when every day theres more evidence that it is But let me tell you why she should not run in that state Theres a good chance that the Democrats could get the governors mansion back If shes on the ballot thats not going to be a drag no question GUILFOYLE Its not going to happen PERINO And why Bob BOLLING Why Exactly PERINO Because it would make it a national race BECKEL Look Ive said this from the beginning I think there will be an effective ObamaCare I dont think its going to be a disaster like you think But I think it will matter by three or four points and it could drag on the ticket BOLLING Where  you said she didnt  by the way your premise was well she didnt really write it So she was only really responsible for implementing it PERINO Right BOLLING And she bungled that amazingly 700 million and they signed up less than 2 million people If thats what you need to do to become a US senator boy there are a lot of conservatives that shouldnt be in the running CROSSTALK PERINO I think it was a trial balloon I dont think its real GUTFELD The trial balloon was a Hindenburg PERINO And its going to come crashing down BECKEL That was very good Greg GUTFELD There you go PERINO I get it All right Were going to move on Next on The Five the Red Hot Chili Peppers may have helped fight the war on terror But one of the band members wasnt happy when he found out about that and Greg is going to tell you why coming up COMMERCIAL BREAK GUTFELD So last week awful singer Cat Stevens made it into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame I know its like inducting Ex Lax into the chocolate hall of fame Now Stevens became Yusuf Islam in 1978 after converting to his last name and the hall of fame praised change writing quote Who can measure the courage it took him in the late 70s to convert to Islam amidst the wave of turmoil and confusion engulfing the world Yes who could measure the courage of filing out paperwork at a courthouse More important Mr Islam is not only known for music that drives birds to suicide but also for endorsing a fatwa on Salman Rushdie after a price was put on his head for writing a book critical of Islam	The ayatollah wanted Rushdie dead and Cat heard his approval So while Brandeis University denies Hirsi Ali a degree someone who stands up to death threats the Hall of Frame praises a fool who endorsed them So in the fan house mirror called Islamophobia we shame the victim not the victimizer If you ask me whats worse Cats beliefs or his music  Id say both One wants you dead the other when played makes you wish you were dead Lastly it was reported Red Hot Chili Peppers music if you can call it that was used to torture detainees held by the CIA and Flea their bassist is furious saying Anything we can do to stop that we will I hope that means retirement CROSSTALK GUTFELD So if you  what kind of music would you choose to torture somebody with GUILFOYLE Well if Red Hot Chili Peppers works Im all for it GUTFELD They should be proud they are helping their country GUILFOYLE Yes I mean I enjoy their music So thats great But apparently detainees or bad guys dont PERINO If terrorists dont like your music that should be a good thing Id be celebrating GUTFELD Its like a good housekeeping seal from terrorists GUILFOYLE Its like good versus evil Were the good guys Weve got to give music and it irritates the bad guys GUTFELD I know Eric this hits you hard You are a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan BOLLIG Big fan Yes Instead I would  I agree with this list of other bands that would torture terrorists anything by Barry Manilow I agree that Whats the Barney CROSSTALK BECKEL The Dinosaur ph BOLLING Yes The Dinosaur BECKEL He should have been shot a long time ago BOLLING The Beatles if I was in jail and they said torture Bolling just play Beatles music  GUILFOYLE Can I second that CROSSTALK GUTFELD Beatles are the one of the most brilliant bands ever BOLLING The Beatles were now it would be like One Direction and you would hate it GUTFELD No thats not true BOLLING Absolutely true CROSSTALK BECKEL Youre going with their first two or three songs you dont take into account the white out great the whole time And I dont know nothing about music You know I would not  like torture with opera or any rap music PERINO Also and heavy metal for me CROSSTALK GUTFELD Heavy metal is the most honest music on the planet PERINO I would spill the beans in half a second if they started playing heavy metal GUTFELD Spill the beans of euphemism Anyway I would pick Sting I love the Police but I hate Sting PERINO Isnt that weird GUTFELD Yes it is weird PERINO And you cant take the Sting out of the Police BECKEL Associated with Sting the Police GUTFELD But he was in the Police Bob GUILFOYLE Why dont they just play like Justin Bieber PERINO That would do it GUILFOYLE Hes annoying GUTFELD So lets talk a bit about Yusuf Islam Should the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Kimberly have included him even though hes kind of distanced himself with fatwa  PERINO Right right GUTFELD Hes nicer now GUILFOYLE Hes less vocal hes a milder meeker person at this point But you know what You cant degrade his ability or talent or influence on music So I would like to think as a free thinking country that you can have somebody put in the Hall of Fame based on merits regardless of their personal beliefs How is that answer GUTFELD Thats pretty good diplomatic answer although Cat Stevens music is terrible PERINO I cant name a single song Sorry CROSSTALK GUTFELD Its what you played on a date to get a girl to make out with you PERINO I never did that So thats why I dont know CROSSTALK GUILFOYLE Oh my God Really PERINO Wow Learn something every day on The Five about our co hosts GUILFOYLE Bolling is loving living in the past GUTFELD I think you are thinking about Harry Chapin BECKEL Thats right Sorry CROSSTALK BECKEL Is he a Muslim GUTFELD No I think hes dead BECKEL Oh he is Oh sorry to hear that PERINO To your point conservatives who complain that people like Ali or Condi Rice when Rutgers were complaining about her going to the university conservatives who complain that should not complain about Cat Stevens getting an award Like if they want to give him an award Great	I mean its like he actually has hurt anybody GUTFELD Why would you give up a name like Cat Stevens PERINO No kidding BECKEL Why do you get a name like Cat Stevens GUTFELD To a similar topic the New York Police Department disbanded a special unit made to detect terror threats in the Muslim communities Eric I happen to think its a casualty of Islamophobiaphobia BOLLING Probably GUTFELD People dont want to be smeared as bigoted so they got rid of the program Do we even know that it didnt work I dont know BOLLING Well remember the whole  you know the whole thing going back and forth between the NYPD and New Jersey and the FBI was trying to get involved and all that So they decided it was probably just not worth the negative PR and Im sure CAIR was right there leading the charge to get rid of them and cheering that decision all along Regarding that listen Im very much proFourth Amendment But when you have a threat to Americans these groups are threatening Americans and have killed a lot of Americans  Im all for it tap it listen to it and see what theyre talking about even if you dont have a singular threat find out take a broader cloth  broader net and grab a bunch BECKEL I was against this project when I first heard about it a year ago I changed my opinion on it Just too many  based on the fact that theres 15 million Muslims here on student visa that never showed up to college thats enough for me GUTFELD De Blasio had something to say about this program Do we have some kind of quote that I can read off the teleprompter This reform is a critical step forward in easing tensions I hate the phrase easing tensions PERINO He didnt say that though GUTFELD That means  what PERINO I was saying he didnt say he hates the phrase easing tension GUTFELD Oh I hate it Easing tensions is a means translate into appeasing PC  sorry I lost my way In easing tensions between the police and the communities they serve so the cops they are called police and our citizens can help one another go after the real bad guys GUILFOYLE They are afraid of the real bad guys He doesnt know what hes talking about because he doesnt have any experience whatsoever in this community policing and what they do with this program But good luck lets see how this turns out The only vote of confidence I can say is Bill Bratton who is a tremendous  GUTFELD Good guy GUILFOYLE Good guy great job  PERINO But he just caved GUILFOYLE  in Los Angeles No but the point is hes going to be overseeing the department in general Perhaps they dont do it under the guise of this organization or group of 28 team members Perhaps they will do it under a different group In some other way they will look for leads like this Im confident its not going to be undetected PERINO I think its very strange that the New York Police Department decided to announce this yesterday which was the anniversary of Boston marathon bombing CROSSTALK PERINO It has no sense And I also think that we wont know the implications of this for many many years and it will be too late BOLLING Unless the FBI said well take care of this We got this	Remember there was an issue between the FBI and the NYPD CROSSTALK BOLLING I feel like the NYPD should be in charge because they know the community better GUILFOYLE They are closer to it Thats the point because community policing and on target but just so you know your friends at the NSA are watching you So they are doing it too BECKEL If you believe as I do that the next serious attack on the United States is from people who are already here then we talk about that other day that more than likely you have terrorists here that are getting influenced here to do their job then I think that makes all the more reason to look into it GUTFELD By the way the police dont like those details I mean hanging out in community centers all day and mosques BECKEL And having to eat lamb GUTFELD Yes I hate lamb BECKEL I do too GUILFOYLE I love lamb I always have it on my birthday GUTFELD Yes the smell of lamb GUIFOYLE Why dont you BECKEL You eat chickpeas GUTFELD I dont mind chickpeas BECKEL Really PERINO Bob chickpeas you mean hummus BECKEL Hummus yes I like hummus BOLLING I think its made out of chickpeas PERINO It is GUTFELD We are expert in music and in food GUILFOYLE And in cultural sensitivity CROSSTALK BECKEL Grape leaves GUTFELD There you go CROSSTALK GUTFELD Eric have you ever  GUILFOYLE You are talking about Greek food now BECKEL Oh I am CROSSTALK GUTFELD Have you ever heard Anthony Kiedis order a sandwich BOLLING Hows hes doing Greg GUTFELD Mayo and tomato and pimento BECKEL Whos that CROSSTALK GUTFELD Coming up Michael Bloomberg 50 million What is the name of that song BOLLING Snow GUTFELD Snow See I wouldnt know because Im a Faith No More fan PERINO I just got it BECKEL Faith No More what GUTFELD All right Bloombergs 50 million war against the NRA and he thinks it will get him into heaven Can you believe that Well talk next COMMERCIAL BREAK BOLLING Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg likes to take things away from people Big Gulps cigarettes and guess what Now guns The billionaire just announced he is taking 50 million out of his own bank account to create a gun control network to outmuscle the NRA Heres Bloomy with more on his plan BEGIN VIDEO CLIP MICHAEL BLOOMBERG FORMER NYC MAYOR This is not a battle of dollars	This is a battle for the hearts and minds of America so that we can protect our children protect innocent people It isnt gun control This is simply making sure that people should no be allowed to buy a gun  criminals minors people with psychiatric problems  make sure they cant buy guns Nobody is going to take anybodys gun away nobody is going to keep you from hunting or target practice or protecting yourself Its just making sure that a handful of people who we all agree shouldnt have guns dont get their hands on it END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Look Im all for KG  GUILFOYLE Yes BOLLING  its your money he earned it He made himself Spend the way you like But the difference when a guy like David Koch does it hes villainized Hes unAmerican Bloomberg does it everyone said oh great job mayor Thank you GUILFOYLE All right Well lets see I think his heart is the right place but is he putting his money in the right spot Because the rules and laws already on the books OK to prevent people from getting guns from getting them But as we well know if you want to get a gun youre going to find a way to go around the law go around the rules and break them and find a way to get a weapon So Im not sure that his 50 million is best spent in this direction I can think of a lot of other ways he could use it BOLLING Bobby you are shaking your head BECKEL Well first of all I applaud the mayor for doing this And by the way I said 15 million students its just 15000 I apologize for that But then again Im  LAUGHTER GUTFELD Thats a small  three zeros GUILFOYLE Why did you even bring it up CROSSTALK BECKEL Its a lot of students ph out there man Come on Look I think what Bloomberg is talking about here Hes not trying to take peoples away but trying to keep the hands out of people who shouldnt have them In fact they dont have laws for example in Virginia If you have psychiatric problems theres no law that says you cant buy a gun Witness what happened at Virginia Tech when all those people were killed by that fruitcake who bought guns legally The other thing is NRA needs some competition CROSSTALK BECKEL I know they  I said he was Canadian I know you changed my opinion on that slightly but I would like to see a birth certificate if I could BOLLING Dana Im pretty sure Bob is not exactly right GUILFOYLE Oh really BOLLING Not only talking about this 15000 and 15 million Muslims PERINO Yes BOLLING Heres the thing Whats the UNINTELLIGIBLE PERINO Well Merina ph said theres a lot of PR consultants right now who are very excited thinking theyre going to keep their hands on 50 million so that they can keep their pyramid schemes going He made the money He inherited the money He earned the money He wants to spend it all the time Absolutely fine But if Harry Reid is going to go to the floor of the Senate and 150 say times how unAmerican it is for someone to spend their personal hard earned dollars on a public policy issue that they care about Thats what they did with the Koch brothers But maybe this is an issue they can get behind I dont know if its great for redstate Democrats actually especially in 2014 for this issue to be on the forefront But that might be what hes deciding to do If I had that much money I would spend it differently I would focus on veterans especially those with PTSD and Id also maybe do something that Bloomberg could do it well something for the longterm unemployed BOLLING Or education You havent said education PERINO Id let other people do education BOLLING You want to do this You want to do what he said later GUTFELD He  he took his security police detail with him after leaving his job He doesnt need a gun when he has that kind of detail packing for him Hes like a nudist accusing you of exhibitionism He lives in a gun bubble Hes surrounded by guns His life is not a gun free zone but he wants yours to be The problem with him is the more the facts undermine the more money he throws at it You know gun  John Lott ph got this statistic Gun control groups outspend gun rights groups 7 to 1 on TV ads But they never work Its because theyre up against facts that gun violence is declining in the areas they say are increasing And a lot of it has to do with BECKEL It has been  quickly point out that the people on this committee with him are Tom Ridge who was homeland security adviser under George W Bush and Admiral Mike Mullen who was the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under Bush So I mean this is not a bunch of fruit cakes out here trying to take away your guns GUTFELD But this is about he  this is about the NRA to him Hes outspending the NRA like 2 to 1 Right The NRA doesnt have a budget like he does BECKEL Oh yes GUTFELD No its true Im just thinking about numbers BOLLING I think we have  we have a full screen Im going to put up I think this is probably a lot of the motivation right here	Bloomberg says quote If there is a God when I get to heaven Im not stopping to be interviewed Im heading straight in I have earned my place in heaven Its not even close GUILFOYLE That is so wow BOLLING The guy has got something like 30 billion It seems to me like hes trying to you know shore up his legacy GUILFOYLE Look maybe hell get into heaven one of the things they look for in the checklist is are you bragging about getting into heaven	I just would never say that That would be so  what GUTFELD Youre talking about a club in the Village BOLLING The Heaven Club GUTFELD Its really hard to get into BOLLING Straight GUTFELD Yes straight Its really hard to get into So I think just you know PERINO You just walk right in BECKEL Well GUILFOYLE Well you know what BECKEL Its weird that he would say it Heres the thing that gets me about it If hes going to do that and says that if there is a God Im not sure if you should be talking about heaven if you dont believe there is a God GUILFOYLE And then say youre getting in Its just weird A lot of you people say around the table its weird BOLLING I thought you were not supposed to mix religion and politics PERINO Well I wouldnt I found this odd I found they had a wonderful rollout He sounds perfectly reasonable on the show Most people are going to agree with it And then he just has to go that one step further you know like that just one more thing and then he says that and it makes everybody go What in the world GUILFOYLE You know why You dont talk past the sale PERINO Exactly GUILFOYLE Dont  dont ever GUTFELD I have to give him credit for one thing Hes consistent	Hes consistent in the sense that hes not just going  and hes not going after the NRA which I  you know criticized He also was for stop and frisk so he has adapted his anti  hes adapted his antigun stance in most areas where hes not cherrypicking the way a lot of people do I have to give him credit BOLLING Can I have one of those little sayings GUILFOYLE Sure BOLLING You never hear about a mass shooting at a gun show All right next Its one of the biggest crime stories of the century	A studio is supporting  they want to tell a story of  of the serial killer Sherman Gosnell Justify actor Nick Searcy wants to stop by and tell us why If I ever get that out COMMERCIAL BREAK GUILFOYLE He is one of the worlds biggest serial killers Abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell ran a house of horrors in Philadelphia He was convicted last year of murdering babies born alive Three filmmakers now want to tell his story but theyre not getting a lot of help from Hollywood to put it on the screen except for some brave actors like Justifieds Nick Searcy who are stepping out to lend their support BEGIN VIDEO CLIP NICK SEARCY ACTOR Im international film and television star Nick Searcy but you knew that You may not have heard of Kermit Gosnell but he is the most prolific serial killer in American history He killed hundreds of babies perhaps thousands in a 30year killing spree Thats why Im so glad that my friends Anne Falon ph and Magdalena are making this film Theyre journalists and filmmakers and their movie will tell the actual facts of the case without apology Facts have no agenda END VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE As you know I did cover this  the case and the story for The Five here and sitting in at the trial so this is something I speak of from personal experience having witnessed these horrors up on the screen and the testimony from the medical examiner So I think its you know an important film and you have also Kevin Sorbo actor who made a YouTube video about it talking about the film	Theyve raised 829695 with a grand total of 2100000 that theyre trying to do So its just interesting because the world of Hollywood will they be receptive This is supposed to be made as a television film to get the story out At the time we were one of few places that was actually covering it Dana and you saw this story was being talked about Because they were trying to make this story about our country ph PERINO So you were down there and I remember FOX covered it and then eventually some in the mainstream media tried to cover it And I understand it is a very hard story to tell Its not necessarily something that I would want to run out and go and see but I do admire people who want to try to get this story out there So theres a way to raise money for things on Web like Kickstarter	Kickstarter was where they first went to to get the funding They felt that they were being censored by Kickstarter so they left that and they went to something else called Indiegogo where theyre actually able to try to raise money I think Hollywood does a lot of movies about all sorts of things that are based in reality This is a story I think that we as Americans need to face up to and to witness GUILFOYLE Yes And were one of the few to cover it as we said and then do the documentary as well Eric FOX News covered it and went through all the detail and spoke to witnesses to bring it to life BOLLING Im just going to throw this Look I  its a tough subject to cover Its a hard subject to put on film Im guessing I think it needs  this story needs to be told but that said I think  I think thats exactly the way you do it Its called crowdfunding and you just put it out there and people come and they donate They believe in the cause They donate money There are a couple of other movies with a similar type of you know PERINO Funding mechanism BOLLING But also the  the editorial on it is so intense that movie studios tend to stay away Great way to do  to make a movie though if they are staying away GUTFELD The thing is I mean it is a brutal topic but so was Idi Amin So is Rwanda So is the Holocaust Hollywood has made movies that involved all of those topics The reason why they dont do this is its not because the evil is so grotesque Its that its too close to a moral choice theyve made	Thats what its about Its not that its so hard to do something on this man who butchered babies Its because its too close to the prochoice mindset Not to say that the big prochoice people are for this but it rubs people the wrong way when they hear this Thats my feeling BECKEL I had a hard time believing its that much mixed up in politics I think that its a business decision I mean who  how many people would actually go and see this GUTFELD Its a fair point Its GUILFOYLE Oh its going to be on TV GUTFELD But you have documentaries about capitalism and the Second Amendment and corporations Michael Moore has made a living exposing these things Why cant you do this PERINO Well the great things is its competition right So now that theres not  you dont  you have more options as a filmmaker and also as a consumer You have lots more choice and you have a lot of different ways to try to get your stories told Thats a great thing BECKEL Im for that The center stage is to have to be the operating room That would be the only place youd  you have to tell a story you have to tell it that way I just think GUTFELD The only time  and maybe Im wrong but the only time an abortion doctor has been in a movie its been in a favorable way from what I can remember PERINO And they being the ones being targeted GUTFELD Yes GUILFOYLE The point is its important to get both sides out there	And so people should inform themselves and understand exactly whats involved in the process and especially at what stage and gestational age	I think a lot of people are educated that were in that courtroom People had longheld beliefs had a change of heart after seeing some of the horrors that were committed BOLLING Wasnt  wasnt there a film made about the guy that was killing abortion doctors BECKEL Yes BOLLING I think there was So when it goes that way theyre PERINO They figure theyll make the money You dont have to go  you dont have to crowdfund in order to get something like that done And I admire Nick Searcy for stepping up and BECKEL Yes I do too GUILFOYLE And Kevin Sorbo youre my buddy All right Still ahead should alcohol should be allowed at gun ranges Well one shooting range in Oklahoma just applied for a liquor	license and Bob has got some thoughts about that next Stay with us COMMERCIAL BREAK MUSIC Drinking beer wasted bullet BECKEL Thats an appropriate song for this block In my favorite state of Oklahoma a shooting range is trying to get a liquor license to serve alcohol on site mixing guns and booze What could go wrong with that except a few people dying Apparently nothing according to coowner Jeff Swanson because he claims the two wont ever mix Go ahead Jeff Prove us that BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JEFF SWANSON COOWNER WILSHIRE GUNS As a group we wanted to build a place the first one in Oklahoma where you can come in shoot enjoy the retail area and then go to the cafe Any misconceptions or joking aside beer and bullets guns and alcohol they do not mix Once you order a drink your drivers license is scanned and you are redflagged and youre not allowed into any of the shooting facilities even as a spectator and certainly not as a shooter for the remainder of the day END VIDEO CLIP BECKEL Only  only in Oklahoma GUILFOYLE You know what Bob There you go BECKEL But there are nice people in Oklahoma GUILFOYLE I know there are BECKEL But are you kidding me Maybe he thinks hell make a lot of profit because people who have guns drink a lot I dont know I dont think thats necessarily true But can you believe hes doing this	Youre a big probusiness guy BOLLING Ive a probusiness guy Also Im a progun guy I spend a lot of time at the gun range and I like to drink GUILFOYLE Vodka BOLLING And I dont think theres a problem here BECKEL Well now theres an idea You have the gun and the vodka BOLLING Let me explain something the safest place  anywhere there is a gun the safest place it is in a gun range If youre going to have a gun be in the gun range Theres security around Theres more  I would venture nothing bad is going to happen Now if someone brings a gun into a bar where its a completely different environment and surroundings that may not be a good idea BECKEL Theyre allowed to do that in gun states like Texas BOLLING Youre allowed to do that BECKEL You can take a gun into a bar That makes a lot of sense PERINO But its his business so he is going  they are going to be highly motivated to make sure that it works and I think the private sector does a good job on that What I dont understand is people who lets just say youre for legalization of marijuana in one state like Colorado Whats wrong with this guy suggesting that there would be controls on a new way for him to grow his business BECKEL Because if they were smoking dope and they had guns they probably wouldnt use them PERINO Right GUILFOYLE Theres a bias  theres a bias for pot smokers BECKEL Let me just ask you This is a little strange GUTFELD Here in Oklahoma theyre introducing alcohol at the gun range where in other places theyre introducing guns in bars Thats called Chicago Look hes saying its separate You have a  youre scanned	Youre not allowed  in fact when you go to places like Malibu Grand Prix where you can race cars you can go there and then afterwards you can have beer And you dont mix the two Its not like a bowling alley GUILFOYLE Like a break room or something GUTFELD Yes This is basically what I would call redneck chum for northern folk who like to rag on the south GUILFOYLE Uhhuh BOLLING You know any of those GUTFELD Yes Theres one here GUILFOYLE I think its called CROSSTALK BOLLING What do you think BECKEL I dont I was just part of the old comparison GUILFOYLE I think that this is a little bit of a dangerous you know proposition All right BECKEL Good for you GUILFOYLE Im just going to say that PERINO But like I actually think that its a safer proposition than what people are probably doing when its not allowed GUILFOYLE Are you saying because its regulated BECKEL What about these gunnut legislators who pass guns in Texas so you can carry a gun into a bar BOLLING Well and thats  the point I was trying to make at the beginning is its a bar its a social atmosphere A lot of guys go there to meet women and someone else is meeting your woman and you get mad I mean the bar is a place where there are a lot of fights This is different This is a gun range You go there to practice your target You practice shooting your weapon PERINO And afterwards youre going to have a couple beers BOLLING And you can also have a beer BECKEL Off the set Im going to tell you how close this story just came in my previous life GUILFOYLE You mean this life PERINO Is that how you hurt your hand BECKEL No no It was angry husbands and guns in bars All right Anybody else have anything else to say about this topic	Also in the great state in Oklahoma do I have enough time for this OK	Good The great state of Oklahoma the governor the legislator wants to pass a law that said you cant raise minimum wage in your own city if you want to And various cities in Oklahoma are talking about raising the minimum wage which makes some sense This governor Fallin PERINO How sexist And racist of you Right How is anybody going to criticize this Republican woman governor How dare a liberal would do that Im just doing what liberals  Im just doing what liberals do to conservatives BECKEL I was just wondering if you were just trying to UNINTELLIGIBLE Because if you were Im out of here GUILFOYLE You confuse my poor Ricky Bobby PERINO Thats what liberals do to conservatives You just start calling people names BECKEL You think  Im not calling names PERINO I think shes an excellent governor and theres a reason that Oklahoma has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country GUILFOYLE Let me tell you something Dana was teasing you BECKEL All of these people for states rights and local rights if a locality wants to raise the minimum wage so what PERINO And if they want to serve beer at their gun range so what BOLLING No no youre making your own statement Your own case	Yes states rights She is the governor of a state They choose not to have a  raise the minimum wage GUILFOYLE But it should be at the state level BOLLING We agree Thank you GUILFOYLE They should decide GUTFELD I just say the only bad thing about Oklahoma is the musical PERINO singing Oklahoma BECKEL OK enough All right One More Thing is up next GUILFOYLE Thanks COMMERCIAL BREAK PERINO Its time for One More Thing  Bob BECKEL OK You guys want a hard time believing this Kentucky Fried Chicken has a new ad out for prom season Take a look at this GUILFOYLE So cool BEGIN VIDEO CLIP MUSIC BOY PUTS WRIST CORSAGE ON GIRL FEATURING A PIECE OF FRIED CHICKEN INSTEAD OF A FLOWER END VIDEO CLIP BECKEL Well it sort of reminds me as one of my former prom dates No as Greg pointed out to me if yours looks like that they give you a coupon or something But to advertise it like that who in their right mind would do something like that GUILFOYLE I think its so awesome Somebody PERINO Its smart enough to get on The Five GUILFOYLE By the way I would totally

Kimberly GUILFOYLE OK so I have a cute one But anyway so you know that Lorde the famous singer and her song Royals was actually based on a third baseman George Brett from the Royals And she saw him in a picture with the word Royals across and shaking hands and giving autographs She was thinking Royals what a cool word Then she asked to meet them and	they got this picture together BOLLING No way Theres no way she wrote the song about George	Brett GUILFOYLE No no no she didnt write the song about him She saw the word across his chest and she was inspired and loved the word PERINO Im skeptical Erics next BOLLING All right Lets get this in Very important FOX is launching a brandnew noon show Its four girls one guy and its called right there Outnumbered And guess who the stars are going to be Kimberly Guilfoyle our own Kimberly is going to be one of the  one of the out numbers Harris Faulkner Andrea Tantaros Sandra Smith Jedediah Bila Katie Pavlich and Kirsten Powers I hope I got everyone

in its final form and may be updated ERIC BOLLING COHOST Hello everyone Im Eric Bolling along	with Andrea Tantaros Bob Beckel Dana Perino and Tom Shillue     Its 5 oclock in New York City This is The Five MUSIC BOLLING Weve got some extreme video for you today First check	out this amazing video leaked to TMZ late yesterday It features music	mogul JayZ his megastar wife Beyonce and a very very perturbed Solange	Knowles Beyonces younger sister going off the rails on JayZ Check this out Theres Beyonce she gets on an elevator Then	Solange and now finally JayZ with a body guard And look at what	happens  Solange younger  again Beyonces young sister  starts	hitting JayZ Pocketbooks are flying The bodyguard tries to pull her	back Shes kicking him thered be another kick here in a second	Another kick there JayZ steps into it the doors close Now you got to keep watching this videotape because were going to	keep rolling it Were going to talk about it throw it around the table	but keep watching because it gets absolutely wild at the end of the video So Ands the Standard Hotel youve been there ANDREA TANTAROS COHOST Yes BOLLING They are in the afterparty for a classy ball and this goes	down Your thoughts TANTAROS OK So on the first contestant on the speculation game	Right When I first saw this video I had a visceral reaction as a sister	and anybody who has a sister who is really tight with their sister has a	gut feeling that this has nothing to do with Solange This has more to do	with JayZ and something happening with Beyonce And from my past	experience the only time Ive ever been fired up and not like that I	mean Ive thought about doing that to a man that my sister used to be	married to but I didnt  was because of an issue with another woman and	I think thats what this is about BOLLING Theres some speculation  TANTAROS This has to do with Rihanna BOLLING Rihanna right TANTAROS So thats just  thats breaking news And so I feel validated that my sisterly strategy here and insight	has played a role Maybe I was right BOLLING All roads lead back to Rihanna somewhere Bob you see Beyonce shes standing back Shes not really getting	in between her husband JayZ and her sister Solange BOB BECKEL COHOST We have some news to break here today It was	because jayz was having an affair with Solange did you know that DANA PERINO COHOST Bob TANTAROS You really have on the speculation game BECKEL Is that speculate I thought seriously how does TMZ get all this stuff is what I want	to know BOLLING Thats the question Bob BECKEL That is the elevator security system in the hotel And the	hotel said they were going to fire anybody who leaked it How in the world	does TMZ come up with this stuff TANTAROS Harry Levin is a genius BOLLING Yes TANTAROS He is a genius He founded TMZ BOLLING Yes he seems to break some of the biggest stories around Your thoughts on this wild video PERINO My thoughts are if this is the biggest thing  biggest	problem in America today its been a pretty good day I cannot  I mean	I get people magazine and I flip through it and I try to understand  it	seems to me like its a personal family issue not one I give a you know	what about BOLLING A couple of megastars though Tommy you want to weigh on	this TOM SHILLUE COHOST Well were wondering how this footage got	out Its not the actual footage from the machinery Someone is taking	their iPhone and they are filming the screen here OK So I dont know 	 you know it seems like  BOLLING Tommy I had to jump in here Im sorry Take a look here They are leaving the elevator here No no watch watch Solange	they are about to leave the elevator everything seems to have calmed down	Think again folks Just watch on the way out Ready  Booyah There we go again JayZ  CROSSTALK BOLLING And they get off the elevator like everything is OK SHILLUE He was provoking He said something to her I can see he	was facing her You know I got to hand to this  the bodyguard here	Hes more concerned  he doesnt really want to stop the fight He stops	the elevator He freezes the emergency stop because he wants the fight to	be contained in the elevator Hes doesnt want anybody to see it So hes more  hes less of a body guard and hes more like of a PR	guy or something He doesnt want the fight spilling out into the street PERINO He wears two hats TANTAROS He also didnt spring into action immediately which I	thought was a little odd Its almost like he thought that JayZ deserved	it and for Beyonce to be standing there so cool its almost like she was	looking at her sister going get him BECKEL Maybe the bodyguard had an affair with him maybe SHILLUE But wait a minute Andrea  she kind of unfriended her on	Instagram or something So shes mad at her sister too TANTAROS Hey look things can happen Maybe B takes her	husbands side and theres sisterly tension I dont know I dont say I	have all the answers to this KnowlesJayZ family drama CROSSTALK PERINO Can we call her B BOLLING B PERINO Can we call her B BOLLING Queen B yes PERINO Maybe she understood that there is no such thing as privacy	anymore maybe one of reasons she didnt speak up or get involved because	she wanted her sister to carry it out or it could be because she thought I	dont want anything to do with this because I want to lead The Five	tomorrow BECKEL Can we stop This is like the most  BOLLING No no hold on Can I just point something out See that	video the way thats taken thats a security camera video but someone is	taking it with a camera I mean this is great That TMZ they are just	breaking news all the time SHILLUE People just send him their cell phone videos Why is	Harvey Levin a genius for that BOLLING Because who else got that Who else gets that They get	all of it They got the Donald Sterling thing too right Speaking of Donald Sterling were hearing more from the embattled	LA Clippers owner that one Donald Sterling This time on Magic	Johnson Listen BEGIN VIDEO CLIP DONALD STERLING CLIPPERS OWNER Big Magic Johnson what has he	done What kind of a guy who goes to every city and has sex with every girl	and then catches HIV And is that someone we want to respect and tell our	kids about I think he should be ashamed of himself I think he should go	into the background But what does he do for the black people He doesnt do anything	He does nothing Its all talk END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING And Magic Johnson just responded Listen BEGIN VIDEO CLIP EARVIN MAGIC JOHNSON FORMER NBA PLAYER My whole life is devoted	to urban America So you know I just wish he knew the facts when hes	talking but hes a man who is upset and hes reaching Hes reaching Hes trying to find something he can grab onto to help him save his	team and its not going to happen Im not a guy who holds grudges and all	that Yes am I upset Of course but at the same time Im a Godfearing	man Im going to pray for him and hope that things workout for him END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING There is one class act We said that before Ill	reiterate that Bob on Don Sterling there you know he was supposed to bail	himself Everyone is calling him a racist See this was supposed to be	his first words since being called a racist and this is how hes going to	fix things He kind of bury himself further  BECKEL And then he takes on Magic Johnson and then he decides and	he says the black  what has he done for the black people Sterling first of all the good news about this is anybody in	America who watches this guy can prove that anybody can be a success in	America if this idiot can be a success I mean he really  look its	disgraceful By the way do you think he gets hair done BOLLING Maybe Dana that was  I dont know  that was a rambling interview He	said some of the craziest things Who advises a guy like that PERINO I was just thinking I cant think of the exact phrase but	Im wondering if his PR person isnt actually on the other side because	they have let him out there and they thought you know what lets just	watch this guy make a fool of himself because thats how bad it was I	think there is some utility in it Bob to your point of anybody watching	it actually can look at that and say OK thank goodness Im not like that	Id never want to be like that And the contrast is Magic Johnson is amazing As you said maybe	Sterling can call himself successful but I think what led to this is	something in his past that I dont think he should be all that proud about	And so when Magic Johnson says Im going to pray for him you think gosh	for sterling money cannot buy class Somebody like Magic Johnson was born	with it and has lived with it and he has fought successfully against HIV	for so many years hes a role model not just people in the black community	but for all of us BOLLING Right And Tom not only that Magic Johnson has invested tens of millions	if not hundreds of millions of dollars into communities that people didnt	want to put money into it He went in there He provided jobs he	provided opportunity he provided economic activity Sterling can he be	that dumb SHILLUE I guess he is I mean you know when he  when that tape	came out I thought well hes going to have to speak about this at some	point Maybe he should keep his mouth shut but then I thought well its	so bad this tape that no matter what he says in public it cant be worse	and it is This interview with Anderson Cooper is worse than the secret tape BECKEL You know Ill say one thing about Magic Johnson all I can	say is there but for the grace of God go me PERINO Yes BECKEL I feel very fortunate BOLLING Yes great man Ands what strikes you BECKEL Thats what I was referring to BOLLING Which is more  I dont know in the front of your mind	Donald Sterlings comments or Magic Johnsons classy reaction TANTAROS Im still hung up on true confessions by Bob Beckel PERINO And its only the Ablock BOLLING And we move on TANTAROS Were only nine minutes into the show Well we knew that he was a bigot before and now we know its a	complete jerk and what was even more revealing to me was the fact that he	said and Magic Johnson thinks that hes helped out the black community	Donald Sterling believes just because he wrote checks to the NAACP that	somehow he was helping the community But behind the scenes we know how	he feels about the black community Magic Johnson he lets his actions speak for himself And he came	out  I mean very early when HIV was something very taboo and have the	courage to speak about it honestly Hes been very honest about his	health when he didnt have to be Its incredibly personal And I thought for Donald Sterling to shoot so below the belt with	those comments about his health  PERINO And with such ignorance TANTAROS It was just  to me the icing on the cake And to your point Dana about that PR person its probably one of	the situations where the client  she couldnt control him So she just	figures  PERINO Yes knock yourself out SHILLUE I believe your theory There is a PR double agent BECKEL Yes thats right The old line you are digging a hole you	hand me the shovel But I think hes digging a hole in a  where hes got	his  CROSSTALK PERINO Someone should take the shovel and whack him over the head BECKEL You know about HIV I want to just say one thing here that	it was the Reagans Ronald and Nancy Reagan who came out on HIV early and	broke the taboo really I mean they were  when Rock Hudson got AIDS	and Ive always the Reagans for that BOLLING All right Lets move on to this one regarding the first	openly gay NFL player Michael Sam Sportscaster Steven A Smith was	concerned with the reactions to the reactions specifically some players	were fined for tweeting their disapproval Meanwhile OReilly thinks this is much ado about nothing BEGIN VIDEO CLIP STEVEN A SMITH SPORTSCASTER When it comes to the plays and the	tweets I dont believe they should have been punished for it Im of the	mindset that there is freedom of speech People have the right to say what	they feel and if there are ramifications for it so be it I think its a	very very dangerous thing when people see something and they have a	problem with what they are seeing and they express themselves and	ultimately they are fined BILL OREILLY FOX NEWS HOST Let Mr Sam play football If he	makes the Rams great But the gay thing way overplayed Its annoying	It really is END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING There you go Dana your thoughts PERINO Well on the point about the player that got disciplined or	has to go to education training for the tweet I really believe that if I	were a sports agent which of course Im not I know a little bit about PR	I think I would tell my players you dont need to be on Twitter It	doesnt further your career It doesnt help you catch a ball or make a	touch down or field goal or anything I think it is in a lot of ways great if you want to survey it so you	can find out whats going on be in the news but if you are even slightly	at risk of hurting your career because of Twitter Twitter is not worth it BOLLING Yes And dont forget putting pictures on Twitter too and	a lot of guys are getting in trouble with that PERINO I never did that BOLLING Your thoughts on this Should these Dolphin players have	been fined and reprimanded for tweeting their dissatisfaction with Michael	Sam TANTAROS No I mean it is a freedom of speech issue But they	should talk to the players about weighing on anything other than football	because its a huge distraction to the game and the league and the teams You know as far as the gay thing I dont think its annoying like	OReilly said I just dont really care I mean Im not comfortable with	PDA with anybody I dont care if youre gay I dont care if youre	straight if youre being overly affectionate on camera its kind of	enough for me I just dont really care BECKEL Listen they have been trying to get me to training the	human intelligence people or whatever it is  TANTAROS How is that going BECKEL Not well I dont go to it The one thing Id say about this guy saying it doesnt matter its	freedom of speech Yes its freedom of speech Theres certain things	you say that you cant say unless youre going to as Dana pointed out  SHILLUE All he said was outrageous right He said one word he	said horrible I wasnt watching this thing but I might have tweeted	horrible because he was eating cake What is he a 9yearold as a birthday	party Having cake Hes in the NFL Come on put your helmet on and go to work PERINO Isnt true its the Miami Dolphins that are already in	trouble from those incidents earlier in the year because of bullying and	being insensitive So they probably have  need to have a teamwide	meeting to say look lets focus on the game because in order for us to	keep our fans happy with us and for us to all make money and to be	successful we dont need the distraction like Twitter CROSSTALK BECKEL Oh never mind BOLLING No go ahead BECKEL I get in real trouble for it Never mind PERINO Come on BECKEL Saying something about the showers But Im not going to	say anything PERINO Dont say that BOLLING What PERINO No no keep going Please Ahead on The Five BOLLING Ahead on The Five  Dana doesnt want to know I want to	know PERINO You already know BOLLING Alec Baldwin  I know  cannot say out of trouble in New	York City today The Hollywood hot head was arrested Wait until you hear	what landed bad boy Baldwin in a fat guy handcuffs coming up COMMERCIAL BREAK TANTAROS Well the far left has made it a mission this year to	silence graduation speakers over politics Ayaan Hirsi Ali Condoleezza	Rice and now the first head of the IMF Christine Lagarde was supposed to	deliver an address at Smith College in Massachusetts But she just pulled	out after protesters alleged that the IMF has helped suppress women	worldwide Now she didnt want to distract from the celebration same thing	with Rice at Rutgers Hirsi Ali was disinvited from Brandeis Now	perhaps if people like her were allowed to speak on college campuses maybe	the threat of radical Islam some wouldnt just be discovering it over the	last week Heres Hirsi Ali on THE KELLY FILE last night BEGIN VIDEO CLIP AYAAN HIRSI ALI We listen to many wellmeaning Muslims who say	please it has nothing to do Islam It has nothing to do with the Sharia	It has nothing to do with the Koran Its an aberration And what we are seeing time and time again is sadly its not an	aberration END VIDEO CLIP TANTAROS Now Bob colleges are supposed to be a place of free and	open debate and they seem to be more close minded these days and against	women Why is that BECKEL Yes Well first of all Greg is not here to say it So	let me say that every college campuses like this in America because of a	bunch of commie teachers You have 500 protesters in one place and 15 in	another and these people except for the one pulled out Now why pull	out Why not just stay and do it Yes youre going to get some heat but if youre going to get some	heat you got a college campus youve got 1000 graduates there youre	going to have some people who are not going to like it So frankly Im a	little bit curious as to why these people are not willing to stand up and	do what they  say what they want to say I mean I would not pull out TANTAROS The thinking behind that though is  Eric they dont	want to make it about themselves They want to be classy and say look	this is about students Im going to be a huge distraction Its going to	be about politics not them graduating How about from a money perspective Eric Do you think its time	maybe we start to as a country look at the taxexempt status that we give	these universities I mean we do it so we can foster honest debate not	be indoctrination camps Should that be something to think about it BOLLING Thats a huge debate how they are structured Where they	should be completely  they have these literally multibillion dollar	endowments And they say well is it time to maybe look at  I dont	think so I like the system the way it is My problem with this Ands is simply why is graduation day become an	activism day Why is it all about ideology These days have work for four	days Theyre ready to go step out into life its going to be hard as	hell out there as soon as they finish as soon as they walk into the job	market Why do we always have to lay this on them Cant we just have some	fun Cant we have some  PERINO Beers Beer summit BOLLIG Have a party have a celebration Not is it going to be	Condi or is it going to be you know someone on the left And come on	lets just stop with this Let them have a nice final day TANTAROS Dana do you think that maybe thats because four years	that they are at these institutions its all about ideology anyway So	this isnt veering off the track of liberal academia PERINO Right Thats a good point I hadnt thought about it that	way Its probably true I would do anything to listen to a speech from any of them And in	the future Im sure that a lot of these graduates after they have made	some money after a while and theyre in jobs they will end up actually	paying to see one of them speak in the future I just guarantee it I also dont think that anybody at Smith would have turned down a	great job at the IMF with somebody as accomplished at Christine Lagarde And also just the thing  the thing that surprises me is that here	you have the first woman to be at the head of IMF Shes willing to come	and give you a speech Shes been hired by your university And I see	your point too Bob That maybe she should have gone ahead and given the	speech  BECKEL Yes PERINO  and made the protesters make a fool of themselves if they	want Im wondering about next year and what trend will we see Are there	going to be colleges that are brave and decide to just do something  you	know hire somebody that was going to be either controversial or thought	provoking or maybe do something that Eric is suggesting which is	basically dont spend the money on a speaker Throw the kids a party and	lets call it a day And then you can come back for the alumni reunion BECKEL Go ahead Tom Weve got to hear from you  TANTAROS Yes Tom its  I mean its one thing if its Donald	Sterling invited to the college to give a speech But these women its	almost as they are saying no to them because they dont like the industry	they are in and they dont like their politics And if universities were	characterized as being conservative then the left would say this is a war	on women judging by the names we mentioned SHILLUE No no Smith has a great diversity of speakers They	have had Rachel Maddow Gloria Steinem and Arianna Huffington So that	really runs the gamut BECKEL Thats a gamut yes But you know  SHILLUE Theyre more openminded than we think over there BECKEL Keep in mind here will you please that these are a very	small percentage of the student body who are doing these protests These	kids believe what they believe You cant deny them that but its still a	small percentage Ive given commencement speeches In one I had a bunch of people	walked out and I was very straight about it I just told them to kiss my 	 SHILLUE They dont know what the IMF does They are protesting the	IMF and theyre talking about patriarchy The IMF is not about patriarchy	Theyre giving money to poor countries Thats what the IMF does BECKEL Well  TANTAROS I think its even worse when you  CROSSTALK SHILLUE Its funny the arguments on the left I mean IMF is	right in the pocket of what these  BOLLING Its as liberal as it comes BECKEL It is not That is wrong BOLLING Its a redistribution of our wealth TANTAROS Its a handful of students but isnt that worse then	So the tyranny of the minority now Theyre folding CROSSTALK BECKEL No the worse is because its such a small percentage that	these guys refuse to go up and stand up and they would make fools of	themselves TANTAROS I think we take away the taxexempt status of the close	minded colleges BECKEL Oh there you go Theres an idea A lot of colleges love	that TANTAROS Coming up Warren Buffet is the third richest person on	the planet and hes got a lot of good to do Well so why has he chosen	to donate money more than a billion dollars to abortion groups Thats up	next on The Five COMMERCIAL BREAK NEWSBREAK BECKEL Yes Im moving up to the Cblock here As Andrea pointed	out Im like George Jefferson Billionaire Warren Buffett has given a lot of money to charity over	his lifetime but hes also donated a massive sum to abortion groups and	just how much is causing controversy According to a new analysis by the	Media Research Center Buffet gave more than 12 billion from 2001 to	2012 That amount could supposedly fund roughly 27 million first	trimester abortions How much does this hurt the Oracle of Omahas image Eric BOLLING Yes I had no idea Everyone knows Warren Buffett has been	very liberal He was a big proObama supporter He bought the PAC which	is in essence another redistribution of wealth And no one can understand	why one of the worlds most successful investor would be for that But wheres the media pointing this out that a billion dollars he	spent on proabortion causes including something like 300 million for	Planned Parenthood Now you know hes not running for elected office so its not really	going to make that much of an effect on anything but it still  it would	be good to hear about that I would have liked to have known about it By the way a billion and a quarter do you know how much teachers	that could hire BECKEL Yes but I mean the guy I mean I dont happen to agree	with it But its the law of the land and hes got a right to put his	money where he wants to put his money Hes made a lot of money Hes	given a lot to a lot of different places So you know you keep jumping on me about the Corker brothers or	whatever their names are about how much they give to charity I mean I	dont mind them giving all that away BOLLING This isnt charity This is a billion  Planned Parenthood	is not a charity Its a cause BECKEL Its not a charity but it does a lot more than just	abortions I might add BOLLING I hear that but I dont believe it BECKEL Let me ask somebody whos sane here PERINO OK The question was does Warren Buffett think it will hurt	his legacy That was one of the questions I think he feels very secure	in his legacy I dont think that he cares The other thing about this is that if we believe that people who have	earned their own money can spend it where they want to on something that is	legal then I dont think that I can criticize him for giving money to	Planned Parenthood or that his wife is giving them money Because the other thing that that does is that I have argued that I	dont think that federal taxpayer dollars should go to Planned Parenthood	because of that commingling If you have somebody thats prolife and I	pay taxes I dont want parts of my taxes to go to pay for something that I	consider killing a life Thats what the Hyde Amendment was all about	And I think that if there are people that are in the private sector that	want to pay their hardearned money to something like this then I think	you have to let them do it BECKEL Andrea what do you think TANTAROS I agree with Dana I would rather have Warren Buffetts	money going to pay Planned Parenthood than my tax money And I dont love	it I mean if I were as rich as he was I probably would not 	definitely would not be making these kind of donations But I guess you either care about this story or you dont care about	the story depending on where you come down on the issue of abortion	Berkshire Hathaway if it turned into the You must get an abortion	company I think they still own Geico So if the little gecko starts	coming out talking about how people should get abortions then Id have a	problem with it But that wont happen And I think ChickfilA is a great example If you dont like Warren	Buffett or where he spends his money dont buy his products BECKEL Yes I guess thats how he gives hundreds of millions of	dollars to charity Does this  do you think this would hurt  for	example if you did it would it hurt your reputation or would it be	pretty well damaged SHILLUE My reputation is very welldamaged being on this show and on	Red Eye Im throwing caution to the wind BECKEL Hey man You can always leave SHILLUE No its great This is why Im in this business to risk	my reputation But I dont think it will hurt Buffett at all Because	people on the right dont punish businesses the way that people on the left	do and thats reason No 1 I mean do you remember when the fellow from Whole Foods had the	temerity to suggest that his company might be better served by something	other than ObamaCare They organized a boycott and hes leftwing And	hes in all the leftwing areas So they went crazy But they wont go crazy on Buffett And the other reason is its easy	to boycott a ChickfilA You just dont go buy a chicken But people	dont really know what  what are they going to do Not ride the Reading	Railroad He owns all these diverse businesses BECKEL I left you off the hook on that CROSSTALK TANTAROS You dont have to buy stock in the companies BECKEL Jane Fonda she did one thing in the Vietnam War got one	picture that was outrageous and she apologized for it And the right has	been hounding her ever since BOLLING One little thing PERINO Bob how did we get to that BOLLING We were in the middle of a war She was standing with the	enemy and saying Im siding with them BECKEL Is that something that should damn her for the rest of her	life BOLLING Well I dont think shes actually ever walked that back BECKEL Well she has walked it back Buffett aint going to walk	this back His first wife died of cancer and thats part of a  and she	was a big supporter of Planned Parenthood So I think hes just carrying	that on And Tom let me just say is a comedian It takes a lot of nerve to	sit here and say youre a beautician ph The poster boy for bad behavior strikes again But this time Alec	Baldwin lashed out at the cops so he ended up in handcuffs Well tell	you what went down coming up COMMERCIAL BREAK PERINO A new smart phone app called Yik Yak have some parents and	critics concerned that it promotes cyber bullying especially on high	school and college campuses Heres how it works Users can anonymously post anything they like on	what has been described as a virtual bulletin board And kids being kids	they dont always contribute the nicest material The result some vile	comments once relegated to bathroom walls have now found their way	online displayed to a much wider audience The app has already been used	to post bomb threats in high schools and shooting threats on at least one	college campus Though the company does point out Tom that Yik Yak has been used for	some good purposes like they  because its a localized thing they were	able to find enough people to come and give blood to see if they could test	positive to give the kidney transplant Now thats one could example But you have been on Yik Yak in the past three hours Hows that	going SHILLUE Yes Ill just put it up here To the BOOP on date night	who tipped zero and wrote BOOP BOOP on your tab your date thinks youre a	BOOP I hope you step on a LEGO and dont get BOOPED I like that step	on LEGO Thats a good one PELOSI Its not the highest end type of messaging SHILLUE No no PERINO And it is a lot of  and as you said earlier its two	schools fighting SHILLUE Yes its a lot of college against college action here PERINO Andrea we talk a lot about bullying a lot because its a	topic Americans talking about And cyber bullying is I think slightly	different Im not a parent and Im curious about the parents here but youre	not a parent yet either How would you have protected yourself or would	your parents have protected your from something like this Your parents	dont know everything youre doing on your phone TANTAROS They wouldnt have let me have  they wouldnt have let me	have one PERINO You dont think you would have been allowed a phone TANTAROS I dont either I would have been allowed a phone if I were	using it They gave me a lot of leeway But if it was proven that I was on	there posting nasty things about people yes the phone would be taken	away Or theyd check to make sure I didnt have the app that Tom has on	his phone But I think this is a recipe for disaster And Im just so happy Im	not in high school anymore Because someone compared this to writing on	the bathroom wall nasty things about someone But you can paint over the	bathroom wall You know and usually you can figure out who the person is	This I guess if youre posting enough you can figure out who it is Some	of these comments stay up there a really long time and you cant fight	back In school you can point out the girl who said it about you figure	it out And then you could hash it out in the girls room PERINO There are some ways Bob that  some people who would maybe	catch their kids writing something nasty and they could have  maybe	theres punishment involved if the parents paid attention But what about if you have a teenage girl How do you protect her I	mean youve kind of been through this BECKEL Yes I have And first of all if you could read the tweets	that I get when the show ends you talk about bullying And theyve got	their names on it And it starts off You big commie and then it goes on	to whatever it is And then I used to tweet back saying thank you for	your kind words Was it your mother who married her brother Your father	married his sister The  and I think the bathroom wall is too bad but there used to be	a source of good information on there TANTAROS You can see the positive in any message board BECKEL I tell you I think this is dangerous because you could 	once it starts to spread I think youre going to start to find crap on	there that  And only Tom would sit there and read it you know PERINO Well some high schools Erik have asked Yik Yak to shut	down in their localized area and Yik Yak has complied with that But you see some good BOLLING I do My son as soon as this app came out he said Hey	Dad did you hear about Yik Yak I looked into it OK Yes it can  bad things can happen There can be cyber	bullying There can be bomb threats but that can happen on Twitter That	can happen on Facebook The anonymous nature of it I get it maybe	enables people to maybe feel more free to do stupid things But if you prosecute and you go after people that do stupid things	theyll fix it And the parents are on it Theyll make sure it doesnt	happen Theres huge positive applications to it Advertising would love this app If this becomes a big blowup app	like Snapchat basically or Twitter man you could  you could locate a	group of people in a city or the whole darn city of Manhattan in a mile and	a half Youd probably have five or six million people in a mile and a	half you can advertise to everyone at once or a high school college or	sports arena watching the game after the game to come to Joes Bar PERINO That was probably  that was probably the theory behind it	and theyve been able to raise I think 15 million BECKEL You know something That is  the thing about that is think	about all those guys with flags saying subway down the street BOLLING You put them all out of work PERINO Thats the argument BOLLING Now youre worried about the sandwich board guys TANTAROS The anonymous nature allows people to get so mean though	I mean the advertising is a great benefit but somehow Im guessing Dana	that people who have lost their dog are not really using this site PERINO Yes No Well they might But I think that  I heard	this about this example of a young man that was at a college campus and	some girl started saying things about him which would probably make it so	that he probably wouldnt get dates in the future And then everybody else	just stopped talking to  it was like you just want to stay in your room	and not go anywhere and not interact SHILLUE Its tougher with these things If you look at any message	board if you put up a YouTube video the comments are vile You see	after you do this show I get comments from

Out to sea  Family ties excuse a lot in politics especially for the loyaltyprizing Clintons But this event for this candidate doesnt seem like a smart choice for the 2016 Democratic frontrunner Her main weakness is her status as the preferred candidate of Wall Street in a party that is increasingly returning to its populist roots  please check your pitchforks at the door if you stop by the Rothschilds dears As is the case with concerns about Hillarys health her part in the Benghazi debacle her refusal to include Islamist militia Boko Haram on the State Departments terror list this kind of tinear campaigning will be dismissed by Democrats desperate to protect their frontrunner But tonights event does not show the signs of a political operation that has supposedly learned its lessons from 2008 Hillary appearing at the Fifth Avenue home of the most famous 2008 Obama basher to buck rake from the richest of the rich on behalf of a candidate who is failing in her bid to return to power is no way to debut in 2014 Maybe Mike McCurry is right Maybe Hillary is going to drop out of the running But if all external signs are correct and she is already at sea with the Bismarck of presidential campaigns Hillary doesnt seem to have turned the rudder from the last voyage Bubba revises on Benghazi  We did  In my opinion Hillary did what she should have done  Former President Bill Clinton defending his wifes handling of questions about the deadly attack on a diplomatic outpost in Benghazi Libya Clinton also seemed to allege that the Bush administration had kept secret the killings of top diplomatic officials He also claimed Benghazi was now booming again with commercial life Well business is good for some sectors VA HEAD TO FACE SKEWERING FROM SENATE PANEL

 No bones in that right     TURN THE PAGE GOP INCUMBENTS HOLD THE LINE
NASHVILLE  The conservative insurgency wont be able to oust an incumbent moderate Republican Senator this cycle With Tennessee Sen Lamar Alexanders closerthanexpected but still convincing primary victory over state Rep Joe Carr here last night the only incumbent still facing a primary is Sen Mike Enzi RWyo on Aug 19 and hes a staunch conservative who already beat back a challenge from the establishment This year is different than the last two campaign cycles in which national groups with the Senate Conservatives Fund at the fore have been able to pick off at least one moderate incumbent They came achingly close in Mississippi some 8000 votes shy in a runoff but they could not pull it off In 2010 the RINO hunt knocked off Sen Robert Bennett in Utah and forced Sen Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania to flee the party In 2012 it was Sen Richard Lugar RInd who went down While there have been RINO safaris in the field at least since the 1960s they didnt do much good until the past four years The last incumbent Republican senator to lose a primary prior to 2010 was New Hampshires Bob Smith who had left and returned to the party surrounding an illadvised 2000 presidential run Smith lost to double establishmentarian John E Sununu in 2002 Before Smith you have to reach all the way back to 1980 to find a Republican senator ousted in a primary New York Sen Jacob Javits who was defeated by Al DAmato a definite insurgent Yes Sam Brownback beat Sheila Frahm in Kansas in 1996 but she had just been appointed weeks before so it doesnt count In the 20 years prior to 1980 Republican primary voters had only tossed out incumbents twice Over the same 20year span 14 Democrat incumbents lost their primaries

So what happens now  Is this just a lull in the conflict or is the start of something else Part of what led former Sen Jim DeMint RSC to establish the Senate Conservatives Fund were famous frustrations like Specter and former Rhode Island Sen Linc Chaffee who like Specter ended up becoming a Democrat The outrage over seeing incumbents who publicly attacked conservatism getting money and support from the ostensibly conservative party in 2004 and 2006 lit the fuse

But there arent any Chaffeestyle Republicans left in the Senate There are a handful of moderates like Alexander Mississippis Thad Cochran Maines Susan Collins and South Carolinas Lindsey Graham but as this cycle showed rooting out a wellestablished moderate who sees the threat coming is hard to do Graham previously considered in big trouble for his support of an Obamabacked immigration deal as well as proposed globalwarming fees didnt even break a sweat

Alexanders win may mark the beginning of the end of this phase of the fight

The GOP overall has moved right since 2008 and certainly the conservative faction will continue to grow in the Senate with the next class Nebraskas Ben Sasse Arkansas Tom Cotton and Iowas Joni Ernst come to mind as potential reinforcements for the right but the act of a national effort to sack moderate incumbents may be over

There are two reasons why First the emphasis in the struggle moves fully to the 2016 presidential field starting right now The energy that was dedicated to trying to oust moderate Republican senators or punish Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is already pouring into the question of whether the GOP will nominate a moderate again or if the conservatives can manage to carry the day and that will preoccupy the party through the next cycle Second its just too darned expensive

At a cost of 135 million so far GOP primary fights have done nothing so much as enrich consultants and local TV stations And Republicans are behind Democrats and their allies in fundraising for the fall making the cost of the primary season more painful Getting donors to shell out for the next season of RINO hunting will be harder without any trophies on the wall form this year

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/10/02/free-long-acting-birth-control-cuts-teen-pregnancy-abortions/, A program that offered longacting nocost contraception to US girls and women age 15 to 19 reduced the teenage pregnancy rate by 79 percent over five years and cut the abortion rate by 77 percent according to the results of a new study This has really important public health implications in the United States where we have had persistent challenges in trying to decrease unintended pregnancy said Cynthia Harper a professor of obstetrics gynecology and reproductive services at the University of California San Francisco She was not involved in the research     The findings were surprising because they had such a large impact she told Reuters Health The report in the October 2 New England Journal of Medicine comes at a time when more than 600000 US teens become pregnant each year By age 20 about 20 percent of white teens and 40 percent of Hispanic and black teens will have been pregnant according to The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy The new study comes from the Contraceptive CHOICE Project conducted in the St Louis area It was designed to see if teen pregnancy rates could be brought down by aggressively providing information on contraceptives and offering contraception for free For many years parents practitioners and policy makers thought Those longacting contraception methods arent for teens theyre not going to want those methods We were able to demonstrate that if they are properly counseled and if they have a choice they will pick those methods actually use them and have really great outcomes as a result said chief author Gina Secura of the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis The teens all of whom had sought contraceptive services through a clinic were told about various types of birth control including the longterm injectable and implantable contraceptives such as IUDs that have been used around the world for years and whose effects are reversible Generally fewer than 5 percent of US teens use such methods Ultimately 72 percent of the 1404 teenage girls and women enrolled in the study went with an intrauterine device IUD or an implant Only 125 percent opted for an oral contraceptive pill The volunteers were followed for as long as three years during the study period which lasted from 2008 to 2013 The annual rate of pregnancy was 340 percent compared to 1585 percent in a survey of sexually experienced US teens and women in the same age group The likelihood of giving birth each year was 194 percent among the St Louis teens versus 940 percent nationally The abortion rate was 097 percent when the longacting contraception was free compared to 415 percent in the rest of the US These methods are not known by teens and providers are not used to providing them Harper said She said young women seeking contraception should initially ask their doctor which method is the most effective because  unlike doctorpatient discussions about other medical treatments  when it comes to contraception effectiveness is not always one of the things that is discussed  What we saw was that among the teens who started with the shorteracting methods like the pill or the patch after a while they started to see they were forgetting to use them And they then transitioned to a longacting method Secura told Reuters Health The girls and women in the study were not new to sex Nearly half had already had an unintended pregnancy 18 percent reported having had at least one abortion and nearly three quarters reported having sexual intercourse during the 30 days before they enrolled in the study Only 3 percent were sexually inexperienced When the researchers compared the young women in the study to all US women  both sexually experienced and inexperienced  ages 15 to 19 they found that the program reduced the pregnancy rate by 41 percent the birth rate by 44 percent and the abortion rate by 34 percent Secura said more teens and young adults are not using the longeracting methods because Historically its been easier for practitioners to write a prescription for pills and have a teen go on her way In addition inserting longacting contraception devices take more training than some family physicians are used to Harper said The other problem the longeracting methods are far more expensive at first The upfront costs are anywhere from 500 to 1000 depending on the device and the cost of the insertion said Secura You reach cost neutrality within two years with the longacting methods But these methods last three four five or six years So not only are they more effective they start to regain the financial investment while theyre still in use she said Hopefully data like this can show people why its so important to cover contraceptives for womens health said Harper,2014-10-02T07:20-04:00,abortion

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/05/justices-new-term-has-expectations-on-gay-unions/,FILE June 20 2013 The US Supreme Court building in Washington DCAP A Supreme Court term that is starting with a lack of headlinegrabbing cases may end with a blockbuster that helps define the legacy of the court under Chief Justice John Roberts While samesex marriage is not yet on their agenda the justices appear likely to take on the issue and decide once and for all whether gay and lesbian couples have a constitutional right to marry     When the justices formally open their new term Monday Roberts will be beginning his 10th year at the head of the court and the fifth with the same lineup of justices He has been part of a fivejustice conservative majority that has rolled back campaign finance limits upheld abortion restrictions and generally been skeptical of the consideration of race in public life But his court has taken a different path in cases involving gay and lesbian Americans despite his opposition most of the time The courts record on gay rights is comparable to its embrace of civil rights for AfricanAmericans in the 1950s and 1960s under Chief Justice Earl Warren said University of Chicago law professor David Strauss The court will go down in history as one that was on the frontiers of establishing rights for gays and lesbians Strauss said The justices passed up their first opportunity last week to add gay marriage cases to their calendar But they will have several more chances in the coming weeks to accept appeals from officials in Indiana Oklahoma Utah Virginia and Wisconsin who are trying to preserve their state bans on samesex marriage Those prohibitions fell one after the other following the high courts June 2013 decision that struck down part of a federal law that defined marriage as between a man and a woman On the courts plate in the new term are cases involving religious employment and housing discrimination the drawing of political districts in Alabama and Arizona a dispute between Congress and the president over passports that is heavy with Middle East politics a faulty traffic stop over a cars broken brake light in North Carolina the use of a law to prevent document shredding against a fisherman accused of throwing undersized red grouper overboard the prosecution of a selfstyled rapper whose Facebook postings threatened his estranged wife an FBI agent and area schools Mondays argument involves the North Carolina traffic stop that led to the discovery of cocaine in Nicholas Heiens Ford Escort A police officer pulled over the car when he saw the right brake light wasnt working although the left one was Typically evidence found in a car pulled over for a valid reason can be used against a defendant But North Carolinas quirky traffic laws mandate that only one brake light on a car be working The case tests whether the officers mistaken understanding of the law makes the traffic stop unreasonable and the ensuing search a violation of Heiens constitutional rights Among Heiens arguments is that citizens cant plead ignorance of the law when they are charged with a crime so there shouldnt be a double standard for the police A divided state Supreme Court said the mistake was reasonable enough to justify the routine traffic stop On Tuesday the justices will take up the case of Arkansas prison inmate Gregory Holt who says his Muslim beliefs require him to grow a halfinch beard Arkansas prison officials permit no beards with the exception of inmates with certain skin conditions who can have beards a quarterinch long Prison officials say their rule is a matter of security because beards can be used to hide prohibited items and 18 states are backing the states argument But groups across the political spectrum and the Obama administration say Holt has a right to grow a beard under a federal law aimed at protecting prisoners religious rights More than 40 states already allow beards with little evidence that inmates have tried to hide prohibited items in them Last term the court bitterly divided over the religious rights of familyowned corporations that objected to paying for womens contraceptives under President Barack Obamas health care law This case appears likely to unite the court said University of Notre Dame law professor Richard Garnett I think theres every reason to expect agreement among the justices that Arkansas hasnt even come close to satisfying the burden Garnett said The courts calendar this fall also includes a foray into the online world Anthony Elonis of Bethlehem Pennsylvania is challenging his conviction for using Facebook to post threats of violence The issue in Elonis case is whether he had to intend to make the threats The government argues that the proper measure is whether a reasonable person would feel threatened Elonis said his online postings should be considered speech that is protected by the First Amendment and that he used the forum to vent his frustration over a series of events that included the loss of his job and the breakup of his marriage Beyond individual cases on the docket court observers across the political spectrum are using the milestone 10th year to offer assessments of Roberts and the court he leads The liberal Constitutional Accountability Center has embarked on a yearlong study of the chief justice noting that he said at his confirmation hearings he would pursue restraint and unanimity on the bench Some conservatives are dismayed by what they see as Roberts unwillingness to take big steps on key issues and they have yet to forgive his vote to uphold Obamas health care law in 2012 With the court closely divided on key issues a change on the bench can mean the difference between victory and defeat That was indeed the case with the replacement of Justice Sandra Day OConnor with Justice Samuel Alito affecting outcomes in cases on abortion race and campaign

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/07/24/us-disengaging-increasingly-chaotic-world/,This is a rush transcript from The Five July 24 2014 This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated DANA PERINO COHOST Hello everyone Im Dana Perino along with Andrea Tantaros Bob Beckel Eric Bolling and Greg Gutfeld     Its 5 oclock in New York City and this is The Five MUSIC PERINO Is America becoming too complacent in the midst of worldwide terror threats This week the 911 Commission issued its first report in a decade and warned just that The commission says that the complacency that led to 911 is happening again The Wall Street Journals Daniel Henninger warned All the worlds chaos is going to get worse In the next two years many more people are going to die and not necessarily in the places where they are dying now Hope alone wont protect Europe or us And take a look at the cover of the new issue of Time magazine It reads Cold War two the West is losing Putins dangerous game Is it time for the US to step up and take charge Well Secretary Kerry and President Obama think that we already are BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JOHN KERRY SECRETARY OF STATE The facts could not be more clear The United States of America has never been more engaged in helping to lead in more places than we are now BARACK OBAMA PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES We live in a complex world and at a challenging time And none of these challenges lend themselves to quick or easy solutions but all of them require American leadership END VIDEO CLIP PERINO Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates thinks the US appears to be disengaging from the world Listen to him BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ROBERT GATES FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY I think that there is a perception around the world of the US disengaging I know that the administration makes the case of its diplomatic involvement and how busy it is how involved it is around the world But look the reality is withdrawing from or disengaging from two wars both of which end without a clearcut victory is a tricky business to avoid giving the impression youre disengaging from the rest of the world END VIDEO CLIP PERINO OK Our attempt here is not to get too specific on tactics and try to keep at the bigger picture Let me just start with you Greg Do you think America is having a national identity crisis GREG GUTFELD COHOST I dont know maybe Next No America I think is falling victim to a number of things Its entitlement plus distractions which leads to I think a steep decline in making us vulnerable to outside threat As the government bloats and buys off a population who are distracted by incredible technologies and endless faucets of pop culture we no longer are paying attention to the threats around us So as the patient is medicated by these painkillers which make it happy and indulge our senses we lose sight of the fact that the world is pretty threatening There are people who do not respond to reason We think that we can somehow convince our enemies to listen to us when actually the only way to get into their thick skulls anything is with a bullet I mean extremists do not listen to us PERINO Another type of bullet is an economic one Eric I wondered what you thought about Americas economic position in the world Is that having an effect on other decisions that were making or not making ERIC BOLLING COHOST So the three conflicts that were talking about You look at Ukraine and Russia we talked about it quite a bit Yet we need to step up sanctions against Russia The way to do that would be with the oil industry and tell them you know in no uncertain terms were going to do what we have to do to drill more here Were not going to rely on any Middle Eastern oil any Russian oil And if we need to help out some European trading partners oil trading partners maybe well do that too in the form of sending them crude oil sending them gasoline products heating oil and all those types of things Not necessarily natural gas Israel send them support  military support in the form of intel and technology We did that with the Iron Dome continue to help them out with the Iron Dome things like that And with the Middle East I think thats just one where we just need to wait and see what happens And we probably disagree on how to handle the Middle East but my take on it is the way to really hurt the Middle East the most is again frack drill and Keystone Pipeline our way out of the Middle East completely PERINO Economic Bob you are wanting to comment on the Time magazine cover which is asking about the Cold War Heres how I wanted to frame the question to you and you can of course answer it however you want of course Before it was called the Cold War in the middle of those first several years people didnt know exactly what they were in but they knew that it was  that they were having a fight without weapons against the Soviet Union Are we in some sort of a new phase now that will be named later that we cant exactly pin down at the moment BOB BECKEL COHOST Well let me start by saying Mr Gates who  PERINO Secretary Gates BECKEL Secretary Gates who criticized the administration went around this table particularly Greg has made the point about cutting back on the military it was the Gates program to cut back on the military I want to make that point Secondly the Time magazine cover is one of the most feckless ill informed pieces of journalism and crap Ive ever seen Look the Cold War was borne out of the Second World War It was the USSR versus the United States It was very clearcut The USSR was big it was powerful it had a number of countries that it controls It does not now have that All it has is oil and gas Its basically a third world country Its unemployment is unbelievable And in terms of the economics  look the world has changed A lot of countries like India and Brazil have become very strong economically So we cant expect to control that But the idea that somehow were going into a second Cold War I dont know who did that for Time magazine They ought to be fired PERINO Do you think Andrea that we are entering something that well name and brand later on ANDREA TANTAROS COHOST Well theres no question that areas that Russia used to control its moving its way back in because theres a perception around the world that US power is receding And whether you agree with the last two wars or not right now it appears that we are losing them And we have a president thats not interested in continuing fighting them Thats a fact When it comes to Ukraine I dont want American blood and treasure to die in Ukraine Im not sure our national interests are over there Our NATO allies are feckless theyre unreliable So I do think we should stay out Eric mentioned some really great ways to impose crippling sanctions But I go back to what Ive said before We have a president that would be better if he didnt draw any red lines than draw them and not enforce them Instead a message has been sent that the president cares more about food stamps than fighter jets And so thats why any bad man living in a hard country somewhere around the world is saying OK its time to flex my muscles because the US wont do anything I think he should stick to the Sandra Fluke press conferences The last thing I want and Ive said this time and time again is President Obama stumbling into a nuclear war that he doesnt have the guts to fight PERINO Do you want to respond BECKEL Yes the idea of nuclear war is to annihilate this world so anybody wouldnt be around to fight The other thing Ill make a point We made this point about Israel We give Israel the most hightech technology we have When I was in the White House we sold them the best military equipment we could and we continue to do that So thats  and we give them the best intelligence we can Beyond that the question is do we get involved ourselves on the ground The answer is clearly no PERINO Let me ask  go ahead GUTFELD Well everybody says no boots on the ground as if theres a group of people yelling boots on the ground boots on the ground Its the least helpful thing you can say in a chaotic world Its like telling a misbehaving child that no matter what you do youll never get spanked Daddy and mommy will still give you dessert we still love you The world is besieged by a number of really horrible children who rape who mutilate the innocent Saying no boots is no comfort to the worlds victims We are here not to wage war We are here to offer the possibilities that we will wage war If you offer the possibility to wage war you will not have a war Thats how it works The idea that we say were out of this Weve got some problems at home Weve got to deal with you know these social ills You guys take care of it Thats not a message you send around the world when there are people who are dying for freedom BECKEL The message you just said is exactly what were not sending We have 600 military bases around the world We have a fourocean navy We are everywhere we could possibly be We are not receding Were cutting back certain things we should be I wish we wouldnt build another aircraft carrier but we are I cant  I would like to see the evidence that somehow any of those military bases were closed GUTFELD Well I think they should go back and get the missile bases maybe in Eastern Europe Poland I think we should stop saying no boots on the ground Even if we believe that were not going to do it TANTAROS Remember the president said and he made the argument to disarm the missile bases in Eastern Europe because he said Iran wasnt a threat and hes drawing down our military right now And hes saying theres no war as an option on the table So why wouldnt you  its sad to watch somebody like Putin push around Ukraine It is sad to watch but its not our fight GUTFELD Yes the thing is if you keep saying its not our fight to every fight youre going to  TANTAROS But not every fight GUTFELD Yes TANTAROS Not every fight The policy needs to be if our allies or if the United States is directly threatened if it is a national security interest to us or our allies say for instance perhaps Jordan we would consider it then we get involved and we go and we flatten them and we leave No inky fingers no democracy building no  yes we stand with you and this orgy of ideological democracy promotion and nationbuilding Enough of that BOLLING Let me also add another  yes if you tell your kids youre not going to spank them theyll misbehave Try telling your kid youre going to take their iPhone away and theyll get right in line And so maybe there are other forms of spanking them GUTFELD I know BOLLING And yes Right TANTAROS You like it though BOLLING Economic spanking sanction spanking So I think were probably in the same ballpark GUTFELD Yes BOLLING So I think were probably in the same ballpark which is actually the administering of the spanking is where  CROSSTALK BECKEL I think Greg is right about not saying no boots on the ground The fact is we do have boots on the ground in a lot of places We just dont make that point enough And when it comes  by the way it was not a missile base in Eastern Europe But nonetheless it was taken away and that was very controversial I understand that But the reality is that there are now very complex geopolitical issues going on around the world that were not there during the Cold War Thats something that any country particularly the United States is going to have to deal with in a multifaceted way in 20 30 different areas of the world I dont know how you do that with  weve spent as much money as we can in the military on intelligence what more can we do BOLLING Can I just agree with everything except the last part We spend as much money as we can on intelligence in the military a ton more We can spend a lot more We could be a lot smarter and we can win any war through our technology and intel I think thats probably in my opinion   PERINO Is anyone else alarmed by the 911 Commission report They havent done a report in a decade and their first one is basically all the lessons weve learned youve forgotten GUTFELD Yes it is the product of a short attention span the fact that we are now living in a world where everything is happening so quickly The world might actually be more peaceful than it has been but the amount of atrocities might have decreased but the reporting of it has increased So we are feeling  were feeling the sense that bad things are happening every day And that  maybe were wrong However the desire to pull back the desire for open borders hating the NSA that creates a recipe for terror And you cant have all three at the same time Youve got to be for intelligence youve got to be for borders and youve got to be for presence Theyre going to come and get you at some point BECKEL I think the 911 report is something to pay attention to Look before we were dealing with al Qaeda which was much bigger and it was centralized and it had a leadership structure Now its in 20 different countries by franchise That by definition presents potential problems PERINO Not only that but in Syria theyve had up to 20000 foreign fighters that they actually hold Western passports They have gone for training and they can leave They can show up in any one of our countries and we are hamstringing on our intelligence to try to track them BECKEL Yes but  PERINO The other issue I think on Jordan I havent had a chance to speak a lot on here I just wanted to make a point on the humanitarian side of things For the last two years 13 million refugees have entered into Jordan Theyve doubled their population and theyre all poor helpless people living in camps And we do not have a strategy to try to deal with that problem which will be one that your children our grandchildren are going to have to deal with BECKEL And the United States media has been terrible trying to cover that And it probably leads to the downfall of Jordan as we know it PERINO Oh gosh lets hope not OK we can do better than that right America OK ahead The Five  GUTFELD No we  PERINO  Obama relishes the chance to insult Republicans but in his mind hes not really all that partisan Well debate that claim next Plus the president may have just lost one of his staunchest supporters Who is that Coming up COMMERCIAL BREAK BECKEL She likes certain  GUTFELD Ssshh BECKEL Sorry Greg PERINO There we go again GUTFELD On Monday President Obama attended the IRS hearings to condemn the corruption that infests the agency I kid again he was at a fund raiser There he said some stuff none of it recorded because no press was allowed No biggie its not like theyd report anything When Obama talks they glisten But there the president claimed hes not very partisan Perhaps but compared to what the red army Then I realized hes right Hes not a partisan because for him Democrats are too moderate and too fearful of the change hes unleashed like a bag of gremlins in a crowded theater Obama succeeded where other progressives have failed making the next Democratic presidential candidate seem like a Republican Its true after Obama everyone looks right because theres nowhere left to go But Obama is partisan if you mean any party where George Clooney is a guest Its where leftists meet in rarified air to discuss the toxic origins of a country that created their opportunities for wealth Obama is a partisan to an ideology a dogma where all calamity serves a higher purpose where a goal is never reached only suffered And thats the gimmick of progressivism As successful traditions are subverted the replacement is never spelled out because theres no alphabet grim enough It truly is Obamas world And were just gagging in it All right Hey Andrea lets be honest Isnt he really bigger than any party Is that what he really thinks Like hes not part of the Democratic Party either Hes just  hes just beyond  TANTAROS Oh I think hes part of a wing of the Democratic Party But I think when he says Im not a partisan that means if you agree with him So if you see things his way like for example when Speaker Boehner came out and spoke in favor of immigration reform President Obama had nice things to say about him If it goes his way and if you agree with him then hes not a partisan And he likes you If you disagree with him he will attack you like I guess our producer said he did moments ago in a fundraiser that he was just giving I actually think the best thing for him and I know hes fundraising to keep the Senate I personally think if I was sitting next to him advising him the best thing for him would be to lose the senate The same way Bill Clinton had to deal with an all Republican Congress that would be a dream for him Hes not going to get anything through with a Republican House anyway And then for the next two years he can demonize Republicans blame him for everything he cant get done and use executive orders Bill Clinton did it he did it masterfully but Clinton still said I feel your pain Thats what Obamas missing He doesnt even pretend to care about the crises GUTFELD Bob arent  isnt everybody a partisan I mean with the exception of may be senator like a Joe Lieberman But if youre in a party youre partisan BECKEL Yes except  let me just lets look at this thing historically The progressive movement in America is much smaller than it used to be Labor unions used to be much more powerful The left used to be much more powerful Bill sort of took the Democratic Party more to the center GUTFELD Yes BECKEL Heres the difference dealing with the Republican Party today when you used to be able to deal with people like Howard Baker and Bob Dole and Everett Dirksen and Jake Javits and people who are big people then you could actually sit down and work out deals In the House of Representatives they have refused to go to conference on anything About 80 percent of them refused to go to conference which is where most of this gets done The problem is that the Republican Party has elected a group of I hate to say it but theyre midgets And there is no big standing Republican left that I can see with the exception maybe being  CROSSTALK GUTFELD Theyre called little people  BECKEL Sorry GUTFELD  Bob And I want you to apologize to Dana BECKEL I apologize Seriously I try to look across  the Democrats by the way I would say the same thing about for the most part But I think that he Republicans  TANTAROS Bob when Republicans came to the table on immigration reform the president demonized those who didnt Even when theyre willing to compromise it doesnt matter because they get name called and thrown in the mud anyway so whats the point BECKEL They never got to conference for immigration reform thats the point Harry Reid was the one responsible for killing immigration reform I agree with that But he had a chance to get that but I still say the point is that there are no big players in either House that  what PERINO Its just that youre making arguments that all of a sudden by the time you walk back around you actually nullified the point you made BECKEL No not all I dont consider Harry Reid at the level of a Lyndon Johnson or somebody who can put together deals I cant find anybody in the Republican Party in either house that stands up to that  that stands up to the Everett Dirksen level or Howard Baker level GUTFELD Eric who are you texting LAUGHTER BOLLING No Im reading  the reason why this is relevant to the conversation were talking about President Obama being disengaged Weve talked about that before But at 257 this afternoon we get this news breaking on our BlackBerrys that said Marie Harf from the State Department said they have confirmation they believe the State Department believes that Russians were firing at  into Ukraine territory Not Russian separatists actual Russian military is firing So weve been going back and forth Yes Russians themselves are firing So now 257 two and a half hours since then has President Obama or anyone come out denouncing the Russian government for firing into Ukraine territory No Hold on But he did talk  CROSSTALK BOLLING Hold on but he did talk about his basketball  he gets 80 percent of his free throws give or take a few his arm is a little bit tired TANTAROS Few thank God BOLLING He has said that since then but nothing denouncing Putin renouncing Putin BECKEL Dont you its a little silly to talk about his  CROSSTALK BOLLING I think  heres what I think Bob I think this news that came out at 300 today  PERINO By the State Department BOLLING  by the State Department is massive And no one is talking about it We should be talking about it and they should be talking about it GUTFELD Well the issue here Dana essentially the president belongs to the party of Obama which is a singular god like entity that we all aspire to but can never achieve PERINO Well whoever the president is then that is the titular head of the party So yes the Democrats have to dance with the ones that won And that happened to be President Obama this time around Who knows who it will be next time I do find  partisan wasnt necessarily a bad word It wasnt a negative word You can be a partisan and not be a jerk and that is possible It doesnt necessarily mean people are like that But you can still go to conference and have a bill and say Im for these principles these are my principles But what are your principles Can we make a deal You give that Ill take this done I mean thats the part of thing  its not about being partisan its just about just figuring out a way to compromise GUTFELD To merge the partisanship issues I dont think theres an issue in front of the Congress with the exception of abortion that cant be resolved by reasonable people sitting down everything  TANTAROS Bob they went to conference over the debt ceiling and budget bill Theyve gone to conference on that before and Republicans caved on the payroll tax and a number of other things And heard and caught hell from their base And so now theyre not giving the president his way And thats just too bad We cant compromise on everything BECKEL Andrea the base of the Republican Party has changed and moved way far right It didnt used to be that way TANTAROS Not way far right Its just not way far left GUTFELD We have the most  this has to be the most successful effective leftwing president in the history of the  BECKEL I think  by the way I think youre right Obamas trying to recreate a progressive movement in America And he cant do it because theres not enough pieces to put it together GUTFELD There you go PERINO Thank goodness GUTFELD All right Ahead on The Five a brutal murderer was put to death for his crimes yesterday The execution took a little longer than expected and the media is going crazy Why doesnt he care as much about his victims Next COMMERCIAL BREAK PERINO Well yesterday death row inmate Joseph Wood was executed in Arizona and some in the media are outraged over how long it took for him to die BEGIN VIDEO CLIP UNIDENTIFIED MALE The convicted killer should have died quickly from lethal injection Instead it dragged out for almost two hours Its the latest execution raising questions about lethal injections and the death penalty UNIDENTIFIED MALE Arizona takes nearly two hours to execute an inmate The demand for answers after another botched death sentence UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE What went wrong an execution in Arizona goes on for two hours some witnesses saying the inmate was gasping and snorting before finally dying END VIDEO CLIP TANTAROS Well what about the victims of the brutal 1989 murder Gene and Debbie Dietz Will an AP reporter document their final gasp for air as one did for Joseph Wood Listen here to family members of the victims respond to the execution of the man who shot their loved ones in cold blood BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JEANNE BROWN SISTER OF VICTIM Everybody here from what I heard said it was excruciating Whats excruciating is seeing your dad lying there in a pool of blood seeing your sister lying there in a pool of blood This man deserved it I shouldnt really call him a man He deserved everything he had coming to him UNIDENTIFIED MALE This man I mean conducted a horrifying murder And you guys are going oh lets worry about the drug and how hes affected Why didnt we give him a bullet Why didnt we give him some Drano How would you guys feel if it was one of your family members Would you be talking about the drug or would you be talking about the family member END VIDEO CLIP TANTAROS All right Greg Im not in favor of cruel and unusual punishment but this is called the death penalty Its not the Lets hang out and have a good time penalty And you  we talked about this a lot in the Mumia case and others The victims are always lost by the media GUTFELD Yes The media is notoriously liberal and against the death penalty Therefore they focus on stories like these and theyre less likely to look at the victims and more at the victimizer and its part of our modern culture We find victims boring We find the villains interesting This is why you know not to be a cheerleader but FOX News is fair and balanced because you need to hear those people You need to hear those Because its the least fair and balanced news coverage comes when these things happen They forget about the victims And you only have so much sympathy in your life and you should allocate it carefully You should allocate it to the victims You know nobody wants some guy to suffer But they suffer They suffer more TANTAROS Dana what do you think about this I mean the media certainly made a big deal about the treatment of this criminal on death row because they said he gasped for a number of hours And then theyve been telling the tale that a number of different executions have been botched Is this something that we should be focusing on PERINO Well I think the Arizona taxpayers deserve some answers from their  from the state government about what went wrong and how they could make sure that if theyre going to have the death penalty that it is done within the confines of what the law says it should be and that it comports with peoples compassion or empathy for that point about  about the cruel and unusual punishment There was one other point though that she  we didnt play the sound byte but later on in her quote there in the interview the victims sister said Its ridiculous 25 years later to go through this appeal after appeal Its ridiculous the paperwork I have I actually think that if you are against the death penalty that is actually where you could focus your efforts to try to help people deal with the judicial system that drags these things out for so long and makes it so much harder for somebody like her and the gentleman with her to get closure TANTAROS Eric what do you think You are prodeath penalty You said just let him die Who cares how long it takes BOLLING Right I have no compassion I have no empathy for the criminal But there are ways to face the The reason they get into this trouble is they found the electric chair wasnt  was too cruel The people were dying and things were happening And it was  so they went to lethal injection We can fix this Youre on death row Your know after your time is up at the end of the week Ill let you choose You want a bullet You want electric chair You want a lethal injection or do you want to hang Its up to you We know then what the end result is going to be So you know what Theres your compassion And thats where my compassion would end TANTAROS Bob you know I think I used to be prodeath penalty and then Ive moderated my position because if youre going to be prolife you should be consistently prolife Thats just my take on the issue And weve seen some people get executed that I dont think should have been executed But weve seen a lot of people executed in Chicago without a peep from the left So if youre going to be prolife  which so many on the left are not on the issue of abortion theyre prochoice  why dont they show their commitment to life across the board BECKEL Well listen I happen to be a prolife and I am against the death penalty One of the reasons I am is that the Constitution does specifically say that the government not other people but the government does not have a right to involve themselves in cruel and unusual punishment This was that instant It was a mistake probably But the reason a number of states have cut back on the death penalty and frozen it is because were finding out that more and more of these people have not been lawyered very well They did not commit crimes Theyve put away people who are not guilty And it seems to me that youve got to take a very hard look at this system and say weve got to make sure that were not putting people to death who dont deserve to be put to death and when we do we do it in a humane way whether we like that word or not GUTFELD That  thats really what this is Its not about a botched execution A botched execution is used as a Trojan horse to talk about the death penalty I could be prolife and prodeath penalty because I just say you kill the guilty and protect the innocent I dont think theres hypocrisy there BOLLING By the way I dont think there are that many cases if any of executing the wrong guys BECKEL Oh my God There were three of them in Illinois TANTAROS Thats why I moderated because of what Bob said because there are instances where there have been innocent people executed BOLLING The jurys out on that exactly BECKEL I think BOLLING I think its a lot less frequent than youd say BECKEL It is less  I mean TANTAROS Its less frequent But if it happens one time isnt that enough GUTFELD I dont know TANTAROS I dont know I dont know What an interesting block where we have all different views And on The Five a huge update on the Christian mom who is sentenced to death in Sudan for refusing to renounce her faith Bobs got a picture of her that youre going to want to stick around to see coming up COMMERCIAL BREAK BOLLING Corporate greed meets government greed Add a father versus a daughter and just for fun make the father a US senator Democrat Senator Joe Manchins daughter is moving her very very successful company Mylan overseas because the business environment her fathers party has provided is so restrictive and expensive here she feels its her job to move out of the US You know where I stand Im a free market capitalist and I warned lawmakers for years this was going to happen Companies flee the US bringing highpaying jobs with them Wake up Let me guess you and Obama think they shouldnt go she shouldnt go BECKEL I think that the law says shes allowed to go I think you ought to close the law But what we dont take into account here and Ill try to get you the number I cant give it to you exactly today but I will by tomorrow The number of foreign companies that move here and establish themselves as US corporations Now it goes both ways It seems to me the pharmaceutical companies seem to be leading the way here and they do that by buying up pharmaceutical companies overseas and then declaring themselves pharmaceutical companies of another country BOLLING Regardless the reason why she did it is because they have the top tax rate is 35 percent I think theyre paying in the mid20s or so But Ands shes going to bring her tax rate down to 21 percent the first year teens the second and third year going forward Who wouldnt make the move Youve got to make that move right TANTAROS Yes Most of the time people are fleeing car wrecks right or train wrecks The fact that US companies are running away from the United States and not  their government and their laws is a huge problem And President Obama wants to keep them here wants to keep their wallet here Hes saying We dont care if you go Just leave your money here On the pharmaceutical industry the point thats so nauseating about this is so many in the pharmaceutical industry like Pfizer were the first to the table when it came to Obamacare They pushed for a law that would be imposed on everybody else Then Pfizer tried to buy AstraZeneca so they could stash their money away in Ireland and be subject to this British tax rate Meanwhile guess who gets stuck with the bill for Obamacare The US taxpayers So these inversions is what theyre trying to do which is what Pfizer was trying to do are the hottest issue in business right now US companies dont want to be here anymore They want to be something  somewhere else which tells them that theres a real problem here at home BOLLING Rather than fixing the problem  either one of you guys take this  fixing the problem by making it more businessfriendly to stay here lowering the corporate tax rate They want to slap some sanctions some fines some fees and force companies not to do it GUTFELD Well in this day and age when government grows thats compassion When corporations grow its greed TANTAROS Yes GUTFELD And whats amazing is why are we worried about China right now Because they woke up They woke up to capitalism Its staterun But its capitalism The result massive eradication of poverty The reason why the world has gotten better is because Chinas gotten better The poverty level has lowered because of that An explosion in new wealth This is because communists are now better at capitalism than the capitalists BOLLING Dana your thoughts on what the  the way to fix this BOLLING Well I think its a simple question Should America be the best place in the world to do business or not If the answer is yes then we have one simple thing that we can do and thats the corporate tax rate Because all of these  you take all of these issues It traces it back to that one issue Interestingly today four Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee Carper Bennett Warner and Casey all said that they would not back  would not back President Obamas proposal to BECKEL Lets make one point here We are sitting here talking about an infinitesimal number of US corporations Were making it sound like theres a big flood of people leaving and there are not BOLLING Billions and billions BECKEL There are not What about your idea I like your idea But your idea is GUTFELD But there are actually little children leaving The little children Thats how the Democrats do it when little children are coming in Its babies BECKEL No but seriously the reason they come here the reason the foreign companies come here is because we have the best workers We have the best technology We have the best universities BOLLING Highest tax rates most restrictive PERINO Wait a minute But BECKEL Do you want to move to Nairobi BOLLING They want to go Can we please just get this in President Obama said this just a few minutes ago You have to listen to this line fair share coming up once again And you wonder why I call this guy a socialist Listen BEGIN VIDEO CLIP BARACK OBAMA PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES We need to stop companies from renouncing their citizenship just to get out of paying their fair share of taxes Lets everybody get together Democrats and Republicans to deter companies from rushing to take advantage of this tax loophole and lets make sure that were rewarding companies that are investing and paying their fair share here in the United States Im not interested in punishing these companies but I am interested in economic patriotism END VIDEO CLIP PERINO And Bob that is why  that is why were talking about it Because President Obama decided to make this a campaign issue We didnt come up with this on our own The president and his staff has decided that this is what theyre going to  that this is where theyre going to place their flag in the ground for the campaign BECKEL What is wrong with fair share What is wrong with fair share BOLLING Our tax rate is the highest in the world Thirty BECKEL Oh so what We still make more money make more profits Take a look at the Dow Jones GUTFELD It will never be enough for you Bob will it Why not make it 50 percent or 55 percent BECKEL I think weve got to raise corporate taxes PERINO You didnt even realize you were supposed to be defending President Obama there That was kind of refreshing You just said that its a stupid issue So youre telling President Obama dont run on this in the campaign because it doesnt make sense BECKEL I think it doesnt make sense I agree And last time around it wasnt corporations as much as it was the 1 percent of people who were just trying to have some vacation money save maybe invest He said that was greedy Thats called survival CROSSTALK BECKEL The hedge fund guys are more than surviving Those guys can survive on what theyve got in their pockets BOLLING Next up on The Five could you go an entire day without complaining How about three weeks One of you guys just did that Are any of us up to the challenge Find out next That was a terrible piece ph COMMERCIAL BREAK BECKEL Did you ever go three weeks without complaining One guy just did and he says it changed his life Tim Ferriss the author of The FourDay Work Week said at first he was only able to go 11 days without complaining But eventually he was able to go all 24 Would any of us at this table be able to do that Whos the biggest complainer around here Well first of all this is a television business and I discovered that its just about everywhere I do pride myself on not being much of a complainer But let me go around Eric do you think youre a complainer BOLLING It depends here I complain But whats technically complaining BECKEL Its not being angry about something Complaining is  the definition of it BOLLING Look the producers Porter would probably say Im the biggest complainer but I just really  just want to you know like when I complain I try to make the show better I like complain about some topics TANTAROS Complaining for a purpose BOLLING Yes TANTAROS Is that why you do it so much BECKEL Dana what would you rate yourself in complaining from 1 to 10 PERINO Probably a 6 7 BECKEL Six seven PERINO Depends on the day I mean if Im not Im TANTAROS Keep going PERINO If its WiFi I will fix it But BECKEL Well see the WiFi wasnt  that wasnt you complaining because you were angry because the thing didnt work which is a legitimate thing to do PERINO Right But then it got fixed BECKEL But theres something  instead of like complaining about  some people have the complaining in their DNA Now Greg Im not pointing my finger at you but where would you put yourself on that scale GUTFELD No I  I am constantly complaining I know that But a complaint remember is a reminder of how lucky your life is Like people dont walk around and go like Ow this cancer is irritating No theyre saying Damn it the printers not working When your problems are  yes when your problems are the printers not working or that you cant find a taxi and all these things that pretty much means your lifes OK Thats the way I look at it BECKEL Thats interesting All right What about you on 1 to 10 TANTAROS I dont complain very much BECKEL Really TANTAROS Really BECKEL I heard you complaining a bunch about vegetables TANTAROS On this  yes I dont  I definitely dont think Im the biggest complainer at this table for sure Do I complain in life Yes its hard not to BECKEL Well I find complaining to be a sort of a useless exercise Although if you walk around this building or any TV broadcast network thats all you hear is complaints GUTFELD Well complaints are necessary therapy PERINO Yes How do you make things better if you dont complain GUTFELD Yes But its just something you do to relieve stress Its like getting  you know loosening the screws BECKEL But why do you think its indigenous to the TV industry seems to me more than anything else GUTFELD I think its everywhere BOLLING Yes Its everywhere BECKEL You do You think so BOLLING People complain all the time BECKEL Dana you and I both came out of politics where theres a lot of complaining But do you find the TV industry to be more complainers than the political industry PERINO No not necessarily BECKEL Really PERINO I dont know I just  heres the thing I think when you complain about the little stuff then thats what adds up and then it weighs you down So you cant complain that they have chicken noodle soup as a special two days in a row those little things You should only complain about things you can control GUTFELD But everything to you is bad PERINO And you cant control it let it go GUTFELD Little things There are no big deals in your life BECKEL There are no big deals in my view except for death and taxes I guess One More Thing is up next COMMERCIAL BREAK PERINO Its time now for One More Thing Im going to go first thank you Greg for that support This is something that I would never ever do This is why I dont go whale watching Its why I do not go in a kayak in the ocean Take a look at these people They were kayaking off the coast of Argentina And they end up with a  on the top  on the back of a humpback whale in the ocean Now Bob look at that Theyre on BECKEL That is scary PERINO Can you imagine BECKEL No PERINO Would you ever do that BECKEL No GUTFELD This is perverted PERINO Why Because of the humpback whales GUTFELD First gay marriage and now people jumping on whales PERINO Well they were in a kayak GUTFELD Still disgusting PERINO OK GUTFELD Im writing an angry letter PERINO OK Well we look forward to that complaint GUTFELD Thank you PERINO OK Andrea youre next TANTAROS OK Jimmy Kimmel last night shows how much people love Apple And if youre Apple youve got to be feeling pretty good about this They used

insignia on the back UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE Because its Apple that would be what would impress me UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE So you would buy anything UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE I would pretty much buy anything from Apple UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE Even a Casio watch with a sticker on the back END VIDEO CLIP TANTAROS If youre Apple how psyched are you right now Im an Apple shareholder Im very excited BOLLING That is a powerful brand TANTAROS It is PERINO Eric youre next BOLLING OK So LeBron James has decided to go back to Cleveland We knew that He wrote a heartfelt letter that some say brought them to tears explaining his decision Frank Caliendo did a brilliant job reading that letter And let me remind you he did it in Morgan Freemans voice Watch BEGIN VIDEO CLIP FRANK CALIENDO COMEDIAN Before anyone ever cared where I would play basketball I was a kid from northeast Ohio Its where I walked Its where I ran Its where I cried Im ready to accept the challenge Im coming home END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING And

Well as you know Im incredibly patriotic Dana But I hate July 4th which was last month because everybodys wearing skimpy clothing like halter tops and cutoffs Even the women Its disgusting to me Finally a solution we have a  an American patriotic burka Now I can enjoy my Fourth of July while also subjugating my body to total modesty And this makes me feel comfortable And its actually kind of cool under there because you dont have to wear that much Theres a little website there where you can order it And Im sure youll be flocking there as soon as this show is over BECKEL Do they have those in your size PERINO He has to have it hemmed GUTFELD Yes thank you PERINO So he doesnt trip GUTFELD Thank you very much PERINO All right Bob BECKEL We all remember the woman that the Sudanese government had decided to put to death the death penalty because she refused to denounce her Christianity She had a husband who was a Christian two children But she chose to take the death penalty Fortunately because of worldwide opinion she got out of Sudan and she went to Italy to Rome And she met with the pope And I want to congratulate the pope for doing that I want to remind people that this is just another example of what happens in Muslim countries to Christians And at some point maybe the world will wake up certainly the pope I hope wakes up on this It is time for us to denounce them for what they are which are barbarians and people who mutilate people people who kill people and people who destroy Christians who were there before their butts were there So there you go PERINO A very powerful picture of the pope that Im sure will get worldwide recognition BECKEL I hope so Because its really  the pope has not frankly said that much about it And not a lot of other people have either GUTFELD Because the pope doesnt have an army We have an army BECKEL Thats true Thats true PERINO Dont forget to set your DVRs Never miss an episode of The Five Well see you back here tomorrow

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/09/02/is-wendy-davis-political-star-fading-in-texas-gubernatorial-race/, As a feisty state senator with pink sneakers and a fist in the air Wendy Davis captured both the love and the ire of America last year when she pulled an 11hour filibuster of antiabortion measures in the Texas Capitol But after using that star power to win her partys nomination for governor Davis is still struggling to take a lead over Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott and some say party confidence in her race is waning     I think the frustration in some Democratic circles is that despite her star power and substantial war chest she has not been able to move the dial against Greg Abbott after a year on the campaign trail Mark Jones political science professor at Rice University in Houston told FoxNewscom Even the highprofile abuseofpower indictment of Republican Gov Rick Perry whom Davis hopes to replace didnt seem to hurt Abbott or raise the Democrats profile over the media din Larry Sabato director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics said the Perry indictment might even give Abbot a bit of a boost since Republicans are so angry that it happened In an illustrative moment Davis 51 was forced to hit back against the head of the Democratic Governors Association back in April when he suggested publicly that her race wasnt competitive enough to be considered a toptier priority Were hopeful in Texas but we all understand that Democrats havent won Texas in a long time DGA Chairman and Vermont Gov Peter Shumlin told reporters It didnt take long for Davis an attorney who has been serving in the Texas state Senate since 2008 to respond She called Shumlin uninformed and a Washington DC desk jockey But by then the media narrative that Daviss campaign was on an impossible journey was on its way Its been a tough narrative to break For Wendy Davis Filibuster Goes Only So Far in Race to Be Governor of Texas blared a headline in The New York Times in June along with an accounting of the campaigns alleged weaknesses including the hiring of a Washington DC operative instead of a Lone Star State political veteran for her campaign manager She didnt have any Texas experience Jones said of campaign manager Karin Johanson who has since left Others say the Davis campaign did a poor job of controlling her own story A Dallas Morning News profile back in January for instance poked holes in what had ostensibly been a ragstoriches journey I hated that piece Cenk Uygur cohost of the progressive Young Turks said at the time It was a hatchet job  and of course the conservatives loved it and went to town on it Jones said the bubble was burst by some of the revelations in the story like that Davis pursued her law degree at Harvard which her husband had paid for by liquidating his own 401k fund They later divorced Analysts cited a recoil from that story and shortly afterward a poll was released showing that her unfavorability ratings were actually going up among women Until August state polls generally had her trailing Abbott by between 10 and 15 points on average Analysts say any Democrat would have a difficult time winning in a Republicandominated state that President Obama lost by 16 percentage points in 2012 Media hype does not produce votes most of the time Sabato said Wendy Davis received enormous amounts of state and national coverage but the Democratic base in Texas is nowhere near a majority of the electorate Not everyone agrees The media narrative is so bound to the notion that no Democrat can win the red state  much less a leftofcenter liberal who during the debate over new abortion restrictions accused Perry of demonizing women  that some are ignoring the latest poll An Aug 8 survey by Rasmussen showed Davis only trailing Abbott by 8 points As for the abortion restrictions they passed anyway even after the filibuster but they were recently put on hold after a federal judge found them unconstitutional The intelligence you have is not correct at all  the level of excitement for Wendy this summer has been tremendous exclaimed Jan Soifer chairwoman of the Travis County Democratic Party in Austin in an interview with FoxNewscom In the heat of the summer in Texas we never get this level of enthusiasm but we are she added Its amazing Political analyst Liz Chadderdon agrees that the whole story is not playing out in pressShe has energized people that have not been energized for Texas governors races she said Trust me  the polls may not be reflecting how much energy there is on the ground for Wendy but I think youre going to see that change as we get postLabor Day shes got 20 million and she will be up on television I think youre going to see this race change very quickly According to recent reports Davis has raised 27 million while Abbott has raised 35 million Davis campaign did not return repeated requests for comment Reaching out for the womens vote is part of the strategy as Davis recently released an ad accusing Abbott of dissenting in a ruling that made a vacuum company liable for a rape of a woman by a doortodoor salesman in 1998 Abbott was a state Supreme Court justice at the time Factchecker PolitiFact called the ad mostly true Analysts say Abbott has kept his powder dry by not spending as much on ads which means he could unleash a barrage of ads against her in response and in the last crucial weeks of the campaign if he wishes Her campaign has been far too concerned with why Greg Abbott wouldnt be a good governor and not why Wendy Davis would be a good governor Jones said She is not giving women a good enough reason to vote for her Thats just not so said Soifer who claimed Davis is poised to bring women who are historically lowturnout voters in Texas to the polls in November I think there is a sense on the part of many women of this state we that need to stand up and take notice They are voting for the first time or voting for the first time in a long time in this election and theyre voting for Davis she added I think at that point you will see that this isnt a Red State Thats what Austin resident Mary Patrick a volunteer for Davis says too I think all kinds of people can win here including Democrats she told FoxNewscom,2014-09-02T08:08-04:00,abortion
Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/04/23/bonus-bombshell-irs/,This is a rush transcript from The Five April 23 2014 This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated ERIC BOLLING COHOST Hello everyone Im Eric Bolling along with Andrea Tantaros Bob Beckel Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld     Its 5 oclock in New York City and this is The Five MUSIC BOLLING Are you ready for your blood to boil Your head is going to explore when you hear what the IRS is up to now We the taxpayer handed	178 million in bonuses to these thugs last year Thats outrageous enough Couldnt get any worse right Wrong A whopping 28 million of those dollars were handed over to IRS employees cited for offenses like drug use making violent threats fraudulent unemployment benefits claims and misusing government credit cards and oh this one dont forget failing to pay their own taxes And its not just a few bad apples There are 2800 employees who were disciplined in the very same year they received quote performance bonuses Dana you thought  you sent this around didnt you DANA PERINO COHOST Well of course because you know my great evening plans are  I send everybody emails Thats what I would like to do One of things I love about this is the idea remember that book everything I needed to know I learned in kindergarten So back in school if somebody throw a spit ball the teacher said nobody is getting up for recess until the spitball thrower raises their hand and you had to sit there and wait I actually think that that should be true for government employees and their bonuses I can understand a bonus structure but when they owe the federal government money and there have been these allegations that they either need to fess up to him or make them right before they get bonuses that other citizens that work in the private sector dont get BOLLING Twentyeight hundred of them were not talking one or two 2800 And they got paid out the same year they were cited GREG GUTFELD COHOST Eric you get off their backs They have had a rough year So many hearings which cut into their conferences But it goes back to the question who audits the auditor Who audits the IRS Its not the White House Its like asking Lindsey Lohan to audit her drug dealer Theres no desire also in the media obviously to expose this corruption because its under their guy So you can get away with anyone because the media is his concubine The media is Obamas harem the IRS is the pit bull You know change in the front yard Hes there to do their bidding Hes not  theyre not there to go after him So they are safe We will talk about this for a day and something else will come up that the IRS does and well forget BOLLING Ands is it a culture of just looking the other way when bad stuff is going on especially at the IRS ANDREA TANTAROS COHOST You have two Americas The ones that are connected that are above the law that dont have to abide by the same rules the ones that are collecting the taxes from everyone else but are not paying it themselves You know they  I would assume most of these employees file very simple W4s How are you getting yourself in tax trouble with very simple W4s when you work at the IRS I forgot about the conferences that you broke up the Star Trek and the line dancing and all that stuff PERINO Hot tub TANTAROS But there was a story that I saw that asked whether or not they were getting these bonuses to pay their back taxes which would be even more appalling that they are coming to the rescue of people who knowingly did wrongdoing with our money so that they can make good on taxes that a lot of us can barely pay BOLLING Bobby 178 million 96000 employees It seems excessive to me BOB BECKEL COHOST Well first 96000 employees and 2800 of them have some problems My guess its probably not a big percentage difference of other departments or agencies or businesses But look the IRS its a bad year for the IRS to be getting this story I mean this is exactly the wrong kind of story to have because of all the problems they have had But lets keep this in mind There are a lot of professionals who work in the federal government who are very very good who can make a lot more money working in the private sector So its easier to beat up on them PERINO I actually dont think thats true anymore If you look at the numbers there are some at the very very highest levels BECKEL Yes PERINO But thats not true when you look at all the benefits that they get and the retirement compared to what most Americans are seeing which is one of reasons that people were so outraged when Scott Walker had that fight with the unions up in Wisconsin and people start realizing wait they get all of that all of those benefits all those guarantees and they dont  I dont think that that is true anymore I think  BECKEL If you think lawyers high priced lawyers say the upper level lawyers at the IRS tax lawyers make a lot of money out in private practice right BOLLING Bob for an IRS agent to not pay his taxes or underreport and some of the other isnt that like a bad cop like a dirty cop BECKEL Its like stupid is what it is GUTFELD I think the IRS should stand for Im really sorry You know what they did to me I paid a buttload of taxes this year	My checks were returned with insufficient postage It was like they kick in the face for fun I almost respected that TANTAROS And then they charged you interest GUTFELD No it arrived April 15th and it said insufficient postage PERINO Do you use the stamps that you put on the original or that they marked it up so that  GUTFELD They marked it up so I couldnt use it PERINO You got fined GUTFELD Yes BOLLING I think its post marked April 15th I think youre good	Well find out Well talk to a lawyer Speaking of DC shenanigans Harry Reid has been making a fool of himself on and off the Senate floor Listen BEGIN VIDEO CLIP SEN HARRY REID D NEVADA The Koch brothers seem to believe in an America where the system is rigged to benefit the very wealthy Terrible dishonesty of these two brothers who are about as unAmerican as anyone that I can imagine These people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not They are nothing more than domestic terrorists END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Now the GOP is fighting Listen to RNC chairman Reince Priebus getting fed up with old Harry this morning Listen BEGIN VIDEO CLIP REINCE PRIEBUS RNC CHAIRMAN Harry Reid is so dirty and so unethical that some of these things have to happen END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING And the RNC in a memo to members today writes quote He was caught funneling campaign money to his relatives his Senate majority PAC was caught lying to voters and he was caught hypocritically accepting money tied to the people he calls unAmerican as he desperately clings to power Is there anything Harry Reid wont do to promote his own self interests Ands let me start with you GOP fighting back TANTAROS Good They should take whacks at him and I think theyre raising a lot of money doing it If you take the look at the latest Rasmussen Poll of members of Congress Harry Reid is below Nancy Pelosi	Hes the lowest one at 26 percent approval rating So they are raising a lot of money likely on going after Harry Reid Is he corrupt Yes Is he a liar Yes The dangerous danger of this though is Harry Reid doesnt really nationalize the election If this becomes the Koch brothers which has been the argument on the left which makes liberals heads blow up when you say their name just look at Bob when we say the Koch brothers if it becomes the Koch brothers versus Harry Reid I think thats a problem And I think if Republicans only focus on Harry Reid then they miss the opportunity to go after bigger things and reach higher like the unpopularity of ObamaCare BOLLING What do you think of the GOP fighting back BECKEL Well first of all  I mean look Harry Reid has got an ability to say the wrong thing at the wrong time but I agree with everything he said about the Koch brothers I agree plus 10 times 10 He was exactly right about that The thing about domestic terrorism was just a horrible use of words	But I dont know what the Republicans think they are doing They are attacking him for a higher  you know I dont know of a campaign honestly that I have worked on that somebody in the family didnt get a job on Ill bet you if I went through the Republican filings I bet you I can find endless numbers of them TANTAROS Its a little more seedy than that I mean he was funneling thousands of dollars through this campaign to his family members	And if a Republican would do it you wouldnt stop talking  BECKEL I bet you I can find a Republican  PERINO And they werent doing work on the campaign BOLLING Can I also emphasize this Hes the Senate majority leader	Doesnt that position come with a little bit extra scrutiny A little bit extra  I dont know we should hold him I higher regard for that right PERINO I would think so Yes absolutely So either Harry Reid is deliberately making these kind of comments because its helping him either his own personal brand or he is making money off of it through political things because they do  you know the worse  he doesnt want to have egg on his face in November if the Senate were to flip to Republicans The other thing is it could be that he just has extremely bad judgment  in which case his staff needs to control it better But on the RNC side what the Republicans are doing today it wasnt necessarily for just attacking Harry Reid this was a signal to donors to the Republicans that yes we have fight we have fire in the belly and we will stand up and were going to punch back and the donors like to see that So there is a political strategy from their perspective too and probably a good one BOLLING Good timing GUTFELD I dont know This  I  this whole GOP is fighting	thing by raising money against someone you should have beaten a couple of years ago thats the sad point is that you let these jerks win so you got to raise money against them Why dont you beat them in an election so you dont have this problem	So there are no Harry Reids Find a candidate that can beat Harry Reid Harry Reid is the symbol of the worst kind of politician that hes brazen in his cronyism Hes thirst for power he does not hide Thats why it bothers him Hes like created in a lab Hes equal parts evil and evil and hes got a voice like you are bathing in spoiled milk BECKEL You know something I could have taken you out there and beaten him last time around GUTFELD Thats my point BECKEL The Republicans have this incredible ability to come up with the biggest jerks with the worst backgrounds And they do it year in and year out  PERINO OK She wasnt a jerk TANTAROS But some of the things going for the GOP are people like Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid because they  in midterms they do give us ways to raise money Harry Reid he is Joe Biden but much less fun He has a history of making really off the wall comments like he said that if a jobs bill didnt go through that men would be home they wouldnt be working and they would beat their wives Really hes a little wack BECKEL He said things like that he should be beatable But you put this crazy woman against him CROSSTALK BOLLING Lets take it one step further The Democrats made him Senate majority leader What does that say about the other Democrats in the Senate PERINO That hes really powerful and smart BECKEL Its a lot more complicated than that Eric believe me BOLLING OK Bob but  BECKEL Mixing oil and gas I mean  BOLLING Really BECKEL It takes a while to work something up to the leadership yes BOLLING Isnt it a reflection on you who you bring up and make your leader who you vote for you put them forward BECKEL Harry Reid got on the track years ago Its very tough to beat a leader when they get up  BOLLING Well listen there are leaders whove been removed as leaders as well BECKEL Im trying to think of one BOLLING All right Late night stepped up the political  Im talking about House and Senate BECKEL Oh Im sorry BOLLING Stepped up the political jokes Take a listen to Jimmy Fallon having some fun at Hillary Clintons expense By the way Fallon got booed and paying ph to this joke BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JIMMY FALLON COMEDIAN I want to say congrats to Chelsea Clinton last week She announced that she is expecting her first child Thats great Yes if its a girl it will get some Chelseas old handme downs	And if its a boy it will get some of Hillarys Its very  little pantsuits little pantsuits little cream pantsuits It wasnt that hard of a joke Whats a big deal END VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Greg what do you think GUTFELD I talked about this before Theres a sexist element to comedy where it is OK to rip open a males appearance You can talk about Christies eight or whatever But if you go after a female I dont think that was a political response to it It was a response  its a protective bubble of being a female that people go oh I cant believe you said that You made fun of how she looked But are we over this at this point Isnt everybody open game BOLLING Isnt it funnier though when you  GUTFELD That was a good joke by the way BOLLNG  when you breach that protective bubble GUTFELD Yes thats the problem is that she has a protective bubble much like President Obama did in the media No one is going to  no one is  he did he got booed CROSSTALK PERINO He got booed but then people laughed because were in uncharted territory It was OK to make fun of Sarah Palin and they made horrible jokes about her But the thing that was great about her she was able to also laugh with them and at herself and she joined it So thats how she persevered We are about to enter into something we havent really been involved because Hillary Clinton did not win the nomination in 2008 We havent had a Democratic nominee a woman presidential nominee So these jokes and things like Fallon you kind of have of just keep moving the line and well maybe get to a point of parody But at this point  no I dont think were there yet I dont at least human naturewise BOLLING Could a Republican  I dont know I guess a comedian  Greg you can make that joke and not get in trouble for that joke right GUTFELD Which one that one BOLLING The pantsuit the Hillary pantsuit GUTFELD Yes But  I mean a lot of these jokes jokes about clothing and jokes about weight They are tired They are as tired as brake pads on a driving instructors car BOLLING What if a Republican talking head said something like that though TANTAROS Well it depends on what who said it Women probably have an easier time criticizing other women Men probably likely dont But I think if Hillary becomes the nominee its going to be very tough to make jokes about her Shes going to have a lot of people rallying around her But if these comedians were smart they would look at where they get laughs they would look at where the ratings goes and put humor over ideology The Chris Christie thing I do think theres a danger in overreaching with the fat jokes They do get old after a while the elephant in room fat chance But Christie is genius because he rolls with it like Ronald Reagan did He used his vulnerability his weight like Ronald used his age as something that he pokes fun at himself for GUTFELD He literally can roll it TANTAROS He really did roll with it BECKEL The only thing I can say is what you just said could a Republican do that First of all you have to find a Republican thats got a sense of humor which would be a little bit  CROSSTALK PERINO Thats what you said last year BECKEL But let me say this Hillary Clinton is one of the more  whether or not you like it shes one of the more popular politicians in America She does have a diehard group of followers Part of that was Greg said is right Hillary Clinton you can make all the fun of her you want but she is the toughest politician in America today BOLLING Toughest what BECKEL Toughest to beat particularly with Republicans BOLLING Mostly because of the money though BECKEL No you dont have a dog in the fight BOLLING Next up a woman who wanted to be on reality TV so badly she was willing to abort her unborn child Is this what the world is coming to Andrea has got the details But before we go I wanted to mention that my hometown ballpark Wrigley Field turns 100 today Thats baseball the way it was meant to be played and watched Were going to go to break with the fun and familiar memory the 7th inning stretch with the one and only Harry Caray COMMERCIAL BREAK TANTAROS Last week we told you about three filmmakers attempting to make a documentary profiling the horrific crimes committed by serial killer and abortionist Kermit Gosnell The documentarians have launched the biggest ever crowdfunding campaign to pay for this film And with three weeks before the funding window closing they raised 61 percent of their	21 million goal Last night on OReilly actor Nick Searcy from Justified explained why this movie needs to be made BEGIN VIDEO CLIP NICK SEARCY ACTOR You dont have to go into gory details and show the blood and gore for this to be a fascinating film I mean this was a very wellrespected member of his community This went on for 30 years with the support of a lot of government programs and for this sort of situation to continue as long as it did and for Gosnell to continue doing the things that he did so long it says a lot about society and its not just an exploitation film as you said Its a story about why this happened END VIDEO CLIP TANTAROS So a lot of people donating to this film If you want to donate I want to get this out of the way its visit gosnellmoviecom Bob you have expressed your horror when we covered the Gosnell abortion trial what he did displaying babys feet in jars Why do you think Hollywood wont fund this movie Why do you think they have to crowdfund it BECKEL I have no idea I mean if theyre willing to do movies on Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer which theyve done who are horrible serial killers I dont understand what their problem is I mean if they are arguing that its just  you know its difficult to show it I mean Ted Bundy killed 45 women or something and Jeffrey Dahmer put his kids in the freezer I mean come on I dont get it TANTAROS Eric where are Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson if you really investigate what Gosnell did he would actually take preference over the white women and put them in cleaner rooms And if you look at the numbers he aborted far more AfricanAmerican babies minority babies that he did white ones Where are they saying this guy should be pried and have a documentary BOLLING Ands I have no idea They  maybe theres nothing in it for them Maybe its not outrageous for them Maybe it doesnt suit their political dialect Some of the crap thats on TV they cant find a few more hundred grand to make this film which I think a lot of people are interested in at least knowing what goes and maybe  again because of the ideology because it exposes what goes on at abortion clinic what probably goes on behind  I dont know 200 or 300 more abortion clinics around the country That doesnt fit their narrative as well What are  isnt there millions of tens of dollars that go into funding the arts Federal dollars going into funding the arts They cant find any of this for a documentary on something so important as this TANTAROS And Dana who from either side of the aisle can defend this man This shouldnt even be a partisan issue People shouldnt be worried I should say about getting behind something like this Its not exactly controversial to be against someone like him PERINO And in fact I was  it was  we wondered at the time during the trial why there werent more people that actually support a pro choice point of view that were out there outraged about him and his actions and defending what they consider to be a safe and legal practice It is illegal practice I do think that supply and demand is an interesting thing when the free market is allowed to work This idea of crowdfunding for a movie is relatively new But something else is new which is how television shows are produced and made and that because its not concentrated at one movie house or network anymore and theres a lot of different ways to fund movies thats why you have actually Nick Searcy of Justified who has come out as a conservative in Hollywood That takes bravery and some courage and some professional success to be able to do that and then to utilize your success to be able to push forward a project that you think is important in Hollywood That is very valuable That is new and I have a feeling and I hope that well see more of it TANTAROS Greg you know Nick Searcy he comes on RED EYE GUTFELD Terrible guy TANTAROS He takes  he does take a lot of risk coming out in Hollywood you know for calls like this But why Where are all womens rights groups in Hollywood So even if youre prochoice no matter what your views on abortion are why arent more maybe women actresses coming out in Hollywood saying this man was mistreating women and female babies and male babies period	Where are they GUTFELD This isnt a typical serial killer film It isnt like Ted Bundy because the viewer the producer has no connection to evil For a vehement prochoicer Gosnells crime was one of poor timing He was just lousy at his job Hes like a clumsy forklift driver you know If he had just done it right this wouldnt have happened But what if Hollywood this is what I was thinking about today  what if Hollywood actually did the Gosnell picture Remember the Liam Neeson film NonStop the terrorist was a relative of a 911 victim So lets see if they did Gosnell It would be a fat white Southern prolife conservative disguised as an abortionist who purposely killed babies to bring an end to abortion Thats how they would do it BECKEL You know you got to give Searcy a lot of credit for this by the way Youre right But you also remember it was  nobody in the media covered this story Remember when we talk about this Were very few We did it and a few others but not many TANTAROS Well instead of  go ahead BOLLING Very quickly Lets be a little fair and balanced here	Where are the prolife groups theres a lot of money there that if theyre going to do something this would be a nice area  TANTAROS Again Im going to say gosnellmoviecom and well tweet it out and put it on our Facebook page OK So while people arent talking about funding the Gosnell movie they are talking about this woman Josie Cunningham This is whats getting headlined  a whom who lives in the UK who wants to be famous	Shes pregnant and she wants to get famous and she thinks if she has an abortion she can get on a reality show Heres her in her own words BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JOSIE CUNNINGHAM I would have to say Im having the abortion to further my career definitely Another reason was cause after Big Brother	approached me the women to go on the show they went a bit cold after they saw in recent publication that I was pregnant and I know theyll get back on board you know after the abortion END VIDEO CLIP TANTAROS OK Greg Big Brother has come out They said we dont want her as part of the show So she canceled her abortion procedure GUTFELD Is it not wrong I thought everybody is OK with choice	Like its  I mean all of a sudden now theyre  so wait a minute they have a moral  they have a spine they are saying they are against it Im surprised because I thought this was just some kind of lifestyle choice of convenience But now because she actually came out and said shes getting an abortion to further her career they are like oh thats bad How many of these  how many of these actresses on these reality shows have done exactly what shes done but havent said so TANTAROS She said Dana Im finally on the vernal of becoming famous and she said now its going to be ruined PERINO Thats a curious thing I know that some people I guess have made a career of being on a reality TV show but it seems to me a strange 	 well a very weird career choice and I think  I would hope that in the UK she would realize she has a lot more options in order to make a living GUTFELD I dont think she has many options given her intelligence TANTAROS I would agree with that Eric she also outraged to the public Shes been trying to get famous for a while In 2013 she demanded 4800 pounds from the National Health Centers in London for a boob job BOLLING Demanded it TANTAROS She demanded it She said being flatchested had quote	ruined her life and she made headlines last year BOLLING Yes honestly Im just completely disgusted with this human being If she wants to be famous shes going to be infamous Shes cold hearted Shes evil Shes pure evil Its a human being shes talking about Shes aborting a human being over a few minutes of fame on a reality  honestly Goodbye Goodbye	I prefer not to even talk about her TANTAROS Isnt that the biggest part of both stories we just covered Bob The unborn babies of the Gosnell story and this girls baby shes still pregnant no one is talking about shes playing game with a human life BECKEL It says a lot about culture too But if I were this woman go ahead and have all the babies you want because you are not going to get a job anywhere PERINO Well wait  TANTAROS I dont want to encourage her to have a lot of babies though I just want her to go away BECKEL Go away OK fine TANTAROS All right Ahead liberal rise ph on campus now extends beyond the classroom all the way to the graduation ceremonies Greg has a list of this years commencement speakers and their politics up next COMMERCIAL BREAK GUTFELD Twice as many Democrats as Republicans will be giving commencement addresses this year In other news Im short and Chris Matthews is crazy Included in this blowhard batch half of the presidents cabinet which is good news It means they wont be working Al Gore will also be scaring kids with his puky panic as Bill Clinton charms the gowns off co eds in Abu Dhabi This is no surprise given the intolerant nature of the modern campus	We should be grateful if any righty makes it in The science is settled	Liberal bastions of uniform thought seek likeminded lecturers to avoid challenging their assumptions To them inviting a righty to speak on campus is like inviting a piranha to a pool party Writer Charles Murray says he was supposed to speak at Azusa Pacific U but was postponed because they worried about quote hurting our faculty and students of color Ill take his word for it especially after watching the weasels at Brandeis rescind a degree from womens rights activist Hirsi Ali because some students could not bear her words Think about how racist this is You cancel a speaker because you think nonwhites cant handle a diversity of opinion Thats a conclusion more insulting than anything from an oldschool bigot I mean racists usually operated out of fear of their adversary but here the faculty just thinks students are too delicate for debate Id rather be feared So Dana you spoke once right PERINO At a commencement speech GUTFELD Thats right PERINO I was scarred by it GUTFELD Yes What happened PERINO It was my alma matter University of Southern Colorado and at the time the university president who is now lieutenant governor of Colorado I thought we had a pretty nice chitchat beforehand but when he introduced me in front of the crowd he said And now despite her party affiliations Im very proud to introduce Dana Perino as a speaker GUTFELD Yes TANTAROS Come on PERINO It was horrible I just felt this chill go through me And then I just decided its not worth it GUTFELD Yes PERINO Just to go Students dont listen to you anyway GUTFELD Yes they dont Well thats true Most of these commencement speeches are just bland awful boring except when you did one BECKEL Ive done a number of them It would be bland and boring I was trying to think of a Republican except for Rice and maybe a couple of others ones who would be fun to listen to But listen these are  these kids are by nature liberal GUTFELD Right BECKEL And you go back through this the whole world they all  they should listen to  I mean what are you going to do Youre going to put somebody like Rand Paul in front of them GUTFELD Rand Paul would be great PERINO He would probably be huge In the crowd BECKEL Im trying to think of anybody who Id like to hear speak in the Republican Party GUTFELD But thats the point though Andrea Is that why are they scared of diversity Why not upset a few students Is it because the faculty is afraid of the students coming after them Is that what its about TANTAROS Well I think its ideology Its probably that Its  so you  we always suspected that when it came time to pick the commencement speaker they just made a list of liberals and wouldnt look at Republicans What I think is most horrifying this year for some reason is theyre actually inviting the Republican and then rescinding the invitation after the students get upset and it becomes public which is far worse than that Also when I think of a commencement speech its not a political pep rally GUTFELD Yes TANTAROS  in any way Its not supposed to be about ideology	Even if you listen to some of the most liberal of the commencement speakers they dont get into politics They get into success GUTFELD Right TANTAROS And seeking your dreams and stuff I dont know why it matters BECKEL You want to listen to Mitch McConnell give a speech TANTAROS You know someone Ben Carter hes someone I would love to listen to GUTFELD Or Ben Carson TANTAROS Carson right GUTFELD But thats a good point though Eric is that why  shouldnt it be champions of private enterprise People that have been successful in business Why does it always have to be a politician BOLLING Thats a good point I would rather hear someone this is how I did it I think thats what these kids really need This is actually perfect Half of the Obama cabinet is going so speak at commencement speeches this year But its perfect you know Theyre going to go through heres how you redistribute your wealth when you get there Heres how you cover your ass when you get caught with stuff like Oh you can keep your doctor or Benghazi or IRS These kids are being taught  or told what to do prepping them for the liberal wilderness that theyre about to enter BECKEL Theres not a single administration that doesnt allow their cabinet to speak during graduations BOLLING OK Im not going to disagree Visavis the purpose of the liberal world PERINO The other thing is though that Charles Murray who you talked about he actually has just written a book about succeeding in life GUTFELD Perfect for it PERINO He actually has substance about what hes talking about But who cares about that GUTFELD Who cares Exactly Dana All right I thought shed never stop The No 1 thing thats holding most people back from success at work	Dana actually has the answer if you can believe that It could help you get that promotion youve always wanted coming up BOLLING Despite her party affiliation COMMERCIAL BREAK PERINO OK Do you work hard but cant seem to get ahead Maybe you need more flair like this waitress in the classic movie Office Space BEGIN VIDEO CLIP UNIDENTIFIED MALE Joanna people can get a cheeseburger anywhere	OK They come to Chotchkies for the atmosphere and the attitude OK thats what flairs about Its about fun JENNIFER ANISTON ACTRESS OK so more then UNIDENTIFIED MALE Look we want you to express yourself OK Now if you feel that the bare minimum is enough OK but some people choose to wear more and we encourage that END VIDEO CLIP PERINO So a good attitude is actually the No 1 thing holding most people back from success according to research One Stanford professor writes performance is only loosely tied to who gets ahead at work Those able to create a favorable impression actually got higher ratings on their reviews That might not be that surprising So Bob I want to ask you when you were in a position to hire lots of people when you had your polling business in Washington DC what did you look for in a candidate honestly BECKEL No that didnt decide that but that was a part of it I set aside a quota on that But no it was people  If people didnt look me in the eye forget about it If they didnt have a sense of humor forget about it If they werent personable we could  we were in the business of out there selling stuff and so you know you could give me a guy from Harvard who was just a boring dork or give me some kid from the University of Maryland who was engaging and could play golf and liked women PERINO What about you GUTFELD I was going to ask if it didnt work out did he still pay for the hour PERINO I meant to do the job of polling Do you want to go next	Do you have anything to add GUTFELD What Yes oh I was as you know PERINO Have a good attitude Me Yes I was very positive I ran three magazines There were some things that I  that a positive attitude is key A boss doesnt like to be around somebody who is a chatty weirdo or a complainer and has weird habits Most important thing too is so what	Youve got to show up If youre going to go out and drink youve got to show up the next day You cant  if you cant handle your hangovers then you shouldnt be drinking That always used to drive me crazy at magazines And you have to overcome your fear of failure I think thats bigger than an attitude is be willing to fail I got fired from three jobs because I didnt care PERINO Because you were willing to take a risk GUTFELD Exactly PERINO And also play a practical joke that was highly inappropriate according to your bosses GUTFELD Yes PERINO All right Eric would you  can you teach somebody to do what you did as long as they had a good attitude BOLLING You know my talking point was exactly that Dana Before you get to the point where youre wondering if you need a mentor its nice to parents Tough love Study with your kids Study with them for tests	Help them do projects When they start to tell you No I dont need your help any morel say Yes you do and you stay with it And then they start to learn to motivate themselves and problem solve on their own And one last piece of advice that my mom built ph Last two words out of her mouth to me whispered in my ear Never quit And I still to this day believe that If you dont quit youll get what you want PERINO Nice thing to hear from your mom Andrea lots of people ask you for advice and call you all the time	How can I get ahead Why wont I get into the  how do I do this What do you recommend Whats your No 1 piece of advice TANTAROS Attitude definitely Also you have to be able to do really crappy stuff for a long period of time You have to not have the attitude that something is beneath And when someone asks you to do something dont go back and say I cant do it Or Im encountering problems or Im just not sure When my dad would tell me to go do something I had to figure out how to do it He just wanted it done I love the employee that comes back and says Did it done whats my next task Also just work hard It really takes a lot of hard work and the doors arent going to magically open You may need to kick some down You may need to jack open a window and jump through it But persistence PERINO One of my favorites is anticipate your bosss needs And what my boss needs right now is for me to tease for the next segment They went to pricey prep schools They probably could have chosen any career they wanted Why did these young men allegedly end up as the leaders of a suburban schools drug ring Bob has got the details on that one next COMMERCIAL BREAK BECKEL Their parents sent them to 35000ayear prep schools likely with the hopes they would go to a good college and get a good job	But 25yearold Neil Scott and 19yearold Timothy Brooks ended up in jail this week Theyre accused of a running a massive drug ring in the wealthy suburbs of Philadelphia and allegedly enlisted local students as dealers and customers Heres the DA on the case BEGIN VIDEO CLIP RISA VETRI FERMAN PENNSYLVANIA DISTRICT ATTORNEY This was not a game These people were in business They were in business to make money and they were going to do whatever they need to do to make sure that no one threatened their business To take those skills and turn it into this kind of an illegal enterprise is very distressing END VIDEO CLIP BECKEL You know whats amazing to me Is how many people particularly parents in the suburbs dont get it Drugs are out there	There are a lot of them And interestingly enough it is white kids who end up being most of couriers these days running the cocaine from Florida on up Why Because theyre not black guys who are going to be stopped on the highway There are more white kids who come from wealthy

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/07/02/most-companies-not-likely-to-stop-paying-for-all-birth-control-after-supreme/,NEW YORK  Dont expect a massive wave of companies to stop paying for employees contraceptives after this weeks Supreme Court decision allowing some businesses to refuse to cover birth control Some business owners say they wont pay for any forms of contraception Others say theyll continue paying for most types but not those that take effect after conception and that some people believe are akin to abortion     But while the ruling applies to many of the countrys businesses in reality relatively few workers are likely to lose all contraceptive coverage Many companies of all sizes paid for contraception by choice even before the Affordable Care Act required it believing its an important benefit that helps them attract and retain good workers A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found 85 percent of large employers already paid for contraceptives before the health care law required it Even employers who want to opt out of some forms of birthcontrol coverage see covering others as important We want to provide for good health care for our people We just dont want to fund abortive procedures said Mike Sharrow owner of C12 Group in San Antonio His company which provides faithbased counseling for business owners has always paid for what he calls traditional forms of contraception such as birthcontrol pills The Supreme Court ruled Monday that some businesses can because of their religious beliefs choose not to comply with the health care laws requirement that contraception coverage be provided to workers at no extra charge The 54 ruling has the Obama administration looking for another way to provide contraception for women who work for those companies The ruling applies to businesses that are closely held with five or fewer individuals owning more than 50 percent of the companys stock By some estimates 90 percent of businesses are closely held and employ about half the nations work force Business owners interviewed by The Associated Press that wanted to opt out of contraceptive coverage said their insurers were still trying to figure out how to change their policies Its possible employees might still be able to get birthcontrol coverage through their plans but pay for that portion of their insurance themselves The contraceptives at issue in Mondays decision are two known as morningafter pills the emergency contraceptives Plan B and ella and two intrauterine devices which are implantable devices inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy Many owners objected to them because theyre designed to work after conception occurs However on Tuesday the court left in place lower court rulings in other cases that allowed businesses to refuse to pay for all methods of governmentapproved contraception The case decided by the Supreme Court on Monday involved two companies Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp About 50 others also filed suit against the health care laws contraception requirement Some received court injunctions allowing them not to pay for birth control the Supreme Courts ruling is expected to allow them to continue that policy Triune Health Group Ltd has already been in touch with its broker to see how soon it can change its coverage to stop paying for all contraceptives said Mary Anne Yep coowner of the Oak Brook Illinois company that provides medical management services We were ready to go when we heard the decision she said Triune had filed lawsuits against the US government and the state of Illinois because of requirements that they pay for contraception Weingartz Inc which has five stores in Michigan selling lawn mowers and other outdoor equipment stopped paying for all contraception except when medically needed since it won an injunction We dont believe anybody else shouldnt have access to it We just cant pay for it said Dan Weingartz the companys president But Joe Holland Chevrolet in South Charleston West Virginia and Hastings Automotive Inc in Hastings Minnesota opposed postconception forms of birth control only said Matt Bowman an attorney representing both auto dealerships Our clients have no problems with things that are truly contraceptive Bowman said Christian publisher Tyndale House Publishers Inc which also filed a lawsuit expects the Supreme Court ruling to clear the way for it to stop paying for morningafter pills and IUDs We believe that those family businesses should have the religious freedom not to offer abortioncausing items through their employee healthcare program Tyndale CEO Mark Taylor said in a statement The Carol Stream Illinois company publishes Christian books The businesses contacted by The Associated Press all said their greatest concern was the government forcing them to pay for something that goes against their religious beliefs Framing this as an issue of contraception is wrong Its a battle against bullying by the government telling us what to do said Yep the Triune Health Group owner,2014-07-02T14:27-04:00,abortion

step this week of making his first television ad of the cycle a social issue attack A new Quinnipiac University poll tells us why The race previously considered a safe Democratic retention is now dead head Udall who led all challengers in February is in a statistical tie with Republican Rep Cory Gardner When asked whether Udall should be reelected 46 percent of respondents said no and 40 percent said yes That number was tied at 42 percent two months ago Udalls early move to launch a scary spot about abortion reflects a candidate concerned about his political base Udall leads among women 52 percent to Gardners 35 percent while Gardner leads among men 53 to 38 Udall has consistently low favorability with Colorado voters while most voters havent made up their minds about Gardner Launching this attack now will surely drive up Gardners negatives among prochoice voters but wont do anything to help Udall enhance his own droopy digits About ObamaCare  Whatever they know or dont know about the candidates in the race voters seem to have formed clear attitudes about the contestants positions Fiftyseven percent of respondents said they were opposed ObamaCare including 62 percent of independent voters Voters supported Gardners health care policies over Udalls 57 percent to 36 percent They preferred Gardners stance on the economy 53 percent to 40 percent for Udall KDVR reports

Udall is helping Steyer kill the Keystone Pipelineeven though Coloradans strongly support it and that its a cold slap in the face of American workers No Democrat finds himself in a trickier position than Udall when it comes to the stalled Keystone Pipeline project Unlike redstate Democrats who can symbolically bash the presidents delay of the project with little fear of angering homestate constituencies Udall has to keep Denver and Boulder liberals on board But the project seems to be overwhelmingly popular among more moderate voters in the energyrich state Udall has not taken a public stance on the project Its understandable Liberal groups are beginning to punish Democrats who do not toe the line on opposing the pipeline and Steyer stands ready to jump in against those who do not

were to seize a cluster of islands in the South China Sea But speaking at a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Obama spoke dismissively of the longstanding territorial dispute that has intensified in recent weeks My hope is that China will continue to engage with us and other countries in the region  where we do not take a position on the particular sovereignty of this

Americans have given their lives in Afghanistan since the beginning of the war in 2001 There is now a growing chorus of Republicans and Democrats who say that if the US is going to draw down to fewer

Napolitano considers a courts ruling that the Obama Administration must reveal its secret legal rationale for killing Americans believed to be part of overseas militant groups Welcome to the strange new world of Barack Obamas War on Terror in which there are no declarations of war against countries that foment or harbor enemy activities as the Constitution authorizes and in which the president claims the powers of a king by killing whomever he wishes under a rationale that his lawyers wrote for him and that he has desperately tried to keep secret The Obama administration is probably right to fear the revelation of this socalled legal way to kill The appellate court decision is a profound and sweeping rejection of the Obama administrations passion for hiding behind a veil of secrecy

HILLARY WOMEN HAVE TO SUPPORT OTHER WOMEN Boston Globe Hillary Rodham Clinton urged hundreds of women business executives in Boston to dare to compete in a speech Wednesday that was part pep talk and part political call to action The speech in Boston was closely watched because it was on the home turf of Senator Elizabeth Warren DNH a fellow Democrat who many on the left hope will run for president in 2016 despite her repeated declarations that she will not do so Clinton made one reference to Warren when she noted that only 20 percent of US Senate seats are held by women She said Your great senator Elizabeth Warren    has joined the women of the Senate and added Women have to support other women Hillary hints at red line for Ukraine  AP Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she believes the outcome of the standoff in Ukraine will be a bad one for Russia Speaking at a University of Connecticut issues forum the former first lady US senator and secretary of state said she believes the sanctions against the Russian government must be tightened and widened to prevent the crisis from escalating I think Russia will pay a big price for this Clinton said But that is an endpoint that weve got to get to as peacefully as possible without seeing the total disintegration of Ukraine as a country with territorial integrity and opportunity to have the relationship it wants with the West

proof of climate change are ignorant Paul was speaking Tuesday with former senior President Obama adviser David Axelrod at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics He said evidence of manmade climate change being a problem remains inconclusive and that many activists are alarmist They all predicted the poor Statue of Liberty was going to drown within a hundred years and the polar bears and all this stuff Paul said That alarmist stuff I think really detracts from the case that we shouldnt pollute Axelrod then asked Paul about the New York City subway system moving to insulate its system after superstorm Sandy What I would say is that someone is an ignoramus who would say that Oh we had three hurricanes this year This proves that somehow the climate is warming Paul said Sen Rand Paul

If you didnt know better youd think that President Obama was actually trying to hurt redstate Democrats First he contradicted the candidates in a dozen Senate races from Alaska to Georgia who claimed his policies werent on the ballot Make no mistake the president said at a campaign stop on Oct 2 his policies are on the ballot Every single one of them The message A vote for a Democrat is a vote for his agenda Pretty bad when the presidents policies are consistently unpopular right And viewers are already hearing the line repeated in campaign ads But Democrats were at least still free to disagree with him and highlight their disagreements Back in Chicago on Monday though Obama closed off even that line of retreat

In an interview with Al Sharpton an MSNBC host who is also an adviser to his administration the president defended the Democrats who were disrespecting him on the campaign trail including one who even refused to say that she voted for Obama over Mitt Romney in 2012 Sharpton wondered how Obama felt about hustling to raise big money for candidates who wont even be seen with him The bottom line is though these are all folks who vote with me they have supported my agenda in Congress Obama said So this isnt about my feelings being hurt These are folks who are strong allies and supporters of me I tell them  I said You do what you need to do to win I will be responsible for making sure that our voters turn out Can you imagine a politician saying that If you really did encourage your fellow Democrats to publicly scorn you but privately support you why would you tell

The answer is in the phrase making sure that our voters turn out The president and his party are trying to reprise the 2012 election in 2014 but the atmosphere is wholly different First except in Georgia and a couple of other races Democrats have not yet succeeded in suppressing turnout among Republicans and GOPleaning independents The focus in most of the races remains on Obama policies and especially on the dominant issues of the past several weeks that has been bad news With Republicans mobilized and independents breaking against the majority party a basepumping drive is of marginal value The president evidently concerned that black voters and other parts of his 2012 coalition were sitting out the election in deference to his feelings wanted it known that dissident Democrats had his permission to badmouth him

DEMS NOT TURNING UP TURN OUT
NYT Early voting is underway in Nevada and the numbers look bad for Democrats Republicans and Democrats have voted in nearly equal numbers in Clark County home to Las Vegas where Democrats have a 13point registration advantage Only 10000 voters have turned out compared with 17000 who turned out on the first day of 2010 Nevada isnt alone The early voting numbers a possible indicator of overall turnout also look bad for Democrats in Ohio The big dropoffs highlight that even in 2010 Democrats were mobilizing large numbers of voters who wouldnt have participated in a less competitive contest Or put another way Theres nothing about new Democratic voters in Iowa that proves the Democrats are better at mobilizing voters in the battleground states than they were four years ago

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/10/18/brazil-seeing-conservatives-gain-more-power-in-congress-amid-shaky-economy/,"RIO DE JANEIRO AP  With its Carnival reputation and skinbaring beach life Brazil may look like a liberal bastion But unease over a worsening economy and deteriorating public safety plus a backlash against recent gayrights gains are propelling a conservative rise that will shape the next administration regardless of who wins the presidency The general election held earlier this month saw a greater share of Brazils National Congress seats go to various conservative caucuses which now control nearly 60 percent of the 513 seats in the lower house They include evangelical lawmakers who oppose gay marriage or access to abortion the ruralistas whose proagriculture positions counter environmentalists and indigenous groups and a lawandorder faction that demands a crackdown on crime Ahead of the presidential runoff Oct 26 theres no doubt such conservatives are giving greater support to centerright challenger Acio Neves over leftleaning President Dilma Rousseff But its also clear that neither presidential candidate is as socially conservative as the increasingly powerful elements of Congress Brazil is one of the very few Latin American countries where the parliament is more important than the president in terms of overall power in the decisionmaking process said Thiago de Aragao a political analyst for the Brasiliabased Arko Advice consulting firm The parliament in an armwrestling contest against the presidency would win  because the parliaments main weapon is just crossing their arms and not voting on matters that are of strong interest to the government Despite its anythinggoes appearance Brazil is like many predominantly Roman Catholic nations in Latin America socially conservative In recent opinion polls for example more than 80 percent of Brazilians said they oppose loosening their restrictive abortion laws or legalizing marijuana and just over half oppose gay marriage However since Brazils return to democracy in 1985 the nations presidents and its judiciary have pushed through progressive projects either by decree or rulings  such as protecting huge swaths of jungle as indigenous reserves a highcourt ruling permitting samesex civil unions and the creation of Bolsa Familia a program that gives monthly cash payments to Brazils poorest families Some predict such changes could be rolled back by the growing conservative forces The evangelical caucus votes in lockstep on hotbutton social issues and is willing to block projects put forth by the presidency because its members know they represent a growing segment of the electorate While Catholics remain the majority in Brazil since 1970 their portion of the population has fallen from more than 90 percent to 65 percent while those identifying as Protestants have grown from 5 percent to 22 percent according to the Pew Research Center In Rousseffs first term the evangelical caucus blocked her effort to promote gaytolerance teaching in schools and managed to have their most outspoken antigay legislator Deputy Marco Feliciano named head of the bodys human rights commission  a move that provoked condemnation from Amnesty International and other activist groups In the Oct 5 election Feliciano was reelected to his So Paulo district with nearly double the votes he won four years ago The ruralista caucus also grew and now has about 200 members who support its agenda These lawmakers showed their strength in 2012 forcing weakening of environmental protection laws which critics say contributed to a 29 percent jump in the number of Amazon acres deforested over the last year And while the lawandorder block is small with only about 20 members it wields influence on security issues The caucus members defend tougher penal codes for young offenders and want to block the sort of drug liberalization seen in neighboring countries even as Brazil copes with overcrowded prisons and years of failed efforts to suppress powerful drug gangs But its the evangelical lawmakers who are at the heart of Brazils growing conservatism and theyve shown an ability to rally the other groups behind their main cause defeating any attempt to legalize gay marriage or advance protections for LGBT communities Toni Reis who heads the gay rights advocacy group Dignidade noted it took a landmark Supreme Court decision to legalize samesex civil unions in 2011 following years of congressional stalling on the matter Now he said gay rights groups are focused not on gay marriage but on advancing legislation to criminalize discrimination against gays Given the new legislative reality Reis acknowledged it will be an uphill battle Were going to have to work twice as hard he said Jean Wyllys Brazils first openly gay congressman said progressive lawmakers wont give up Theres no doubt its going to be more difficult said Wyllys who represents Rio de Janeiro state But I also have my allies  We are a political force capable of blocking their the evangelicals legislative projects But Brazils most influential evangelical pastor Silas Malafaia who campaigned for several Pentecostal politicians says the conservatives dont intend to impose stances out of step with the electorate I am against gay marriage Lets hold a referendum and let society decide Malafaia said in an interview If the people decide that they want abortions to be legalized I will always be against it but I will respect those decisions Were not evangelical extremists trying to impose what we think with an iron fist Follow us on twittercomfoxnewslatino

Furthermore Congress failure to work together to actually reach a consensus around immigration  both in terms of the immediate reality of unaccompanied minors and the larger challenge of our antiquated immigration system  has given the President the impetus to take executive action to resolve our immigration challenges which he says he will do in the coming weeks It is because of my commitment to religious freedom and to defending unborn life that I feel a profound ambivalence about the Presidents pending action on immigration  On the one hand executive action on immigration could relieve the suffering within immigrant communities that I and other pastors witness firsthand There is scarcely a Latino pastor who does not have stories of hardworking otherwiselawabiding members of their congregation who were picked up on a traffic violation or some other minor offense then detained and ultimately deported often separating them from their spouse and children Marriages suffer Children suffer In 2013 alone about 200 parents of US citizen children were deported each day So if the President announces bold executive action  such as a dramatic expansion of the Deferred Action program to parents of US citizen children without criminal issues  I will applaud even though it will at best be temporary relief not the longterm legislative solution that the House of Representatives has failed to offer But I also fear that such bold executive action could in an indirect way significantly set back other causes of critical concern to me and other conservative Christians Heres why our nations policies on abortion and religious liberty have largely been determined by the courts rather than by Congress From the Hobby Lobby case in June to Roe v Wade four decades ago these questions are being decided by judges appointed by the President If the President expands the Deferred Action program allowing a significant number of presently undocumented individuals to gain work authorization a GOP presidential candidate will be boxed in The pressure on Republican lawmakers to vote to end DACA a few weeks ago foretells that in order to win the GOP primary a presidential candidate will likely be pushed to announce he or she would kill the program effectively opening millions to the risk of deportation and forcing employers to fire their onceauthorized employees Come November 2016 Latino voters including Latino evangelicals whose conservative values generally resonate with the Republican Party will likely vote overwhelmingly for the Democratic candidate This will be history reliving itself two years ago when President Obama first enacted DACA Governor Romney stated publicly that if elected he would end itand millions of Latinos including a majority of Latino evangelicals stood in line to vote against him Many had in mind the face of a friend relative or fellow church member whose livelihood was on the line with the decision either to continue or terminate the program Governor Romney ended up with a paltry 27 percent of the Latino vote How Hispanics vote in 2016 could decide the next President as welland the appointments that he or she makes could determine for decades to come if our country will defend religious liberty and protect unborn life The best chance the GOP has to put this issue behind them is for Speaker Boehner to move now on immigration reform because it will only become much more difficult after the President acts unilaterally If Republicans act theyll earn the gratitude of the Latino evangelical community who already share their values on key social issues but most of whom cannot stomach the idea of voting for a party that has blocked immigration reform To be clear there are a plethora of economic national security and moral reasons that the House should act on immigration reform But if those reasons are not enough passing reform is also politically vital for defenders of life and religious liberty House Republicans who refuse to constructively take up the issue  and who participate in show votes that alienate Latino voters  are throwing social conservatives under the bus Rev Samuel Rodriguez is president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference Follow us on twittercomfoxnewslatino

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/lifestyle/2014/08/16/pope-francis-beatifies-124-korean-martyrs-hails-them-as-models-for-church/,"SEOUL South Korea AP  Pope Francis beatified 124 Korean martyrs on Saturday telling hundreds of thousands of people who turned out for his openair Mass that their ancestors willingness to die rather than renounce their faith two centuries ago was a model for Asian missionaries today The streets leading up to Seouls iconic Gwanghwamun Gate were packed with Koreans honoring the lay Catholics who founded the church here in the 18th century Koreas church is unique in that it was founded not by foreign missionary priests  as occurred in most of the world  but by members of Koreas own noble classes who learned of Christianity by reading books about it These early Catholics were killed in the 18th and 19th centuries by the Joseon Dynasty which tried to shut the Korean Peninsula off from Western influence Police in Seoul declined to give an estimate of the crowd size but the Vatican said about 800000 people had turned out The number was significant given that Catholics represent only about 10 percent of South Koreas 50 million people The Mass kicked off a busy day for Francis as he passed the halfway mark of his fiveday South Korea visit In the afternoon he traveled to a religious community that cares for severely disabled Koreans and prayed briefly at a monument to aborted babies  a strong albeit silent gesture from a pope who prefers to stress other aspects of church teaching rather than emphasize hotbutton culture war issues like abortion The Mass in Seoul though was one of the highlights of his trip providing Francis with an opportunity to stress how the lessons of Koreas early martyrs were relevant today for Koreas church which is small but growing and is seen as a model for the rest of the world They were willing to make great sacrifices and let themselves be stripped of whatever kept them from Christ  possessions and land prestige and honor  for they knew that Christ alone was their true treasure he said They challenge us to think about what if anything we ourselves would be willing to die for Francis praised in particular the fact that laypeople were so crucial to the churchs foundation and growth in Korea  a theme he stressed later in the day when he met with leaders of Korean lay movements The church is counting on such laymen and laywomen to spread the faith in Asia which the Vatican considers the future of the church The main reason for Francis visit to South Korea in fact was to attend an Asian Catholic youth festival the church sees such rallies as a crucial way of inspiring the next generation of Catholics to evangelize Today as ever the church needs credible lay witnesses to the saving truth of the Gospel Francis said stressing in particular the need for their outreach to focus on the poor and most marginalized A collective cheer erupted from the masses when Francis declared the 124 blessed  the first step toward possible sainthood Many of the women in the crowd wore lace veils others sported paper sun visors with Papa Francesco written across them protecting them from the overcast hazy skies The scene was impressive with thousands of people neatly packed into fencedin sections leading away from the altar which was set up in front of Gwanghwamun the south gate to Gyeongbokgung palace with mountains looming above and the presidential Blue House on the lower slope Police in green vests stood guard along the barricades and volunteers handed out water to guard against the warm humid temperatures Im so thankful that the pope visited South Korea said 75yearold Yu Pilsang a Catholic who was trying to get a glimpse of Francis just outside the police barricades But Im so sorry that all the ways to see the pope are blocked I came to hear at least his voice En route to the altar before Mass Francis stopped his opentopped car so he could get out and bless a group of families who lost loved ones in the sinking of the Sewol ferry in April in which more than 300 people most of them high school students were killed On his white cassock Francis wore a yellow ribbon given to him by the families a day earlier when he met with them privately to try to console them We want the truth read a yellow banner a reference to the families demands for an independent inquiry into the sinking Officials said 400 families had been invited to the Mass The main figure in the group that was beatified is Paul Yun JiChung who was born in 1759 and was among the earliest Catholics on the peninsula He was beheaded in 1791  the first Korean martyr  after he violated the traditional Confucian funeral rites for his mother In all the Joseon Dynasty killed about 10000 Catholics for refusing to renounce their faith Historians say Koreas early believers were struck by the idea of a religion that preached universal equality in divine eyes at a time when the nobilitys discriminatory hierarchical system brutally exploited ordinary people St John Paul II canonized another 103 martyrs during a visit to South Korea in 1984 Francis began his day by praying at a monument in Seoul commemorating the martyrs on the site where many of them were killed Even nonCatholics turned out for the Mass impressed by Francis humble gestures and call for South Koreans to pay more attention to the poor than their own material gain I do not know much about Catholics and South Koreas Catholic history but it seems that the pope is making sure to reach out equally to everyone said Eom Yaesung 49 a Protestant who said Francis had inspired her to make changes in her own life I plan to do volunteering and a lot of sharing so that when I look back at my life 10 years from now I will think that the popes visit motivated me to change Eom said Follow us on twittercomfoxnewslatino

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/07/08/bill-oreilly-two-dangerous-situations-remain-unresolved/, By Bill OReilly Almost everywhere I went this Fourth of July weekend people stopped me asking why the country is in such a mess No question the folks are concerned some of them very angry     In Iraq this man the terrorist thug al Baghdadi openly threatening America Jordan another country saying that his ISIS army will attack Incredibly Baghdadi was in US custody but the Defense Department let him go during the Bush administration Now he heads up perhaps the most powerful terrorist organization in the world Another big screw up in the war on terror As you may know the ISIS army is an off shoot of al Qaeda now occupying thousand square miles in Iraq and Syria Its wellarmed well funded wants to kill Americans Yet President Obama has done very little to constrain ISI In fact it looks like the President doesnt know what to do Certainly Baghdadi does not fear the USA A brutal situation thats about to get much worse But even more upsetting to some Americans is the chaos on the southern border Over the weekend a border patrol agent Hector Garza openly criticized the Obama administration BEGIN AUDIO CLIP  GARZA We have a situation right now where our federal government is pretty much aiding and abetting and facilitating the smuggling of these individuals of illegal aliens These illegal aliens cross our borders illegally We have to hand these illegal aliens that pretty much surrender themselves because they know that they are getting a free pass This is an organized its an orchestrated situation Its orchestrated by the drug cartels and its pretty much a rampant abuse of our immigration system END AUDIO CLIP  OREILLY Now Mr Garza is a spokesperson for the National Border Patrol Council for the Laredo Texas sector And his opinion is echoed by many federal agents we have spoken with On the state level Texas Governor Rick Perry  equally blunt BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  PERRY What has to be addressed is the security of the border You know that I know that The President of the United States knows that I dont believe he particularly cares whether or not the border of the United States is secure President Obama is traveling to Texas this week but is not going to the border That strikes talking points as very strange Ed Henry will have a report in just a few moments The President has made a few statements about the border melt down but not many perhaps because the stats are so grim In this fiscal year about 300000 undocumented aliens are expected to be apprehended by the border patrol That includes more than 50000 children an average of 200 kids per day Thats a 99 percent increase for fiscal year 2013 It does not even account for those illegals who elude the border patrol So far on President Obamas watch more than two million illegal aliens have been apprehended by federal authorities About half were deported until this year when deportation slowed down That has led to bitterness on the part of some Americans directly impacted by illegal immigration In just a few moments we will talk with the mayor of Murrieta California a town in the eye of the storm On Long Island where I live houses are being rented to Hispanic men  dozens of them dozens living in a single house wreaking havoc on the entire neighborhood And all over the USA social problems are arising because of the influx of migrants Again the Obama administration seems unprepared to deal with the problem Late today the AP reported there is no plan to send immigrant children back to their countries yet No plan Last week ABC News reported the situation this way BEGIN VIDEO CLIP UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE Melissa here brought her fiveyearold son on the journey Starting in Honduras then eight days on a bus through Mexico across the Rio Grande by raft to McAllen Texas four nights in a border patrol processing center and then by bus to Maryland All with just one promise show up in court today at 1000 in the morning in Baltimore ABC News was there She was not She wasnt at the Maryland address she gave either Border Patrol sources say fewer than 20 percent ever show up as promised END VIDEO CLIP  OREILLY Thats a disaster and every fairminded person knows it But we are living in a time of intense ideology which sometimes fogs up dangerous situations Some on the left believe that the USA should accept all socalled refugees all of them And if you oppose that philosophy you are inhumane uncaring unchristian and so on The demonization of opposition has been effective for the left spurred on by a sympathetic media For example Americans who believe that companies should not pay for abortion inducing medications are practicing gender bigotry If you believe people on welfare should be drug tested you are antipoor If you believe an ID should be shown at the voting booth like they do in Canada you are antipoor If you believe traditional marriage should have a special place in society you are a homophobe And in some cases if you criticize President Obamas policies you are a racial bigot Thats why there is so much anger in America The issues have become very personal No longer are opposing points of view respected and the left is driving this terrible train although although I have to say pictures of antiillegal immigration protesters spitting at people were disgusting There is a lunatic fringe on the right as well and it greatly harms the debate for effective immigration policy The truth is that President Obama has lost control of the process America is now being threatened by terrorists once again And the terrorists believe they are winning The southern border is a sieve Mexico is facilitating hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens coming into this country Whats the administration doing to Mexico Nothing Finally in a perfect world all oppressed people would be given an opportunity to have a better life America is a place of opportunity We should take a sane number of immigrants every year into our system But to have millions of mostly poor people pour into this country without the resources to care for them to educate them to relocate them is simply anarchy The Obama administration said for years the border was secure That was the backbone of the proposed immigration reform law But its not true and never has been true The public was sold a lie If Americans dont wake up and soon and demand a better performance from their elected officials on all levels this country will continue to decline Right now the President should degrade the ISIS army by using American air power and should move the National Guard to the southern border to stop the madness down there After that then Congress should try to solve these awful problems in totality And thats The Memo OReilly Factor hosted by Bill OReilly airs on Weekdays at 8PM ET on Fox News Channel,2014-07-07T00:00-04:00,abortion
Fox,http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2014/04/14/scammers-want-your-medical-recordshere-why/,Turns out its not just your personal financial information scammers and thieves are aftertheyre also looking for ways to get their hands on your private medical records There are new and expanded threats to the security and privacy of patient information in the US healthcare system according to the Fourth Annual Benchmark Study on Patient Privacy and Data Security by the Ponemon Institute In the past four years the number of criminal attacks on health providers has doubled with 90 of the hospitals and large regional health networks that participated in the study reporting at least one data breach Thirtyeight percent have had five or more A data breach involves the loss or theft of a patients information and includes such things as health records insurance information blood type and medications Your medical file might also include personal financial information if for instance you used your credit card to cover your copay It might come as a surprise to learn that medical data are actually worth more to cyber thieves than financial records On the black market health information is more valuable than credit or debit card information according to Larry Ponemon chairman of the Ponemon Institute Thats because it includes a lot more than just details about your medical condition For instance by knowing your weight height eye color and other physical characteristics bad guys like Al Qaeda can create fake identities Theres No Taking It Back If a thief steals your financial information you have to go through the hassle of closing credit cards changing passwords on bank accounts notifying lenders and the three major credit bureaus etc Granted its a pain in the neck but once you open new accounts your financial data is again private However if your medical identity is stolen you dont have the opportunity for a clean start If it leaks out its out forever says Ponemon If theres a negative stigma associated with your health data you cant undo it Imagine the potential consequences if your medical records indicate you were once treated for a sexuallytransmitted disease or had an abortion or underwent a sex change or have a slowgrowing cancer or a body mass index BMI that indicates you are excessively obese Even worse the consequences of having your medical information fall into the hands of unscrupulous individuals can literally be life threatening In addition to the financial impact there can be a medical impact says Lisa Schifferle an attorney in the Federal Trade Commissions Division of Privacy and Identity Theft Protection When a thief uses your identity to get medical care the imposters information could end up on your medical record If you are in an accident and rushed to the emergency room doctors retrieving your electronic record could see the wrong blood type or not know that you are allergic to certain medications or that you have a preexisting condition This could lead to misdiagnosis or mistreatment with potentially deadly consequences Diagnosing the Problem Unfortunately the very organizations and individuals we turn to when we are sickhospitals doctors nurses and medical personnelare making the situation worse Often its simple negligence The receptionist leaves your file on the desk when she goes home at the end of the dayin plain sight of the office cleaning crew Or patient records are simply thrown in the trash instead of being shredded A growing issue is that doctors nurses and other medical personnel are now communicating with patients and accessing medical records using their own personal devices cell phones home computers and tablets These dont have the level of security needed to protect patient information Another factor is that hospitals are reluctant to spend money on the personnel or technology needed to stay ahead of potential threats because they feel it would be better spent on things that could directly improve patient care like a new MRI machine updated operating room equipment or increasing staff according to Ponemon Medical providers dont consider privacy and security a high priority Theyre not using stateoftheart technology A lot of these organizations really dont have professional IT staff like other industries have They dont feel theyre a target of cyber crime And theyre wrong Unintended Consequences The Ponemon study found that the Affordable Care Act ACA has also made Americans more susceptible to medical identity theft citing the documented insecure websites databases and health information exchanges that are highly vulnerable to insider and outside threats Health information exchanges HIEs which are at the forefront of the trend toward creating a national digital database of patient information are making us much more vulnerable According to Healthitgov HIEs make it possible for doctors nurses pharmacists other health care providers and patients to appropriately access and securely share a patients vital medical information electronically This is supposed to result in faster and more accurate treatment and lower healthcare costs But HIEs contain the medical records of hundreds of millions of individuals if identity thieves manage to break in it will make the Target TGT hackers seem like amateurs The scary part is that it would not be especially difficult to obtain the records the data on these systems is only as secure as the weakest link All an identity thief has to do is find one vulnerabilitya hospital with a bad firewall or a doctors office with outdated security softwareand this could open up hundreds of thousands of records Uncle Sam Wants Your Medical Data In addition HIEs send patient data to the federal government In theory the purpose is to supply information on such things as the number and types of surgeries performed the rate of infection complications how many patients died and the costs involved so that the government can do economic modeling But this information doesnt just land in the hands of statisticians at the Department of Health and Human Services Other government agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service which is charged with enforcing participation in the Affordable Care Act also have access to it In Ponemons words Your information may not be very secure when it is kept at a local hospital or medical network but once it is shared with the federal government its totally out of your control Health care is a scarce and expensive resource and Ponemon suggests that at some point we as a society will have to make choices about whos going to get treatment You cant help but think that older less productive individuals wont get it To help stay ahead of the scammers and protect your information experts offer the following steps  1Inquire about what specific steps the hospitaldoctors office takes to safeguard your medical and financial information After his own mother was a victim of medical identity theft in a nursing home this was one of the first questions Ponemon asked when looking for a new facility for her 2 Ask who on staff is in charge of maintaining the privacy of patient records Hint If a provider doesnt know or dont have such a person consider other options 3 Dont automatically provide your Social Security number when filling out a medical or new patient form Theres no legal reason a doctor needs this according to Ponemon If they insist compromise by giving just the last four numbers 4 If you are on Medicare dont carry your Social Security or Medicare card with you For some reason the Department of Health and Human Services doesnt get it Despite the danger they insist on using your Social Security number on your Medicare card Theres no question they are putting us in harms way providing the bad guys with rich information because theyre not smart enough to come up with an alternative says Ponemon 5 Visit the Federal Trade Commission for more about protecting yourself from medical identity theft and what to do if you feel youve been victimized  Ms Buckner is a Retirement and Financial Planning Specialist and an
