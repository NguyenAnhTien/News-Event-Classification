MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/rand-paul-cory-booker-reform-the-war-drugs, Condemning a war on drugs they call excessive  counterproductive and discriminatory  Sens  Rand Paul  R Kentucky  and Cory Booker  D New Jersey  are pushing a new bipartisan bill to reform criminal background checks and the juvenile justice system  The senators say their bill   the REDEEM Act   will cut the cost and stigma of non violent drug offenses by limiting how long criminal records stick to ex convicts  Under current law  ex convicts must answer employer questions about past convictions  That rule has major effects on the labor marker   even for low level offenses  a criminal record makes many job applicants far less employable  Studies show the impact increases unemployment and disproportionately hinders poor and minority communities  The senators  legislation aims to counter that trend by offering some non violent offenders a second chance  It would seal criminal records for teenage offenders  while adults could apply to have their records expunged  Judges would review those applications  under the proposal  by balancing an offender s interest in  employment  against the public s interest in  knowledge and safety  And when ex offenders win  they would get something pretty rare under federal law   a do over   The problem really of the war on drugs is taking a lot of people who make youthful mistakes and it s punishing them for a lifetime  Sen  Rand Paul on  The Cycle  The bill says that when a crime is expunged  it will simply  be treated as if it never occurred  Paul  who has backed several measures to limit punishment for non violent offenses  says that approach is crucial if the U S  wants to truly rehabilitate offenders and break the cycle of recidivism   The biggest impediment to civil rights and employment in our country is a criminal record  Paul told PBS   NewsHour  Tuesday   People can t get a job because they have to check off a box saying they re a felon  he said this week   I want people to work  There are certainly a range of rights and government benefits denied to ex offenders  including voting rights  government jobs and public assistance  The 1996 Welfare Reform Act  passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton  denies public assistance to many ex offenders  The Paul Booker bill would reverse that policy for non violent offenders   It restores welfare benefits and food stamps for people who complete substance abuse treatment  Both senators also emphasize the racial disparities at play  Black and white Americans use pot at similar rates  but blacks are almost four times as likely to face arrest for pot  While 13  of the nation is black  black Americans comprise 45  of inmates serving time for drug offenses  Booker  the fourth black senator elected since Reconstruction ended in 1877  has spoken out about both the racial disparities at play and the overuse of harsh sentences for Americans who commit low level  non violent crimes   The majority of our criminals that we lock up are non violent offenders  he said in the  NewsHour  interview   we ve got to start figuring out ways to empower them to succeed  The legislation would also roll back two harsh practices in the treatment of minors It discourages states from trying some teenagers as adults  a practice that has increased even as the rates of violent crime by juveniles are at a 25 year low And it would provide the first national ban on solitary confinement for children   In the U S  solitary confinement has proven increasingly controversial Last year  a United Nations human rights expert concluded that the psychological damage caused by solitary confinement can amount to torture  Congress has been slow to act on most non emergency legislation this year  but aides to both senators say criminal justice is emerging as a rare area of bipartisan agreement  The Senate Judiciary Committee passed reforms to mandatory minimums on a bipartisan vote earlier this year   a change backed by President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder   and this month the entire House of Representatives backed a bipartisan bill to ease banking access for marijuana sales that are legal at the state level  For more reporting on criminal justice  visit Ari Melber s MSNBC series on racial inequities in the law  Presumed Guilty  ,07/30/14 02:30 PM,drugs

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/martin-bashir/unlike-his-father-rand-paul-just-says-no-t, Sen  Rand Paul  R Ky  entered politics with more than just his father s name to his credit  As an insurgent  Tea Party candidate for the U S  Senate in 2010  Paul also benefited considerably from the movement that former Rep  Ron Paul built during his run for the Republican presidential nomination two years before  The elder Paul s campaign failed in 2008  as it did in 2012  but he succeeded in establishing himself as a kind of libertarian folk hero  especially for certain young voters who thrilled to his calls for ending government intrusion in all its forms  from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to the War on Drugs  Rand Paul followed the libertarian path blazed by his father all the way to the corridors of power on Capitol Hill  But now that he s made it to the Senate and perhaps contemplating his own designs on the White House Paul has to decide just how far his father s brand of libertarianism can take him  Sen  Paul demonstrated the sincerity of his libertarian convictions recently  when he made an observation about the absurdity of U S  drug laws  Look  the last two presidents could conceivably have been put in jail for their drug use  and I really think  you know  look what would have happened  it would have ruined their lives  They got lucky  but a lot of poor kids  particularly in the inner city  don t get lucky  They don t have good attorneys  and they go to jail for these things and I think it s a big mistake  Paul s comments  which came during an interview on Fox News Sunday  caused something of a stir  A close reading of them  however  shows that he is not willing to go as far as his father did in advocating for the repeal of laws that make the use or possession of drugs  such as marijuana  illegal  As he explained in the same interview   the main thing I ve said is not to legalize them  but not to incarcerate people for extended periods of time   To that end  Paul has teamed up with Sen  Pat Leahy  D Vt  the liberal chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee  to introduce the Justice Safety Valve Act of 2013  which would give judges greater flexibility in sentencing federal crimes where a mandatory minimum punishment might be considered too harsh  This is exactly the kind of  libertarian Republican approach  that Paul has said will bring more young people back into the GOP fold  But for fans of the more free wheeling libertarianism of his father  it might seem a little tepid  Paul senior attracted a large and devoted following of young people during his failed runs for the presidency  in part  because of his full throated embrace of legalization for all narcotics  not just cannabis but hard drugs like heroin and cocaine  Unlike the younger Paul  who opposes legalization and takes pains to point out that marijuana is  a bad thing to do  the elder Paul actually introduced legislation with arch liberal Barney Frank that would have repealed the federal ban on pot  After the last election  he even co wrote a letter with former Rep  Frank that called on the Obama administration to back off of enforcing the federal ban in Washington and Colorado  where voters have approved measures legalizing the recreational use of the drug  If Sen  Paul is really interested in being president some day  then he has probably decided to avoid some of the more extreme libertarian positions  as well as opposition to foreign wars  that made his father a fringe candidate in many GOP circles  But will his stance on reducing the harshness of penalties for drug offenses resonate with young voters  who rejected the Republicans  last presidential candidate by a margin of 24 percentage points  Guest host Karen Finney discussed Paul s efforts to win back the youth vote with political strategist Angela Rye  author Goldie Taylor and Republican strategist Hogan Gidley  You can watch their discussion here  ,03/27/13 08:48 AM,drugs

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/the-defenses-version-george-zimmerman, George Zimmerman s defense team sent a parade of witnesses to the stand Monday  seeking to paint a humanizing portrait of their client as someone who tutored children  struggled with his weight  and needed help learning how to tie a Windsor knot  Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty to charges of second degree murder in the shooting death of 17 year old Trayvon Martin  saying he was acting in self defense  Key to the case is whether the jury believes Martin was accosted by Zimmerman after being followed by him  or whether Zimmerman shot Martin after the teen attacked him  Most of the first full day of defense testimony focused on whether or not a voice heard screaming on the 911 call made by a witness to police belongs to Martin or Zimmerman  One by one  defense witnesses testified that the voice heard screaming for help on the call was Zimmerman  Among them were Mark and Sondra Osterman  who wrote a book defending Martin s killing as an act of self defense and said they are donating the proceeds to help pay for Zimmerman s legal defense  One witness  John Donnelly  who said he paid for suits for Zimmerman to wear in court and also donated to Zimmerman s legal defense  testified that as a former combat medic in Vietnam he could easily pick out the voice of someone he knew amongst chaos   There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that is George Zimmerman  and I wish to God in my mind I didn t have the ability to understand that  Donnelly told the court  Last week  Trayvon Martin s mother and brother testified that the voice on the tape belonged to Martin  It s unclear how important the identification of the voice on the tape will be  NBC legal analyst Lisa Bloom said Monday   I d be very surprised if after the verdict  the jury  said we decided based on what the friends of George Zimmerman said about the 911 call  The defense also called Sanford police detectives Chris Serino and Doris Singleton  Serino testified that Tracy Martin  Trayvon Martin s father  said  no  when he first heard the recording  a statement that Serino took as meaning that the voice screaming for help on the 911 call did not belong to his son  Singleton also testified that Tracy Martin said the voice on the tape did not sound like Trayvon Martin  Called to the stand later Monday afternoon  Tracy Martin disputed those accounts  testifying that he never told the detectives that the voice on the tape did not belong to Trayvon Martin  Pressed by prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda under cross examination  Serino acknowledged that Tracy Martin might have been uttering  no  in denial  while hearing the gunshot that ended his son s life  The prosecution has noted that Zimmerman himself did not believe it was him on the tape  Serino stated Monday that he believed Zimmerman was simply reacting to the strangeness of hearing his own voice when he told Sanford police  that doesn t even sound like me  after listening to the call  The defense also called Adam Pollock  owner of a gym where Zimmerman sought training in martial arts for what Pollack said was just under a year  Pollock testified that when he first met Zimmerman  the 29 year old was a  physically soft  man who wanted to lose weight and do fight training  Pollock told the court that Zimmerman was ultimately successful only at shedding pounds  Pollock testified that Zimmerman never even learned how to punch correctly  During one dramatic moment  defense attorney Mark O Mara got on the ground and asked Pollock to physically demonstrate what it would look like if one fighter were on top of the other  pinning him with his weight  The image evoked the testimony of Zimmerman neighbor John Good  who testified during the first week of testimony that Martin had pinned Zimmerman in a  ground and pound  position before Zimmerman shot Martin  The prosecution has sought to portray Zimmerman as a law enforcement would be who followed Martin against the advice of a police dispatcher  believing the teenager was  up to no good  Pollock s testimony that Zimmerman failed to properly learn to punch after almost a year of martial arts training could bolster the defense s assertions that Zimmerman was outmatched by Martin and wouldn t have started a fight  or it could support the prosecution s argument that Zimmerman was an aspiring crime fighter who was out of control  Shortly after testimony concluded and the jury left the chamber  the judge ruled that the defense could introduce in court the fact that Martin had marijuana in his system the night he was killed  The defense is expected to conclude its case later this week  Note  George Zimmerman has sued NBC Universal for defamation  The company strongly denies the allegation  ,07/08/13 10:00 PM,drugs

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/evolving-presidential-position-drugs, President Obama has not always welcomed questions about his views on drug use  including marijuana  Dave Weigel noted that Obama has a habit of casually dismissing the topic  when he s not ignoring it altogether    And so it was noteworthy that the New Yorker s David Remnick explored the issue during a lengthy interview with the president  When I asked Obama about another area of shifting public opinion   the legalization of marijuana   he seemed even less eager to evolve with any dispatch and get in front of the issue   As has been well documented  I smoked pot as a kid  and I view it as a bad habit and a vice  not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life  I don t think it is more dangerous than alcohol  To his credit  Remnick pressed further  asking whether Obama believes marijuana might be less dangerous than alcohol    The president apparently paused before diving in  Less dangerous  he said   in terms of its impact on the individual consumer  It s not something I encourage  and I ve told my daughters I think it s a bad idea  a waste of time  not very healthy  What clearly does trouble him is the radically disproportionate arrests and incarcerations for marijuana among minorities   Middle class kids don t get locked up for smoking pot  and poor kids do  he said   And African American kids and Latino kids are more likely to be poor and less likely to have the resources and the support to avoid unduly harsh penalties  But  he said   we should not be locking up kids or individual users for long stretches of jail time when some of the folks who are writing those laws have probably done the same thing  Accordingly  he said of the legalization of marijuana in Colorado and Washington that  it s important for it to go forward because it s important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punished    As is his habit  he nimbly argued the other side   Having said all that  those who argue that legalizing marijuana is a panacea and it solves all these social problems I think are probably overstating the case  There is a lot of hair on that policy  And the experiment that s going to be taking place in Colorado and Washington is going to be  I think  a challenge  He noted the slippery slope arguments that might arise   I also think that  when it comes to harder drugs  the harm done to the user is profound and the social costs are profound  And you do start getting into some difficult line drawing issues  If marijuana is fully legalized and at some point folks say  Well  we can come up with a negotiated dose of cocaine that we can show is not any more harmful than vodka  are we open to that  If somebody says  We ve got a finely calibrated dose of meth  it isn t going to kill you or rot your teeth  are we O K  with that    That s quite a nuanced answer  as is his wont  but with the administration s raids on dispensaries in the not too distant past  on balance  it would appear the president s policy views are evolving in this area  too    ,01/20/14 11:00 AM,drugs

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/can-anonymous-tips-justify-police-stop, In a world where police have the green light to swab arrestees  cheeks for DNA and   at least in some cases   test DUI suspects  blood without consent  it might be surprising to learn that courts have any qualms at all about police pulling drivers over based on anonymous tips  But so they do  The Supreme Court has long been suspicious of police searches or seizures based on tips from callers who don t give their names  On Tuesday  the court will revisit that issue for the first time in a decade when it hears a case presenting this question  Can police stop a driver based on nothing more than an anonymous tip that he or she was driving recklessly  The case  Navarette v  California  raises important doctrinal questions about the 4th Amendment  But it also has practical implications in the road rage era  After all  someone willing to shout obscenities at another driver could just as easily call 911 and say that driver is weaving all over the road  That scenario cuts to the heart of Tuesday s case  Can such callers be trusted  More to the point  can they be trusted enough to justify a police stop  Navarette began with a 911 call in California  The caller reported that a silver Ford pickup truck had just run her off the road  The dispatcher relayed that information to police  and officers soon spotted a silver Ford pickup with a license plate matching the one the caller had reported  Officers followed the pickup for a few minutes and didn t see any signs of reckless driving  Nonetheless  they pulled the pickup over  Inside they found two men  Lorenzo and Jose Navarette   along with four large bags of marijuana  The men pled guilty to drug charges  But they also challenged the legality of the police stop  The officers  they argued  did not have reasonable suspicion to pull them over based on nothing more than an anonymous tip of reckless driving  The case is now before the Supreme Court  and   as in so many cases   the outcome boils down to how the court chooses to read one of its earlier decisions  In 2000  in Florida v  J L  the court ruled that police could not stop and search a teenager at a bus stop based only on an anonymous tip that he had a gun  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg  writing for the court  explained that police have to have reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot before they can search a suspect  and an anonymous tip   without more   doesn t amount to reasonable suspicion  Instead  she wrote  police have to corroborate the tip  they have to have reason to think the tip is  reliable in its assertion of illegality  In reaching that result  Justice Ginsburg worried that letting police act based on uncorroborated anonymous tips would make it too easy for grudge holders to use police as their instrument of revenge  The government argued in J L  that firearms are so dangerous that tips about gun possession should automatically justify a search  Ginsburg rejected that argument  explaining   Such an exception would enable any person seeking to harass another to set in motion an intrusive  embarrassing police search of the targeted person simply by placing an anonymous call falsely reporting the target s unlawful carriage of a gun  At the same time  Justice Ginsburg left the door open to exceptions in other cases  She wrote  for example  that  a report of a person carrying a bomb  might be a case where the danger is so great that police can stop and search a suspect based on a pure anonymous tip  In Navarette  the state of California   supported by the Obama administration   is trying to shoehorn reckless driving within Justice Ginsburg s bomb exception  Police should be able to pull drivers over based on anonymous reckless driving tips  the state argues  because reckless driving often means drunk driving  and that presents an immediate danger to the public  The Navarettes  for their part  say this case is just like J L  They say police should be required to corroborate the tip by following the driver and observing reckless driving  And  they point out  Justice Ginsburg s concern about harassment is just as big a problem in this context  What s to stop an angry driver from taking out his rage by calling in a bogus tip   At least one person in virtually every car now on this nation s roadways has a cellular phone  some prepaid and therefore untraceable  they argue   making instant anonymous tips available to almost everyone caught up in road rage  The court will decide the case by June  Whether anonymous tips trump the Fourth Amendment will turn on whether five Justices think reckless driving is uniquely dangerous   and whether they think it would be too much of a burden to make 911 callers give their names  Poll  Can anonymous tips justify a police stop   ,01/20/14 05:00 PM,drugs
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/colorado-washington-get-ok-feds, When voters in Colorado and Washington approved the legalization of marijuana possession for adults  it was a policy breakthrough  but there was a problem  the newly approved state laws conflicted with federal law Under the Controlled Substances Act  federal law bans marijuana use  so Colorado and Washington were left wondering whether the Justice Department would intervene and block the measures approved by state voters Today  as Ryan J  Reilly and Ryan Grim reported  Colorado and Washington got their answer The United States government took an historic step back from its long running drug war on Thursday  when Attorney General Eric Holder informed the governors of Washington and Colorado that the Department of Justice would allow the states to create a regime that would regulate and implement the ballot initiatives that legalized the use of marijuana for adults A Justice Department official said that Holder told the governors in a joint phone call early Thursday afternoon that the department would take a  trust but verify approach  to the state laws That last part is important  The DOJ is effectively letting the states know that they can proceed on their current course  but if federal law enforcement has reason to believe in the future that Colorado and Washington are failing to be responsible  the feds can revisit the new policy In the meantime  though  that means these states   and any others that choose to follow their lead   can move forward on legalization After watching the  war on drugs  move in only one direction for the majority of my life  this strikes me as a pretty amazing development  Up until fairly recently  it would have been unimaginable The Huffington Post added that Deputy Attorney General James Cole also issued a three and a half page memo to U S  attorneys outlining eight priorities for federal prosecutors enforcing marijuana laws  These are the areas where prosecutions will continue  the distribution of marijuana to minors  revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises  gangs and cartels  the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states  state authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity  violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana  drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use  growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands  preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property But note that this leaves a whole lot of recreational pot use that federal prosecutors will no longer feel the need to pursue Update  Sahil Kapur posted the full memo from Cole  ,08/29/13 02:25 PM,drugs

shelves  At night  gunfire is common  neighbors say  And the police routinely sweep through to disperse the crowds of young people that pool on street corners and in vacant lots  It is along this road  the once bustling main drag of what a century ago had been one of the first African  American incorporated towns in Florida  where tensions brewed and then spilled over after Martin s killing  And it is here where Sanford s black community will wait together for the verdict  Police initially declined to arrest George Zimmerman who claimed he shot the teen in self defense  Zimmerman is on trial in Sanford for second degree murder and has pleaded not guilty  Prosecutors say that Zimmerman profiled  followed and then killed Martin on Feb  26  2012  as Martin made his way through the neighborhood where his father s girlfriend lived  The shooting did not take place in Goldsboro but in a gated community a few miles away  Still  it highlighted a broad gulf between law enforcement and black residents that has widened through the years  Martin s killing and the lack of an immediate arrest conjured up memories for Goldsboro of a shooting that took place two years earlier  In that case  police shot and killed Eugene Scott  a black resident who had been jailed for armed robbery and was a fugitive on other charges  The shooting took place in a grocery store parking lot while police were attempting to arrest him  Scott was shot in the back  The officer who opened fire said he did so after Scott tried to run over his partner  The officer was cleared by law enforcement officials of wrong doing  but many in the black community remained unsatisfied with the findings  Mary Fudge in the passenger seat  on 13th Street  June  2013  Photo by Wayne Lawrence Institute for msnbc Along 13th Street  residents are following Zimmerman s trial closely from local bars and over games of dominoes  Some say that what hinges on the outcome of the case is what blacks here have been owed far too long  justice   People are trying to use this case to move us forward  said Pastor Valarie Houston  whose church is on the corner of Olive Avenue and 13th Street   For this community  she said  the trial brings  an opportunity for a spiritual awakening as well as a sense of hope and empowerment  A hard pill to swallow On most afternoons  older men take refuge from the biting sun under the palm and willow trees where South Pomegranate Ave  meets W  13th Street  Many of them spent years laboring in the region s citrus groves and celery fields but now commune over cold beer and boisterous games of dominoes  Their leisure time is equal parts fellowship and an informal people s court where they pass judgment on everyone from local politicians to neighborhood ne er do wells  They trade stories of run ins with white supervisors and the police  More recently the often raucous deliberations have been about Zimmerman s trial   I ll tell you this much  If he s found innocent there s going to be an uprising  said Cecil Nelson   There s going to be trouble  The collective of men let out a chorus of mm hmms above the clack clack of dominoes hitting tabletops   I had a 17 year old

Elijah Williams  L  and Horace Cain  R  a lifelong resident of Goldsboro  joined a group of men under the shade of palm trees just off 13th Street on a recent afternoon to drink beer and play dominoes  Cain lamented the death of Trayvon Martin and the long history of racial strife in Sanford   Photo by Wayne Lawrence Institute for msnbc Nelson  Cain and most of the others here remember childhoods with segregated public spaces  Most said they still don t feel comfortable going downtown  where nearly all of the businesses are white owned and patronized by white residents  The history of racial strife runs deep in Sanford  founded in 1870 by Henry Shelton Sanford  an American diplomat who served in the Congo  He later argued that the country would be better off if blacks were returned to Africa  according to historian Adam Hochschild in his seminal work  King Leopold s Ghost  In 1946 Sanford s police chief famously forced Jackie Robinson out of a minor league baseball game  refusing to let him integrate the exhibition   The Robinsons were run out of Sanford  Fla  with threats of violence  Robinson s daughter  Sharon Robinson  later wrote  In 1997 the city apologized for its treatment of Robinson  During the Civil Rights era  city leaders cemented over Sanford s lone public pool rather than allow black children to swim in it  While that time has long passed  the town remains largely segregated with the majority of blacks living in neighborhoods such as Goldsboro  About 30  of the city s 54 000 residents are black and 57  are white  according to the latest Census  Much of Sanford is the stuff of post cards  with red bricked streets downtown and a picturesque waterfront  Crooked oak and willow trees hunch over lazy roads  Further away from downtown are the fruits of Sanford s more recent sprawl  with newer developments similar to the gated community where Martin was killed  While the city has pumped millions into new projects and redeveloping its waterfront  there s been little investment in Goldsboro  Many of the streets don t have sidewalks  the sewer system is in disrepair and the closure of several public housing complexes has left acres of land pocked with shuttered cinderblock apartments and many residents displaced   I don t see how we as leaders could talk about developing Sanford to its fullest potential if you don t address the needs in the depressed areas  Velma Williams  the city s lone black commissioner  told msnbc  It s rough out there Juwann McCall  16  stands on the corner of Oleander Ave  and 13th Street on a recent

slice of the neighborhood   It s rough out here  said McCall  a slender  somewhat sullen faced boy  looking anxiously over his shoulder   You just hope  just hope that you be the one to make it out  For months leading up to Martin s death  residents said there had been shootings between rival groups in the neighborhood  But Martin s death seemed to affect them in a different way  Martin s killer wasn t black  Zimmerman is of white and Hispanic descent  The deaths of other black men had not led to protests in Goldsboro but McCall joined the neighborhood rallies that followed Martin s killing  He would stand along busy streets with a pack of Skittles  like the one s Martin carried that night  holding a sign that read  Honk For Justice  A slow trickle of young men walked by and offered head nods or shouts from across the street  McCall threw up a hand or shouted back   Every day I worry  he said   So  just think like  just pray and everything should be okay but like it s a lot of crazy stuff going on around here and stuff so  I just try to stay out the mix  From her little church on the corner of Olive Avenue and 13th Street  Houston says she has witnessed the best and worst of

served as a police post mulled her community s long struggles   Seems like every so often  this race thing kicks its head up again  said Oliver  whose golden dreadlocks flowed over her shoulders and halfway down her back  Indeed  the long running racial fissure in the city of Sanford goes back more than 100 years  Goldsboro was the second town in Florida to be incorporated by blacks after Eatonville  ushered into literary history by author Zora Neal Hurston s  Their Eyes Were Watching God  Hurston lived in Goldsboro for a time and her father  John Hurston  was pastor of a local Baptist church  In 1911 Sanford expanded and stripped Goldsboro of its charter  absorbing the city into Sanford proper  Goldsboro s institutions were dismantled  including the post office  the jail and many of the black owned businesses  Streets named for Goldsboro s black founding fathers were changed to numbers instead  In more recent years there had been efforts to mend old wounds with proclamations  In 2012  a stretch of 13th Street was renamed Historic Goldsboro Blvd  in honor of the neighborhood s rich history   There were barber shops  beauty shops  restaurants  stores  even supermarkets  Oliver said of 13th Street s past  Most of those establishments have long since gone  But images of Goldsboro s past live on within the museum s walls  One photo captures William Clark  a town founder  atop his prized mule  A replica of an old barber shop that stood on 13th Street for generations is prominently on display  Century old court records document the debt Goldsboro was owed by Sanford when it was taken over in 1911  The total   10 375 80 for property and other stipulations   The Jim Crow part of Sanford is gone  Francis Oliver said   But you still gotta deal with part of segregation  As you can see  Goldsboro looks like the stepchild of Sanford  Sanford Police Chief Cecil Smith talks with a group of residents on 13th Street  which runs through the heart of Goldsboro  Sanford s historic black neighborhood  Photo by Wayne Lawrence Institute for msnbc Another 50 years Two blocks over on 13th Street near Mangoustine Ave  people gathered in front of the Goldsboro Food

 More than one young man was seen with a marijuana blunt behind his ear  Many here complained that police harassment has worsened since Martin s killing   It s like they used that as an excuse to apply more pressure to the community  not help us  but to hurt us even more  said Derwin Slayton  Brenda Hartsfield  a nurse at the county jail and owner of the Goldsboro Food Mart  said that she has filed numerous complaints about the treatment of her customers by the police   I m their voice  When things happen to them  the first thing they do is they come to me  Hartsfield said   The police basically done put like a chokehold on the neighborhood  As Hartsfield and a small crowd ran down a laundry list of complaints against the police  including allegations of overzealous enforcement of loitering and open container laws  the police chief strode down the block and into the gaggle  Goldsboro residents  Trevose  Tru Tree  Scott  L  and Tony  R  on 12th Street in Goldsboro  June 2013

other problems  His officers  he said  are there  making sure that the streets are safe  making sure that people can get up and down the sidewalks  that people in the middle of the night at 2 o clock in the morning can get up and down the street  We don t want to keep people from having a good time  But there is a time and a place  Smith believes that the anger and tensions that roiled after Martin s death could have been avoided had police brass had better communication with the black community  In the wake of the shooting  then Police Chief Bill Lee publicly defended the decision not to arrest Zimmerman  He cited the state s controversial Stand Your Ground Laws and said he was legally barred from arresting Zimmerman given the lack of evidence to counter his self defense claims  Zimmerman was arrested 44 days after the killing and only after a special prosecutor was assigned to the case  Chief Lee was later fired   I m black from Chicago  coming in to a highly inflamed community  Smith said  standing outside the Food Mart   It took 50 years for people to feel the way they do now  It s going to take another 50 years to try to get people to change their mindset  It may not even happen in all of this generation  But for me  if I have the ability to change ten people s attitudes  that s a step  Smith said part of bridging the gap between the police and the people are weeding out bad apples in the department  He has fired one officer for using a racial slur on Facebook  and said others are being investigated for similar racial incidents  The fired officer  Vanessa Knode  conceded to internal affairs investigators that she used the  n word  in a Facebook post  But she told investigators that the epithet was aimed at her white husband and that she saw it as synonymous with  bro  or  these guys  Standing back to survey the scene on 13th Street one recent evening  Smith seemed satisfied with the discourse his random appearance had sparked   I could send the dogs in here and chase everybody away  or I can come in here and try to talk to people  Smith said  Wayne Lawrence contributed reporting to this article  Goldsboro is a neighborhood literally on

 Close video       The Reid Report  5 19 14  3 18 PM ET       All eyes on Oregon same sex marriage ruling       Aisha Moodie Mills and Danielle Moodie Mills  both of the Center for American Progress  join Joy Reid to discuss how the fight for marriage equality has transformed in the last decade    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss In 2004  as San Francisco s Mayor  Newsom defied state laws by directing the city county clerk to issue marriages licenses to same sex couples  He continued his fierce support of same sex marriage by being a vocal opponent of Proposition 8  The Moodie Mills are a media power couple who use Politini to  shift culture by exploring the personal side of politics  You ll often see them on msnbc speaking to LGBT  women in politics  and race issues   The LGBT advocates responded to a range of msnbc com community questions from AIDS to marijuana  Take a look at the conversation below   Aisha and Danielle Moodie MIlls responded to the questions collectively  Luke Leifeste  How did you deal with the onslaught of naysayers along the way in your fight for LGBT rights  Did you tune out the  haters  or prefer to take them head on  The Moodie Mills  There will always be haters that work tirelessly to block progress and never enough time in your day to take them all on  We focus on moving the ball forward and that takes energy and focus that can t be wasted on naysayers  Although  we are human  so when we shared our wedding photos on Essence and commenters came after our family  we did step in and try to shut the negativity down  The good news is that naysayers have been far and few in between in our experience  What we ve learned is that few can disavow or deny basic love  and so we try to lead from that place of love  We strive each day to live authentically and love openly and to connect with people around our common humanity  This has helped us to demystify stereotypes about LGBT people and connect with people who haven t been considered natural allies of the LGBT community   I am someone who cannot support denying a basic human right to two people who love one another  Gavin Newsom  Lt  Gov  of California Lt  Governor Newsom There was a lot of resistance around same sex marriage when we began issuing licenses in San Francisco in 2004  While good people can disagree  I am someone who cannot support denying a basic human right to two people who love one another  When we started issuing those licenses   and in the end had 4 036 couples come to San Francisco to get married   it was about doing the right thing and standing on principal  not on making headlines or confronting any naysayers  Early on  there were protests and a lot of hateful actions  But over the last 10 years  the public opinion has changed not only because of the court cases we ve seen at every level across the country  but also because of the thousands of conversations that are happening over the dinner table  at birthday parties  driving to work  etc  and people realize that granting same sex couples the right to get married is in the end no different than their own marriages  Matthew Kaye Should the transmission of HIV be decriminalized nationally  The Moodie Mills  Absolutely  From the beginning of the HIV epidemic  prevailing public misperceptions about the routes  risks  and consequences of HIV transmission have been wrought with homophobia  transphobia and stigma about LGBT people and people living with HIV   and public policy has often perpetuated that stigma  In 36 states  people living with HIV can be

when you said   Oh  it s coming whether you like it or not  And now it s basically here  Now let s get marijuana moved from Schedule 1 with heroin  ahead of cocaine  and down to Schedule 3 or 4 where it has always belonged  Lt  Governor Newsom Nathan  you are correct  Marijuana is currently listed as a schedule 1 drug  next to LSD and heroin and above cocaine  This schedule also means marijuana has no medical use whatsoever  With numerous research officials disproving that and personal stories of family members or friends benefitting from medical use of marijuana throughout the country  we now have 23 states and Washington  D C  with laws allowing use of marijuana medically  We are also seeing members of congress calling for a change in the schedule and a shift in views for recreational use  You know that Colorado and Washington are already legally selling marijuana to adults  while Oregon and Alaska are looking at ballot initiatives in November  In California we are working on an initiative that addresses age limits  taxation  regulation and education about smoking and eating marijuana   before taking it to the voters  It s the old adage  If you want to go fast go alone  but if you want to go far go together  We want to do this right so we are looking at and learning from the implementation and application of legal recreational use in Colorado and Washington  From Jennifer Jackson With the current drought  what s the direction California is taking on climate change  Lt  Governor Newsom One of California s top priorities is combating climate change  Our focus is on adaptability and reducing greenhouse gas emissions  A lot of work is happening in California  We are leading the way in fuel standards  Under AB 32  our goal is to return our emissions back to 1990 levels by 2020  which we are on track to do  Then we have a goal to reduce our emissions by 85  by 2050  We continue to explore and make use of alternate energy in wind and solar  Additionally  as I sit on the California State Lands Commission  we are aggressively mapping our 1 000 miles of coastline  and the California Public Utilities Commission is establishing a framework for adaptability  We also have a governor who believes we need to combat climate change as well  In the past four years  Gov  Brown has agreed and signed a pact with our neighbors in Oregon  as well as Mexico  China and Canada  to address greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution   Working at your local LGBT youth center or chapters of national organizations like GLSEN and The Trevor Project are great places to lend

organizations to volunteer with    Lt  Governor Newsom  I would advise any person looking to get involved to seek first to understand  then to be understood  Be open to argument and interested in evidence and not be ideological  I would say that everyone s expression is unique   no on else has it  Be sure to maintain your authenticity and stand on principal  then volunteer with an organization you believe in  At this point  it s hard to expect anything good from politicians in Washington  They are going to continue using the border crisis as an excuse to  not  act on immigration  both  the president and congress  And if they ever give relief to the community  they will also militarize the border even more as a condition  What I expect from the rest of us  is to learn more about this border culture  why people are fleeing their homes  why that border is there and since when  The situation in which we live today has root causes  We need to build grass roots to change the communities we live in  where directly affected people are  The Moodie Mills LGBT equality needs to be achieved on two fronts  through culture and through policy  All politics are local  so starting

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/rand-pauls-long-game, Rand Paul this week announced a class action lawsuit against President Obama to curb the NSA s ability to gather domestic phone records  insisting such surveillance efforts should be  specific to the person  to the place and to the items  But lurking behind the policy argument is a clear political motive as well  the Kentucky senator  who s considering a bid for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016  has argued for years that his libertarianism is just what the party needs to attract a younger  more diverse base  Paul s lawsuit  which is backed by former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli and tea party group Freedomworks  is the latest phase in Paul s long running campaign against government spying  But lately his political motives have been more visibily attached to the war on surveillance  Paul s asking Americans to show their support for his lawsuit by giving him their e mail addresses and zip codes   information that some commentators noted is more valuable to a candidate building a voter database than to a judge considering a lawsuit  Paul s critique of the NSA isn t unique to the right  many progressive activists are similarly appalled by evidence of widespread government spying  And opposition to such surveillance programs isn t the only area where Paul has some overlap with the left  Some of his more libertarian positions  like scaling back the war on drugs and restricting drone strikes  also cross party lines  One of Paul s top allies in the Senate when it comes to spying concerns is Ron Wyden  an Oregon Democrat who is also intensely critical of the NSA  Paul has argued such crossover issues will attract voters not traditionally associated with the GOP  He s made an effort to reach out to African Americans by criticizing mandatory sentencing laws  And he insists protesting government intrusion will win back the so called Millennial voters   young people born after 1980 who backed Obama by large margins in 2012  Young voters  don t really care as much about taxes  regulation  balanced budgets might not be their big deal either  but they care about their liberty  they care about their privacy  Paul said at a forum hosted by Young Americans For Liberty in July   I think if we do  the youth will come  Paul s efforts may even resonate with more traditional GOP base voters  Republican strategist Ford O Connell told msnbc that Paul s NSA attack would appeal to that group because it dovetails with conservatives  general anxieties about government overreach under Obama   This is about not just getting to the general election and winning young voters  it s also high on the mind of tea party folks and constitutional conservatives  O Connell said  For now  neither party has a monopoly on the battle over civil liberties  Many Republican leaders  who gleefully attacked Democrats for opposing warrantless wiretapping under President Bush  are still uncomfortable with Paul s positions  And Democrats have yet to reach a consensus either  with some more hawkish officials like Senator Dianne Feinstein aggressively defending the NSA s surveillance practices  Some progressives are making a parallel case to Paul s as well  arguing Democrats shouldn t cede political ground to the GOP on the issue of privacy  Shenna Bellows  a Democrat challenging Republican Sen  Susan Collins in Maine  has made the incumbent s support for the NSA and the PATRIOT Act her top campaign issue   Privacy is a winning issue in 2014 because there s a really interesting coalition of progressives and libertarians across Maine and across the country interested in restoring our constitutional freedoms  Bellows told msnbc in a phone interview   I think privacy is incredibly important to young people who understand technology and understand that our laws have not kept pace with technology  Paul s earned plenty of praise from progressives for his positions on surveillance  drone strikes  and drug laws  But his political ambitions can be a source of tension in those circles  Paul is intensely conservative on budget issues  favoring the rapid elimination of huge swaths of the federal government  and he opposes abortion rights  His libertarianism has also led him to some politically explosive places  like criticizing the 1964 Civil Rights Act that ended segregation  and some fringe associations  like a neo Confederate aide who resigned last year  And that s not even counting his father s far more inflammatory history  The closer the younger Paul gets to a plausible presidential campaign  the harder it gets for some progressives to separate his issues from his ambitions  Van Jones  the progressive activist and former Obama adviser who now hosts CNN s Crossfire  carefully qualified his support for Paul s filibuster against drone strikes last year by labeling him  a civil liberties hero and a civil rights villain  in a column  Liberal columnist Adele Stan took fellow left wing activists to task over their support for Paul the same month  warning that they were legitimizing his more extreme positions by extension  Concerns on the left about boosting Paul s presidential stock might make it marginally harder to find activist allies for his policy causes  but they aren t particularly relevant to his electoral ambitions  In fact  one of the biggest obstacles he could face in 2016 is that his rivals actually buy into his argument  Many of Paul s signature issues are gaining ground within the GOP  The Republican National Committee recently adopted a resolution sponsored by a Paul supporter decrying NSA spying  Texas Gov  Rick Perry  who might run again in 2016  recently suggested Texas move towards decriminalizing marijuana and has defended the right of states to legalize the drug  Chris Christie  who has clashed with Paul on national security issues  slammed the war on drugs as  a failure  in a speech last month  Two other likely presidential candidates  Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio  joined Paul for his anti drone filibuster last year  Paul is surely heartened to see libertarian policies gain ground among Republican leaders  But the more they do  the less unique his appeal might be to Republican voters  There s a long history of political insurgents fading away as the major parties co opt their views  Paul s biggest enemy could be success  Close video       The Daily Rundown  2 14 14  10 57 AM ET       The road to  16 00        Would be 2016 candidates learn some hard lessons about the

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/nyt-editorial-board-calls-end-pot-prohibition, The New York Times  opinion section has taken some curious steps in recent months when talking about marijuana  Last month  for example  Maureen Dowd wrote about a terribly unpleasant incident in which she ingested far too much pot and ended up  in a hallucinatory state for the next eight hours   panting and paranoid    It followed a David Brooks column from earlier this year in which he noted his own experimentation before concluding that he wants a society in which  government subtly encourages the highest pleasures  like enjoying the arts or being in nature  and discourages lesser pleasures  like being stoned    One of the problems with Brooks  piece  of course  is that the United States doesn t just  discourage  the use of marijuana  we spend billions to fight it  imprisoning many of those who embrace the  lesser pleasures  It is  in other words  a prohibition   which the editorial board of the New York Times now wants to end  It took 13 years for the United States to come to its senses and end Prohibition  13 years in which people kept drinking  otherwise law abiding citizens became criminals and crime syndicates arose and flourished  It has been more than 40 years since Congress passed the current ban on marijuana  inflicting great harm on society just to prohibit a substance far less dangerous than alcohol    The federal government should repeal the ban on marijuana    We reached that conclusion after a great deal of discussion among the members of The Times s Editorial Board  inspired by a rapidly growing movement among the states to reform marijuana laws  On the surface  it may not seem especially important to think a newspaper ran an editorial on legalizing marijuana  Lots of newspapers run editorials on all kinds of issues every day    But in practice  the New York Times isn t just any paper  and the editorial board s willingness to adopt a bold stance on drug policy is emblematic of a national conversation has fundamentally changed   and may never be the same    The editorial itself acknowledges  legitimate concerns  before concluding that the balance  falls squarely on the side of national legalization     Creating systems for regulating manufacture  sale and marketing will be complex  the piece adds   But those problems are solvable  and would have long been dealt with had we as a nation not clung to the decision to make marijuana production and use a federal crime    Mark Kleiman  a national expert on drug policy  believes the Times  editorial is incomplete  brushing past some legitimate questions while ignoring others  His concerns clearly need to be part of the conversation    But I m nevertheless struck by the fact that a conversation exists at all  In the not too distant past  the idea of lifting the prohibition on marijuana seemed as fanciful as  well  marriage equality    A societal evolution appears to be well underway    ,07/28/14 09:21 AM,drugs

mountain s north face forced him to turn back The point  the Colorado Democrat said last week as he walked down the road to the Mesa Trailhead near his home here   is to come home alive  It doesn t count if you touch the top of the mountain and you don t make it back The stakes Udall faces now aren t life and death but if he loses his unexpectedly close bid for re election against Republican Rep  Cory Gardner in November  control of the Senate is all but guaranteed to flip to the GOP  Democrats can only lose a net of five seats to retain control of the chamber  with red state races in Arkansas  Alaska  Arkansas and Louisiana all more likely to flip than blue Colorado  a Udall loss could be catastrophic This has always been a tough map from the very beginning  said Udall s fellow Democratic Colorado senator  Michael Bennet  who this year is running the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee   We ve known it was going to be a tough map But Udall s race in what has been an increasingly Democratic state has been creeping closer and closer as the months have worn on  President Obama is becoming more unpopular  The genial  mild mannered Gardner  his hobby  restoring antique furniture  is a contrast with the firebrand conservatives who ran unsuccessfully for Senate and governor in the state in 2010  and national Republicans considered it a coup when they convinced Gardner to jump into the race   It relegated Ken Buck  the erstwhile 2010 Senate nominee who lost to Bennet  to running for the House   A big smile s a nice thing  I think we hall have big smiles  but your record matters  your actions matter  To beat Gardner  Udall has been almost singularly focused on the Republican s support for hard line positions on abortion and contraception  Nearly half of Udall s ads have attacked Gardner for  among other things  supporting a state  personhood  initiative that could criminalize many forms of birth control A big smile s a nice thing  I think we hall have big smiles  but your record matters  your actions matter  Udall told msnbc   His positions would move us backwards Gardner has since reversed his stance on the state personhood measure   But his name is still on a very similar federal law There is no federal personhood bill   they re two different pieces of legsiatlion  And I understand Sen  Udall he wants to run away from the failed economy  Garnder said when asked about the Life at Conception Act  which Personhood USA  which supports such initiatives around the country  says is in fact a federal personhood measure Asked to identify the difference between Colorado s state initiative and the nationwide version  Gardner focused on procedural differences  not policy Again  you re talking about a bill that s at the state level that was at the amendment to the constitution  They re different from a procedural posture they re different language  Gardner s discomfort crystallizes what the race is really about  women  particularly unmarried women who live in Denver and its surrounding suburbs Younger  single voters tend to participate less in midterm elections than in presidential contests  With his focus on reproductive health care  Udall is counting on a turnout boost among young women  Gardner s challenge is convincing those women that they should be focused on other issues  His approach so far is twofold  He s trying to tie Udall to Obama  and he s going after the Udall family for its long history in politics  Mark Udall s father  Mo Udall  was a near legendary Democratic senator from Arizona who made a short lived run for president in 1976 Eighteen years in politics and he s got two cousins who are senators too  Mark Udall s dad even ran for president  a new Gardner ad declares  Udall s two cousins are Democrat Tom Udall of New Mexico and Mike Lee of Utah Udall took umbrage at the ad  demanding it be taken down No way  Gardner said   I m running against a person who has a Wikipedia page for his political dynasty   I m running against a person who has a Wikipedia name a Wikipedia page for his political dynasty that his family runs  Gardner said in an interview Gardner also insists that his rival is much closer to Obama than he tries to claim  during a recent debate  Gardner supporters hooted and laughed when Udall declared Let me tell you  the White House when they look down the front lawn the last person they want to see coming is me  Udall says he has stood up to Obama on a range of issues  including abuses at the CIA and National Security Agency  Still  he is one of the only lawmakers to ever play golf with the president Over the last six months I ve been a thorn in their side  On the NSA  on the VA  Veterans Affairs  on the CIA  they haven t always been happy to take my phone calls over there  Udall said What s not clear at this point  though  is whether Udall or Gardner will be able to break the race out of the pattern it s been stuck in for months  And observers are also raising questions about the governor s race also taking place in the state and how it will affect the Senate contest   Democratic Gov  John Hickenlooper has dropped in polls in recent weeks amid controversies over the death penalty and guns At particular issue  Hickenlooper s reprieve for Nathan Dunlap  who was convicted of killing four people in a shooting rampage at a Chuck E  Cheese where he worked  In an interview with CNN  Hickenlooper suggested that he might grant full clemency to Dunlap an idea that drew a rebuke even from Udall   No  Udall said when asked if he believed Dunlap should be granted clemency Hickenlooper s challenges could affect the makeup of the midterm electorate in Colorado  which is Udall s other critical hurdle  Democrats are quick to insist that their operation in the state is unparalleled  Udall aides say their data is so good that they are targeting not just counties or ZIP codes but individual voters  Nationally  the Democratic turnout operation is called the Bannock Street Project  after the Denver roadway where Bennet had his headquarters in 2010 and won in a strongly Republican year Forty days out we ve got a ground game here that we ve never seen in an off year election  Bennet said of the 2014 effort   Three times better than when I ran Another potential wrench for Democrats  Pot  When Obama won the state by  5 points in 2012  an initiative to legalize marijuana was on the ballot  possibly lifting participation among younger  Democratic leaning voters  There s no comparable measure ballot this time  Udall says that he s trying to help the new marijuana industry get access to banking services  but that s not a major issue in the race  As for the candidates themselves  Both say they ve stayed away No  I haven t  No  No

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/washingtons-silence-the-racial-wealth-gap, In 1967  with the Civil Rights movement still in full swing and Jim Crow still looming in the rearview mirror  median household income was 43  higher for white  non Hispanic households than for black households  But things changed dramatically over the next half century  as legal segregation faded into history  By 2011  median white household income was 72  higher than median black household income  according to a Census report from that year  PDF  To say that economic inequality is still a heavily racialized phenomenon  even a generation after the end of the Civil Rights era  would be an understatement  Yet both major parties continue to discuss inequality in largely color blind terms  only hinting at the role played by race  The trend is even more startling when one looks at median household wealth instead of yearly income  In 1984  the white to black wealth ratio was 12 to 1  according to Pew Research Center  By 1995  the chasm had narrowed until median white income had only a 5 to 1 advantage over black income  But over the next 14 years the wealth gap began to grow once again  until it had skyrocketed up to 19 to 1 in 2009  Yet even a recent 204 page analysis of the federal War on Poverty  spearheaded by Rep  Paul Ryan  R Wis  gives only passing mentions to racial disparity  In the first section of the report  which purports to explain the causes of modern poverty  Ryan and his co authors bring up race only twice  Once to identify  the breakdown of the familiy as a key cause of poverty within the black community  citing Daniel Patrick Moynihan  and again to applaud the narrowing of the  achievement gap  between white and black schoolchildren  Weeks later  during a radio appearance  Ryan said poverty is in part to blame on the fact that  inner cities  have a culture of  men not working  President Obama went a step forward in December s major address on inequality  when he noted that  the painful legacy of discrimination means that African Americans  Latinos  Native Americans are far more likely to suffer from a lack of opportunity higher unemployment  higher poverty rates  Yet that amounted to a footnote in a speech that also included the line   The opportunity gap in America is now as much about class as it is about race   I think it doesn t make for good politics  said Color of Change executive director Rashad Robinson of the racial wealth gap   It s messy and requires us to be deep and think about much bigger and more long term solutions than Washington s oftentimes willing to deal with  Yet in a serious discussion about American inequality  the subject of race is essentially unavoidable  That s because most of the pipelines to a higher economic class such as employment and homeownership are  oftentimes not equally accessible to black folks  said Robinson  Disparities in homeownership are a major driver of the racial wealth gap  according to a recent study from Brandeis University  According to the authors of the report   redlining  a form of discrimination in banking or insurance practices  discriminatory mortgage lending practices  lack of access to credit  and lower incomes have blocked the homeownership path for African Americans while creating and reinforcing communities segregated by race  Many of the black families that have successfully battled their way to homeownership over the past few decades saw their nest eggs get pulverized by the 2008 financial collapse  The Brandeis researchers found that  half the collective wealth of African American families was stripped away during the Great Recession  in large part due to the collapse of the housing market and the subsequent explosion in the nationwide foreclosure rate  Similarly  employment discrimination has done its part to ensure that black unemployment remains twice as high as white unemployment a ratio that has stayed largely consistent since the mid 1950s  National Bureau of Economy Research fellows have found that resumes are significantly less likely to get a positive response from potential employers if the applicants have names that are more common in the black community  And an arrest for even a non violent drug offense can haunt a job applicant for the rest of his life  combined with the fact that black people are nearly four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than whites  despite using the drug at roughly the same rate  criminal background checks have helped to fuel racial inequity in job hiring  Yet both parties have stressed personal responsibility to an outsized degree  said William Darity Jr  the director of Duke University s Consortium on Social Equity   The underlying narrative that many people share is that whatever inequities still exist  they re due to the misbehavior or disfunctional behavior of black folks themselves  said Darity   So there s no reason to pay attention to racial disparities because one doesn t believe they re still significant  or there s no need for public policy action by the government because it s just a question of black folks changing their own behaviors  Darity portrayed this as a bipartisan problem and criticized President Obama for  playing  into that behavior  by emphasizing personal responsibility in the  My Brother s Keeper  initiative to help young men of color  The conservative notion of a  culture of poverty is another example of the fallacy  he said   I think a lot of people are really attracted to stories about personal uplift or social mobility  but these are very exceptional cases  he said   That s not the norm  Most people who are born into deprived circumstances do not really have the capacity or support to come out of those deprived circumstances  Instead  he argued that the only way to break self perpetuating inequality was through wealth transfers   People s behaviors are largely shaped by the resources they possess  and if their resources alterned  than they might change their behaviors  he said  Poll  What do you think is the primary factor perpetuating the racial wealth gap

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/all-in/congress-plays-lets-make-deal, Big news on multiple fronts out of Washington  Wednesday  and the word of the day on Capitol Hill was  deal  The big deal Wednesday on Capitol Hill was the reaching or leaking of big deals  And the way that Washington talks about a deal is that a deal is inherently good because a deal is the end  in and of itself   You re always looking for a deal  so when you get one it must be good news  But in the real world  where we all have to live every day  a deal is good only if it s a good deal Deals are  almost by definition  cut in the center  And so what matters most in Washington deal making is how the center is defined And what made two of the deals being rolled out on Wednesday  at least tentatively promising is the fact that the center around which they are crafted is remarkably further to the left than it was just six months ago  Take the big  bipartisan gun deal  announced by Sens  Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey  It s pretty narrow deal  policy wise  simply designed to expand background checks to cover gun show and internet sales  The cost of the deal  apparently  was private  person to person sales  which still be exempt from background checks NBC reported today that the NRA was a  near constant  presence in the room as Manchin and Toomey worked out the details  And  for his part  Sen  Toomey would prefer that you not even refer to it as gun control  See that right there  that s the power of the center  The center gets to be  common sense  Everything else is defined as  politics   Now  as narrow as this background check deal may be when put up against the staggering problem of gun violence in this country   it is still a remarkable thing Even just six months ago  the idea of the senate opening debate on a bipartisan gun safety bill of any kind would have been unthinkable There has not been a major piece of gun control legislation debated in the senate since 1994   that was the last time we saw anything like what s happening right now  Almost 20 years ago  The only gun measure to get through Congress during Barack Obama s first term was  notably  an amendment to allow you to carry firearms into National Parks And even though the NRA was apparently physically looming over the negotiations  the deal announced on Wednesday is exactly the sort of thing that the NRA has been fighting like crazy to prevent The NRA s elite  placebo nightmare is now on its way to almost coming true  In real life  In a move from Capitol Hill that could not have been imagined last year  The other big deal in the news comes to us from the bipartisan group of eight Senators tasked with coming up with an immigration reform framework  Those eight senators are just about ready to present their proposal to the rest of the senate And Patrick Leahy  the chair of the Judiciary Committee has already set a hearing for the compromise bill for one week from today  This pivotal movement on immigration  just happened to coincide with rallies  held in Washington and all over the country pushing for reform Now  judging from the details of the immigration compromise that are leaking to the press at this point the path to legal status for undocumented workers in this country would be obstructed by some really draconian border security requirements But even so  again   any deal at all on immigration is a deal that would simply not have happened six months ago Six months ago  the leader of the Republican Party sounded like this on immigration  In a matter of months  Republicans have gone from being the party of    I can t have illegals   to working out a deal with Democrats on immigration that does not center around the mystifying and cruel concept of self deportation Of course  having lost the last election among Latino voters by a 44 point margin probably helped them along in their re awakening on the issue But even after that shellacking among Latinos  even after Republicans seemed to be coming to the table on immigration  there were moments  over the course of the last few weeks  when it looked like the base was about ready to abandon the effort  There was Jeb Bush s immigration book  out last month  arguing that undocumented immigrants should never be allowed a pathway to citizenship  And then  as recently as a couple of weeks ago  it was starting to look like Marco Rubio   a key member of that bipartisan group working toward a deal   might be getting cold feet  And  to be clear Republicans still might change their minds and decide to blow this whole thing up after all  But today they re talking about a deal on immigration  And that itself is a victory for the forces of righteousness  Both of these deals on Wednesday were  for progressives  encouraging developments because they show how what could broadly be called the Obama coalition is succeeding in pushing the center of domestic political conversation on a whole host of major issues to the left  On some issues  like marijuana legalization in the states and marriage equality   the Obama coalition has been able to move the conversation farther to the left  faster than anyone thought conceivable And in domestic politics one huge pressing exception to that pattern perhaps the only place where the center is still defined as so far to the right that we are still living in the 2010 Tea Party world  is austerity  The terms of the conversation about austerity and budgets and jobs are still defined by the peak moments of Gadsden flags and tri corner hats  Which brings us to Wednesday s third deal   a bad deal that is redeemed by the fact that it is the one of the three deals that is not yet struck  And probably won t be It is  instead  a deal offered in the form of the president s budget  Which  I should say  contains some great progressive stuff  But there s also this  The third to last bullet point in a five page summary of the president s budget is a proposed cut to Social Security benefits  Because the center of debate on fiscal policy is so far to the right  that cutting Social Security benefits is part of the Democratic president s budget proposal  The center gets defined in a whole host of ways   who shows up to elections  who gets to appear on cable news  who stands outside on the National Mall or in the street carrying signs And we ve seen activists mobilize to tremendous early effect on guns and on immigration  And what we have not seen at this point is mass sustained mobilization against austerity  And we are seeing the results of that absence of political pressure

nephew was killed by transit police in Oakland  flew all the way from California  And Noche Diaz  an anti police brutality activist from New York City  boarded a bus in Chinatown and spent the next 16 hours en route to Georgia before joining a group of friends for the 10 hour drive to Sanford   I was anxious  I was afraid  but I knew I had to be here for the start of this trial  said Sherman  standing on the grass outside of the Seminole County Criminal Justice Center  where the trial of George Zimmerman for second degree murder began on Monday morning with jury selection  Sherman stood with a dozen or so other people who d gathered in front of the courthouse  holding a large sign with a picture of her 9 year old grandson Semaj that read   Could He Be The Next Trayvon Martin  Trayvon Martin  17  died just about six miles from the court house where scores of potential jurors were convened and questioned today  Zimmerman  who has pleaded not guilty  says he shot Martin in self defense after the teenager attacked him  When police initially declined to arrest Zimmerman  thousands of protestors  descended upon Sanford  There were massive rallies with celebrity activists who compared Sanford to Selma and Montgomery  The case has remained controversial  And yet the crowd outside the courthouse on Monday was small  City officials have been preparing for the trial for about a year  creating so called free speech zones for protestors  making accommodations for the national and international press figured to be in town for the trial  and assigning officers with the county sheriffs and police departments to guard the courthouse and other key locations in town  The planning so far has cost more than  500 000  according to City Manager Norton Bonaparte  But little of that exhaustive preparation seemed necessary Monday  as some of the protesters  many wearing hooded sweatshirts like the one Martin was wearing the night of his death  began trading their protest signs for places in the shade as the late morning sun crept higher and hotter  There was no chanting  no apparent rancor  There seemed to be just as many members of the media present as there were protestors  But the surprisingly sparse crowd did little to dim the spirit of those who d trekked from across the country or from across town to be here   I said I would be here for the start of the trial and I made it  said Sherman  who used four days of vacation from her job with AT T   I m here to support Trayvon Martin and his family  It s not just his family that was hurt by this  We ve all spent a year and a half being mad  being sad and being angry  I m here for justice  Cephus Johnson  the uncle of Oscar Grant  22  who was shot and killed by a Bay Area transit officer on New Year s Day in 2009  said he made the trek from Oakland to carry the spirit of all the young  unarmed black and brown men killed by law enforcement  security guards and others each year   When we heard about Trayvon it hit us hard  It was painful  gut wrenching  and we knew exactly what his family was going through  said Johnson   We couldn t have made it without the support of the community  coming to court with us  helping us to get through the process  So that s why we re here  Grant s killing was captured on video which later went viral  It renewed debate over the treatment of black men by law enforcement   It s a group that none of us want to be a part of  said Johnson  of the families of gun violence   but we have to stand together  An award winning film   Fruitvale Station  depicting the life and death of Oscar Grant  is scheduled to be released in theaters in July  The officer who killed Grant was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to two years in prison  but served less than a year because of time served in jail while he awaited trial  Over the course of the next week or more  some 500 prospective jurors will file into the county court here in Sanford  That number will be whittled down to six jurors and several  alternates  The jurors will remain anonymous and will be asked a litany of questions by the judge  defense attorneys and the prosecution most likely about what they know about the case  how they feel about race  guns and marijuana  among other things  The trial could last six weeks  Ultimately  the jury will have to determine Zimmerman s guilt or innocence  was his shooting of the unarmed teenager legal self defense or second degree murder  Noche Diaz has already made up his own mind   Trayvon Martin is not on trial here  said Diaz   If we don t get justice  if Zimmerman is not found guilty  vigilantes out there will think vigilantism is free and the courts will have your back  There was no visible presence of Zimmerman supporters outside of court today  but Robert Zimmerman  George Zimmerman s brother  who has been one of his most vocal defenders  held an impromptu press conference during a court recess  He said that his family has received death threats and have few interactions with people outside of the family  Robert Zimmerman reiterated his brother s account of what happened just before Martin was killed  saying that Martin struck Zimmerman first  breaking his nose  He expressed faith in the justice system  and said that he believes his brother will ultimately be vindicated   We are very confident in the outcome of the case  he said   and we are confident that the state will not be able to meet its burden  Note  George Zimmerman has sued NBCUniversal for defamation  The company has strongly denied his allegations

lawmakers repealing the Affordable Care Act in 2017  By then  according to the Congressional Budget Office  25 million previously uninsured people will have gained coverage  The CBO projects that 24 million Americans will buy their insurance through the exchanges in 2017  and 12 million will benefit from the Medicaid expansion  Politically  taking health care away from 36 million people would be a hard sell   DWAT8002 I currently do not have healthcare coverage  I just started a new job that offers healthcare benefits  but I will not be able to sign up until April 1  Since the deadline to sign up for health insurance and avoid the tax penalty is March 31  will I have to pay the penalty fee even though I will have coverage on April 1  Geoffrey Cowley  No one who enrolls in a health plan by March 31 will face any penalties this year  even if the coverage takes a while to kick in  By waiting until April 1 to enroll  you would cross the three month threshold and incur a penalty for the part of the year you spent uninsured  details here  The penalty for going uninsured all year is  95  or 1  of your income if you make more than  95 000  The baseline fine for three uninsured months would be a fourth of that amount  or  23 75  If you want to save the money  maybe your employer will move up your start date by a day  Ademocrat My husband and I rarely have need for doctors but

why should we pay for something we have no need of  We paid so much less for the few times we did need a doctor as self pay patients  Please explain to me what is  affordable  for those of us that would rather keep our money instead of lining the pockets of these insurance monsters  Geoffrey Cowley  There s a difference between not needing something and not needing it at this moment  We require drivers to insure themselves because some will have accidents and the costs they can t cover will fall upon others  The argument for mandatory health coverage follows the same logic  Self pay may work well while you re healthy  but few of us could pay cash for the care we would receive when mortally injured or seriously ill  Since we re all likely to require serious care at some point  we owe it to each other to pay our share of the cost  Conservatives used to champion that idea  but something has eroded their sense of shared responsibility  As for affordability  health care is expensive and often wasteful  The health care law includes many provisions to make it more efficient and to help people who truly can t afford it  Fortunately for those who can afford coverage  health care costs are now rising more slowly than they have in decades  Tom Kruse via Facebook Dental health is health  Why wasn t dental insurance included in ACA  Geoffrey Cowley The health care law treats dental care as an essential health benefit for children and youth less than 19 years old  Any health plan offered to that age group will include dental coverage  but Obamacare makes dental coverage optional in adult health plans  Some offer it  some don t  and consumers can choose the level of coverage they want  There s no tax penalty for skipping dental coverage  but you re right that it s worth having  Untreated cavities and gum disease can foster everything from pregnancy complications to heart disease  KaitlynK For unknown reasons  many doctors are not accepting ACA exchange insurances  If this trend continues  can t the government compel physicians to accept these insurances so that Americans can continue to have access to affordable care  Geoffrey Cowley Doctors can refuse any form of payment they don t like  Many refuse Medicaid because of its traditionally low reimbursement rates  and some refuse all insurance to avoid being second guessed by claims adjusters  It s hard to imagine any doctor caring whether a patient s health plan was purchased through an insurance exchange  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act  those policies provide the same coverage as the policies people get through their jobs   LLeno22 My 88 year old mother has Medicare through her former employer  the state of Michigan  where she retired as a teacher 30 years ago  The prescription coverage thru Catamaran is horrible  only allowing for old generic meds which have not helped her issues with diabetes and neuropathy and they offer no therapeutic meds for dementia  Can the ACA help my mother or supplement her prescription coverage  Geoffrey Cowley It sounds like your mom is using Medicare Part D  the prescription drug plan that President George W  Bush signed into law in 2005  The program is administered by private insurers  through Medigap or Medicare Advantage plans  Different insurers charge different premiums and cover different collections of drugs  so you should shop around for the right plan  Medicare has an online plan finder you may find helpful  Under federal law  all Medicare Part D plans must provide a minimum level of coverage  The law also limits the deductibles and copays insurers can impose  This year s maximum deductible will be  310  down from  325 in 2013  and copays will be capped at  2 850  down from  2 970  in 2013  The Affordable Care Act doesn t restructure Medicare Part D  but it does close a big gap in coverage  Because of a quirk in the 2005 law  Part D benefits fall off sharply after a subscriber s total drug bills reach a certain threshold  2 970 last year  and resume only after the subscriber crosses a  catastrophic  threshold  4 750 last year  For more details on this  doughnut hole  see this fact sheet from the AARP  The Affordable Care Act is slowly closing the hole  both by shifting its boundaries  to  2 850 and  4 550 this year  and by helping people pay for their medications while they pass through it  Last year  between federal subsidies and drug company discounts  people in the doughnut hole paid 48  of the retail price for brand name drugs and 79  of retail for cheaper generics  Obamacare ensures that by 2020  no one in the gap will pay more than 25  of a drug s retail price  AltaAndy sent via email In your recent article on Arkansas  approach to Medicaid expansion  A red state breakthrough on health care reform  you mention a graduate student who  earns too little to qualify for a discount on private health insurance  I don t get that  Are you saying he has to earn MORE to qualify for help  Geoffrey Cowley Yes  it s strange but true  Here s the back story  As signed into law four years ago  the Affordable Care Act extended Medicaid coverage to everyone living below 138  of the federal poverty level  roughly  16 100 a year for a single adult and it used tax credits to help people with moderate incomes buy private insurance through the new health insurance exchanges Those subsidies are available to anyone earning 100  to 400  of the federal poverty wage  11 670 to  46 680 for a single adult  Just about everyone would have been covered if that formula had stuck  But two years ago  the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out of the Medicaid expansion  and 23 of them have done just that  If Arkansas had turned down its Medicaid expansion funds  that grad student would be out of luck  His  9 000 a year internship would make him too rich for traditional Medicaid  he would have to earn less than  2 000 a year to qualify for that  But his  9 000 salary would make him too poor for a marketplace subsidy  Some 5 million low income people have fallen into that coverage gap in the Medicaid refusal states  Congress could fill the gap by lowering the floor for marketplace subsidies  but no one expects that to happen as long as the GOP controls the House of Representatives  SocialmedicToo I would like to know why crippling student loan debt is not taken into account when figuring how much a person is able to pay  Student loan debt payments are not exactly optional or dischargeable through bankruptcy and do rob the individual of discretionary income  Geoffrey Cowley Means testing is generally based on your income and assets  not your obligations  Without that distinction  anyone even the rich could qualify for benefits by loading up on debt  People living on fixed assets sometimes opt into Medicaid by paying down debts until they they re poor enough to pass the means test  As you point out  the monthly payment on a student loan can have the same effect  Unfortunately  social programs just aren t set up to take that into account  Here s the upside  The ACA subsidizes health coverage for anyone earning between 100  and 400  of the federal poverty wage  11 490 to  45 960 for an individual  and the biggest subsidies go to those with the lowest incomes  If a student loan payment is taking a significant chunk out of your paycheck  chances are you fall into that range  To learn more  check out this primer on eligibility and this guide to checking your own status   cjkid1964 Section 18115 of the Affordable Care Act is titled  Freedom not to participate in Federal health insurance programs  Can you tell me more about this  Geoffrey Cowley Sure  this section simply tells insurers that they don t have to sell their plans through the exchanges or take part in other Obamacare programs  Here s the full text  No individual  company  business  nonprofit entity  or health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall be required to participate in any Federal health insurance program created under this Act  or any amendments made by this Act  or in any Federal health insurance program expanded by this Act  or any such amendments  and there shall be no penalty or fine imposed upon any such issuer for choosing not to participate in such programs  Mathies Gorm Jensen As the ACA goes forward and becomes  as Mr  Boehner has called it  the law of the land  my question concerns the projects that individual states will start running in 2017  Do you feel these may lead to more states running single payer systems if  for instance  Vermont is successful  We have seen how other states are jumping in on legal marijuana after Colorado was successful with it  Do you feel a similar parallel could be drawn to health care  Thank you  Geoffrey Cowley I suspect legal weed will prove more popular than single payer health care  at least in the short term  But yes  states are exploring a lot of interesting variations on Obamacare  So far  only 10 have embraced all three of the law s main provisions  state run exchanges  and Medicaid expansion and insurance industry reforms  But nearly all states have embraced parts of the law and several are using Obamacare funds to pursue novel approaches to health care reform  Arkansas and Vermont are both good examples  Last year  the feds approved Arkansas  bid to spend its Medicaid expansion funds on commercial insurance policies rather than government benefits  As a result  nearly 100 000 poor Arkansans now enjoy the same coverage as other private consumers  and 150 000 are still eligible  Vermont is pursuing the opposite tack hoping to pool private  state and federal resources to create its own single payer system  To succeed  the state would have to reallocate all of its federal health funds  not just those earmarked for Medicaid expansion  The feds can t legally approve that request before 2017  and some experts even those who favor a single payer solution doubt the experiment will work at the state level  But all of these experiments will hold valuable lessons for the rest of the country  And like Romneycare  the successful ones are likely to spread  Fred Orth What is going to happen to medical facilities in states that do not accept Medicaid expansion  I understand that federal payments will be reduced to reflect the compensation they would have received if their states had expanded coverage  What will the ensuing cost shift mean to charges for those insured outside of ACA  Geoffrey Cowley Hospitals could suffer huge losses in states that refuse to expand Medicaid  because they re the provider of last resort for people who lack health insurance  Under a 1986 law called EMTALA  hospitals that receive federal funding have to attend to dangerously sick or injured patients regardless of their ability to pay  Hospitals have traditionally recouped their losses from  uncompensated care  by shifting the cost onto paying patients and by drawing on a federal account called DSH  which provides partial reimbursement  It s more efficient to give people routine care than to rescue them from medical crises  so the Affordable Care Act moves money out of the DSH program and uses it to help states expand their Medicaid programs  In states that refuse to expand Medicaid  uninsured people will continue to rack up unpaid hospital bills  but the hospitals will stop getting DSH payments from the feds  That s one reason the hospital industry is pleading with recalcitrant states  e g  Florida  Georgia and Texas  to stop boycotting the Medicaid expansion    ,02/21/14 10:58 AM,drugs

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/marijuana-scare-stories-legalization, Coverage of marijuana legalization in Colorado has often focused on rare  genuinely tragic occurrences involving overuse of the drug  But  Reefer Madness style stories coming out of Colorado won t tell us much about whether or not legalizing marijuana was a good idea   I think we ve learned very little so far from Colorado  said Mark Kleiman  a professor of public policy at UCLA who advised Washington State in developing its legal marijuana policy   There will be bad things coming out of legalization  but they re not going to happen quickly   Americans use marijuana billions of times a year  and there s very few stories like this  Keith Humphreys  Stanford University School of Medicine There s little data so far to suggest that marijuana legalization has led to serious public safety problems  Despite the proliferation of terrifying anecdotes publicized by anti legalization advocates  crime has actually dropped in Colorado since legalization  One of these stories is that of Richard Kirk  who killed his wife after possibly ingesting marijuana and prescription pain pills  Some reporting has actually omitted the pills  the interaction of the two could have contributed to the incident   leaving readers with the impression that consuming a marijuana candy bar alone may have caused the psychotic episode that led Kirk to retrieve a gun and shoot his wife Police took a blood test  but the results may not be revealed until Kirk s case goes to court  so we won t know for a while what role drugs may have played   These are all multi determined events  We know that because they re rare   if they were simply determined they d be happening more often  said Keith Humphreys  a professor of psychiatry and behavioral medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine In the aggregate  Americans use marijuana billions of times a year  and there s very few stories like this If marijuana had this effect in a prevalent fashion  these things would have been happening for years and years and years  Also prevalent has been the sad story of Levy Thamba Pongi  a 19 year old college student in Wyoming who came to Colorado and leaped off a hotel balcony after eating a marijuana cookie that  according to police documents  contained six and a half servings of THC  the compound in marijuana that leads to intoxication  The coroner concluded that marijuana intoxication was a  significant contributing factor  in Pongi s death  But these are not typical experiences  According to Humphreys  it s  highly unusual  for people  without steady use and without a tendency toward psychosis to become psychotic from using marijuana  though he said he could not comment on any specific incident  Then there s the question of overuse  New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote Tuesday of a trip to Colorado where she had a bad experience after eating a marijuana laced candy bar that left her  curled up in a hallucinatory state for the next eight hours  Kirk and Pongi are both mentioned in the column  Yet the risks of marijuana intoxication pale in comparison to the number of deaths attributable to alcohol  which Dowd describes as her own drug of choice  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention there are around 88 000 deaths related to alcohol overuse every year about 7 500 of which are the result of falls  Kleiman estimates that alcohol related falls may account for as many as two deaths per week in Colorado alone  But Dowd s column wasn t about the risks of legal alcohol  And since there are no highly motivated groups fighting for the prohibition of alcohol  they re not likely to make news  Still  Dowd s column deals with a genuine issue   unlike with smoking  people can have a hard time understanding how much THC they re taking in when they consume marijuana edibles  People consuming edibles sometimes believe they re not getting high because of a delayed reaction  and then end up much more intoxicated than they intended   a problem of which Colorado state officials are well aware  But no one would be surprised if you told them a story about someone getting in trouble after drinking an entire handle of bourbon  either  And unlike with bourbon  there s never been a documented case of someone overdosing on marijuana   There s clearly an edibles problem  meaning that Maureen Dowd is not the only idiot in the world  said Kleiman   Eating is dangerous because it s harder to control the dose  Under legality that problem should go away  because the dose is on the product  You should be able to take just the right amount  just like a drinker knows how many drinks they want to drink   Eating is dangerous because it s harder to control the dose  You should be able to take just the right amount  just like a drinker knows how many drinks they want to drink  Mark Kleiman  professor of public policy at UCLA No one is proposing we go back to the days of Prohibition  despite the fact that people often become reckless or violent when they abuse alcohol The evidence suggests that they re more likely to do so under the influence of alcohol than marijuana  But as Rolling Stone s Bruce Barcott notes   Legalization rides on the growing belief that marijuana should be treated like alcohol  not like heroin or cocaine  The perception that marijuana  independent of other factors  can turn any teenager suicidal or any husband homicidal  would alter that belief  which is why anti legalization advocates are focusing on stories like Kirk s or Pongi s  There may be greater problems with marijuana legalization down the line   particularly as the marijuana industry s political ambitions rise with their profits  But the rare scary story from Colorado or Washington doesn t tell us much about whether or not legalization is working   So far there s nothing coming out of Colorado that says they made a mistake  Kleiman

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/marijuana-legalization-elites, Colorado rang in 2014 by becoming the first state to sell marijuana to its residents for recreational use  Along with Washington  Colorado legalized recreational marijuana use by state referendum in the 2012 election  Despite the fact that marijuana use is still illegal under federal law  the feds have decided to allow these two states to experiment with legalized marijuana as long as they follow certain guidelines  Along with the usual barrage of tired stoner jokes  there has been some handwringing over the possible consequences of legalized pot use  Among them  the potential health risks  the possibility of more marijuana users  and  in particular  increased use among children  But rarely do those concerned about the consequences of legalized marijuana confront the consequences of our current marijuana prohibition regime  under which some groups of Americans are swiftly labeled criminals and set on a path of being marginalized by society for what the elite and well off usually end up recalling as foolish but ultimately harmless experimentiation with drugs  Consider that at least the last three American presidents  Bill Clinton  George W  Bush  and Barack Obama  have all more or less admitted to smoking weed  Bush s former budget director and former Indiana Gov  Mitch Daniels  was arrested for possession of marijuana and other drugs while a student at Princeton  On Friday  two major newspaper columnists  Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post and David Brooks of the New York Times  admitted to using marijuana  Yet just as all three of the above presidents presided over a criminal justice system that imposes harsh punishments for marijuana use  Marcus and Brooks argue against Colorado and Washington s marijuana initiatives  on the basis that marijuana is bad for you  The real question with marijuana legalization  however  is not whether it s not healthy to consume  but whether our current system of prohibition makes things worse  Excessive consumption of alcohol is not healthy  either  but after more than a decade of banning alcohol  Americans decided the collateral consequences of prohibition were far worse than the consequences of letting people have a drink  Presumably  Brooks and Marcus don t think of themselves as criminals who should have gone to jail for their drug use  any more than our three past presidents  Marcus all but acknowledges as much  saying that  t hrowing people in jail for smoking pot is dumb and wasteful  But that s what marijuana being illegal means in most states and under federal law  It means people go to jail   It almost never means  however  that people like Brooks and Marcus go to jail  Anyone who wants to see what a de facto legalization environment looks like can visit an elite college campus  where both the trade and use of marijuana are highly visible  and where those who get caught face the relatively minor sanctions associated with breaking campus rules rather than the lifelong consequences of breaking the law  What we basically have now is a system where marijuana is practically legal for the wealthy and white and illegal for everyone else  Although marijuana use among blacks and whites is about the same  according to a 2013 report by the ACLU  blacks are almost four times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession  This startling graph from the report tells the story  According to the report  there were more than 8 million marijuana related arrests between 2001 and 2010  almost 90  of which were for possession  Marijuana arrests now make up more than half of all drug arrests in the country  And use of the drug has only increased over time  As Michelle Alexander notes in her book  The New Jim Crow  the consequences of being convicted of felony marijuana possession can be far more dire than the sentence itself  Former offenders can find themselves deprived of professional or driver s licenses  educational aid  food stamps  public housing  their right to vote  and they may find themselves fired and unable to find new employment  having been marked by society as little more than a criminal  For blacks caught up in the system it can compound the already considerable effects of ongoing racial discrimination  Yet with their own acknowledged marijuana use our current and former presidents  as well as our well respected newspaper columnists  are implicitly acknowledging that mere marijuana use does not make you a criminal who should be driven from society and made a pariah  it does not consign you to fate as an addlepated dunce or violent sociopath incapable of holding a job or raising a family  Would that the worst consequence for marijuana use was something resembling Brooks  recollection of a botched attempt to deliver a presentation in English class while stoned  Legalization means that other people  not just elites and their children  can have the opportunity to shrug off past drug use as a youthful dalliance rather than a life sentence  There are degrees of decriminalization between marijuana prohibition and legalization and people can argue how far the government should go  What s clear is that under the current system  the wealthy and connected are almost entirely shielded from the consequences of marijuana being illegal  while the poor and non white face catastrophe for engaging in the same behavior  Brooks writes that legalizing marijuana means  nurturing a moral ecology in which it is a bit harder to be the sort of person most of us want to be  The current system already can make it not a bit harder  but insurmountably hard to become the sort of person most of us want to be  But not for Brooks or Marcus  not for any of our recent presidents  and probably not for their children  Poll  Legalize it  Close video       The Cycle  1 3 14  4 23 PM ET       Not everyone is stoked about legal pot       Two

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/feds-will-let-states-experiment-pot%E2%80%94, The U S  will allow states to continue their experiments with legalized marijuana as long as they enact  strict regulatory schemes  that adhere to federal priorities such as keeping the drug out of the hands of kids  the Justice Department said Thursday  The Obama administration s new stance does not change the federal classification of marijuana as an illegal drug but does free up the nearly two dozen states that have recently made small amounts of marijuana legal for medicinal purposes  or  in Washington and Colorado  for recreational purposes to move forward with their local laws   These schemes must be tough in practice  not just on paper  and include strong  state based enforcement efforts  backed by adequate funding  Deputy Attorney General James Cole wrote in a memo to US Attorneys   I f any of the stated harms do materialize either despite a strict regulatory scheme or because of the lack of one federal prosecutors will act aggressively to bring individual prosecutions focused on federal enforcement priorities and the Department may challenge the regulatory scheme themselves in these states  The memo provides guidance for federal prosecutors  setting eight specific enforcement priorities for them to follow  which double as  harms  states need to avoid if the wish to prevent federal interference with state marijuana laws  While those priorities apply to US attorneys nationwide  they will have the biggest impact in states where some form of marijuana production and use is legal under state law  Earlier this month  Attorney General Eric Holder said that that federal prosecutors would stop seeking harsh mandatory minimum sentences for low level drug crimes  a policy which helped put record numbers of people behind bars  Eighteen states and the District of Columbia now allow some distribution of marijuana  mostly for medical reasons  Washington and Colorado became the first states to legalize recreational marijuana use in referendums last November  setting up a conflict with federal law which still prohibits marijuana use  The Justice Department s memo ostensibly sets that conflict aside for now  by stating that the feds will not challenge those laws in court  If the results of legalized recreational marijuana use in Washington and Colorado are seen as positive  other states could follow suit  In the past  however  federal prosecutors have taken a hard line on legalized pot use even as Obama administration officials publicly insisted otherwise  In order to forestall federal interference with state marijuana laws  Cole s memo says states must work hard to prevent   the distribution of marijuana to minors   revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises  gangs and cartels   the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states   state authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity   violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana   drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use   growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands   preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property  Legalized marijuana could ultimately have a significant impact on the number of people coming in contact with the criminal justice system  A 2013 report from the American Civil Liberties Union found that marijuana possession arrests account for nearly half  46  of all drug arrests  and that  on average  a black person is 3 73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white person  even though blacks and whites use marijuana at similar rates  ,08/29/13 03:34 PM,drugs
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/what-real-drug-law-reform-would-look, The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing this week to discuss an emerging tension in marijuana policy  Washington and Colorado have legalized small amounts of marijuana and 20 other states have legalized it for medical use  These policies put the federal government into something of a quandary  since marijuana is illegal for any use under federal law  should the feds enforce its laws in these states  The federal government has devised a temporary solution that skirts the problem and could create a series of new ones  Last month  the Department of Justice released new guidelines on marijuana prosecutions  The essential message was that federal prosecutors should not interfere with state marijuana laws  Prosecutions should be reserved for those who sell marijuana to minors  use state laws as a cover for illegal drug sales  or as a means to distribute marijuana in states where it remains illegal  Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy was unambiguous about his support   The absolute criminalization of personal marijuana use has contributed to our nation s soaring prison population and has disproportionately affected people of color  said the Vermont Democrat  But soon there were questions about whether marijuana television commercials would run in Colorado  or if there was a plot to addict the nation s kids to harder drugs through pot laced gummy bears  While drug legalization advocates are hailing the new guidelines as  the most heartening news to come out of Washington in a long  long time  many are skeptical  The Judiciary Committee s ranking Republican  Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa  condemned Colorado s approach and the Justice Department s new policy  He asked Deputy Attorney General James Cole  who wrote the guidelines   Why has the Justice Department decided to trust Colorado  Colorado has become a significant exporter of marijuana  But there is reason even for drug reform advocates to be wary  the new approach will do little to mitigate the failed  war on drugs  and it puts the Justice Department in an untenable position  First  the change in the Justice Department s stance is only advisory  The directive to the nation s U S  Attorneys can easily be reversed by Cole s successor  This is not an actual change to the federal drug laws  The federal government will continue to prosecute drug crimes  which trigger harsh mandatory minimum sentences  These overly punitive sentences have led to almost half the federal prison population locked up for drug convictions  Second  because of the preemption doctrine  in which federal law displaces contradictory state law  prosecutors are opting not to enforce laws they are sworn to uphold  That may be laudable when it comes to marijuana but would not be so praiseworthy if the issue were  for example  voting rights  Grassley understood this when he said it was  disastrous  that the Justice Department was  giving the green light to states that decide to ignore laws they don t like  Criminal justice reform advocates should not be diverted by this recent shift  To create genuine and lasting progress  federal drug laws must be completely revamped  Congress should remove harsh mandatory minimums for drug crimes or remove crimes like possession of marijuana from the list of jail able crimes  Better yet  it should commission and evaluate public health data on whether marijuana actually should be classified as a  dangerous  drug and if it isn t  Congress should rethink criminalizing and punishing it so harshly  In this way  the federal government can lead the nation toward a sane criminal justice system one that protects the public from the serious safety threats and prosecutes and incarcerates only when absolutely necessary  ,09/14/13 08:45 AM,drugs

Republican Voter ID laws  Wall Street prosecutions and the Obama administration s efforts to reform the War on Drugs with more rehabilitation programs   See video below  On the NSA findings  Holder said he hadn t read the new report from the government s privacy and civil liberties board  but noted that  at least 15 judges on about 35 occasions have said that the program itself is legal  RELATED Snowden   No way I can come home  When asked about judges who disagree  including a Washington federal court that rebuked the bulk data collection last month  Holder  himself a former Washington judge  contended the legal consensus is now clear   I think that those other judges  those 15 judges  got it right  Holder said  The Obama administration s recent  modifications  to the NSA program addressed any outstanding legal issues  Holder added  and he is now focused on working with James Clapper  the National Intelligence Director  on a harder policy question for surveillance today

Rights Act  He credited a bipartisan bill  introduced last week by Rep  John Lewis  a Democrat  and Republican Jim Sensenbrenner for going a  long way  towards addressing the Supreme Court s ruling against the law last June  However  Holder said the bill should patrol voter ID laws more assertively   If we can show that that photo ID efforts are done inappropriately and for improper reasons  Holder said   that ought to be the basis for federal intervention  The bill only counts voter ID violations found by a court   not violations filed by the Justice Department   to trigger supervision of local voting rules  That s a less stringent approach than the original Voting Rights Act of 1965  and it relies less on the Attorney General s judgment than the original law  Close video       The

Rights Act bill should target voter ID issues and    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss Holder had strong words for Republicans who use voter ID laws to suppress or distort voter turnout   People have to understand that we are not opposed to photo identification in a vacuum  he said  but it must not be used  to disenfranchise  people for racial or  partisan reasons  While some GOP lawmakers may have a  good faith  concern here  Holder said  others are disingenuously  using it for partisan advantage   The reality is that all the studies show that this whole question of ballot integrity  in person voter fraud   simply does not exist  he stressed  Given all the data  Holder contended  Republicans  fixation on voter ID suggests  a remedy in search of a problem   It is being used  in too many instances  he continued   to depress the vote of particular groups of people who are not supportive of the party that is advancing these photo ID measures  The attorney general said he d like to talk with Congress about legislative  language  to ensure the bill prevents any misuse of ID requirements   I would like to work with members of Congress  he pledged   to make this bill as strong as we possibly can make it  Too big to indict  Turning to the Justice department s Wall Street record  Holder rejected the criticism that prosecutors go easy on large companies based on their power or economic position   There are no institutions that are too big to indict  he said   We have brought charges against thousands of people over the course of these last four and a half years  Federal prosecutors have certainly racked up record breaking fines against some major financial companies  but most financial executives have avoid any jail time  and many companies pay fines without admitting any wrongdoing   One exception is insider trading cases  Holder cited the JP Morgan investigation as an example of strong oversight  noting that prosecutors reached a tentative  13 billion settlement   without letting the bank off the hook   Significantly   the settlement  did not include a resolution of the criminal investigation that is ongoing  Holder said   and could result in charges against either the institution or individuals  involved in misconduct  Yet Holder also pushed back on the idea that these cases can be easily judged from afar   People say these things without having the ability to look at the files that we have  Holder noted   We have certain responsibilities to only bring those cases that we think we have an ability to prove beyond a reasonable doubt  he said  And he suggested that some results may just be a matter of time   I think people need to just be a little patient  I know it s been a while  he said   but we have other things that are in the pipeline   We have ongoing investigations that I m really not at liberty to talk about  but involve significant financial institutions  Holder continued   and the focus of those investigations is not only on the institutions but on individuals as well    While relatively few people tied to the financial crisis are in jail  Holder believes too many drug users are incarcerated under outdated and ineffective laws   a core focus of his agenda during Obama s second term  Close video       The Cycle  1 24 14  3 41 PM ET       Atty  Gen  Eric Holder goes one on one with Ari Melber       In an

that prioritizes rehabilitation  instead of jail  for selected veterans battling substance abuse  It is only the second such federal court in the nation  Holder is calling for more through his  smart on crime  initiative  Speaking at the court  as several successful graduates of the program looked on  Holder said court mandated rehabilitation can break the  cycle of crime and incarceration  Holder believes providing that service  and that second chance  is essential for veterans   We owe them in the most profound of ways  he said  Holder also used the visit to endorse legislation to reduce disparities in drug sentencing  the Smarter Sentencing Act  The bill  sponsored by tea party favorite Sen  Mike Lee and Democratic Majority Whip Dick Durbin  has drawn attention for its bipartisan approach to reforming the war on drugs  A related proposal has the backing of Senators Rand Paul and Pat Leahy  Reflecting on his tenure  including one of the longest stints as attorney general in the modern era  Holder said he hopes these reforms set a new standard  A  smart  legacy  I would hope that one of the things that people look back on and say that we got right was to do things in a different way  he said   not to reflexively say that we were simply  tough on crime  but  as we use the phrase  to be smart on crime  In that vein  Holder touched on the widely documented racial disparities in criminal sentencing   This mass incarceration happens with a cost  he said   If you look at the way it impacts certain communities  Holder continued   let s be honest about this  communities of color   where young men who should be the future of these communities are taken out  labeled  and prevented from pursuing life as  productive citizens    they often bear the brunt of tough sentences   People have to be held accountable for individual decisions that they make  Holder stressed   but we need to have proportionate penalties  and the chance for people to rehabilitate after making a mistake  He pointed to the excess of mandatory minimums in the War on Drugs  a practice he reformed last August   I think we have a moment in time now where Congress  as well as those of us in the executive branch   may  pull back just a bit  He continued   I hope that will be a part of my legacy  Watch Part I of Ari Melber s msnbc interview with Eric Holder  on Edward Snowden  Gov

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/after-the-shots-ring-out-regrets-and-redempt,  Bam  Bam  Bam  Demetrius Harris remembers hearing just before his legs failed him and he was thrown to the ground   Bam  Bam  More shots rang out   Bam  Bam  Bam  Harris winced and squeezed an imaginary trigger as he reenacted each blast   I tried to run but one of the bullets crashed through the car window and hit my spine  said Harris  a former drug dealer on Chicago s South Side   Something said get up  When I tried to get up my lower half just slumped  Joel Irizarry  a one time gang member on the northwest side  remembers the moment he was shot with just as much clarity  He said he watched his shooter pull out a pistol  raise it and fire a single shot   The bullet went through the backseat and hit me dead in the spine  said Irizarry  who was 17 when he was shot   As soon as it hit me I was instantly paralyzed  Both men were caught in Chicago s violent gun culture when they were wounded  In Cook County Hospital alone  doctors treated more than 1 000 people for gunshot wounds in the last year  Like so many other Chicagoans wounded by gunfire each year  Irizarry and Harris survived  but suffered catastrophic physical injury  Officials in some of the city s hospitals and trauma centers say that while accurate statistics are difficult to come by  they are seeing more patients suffering from spinal cord injuries associated with gun violence  a haunting uptick that seems to be trending with the city s rising homicide rate  They say the rise in such injuries comes after steady declines from the bad old days of the early 1990s when the boon in crack cocaine fueled a record level of shootings and killings  The gnarled spines and shattered limbs are the most direct correlative  aside from the mounting dead  of a city seemingly consumed by relentlessly whizzing bullets and bloodshed  Across Chicago  in hospitals and rehab centers and among a growing  loosely affiliated network of survivors many of whom have been paralyzed by gunfire the physical and emotional remnants of violence are all too present  Disfigurement  disability and  oftentimes  shame   I knew at some point it was going to happen  said Harris  33  who was shot in 2003 and  left paralyzed from the waist down   I knew at some point I was going to go to jail I knew at some point I was probably going to get shot  I just didn t know that when the bullet hit me it would tear my spinal cord up and I would be confined to a chair for the rest of my life  Among this unfortunate club of hobbled survivors  there is a growing camaraderie  Harris and Irizarry are part of an anti violence program called In My Shoes  a peer led curriculum funded by Schwab Rehabilitation Hospital that speaks mostly with youth about the consequences of gang and drug involvement  Peer leaders of In My Shoes say the program is part practicum on how to be independent after suffering a spinal cord injury  and part therapy and rehab group  Mostly  they re a group of cautionary storytellers  The program s staff is made up almost entirely of people who have been paralyzed as a result of gun violence   Seeing a young person get shot and end up with a disability  that to me is one of the most heart wrenching things  because a lot of times they are so young  12  13  14 years old  said Irizarry   These are babies  They haven t begun to live yet  And now they have to live the rest of their life with a disability is very  very disheartening  But we let them know that life isn t over  Victims of our own circumstance On a recent afternoon Harris and Irizarry rolled their wheelchairs down the corridors of Schwab  on Chicago s West Side  chatting with passersby and trading smiles and handshakes with random staff who whisked through the center s main lobby  Far from their former street life  they spend countless hours in hospitals regaling those who will listen with their war stories  They talk in painful detail of the burn of a bullet cutting through their flesh  and the moment they realized that they would never walk again  But they also talk about the role they played in their own  tragic misfortune   At the end of the day we re all victims victims of our own circumstances  Irizarry said   A lot of times young people only hear about death or jail  They don t hear about the disability  They don t know that this  he said motioning to the wheelchair he was sitting in   is an option  When someone is newly injured there is also grief  denial  regret and figuring out how to navigate the physical space around them while in a hulking wheelchair under unsteady hands  The group pairs those who were shot with mentors with similar disabilities  They set personal goals  Help people get back into school  They teach them how to plan out their every trip outside of home  Schools and buildings without wheelchair ramps and un shoveled sidewalks are the bane of a wheelchair bound person s life  especially during the brutal Chicago winters  Irizarry and Harris say  With equal parts clarity and candor  Irizarry and Harris drum up the ghosts of their pasts and the violent episodes that led to their injuries   Being a gangster isn t something that you do  It s a result of what happens to you  Harris said   Nobody wakes up at eight and says I m  going to be a gangster   You react to the lifestyle that you re put in and the situations that mold you and it makes you hard  and it makes you cold  it makes you callous and have no compassion  The night that Harris was shot  he says his killer squeezed off as many as eight shots before his gun jammed  As he lay there  he said he turned to look his killer in the face  but instead saw his legs kicking uncontrollably even though he couldn t feel a thing from his waist to his toes   I know I m not crippled  he pleaded to himself   I know I m not paralyzed  Long before those first shots rang out  Harris said he had a bad feeling about how the night might end  It was about 8 p m  on a spring evening in 2003  and Harris  who said he d traded education and legal jobs for a hustler s life  set out on his neighborhood s main strip to make a couple dollars selling drugs  Harris said he had a bad feeling about going out that night  but the prospect of getting paid clouded his instincts  Earlier in the day there was an informal meeting with his crew  And one of its leaders warned everyone to stay off the block that night  that there d been too much shooting and too much attention from the police  Harris said he saw the warning as an opportunity  if the entire clique was staying low key  that meant more customers and more money for him   He kept saying  I got a real bad feeling  Harris recalled   While he s telling us all this as a group  I m sitting there thinking that if he wants everybody to stay in the house  I d be able to make a killing  a bigger profit  Later that night  Harris hit the strip and almost immediately ran into a local flower peddler known in the neighborhood as  Flower Man  standing in the doorway of a bar  He was looking to buy some marijuana and crack cocaine  The weed Harris had on him  The crack was in his car  which was parked down the block  After handing Flower Man the weed  he made his way down the street to his car to retrieve the cocaine  He reached for the car door handle then heard gunfire  The impact of the bullets tossed him to the ground  Harris said he turned to look at his legs and they were still kicking   I couldn t stop them  Harris said  He tried to get up  but couldn t  Harris suffered a gunshot wound to his T7 vertebra  A nurse would later break the news to his family that he d never walk again   They were in denial for a long time  he said  Some of them still are  But Harris isn t   When you 13 and 14 you might convince yourself that you Superman  but when you 23 and you ve been to over 20 funerals you don t believe in Superman or bulletproof  Harris said  Harris said he has buried at least 10 close friends killed by gun violence in the 10 years since he was paralyzed  He rattled off a list of names  Gary Pinex  Keith Daniels  Rally Prichard  Paris Mercer  All dead   I m just lucky to be alive  I ve seen people way tougher than me  way stronger than me  lying dead in the streets  Harris said   I ve seen death  I ve lost count of how many times I ve seen death  Gang Banging at 15 By the time Irizarry was in his mid teens he was living a double life  At home he was a protective big brother and a loving son to his single mother  But in the streets of his West Humboldt Park neighborhood  he was something else entirely   I started gang banging at an early age  about 15  Irizarry said   I couldn t get to school  I couldn t get to work or go the local grocery store without being chased  harassed  beat up  There s only so much you can take of being a victim  I felt my only option is to join this gang and get this little protection that they claim to give you  For Irizarry  then a tall  skinny kid all of  135 pounds soaking wet  the odds of surviving on his own weren t worth taking  One gang controlled his high school  Another controlled his neighborhood  Shooting and fighting were everyday occurrences  But even as he became a more active  combative member of his gang and started selling drugs to  keep some money in my pocket  the two realities he was living were becoming starker  His mother and father had separated  so he was the man of the house  He did his best to keep his little brother and sister in line while his mother worked long hours at a local retailer  Irizarry said he even managed to keep up decent grades in high school  and as the end of his senior year approached he was excited about becoming the first in his family to earn a high school diploma  Then  on a sunny afternoon in the Spring of 1998  it all came to an end   He pulled out a pistol and shot just once  Irizarry said  Irizarry said he was targeted by a rival gang member who d seen him pull up to a neighborhood park  along with a friend whom he d had beef with from an earlier fight  First he threw bottles and bricks  Then  as Irizarry peeled away from the park  the young man whipped out a gun and fired  The bullet crashed through the back of the car and directly into Irizarry s spine  He knew immediately that he d been hit  Unable to move his legs  he said his foot smashed down on the accelerator  sending his car careening down the street  He finally managed to throw the car into neutral to slow it down  at which point his  so called friend  and fellow gang member hopped out of the car and left Irizarry  his younger brother and a cousin in the car to fend for themselves   He left me for dead  Irizarry said   I kept praying  asking God not to let me die like this  Days later at the hospital he asked a doctor   When am I going to walk out of this hospital   You re never going to walk again  the doctor told him   Instantly my world was shattered  Irizarry said   There were a lot of nights waking up and hoping that this was a nightmare  only to wake up and see a wheelchair parked next to my bed  When Irizarry finally made it back home from the hospital he experienced a mix of emotions  There was excitement to be finally leaving the hospital  frustration with his disability and fear of more violence  His shooter was a member of a rival gang in the neighborhood  Anything could happen  he thought  This time he d be a sitting duck   What we re confronting with the violently acquired injury  they re going home to where they were shot  said Dr  Michelle Gittler  a physiatrist and expert on violently acquired spinal cord injuries at Schwab   They are going right back to that community where their injuries occurred and that s one of the hardest issues  After the initial shock wore off  Irizarry made immediate plans to change his life  He distanced himself from his old gang  And his family uprooted to a nearby suburb  But the impact of his injury rippled through his family  He could no longer help out financially because he could no longer work  The  400 or so he received each month in Social Security Income did little to help buoy his families expenses  And he could no longer keep his younger siblings in check   My mom  having to see me in this situation and trying not to cry every day  it hurt  Irizarry said   Even though I was the oldest I was her baby  She was there when I first started to walk  and now I d never walk again  But his injury did something no nudging before it could ve done  he was off the streets  He went back to school and began to realize  in part through his rehab work at Schwab  that life was not over  After doing his rehab at the hospital he eventually was hired as a peer mentor with In My Shoes  One of the truest signs that he d moved on  he said  was when he came face to face with someone from the same gang that had shot him  The rival wasn t menacing this go round  He wasn t chasing him or pointing a pistol in his direction  This time  they were on the same team  He was from the neighborhood and was found shot one evening behind Irizarry s father s barbershop  The rumor was that his own gang had turned on him  The man was paralyzed from the waist down and seemed as affected mentally as he was physically  He was anxious and paranoid  He d been holed up in his home and refused to go out in public or take public transportation   He was always worried about who was around  that someone was always going to try to kill him  Irizarry said  But almost every day Irizarry called the guy or they d meet up to talk  Soon  Irizarry coaxed him into riding public transportation and then  back onto the social scene  The two developed a friendship and a bond  Eventually Irizarry landed him a job fixing wheelchairs at Schwab rehab   That other stuff to me was in the past  Irizarry said  noting though that he rarely shares his former gang affiliation   It could still be dangerous in certain neighborhoods  To this day  wounded gang members are rolled into Schwab  their tough exteriors softened by their disabilities  And Irizarry  Harris and the rest of the team initiate them into this new club  Some change their ways  Some don t  Harris and Irizarry say   Some people have been doing it so long it s hard for them to break out of it  Harris said   Some say they want a way out  others say they can t find a way out  But for us  after everything we lost  whatever we were going to get out of it wasn t going to be worth what we ve already lost  Some people have been doing this so long and are afraid of change  They just fall back to what they know  Previously in msnbc s ongoing look at Chicago gun violence

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/rethinking-the-war-drugs, Monday saw two major legal developments in the so called  war on drugs  First  a judge in New York City ruled that the police department s stop and frisk policy violated the Constitution in targeting a disproportionate number of blacks and Hispanics  Then  Attorney General Eric Holder announced the end of mandatory federal prison sentences for low level  non violent drug crimes Changes in these policies will come as a reprieve for the groups that are negatively affected by them the most  In Judge Shira Scheindlin s 198 page ruling on stop and frisk Monday  she noted that 80  of the 4 4 million times the tactic had been used between 2004 and 2012  the suspect was black or Hispanic The city s highest officials have turned a blind eye to the evidence that officers are conducting stops in a racially discriminatory manner  Scheindlin wrote  As for non violent  low level drug crimes  the data has long pointed to a racial bias  In the war on marijuana specifically  black Americans are four times as likely to be arrested for possession  according to a recent report by the ACLU  Nicholas Peart  one of the plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit that challenges the procedure as racially charged  wrote about his multiple experiences of being stopped and frisked in a New York Times op ed piece   These experiences changed the way I felt about the police  After the third incident I worried when police cars drove by  I was afraid I would be stopped and searched or that something worse would happen  I dress better if I go downtown  I don t hang out with friends outside my neighborhood in Harlem as much as I used to  Essentially  I incorporated into my daily life the sense that I might find myself up against a wall or on the ground with an officer s gun at my head  It s appropriate to single out marijuana arrests because they dwarf those of other drugs  According to a report released by the FBI  a marijuana related drug arrest happened every 42 seconds in the United States in 2011  totaling 750 000 arrests for the year  That number decreased by about half in 2012  but the 354 023 marijuana related arrests still trump cocaine s 36 001 and crystal meth s 3 898  Though marijuana is legal in Washington state and Colorado  it is still considered a Schedule I drug by the Justice Department  along with heroin and MDMA  This means that even in states where it is legal  for medical or recreational use  marijuana is subject to seizure by the Drug Enforcement Administration  and its legal users and sellers are subject to arrest  Just two weeks ago  DEA officials raided several medical marijuana dispensaries in Washington state  seizing thousands of dollars worth of the drug  Mandatory minimum sentences for drug related crimes marijuana possession in particular contribute disproportionately to the country s overcrowded prison system  As Eric Holder lamented in a speech to the American Bar Association Monday  these sentences   have had a destabilizing effect on particular communities  largely poor and of color    To counteract this trend  Holder has proposed a way to leave sentencing up to the judge in question s discretion  The disproportionate number of marijuana arrests  and the disproportionate number of black American men being arrested for marijuana possession  comes to head on the streets of New York City  In 2011  NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly issued a memorandum to his officers that prohibited them from arresting people with small amounts of marijuana  unless the drug was in public display  When someone is picked out for a stop and frisk  however  they often have to turn out their pockets  potentially forcing a display concealed marijuana and making them subject to arrest under the law   I would say as much as 40  of these cases stem from illegal searches  illegal stops of our clients  and the mischarging of our clients where clients are charged with the misdemeanor of possessing marijuana in public view where they only actually possessed it in their pocket Scott Levy of the Bronx Defenders told NPR early last year  coming off a 2011 of 50 700 arrests for low level marijuana possession  Given the racially biased numbers of stop and frisk program  it s no surprise that between 2002 and 2010  87  of those arrested for marijuana possession were black or Hispanic  In fact  the ratios are just about equal  In her ruling  Judge Scheindlin didn t dismantle the stop and frist program completely  but she did appoint a monitor to ensure that officers stop racial profiling  Attorney general Holder didn t decriminalize marijuana federally  but his actions will likely result in less incarceration and shorter prison terms for low level drug offenders  Both policy changes are moderate but meaningful steps toward the end of a racially biased and  wildly counterproductive war on drugs  Peart spoke with msnbc s Lawrence O Donnell to discuss how the police tactic was ruled  unconstitutional  Watch his interview below  ,08/13/13 12:24 AM,drugs

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/new-nj-battle-over-medical-marijuana, Sabina Rose Joana was 15 months old when she lost a battle to Dravet syndrome   Photo by Paula Joana There is a glimmer of hope for families of epileptic children across the country in the form of a marijuana oil  It could mean no more sleepless nights  no more emergency room visits  no more holding your breath while waiting for the next seizure to grip their child s body  But even as state lawmakers across the country pass legislation to allow the use of a marijuana extract to treat epilepsy in children  some families are discovering a new front to the fight  the battle to implement the laws in a timely manner  It s a battle Paula and Phil Joana know too well  The New Jersey couple lost their 15 month old daughter  Sabina Rose Joana  last December to a condition caused by Dravet syndrome  The Joanas were attempting to comply with New Jersey s medical marijuana laws a process that takes months between the required number of doctors to see and paperwork to complete  In order to become a registered patient with the medicinal marijuana program in New Jersey  one must be a resident of the state and must also be diagnosed with a  debilitating medical condition by a New Jersey physician registered with the medicinal marijuana program  Which is where things get complicated  in order to qualify in New Jersey  a patient must have a  bona fide relationship   defined by the State Department of Health as a doctor patient relationship existing for at least a year or for at least four visits with a doctor who is already registered with the program  If a patient s current doctor is not registered in the program  the family must find a new doctor a time consuming issue for children who are running out of time  Children like Sabina  who didn t have months or a year  and died while waiting for the treatment that may have helped her On Thursday  Paula Joana joined Hardball where she explained the struggle to treat her daughter   For pediatrics  you have to get a letter from your pediatrician  then you have to get a letter from a specialist so we got one from her neurologist  Then we had to see a psychiatrist to make sure we weren t exploiting her and her medical marijuana  Joana added   I don t understand anyone who wanted to smoke pot recreationally would go through all those hurdles just to smoke pot  Last November  a bill was put before New Jersey Gov  Chris Christie that would permit patients to receive medicinal marijuana from states with more developed medicine and less regulated programs  But Christie refused to sign it   See  this is what happens  Christie said at a Dec  2  2013 press conference where he infamously joked about  working  the cones  on the George Washington Bridge   Every time you sign one expansion  then the advocates will come back and ask for another one  Here s what the advocates want  They want legalization of marijuana in New Jersey  It will not happen on my watch  ever  I am done expanding the medical marijuana program under any circumstances  So we re done  On that same day  and in the same hour Christie gave those remarks  Sabina Rose took her last breath  READ MORE  The new faces of marijuana  I think the medical marijuana program in New Jersey is extremely broken  Joana said   Kids aren t getting what they need  the dispensaries are held up there s always a problem  Earlier this year  Joana described her attempts to reach out to Christie attempts that never succeeded He has ignored my many attempts to meet with him  Paula  who said she had liked the governor and voted for him twice before  said in an article that appeared on the Huffington Post Everyone  in his office  who answers my calls knows who I am  and they blow me off  My emails are not answered  He can ignore me and my husband but we aren t going away  and he doesn t scare us like he scares everyone who works for him  The battle to implement medicinal marijuana laws are also surfacing across states that have passed legislation on the issue  Sally Schaeffer  whose daughter Lydia had a rare genetic seizure disorder  successfully lobbied for a law in her state of Wisconsin that could help her 7 year old  State lawmakers passed the bill to legalize marijuana oil for children in April  and Gov  Scott Walker wasted no time in signing it into law  But the Schaeffers were told Lydia would not be able to receive the treatment until the fall while the law s implementation was worked out   I kept thinking to myself  we ve just got to buy Lydia some time  we ve just got to buy her some time  Sally told the Milwaukee Wisconsin Journal Sentinal   And I guess we didn t buy enough  Lydia died in her sleep on Mother s Day  less than a month after the bill was signed by Gov  Walker  In her memory  Walker renamed the law  Lydia s Law  Meanwhile  in New Jersey  the Joana family continues to fight for their cause in memory of Sabina Rose  starting The Love Nugget Foundation in order  to advocate for common sense laws to help medical advancements as well as raise funds to assist children with various form of Epilepsy  At the end of the day  they just want to see medical marijuana available to those who need it the most   Chris Christie is not against medical marijuana  Joana told msnbc   There are just so many regulations that he wants on  the law  it makes it virtually impossible  Paula and Phil Joana and their two children  Their 15 month old daughter Sabina Rose passed away in Dec  2013 after losing a battle to Dravet syndrome

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/the-new-faces-marijuana, Two years ago  Charlotte Figi was losing a lifelong battle to epilepsy Her parents were using a hospice program at home because she wasn t eating  had chronic pneumonia  and couldn t swallow water  At the age of five  Charlotte was suffering up to 50 seizures a day  Fast forward to today  Charlotte  now seven  is like any other child  She rides horses  goes to school  and plays with her twin sister and older brother Her parents say she is  99  seizure free  suffering usually one seizure a month which is under control after a few minutes   She can hike a couple of miles a day  Paige Figi  Charlotte s mother  told MSNBC   She can walk  talk  feed herself  has a normal sleep cycle and she has not taken prescription medication in two years  Charlotte s miracle Medicinal marijuana oil   We were using  medicinal marijuana  as end of life comfort measures  Figi explained  But it turned out that those measures saved Charlotte s life  The movement to legalize medicinal marijuana has a face like Charlotte s and it s a young one that s hard to ignore  Lawmakers across the country are pushing legislation to legalize marijuana oil as a treatment for children with epilepsy The marijuana extract is produced in Colorado and is designed to not produce a high  Instead  the strain has increased levels of CBD  a chemical that fights seizures  The organization the Realm of Caring developed the marijuana oil strain now known as Charlotte s Web  which was named after Charlotte Figi the first child to test the oil two years ago On average  the organization says 85  of people taking Charlotte s Web have seen a reduction in seizures  Since the development of Charlotte s Web  many parents have traveled to Colorado to treat their children  since the state law does not have a provision that allows the shipment or sale of marijuana products out of state Others have gone as far as to relocate their families to Colorado for the oil The Realm of Caring says they have 100 patients who have moved to Colorado from 43 other states  and there is a waiting list of more than 2 000 people who are willing to relocate An additional list exists of more than 4 000 Colorado residents who are waiting for the oil Doctors work with the Realm of Caring to determine each patient s dosage based on their weight  and the cost of Charlotte s Web is about 5 cents per milligram  The Figi family s monthly cost for the oil is about  180 a month  Left  Charlotte s medicine   Right  The Stanley brothers  Jon  Jared  Joel  Jesse  and Jordan  the founders of the Realm of Caring and makers of the Charlotte s Web oil  Photo by Paige Figi Currently  there is a rapid movement to legalize medicinal marijuana across the country  four states in March alone  Kentucky  Utah  Alabama  and Georgia  passed legislation to allow the use of the marijuana oil for medical purposes The fight to allow medicinal marijuana now heads to the floor of the North Carolina State Assembly  and lawmakers there are doubling down on their chances of legalizing with two bills up for consideration When the assembly reconvenes next month  it will consider one bill to legalize all forms of medicinal marijuana and another that focuses solely on the cannabis oil for the treatment of epilepsy   There seems to be a sense that something has got to happen  said State Rep  Kelly Alexander  who is sponsoring the bill for medicinal marijuana This is a bipartisan measure to find a way to alleviate the pain and suffering of those with illnesses  Alexander spoke on behalf of his bill when it was introduced to the North Carolina General Assembly last year  but it was placed on an  unfavorable report  and put on hold State Rep  Jonathan Jordan told the High Country Press that he was not likely to support the bill unless he saw evidence of the success of medicinal marijuana  and State Rep  Paul Stam told WRAL in Raleigh   We did it to be done with it so people could move on for the session  Stam claimed lawmakers were being harassed by emails and phone calls in regards to the bill MSNBC reached out to Stam  who declined to comment for this article  But lawmakers who support marijuana legislation could see an advantage at the polls in November  In a recent George Washington University poll  39  of surveyed voters say they would be more likely to vote if there was a proposal on the ballot to legalize marijuana An additional 30  of those surveyed said they would be more likely to vote in the 2014 midterm election under that circumstance  Americans also seem to be more open overall to changing marijuana laws Plans to legalize marijuana show a 73  approval rating while decriminalizing the possession of pot has a 53  approval rating  Charlotte and Paige Figi  Photo by Paige Figi Paige Figi said the opposition in states like North Carolina was based on preconceived notions about the damages of marijuana as a whole   Some states are very conservative and just won t allow cultivation because they can t figure out a way to regulate it  Figi said   There are no negative side effects  absolutely none  THC has shown long term cognitive loss  but that s not in this oil  Recently  the Realm of Caring began cultivating Charlotte s Web in the form of hemp  which can be dispersed to a wider population The organization is continuing its work to expand the legalization of medicinal marijuana to other states  sharing Charlotte s story as a means to give hope to the families of epileptic children   We had a DNR  do not resuscitate  signed  Figi recalled   Nobody thought  Charlotte  had any time left and now she is doing amazingly well  Close video       Hardball with Chris Matthews  5 14 14  8 19 PM ET       The new

interview with The Cycle s Ari Melber  Attorney Gen  Eric Holder weighed in on charges against NSA leaker Edward Snowden  the legality of marijuana  and his legacy of moving from over incarceration to rehabilitation    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss Ronald Taucher  an Air Force veteran  was back in federal court last week  Unlike his past court appearances  however  when Taucher battled alcohol abuse and risked going to jail  now he was celebrating his graduation  Taucher completed a new program that offers veterans struggling with substance abuse a chance at rehabilitation rather than prison  Along with four other veterans  Taucher stood before magistrate Judge Michael Urbanksi in a Veterans Court in Roanoke  Virginia   It is nice to have a happy occasion in federal court  Judge Urbanksi told the program graduates   We don t see many of those  It is just the second such federal court in the nation  In an interview with msnbc  Taucher credited the court for offering him rehab instead of a jail cell   When you see a judge and he gives you an opportunity  he said   you better take it  The courtroom was filled with friends  family  veterans  advocates  and an unusual observer for a local proceeding   Attorney General Eric Holder   The program that we re here to celebrate today provides a lot for preventing recidivism  reducing relapses  and empowering veterans convicted of certain non violent crimes to join their communities as productive  law abiding members of society  Holder told the court  For decades  criminologists have documented how the incarcerated veteran population is largely a result of ex service members  substance abuse and mental health issues  There are about 140 000 veterans in American jails today  according to the Justice Department  and 60  have substance abuse problems  About 25  were inebriated at the time of the violation that landed them in prison  Experts say many are  self medicating  countering the strains of their service   PTSD  emotional stress  mental fatigue  family disruption   with drugs or alcohol   A 2008 Rand study estimated that 18 5  of returning Iraq and Afghanistan vets screened positive for PTSD or depression  The incarceration rates also reflect broader trends in criminal justice policy  since the federal government  and most states  typically address substance abuse with jail time  not rehabilitation  Courts for veterans For veterans  that approach first began to change a bit in 2006    Robert Russell  a New York state judge  was overseeing mental health treatment for a Vietnam veteran in his Buffalo courtroom  It was a sad and familiar case  The veteran would attend the required sessions  but failed to participate or engage  Judge Russell recalls how the man  strongly built and six feet four inches tall  would slump  defeated  in the courtroom  He avoided eye contact  Nothing was getting through  So Judge Russell asked one of his staff  a Vietnam veteran who served in the 82nd Airborne  to go talk with the man during a recess   Is there something we could do  Judge Russell recalls thinking   How do we motivate him  They returned after twenty minutes  and to Judge Russell  it looked like a different person entered the courtroom   There was a remarkable distinguishing difference in this veteran s disposition  he recalled in an interview with msnbc this week   Standing erect   at what they call  parade rest  which is part of the military culture  your feet slightly apart  hands cupped in the back   and he looked at me  eye to eye  and he said   Judge  I m gonna try harder  The shift made an immediate impact on Judge Russell   I was totally amazed  he said  noting how a few minutes talking with a fellow veteran apparently awakened the man  enabling him to  tap into part of his military culture  and embrace self improvement  Judge Russell recalls asking his staff   What the heck did y all do  The answer was simple   They discussed commonality   where they served in Vietnam   and after they had a discussion about their military service  he recounted   they addressed that they wanted him to get better  Judge Russell began trying to develop a model  based on rehab success in dedicated drug courts  to address the particular challenges facing veterans  He reached out to the local V A  hospital  which provided volunteer veteran mentors for the program  As a start  Judge Russell recalls  he set aside aside one day a week for cases of  veterans suffering from mental health disorders or substance abuse  It worked  After formally beginning in 2008  states around the country launched their own veterans courts  There are over 130 today    On average  they are far more successful than jailing drug offenders   70  of enrolled veterans successfully complete the program  and 75  are not arrested within the following two years  Russell is pleasantly  surprised  that his experiment swiftly become a national model   and he welcomed the interest from the Obama administration   It s tremendous for the federal government to have the understanding of the needs of our veterans  he said   and the attorney general  and for some of my fed colleagues  having the desire to start up courts like this  New Department of Justice policy Holder  who talked about his cousin s Vietnam service when he visited the Virginia court  is advancing more federal veterans courts as part of his  Smart on Crime  reforms   There s a crying need for more of these kind of efforts  he said last week  stressing the special bond with veterans   It was once said that so many owe so much to so few  he said   we owe them in the most profound of ways  Under Holder  official Department of Justice policy now states that veterans get  involved in the criminal justice system with co occurring substance abuse and mental health issues    they risk going to prison because of drugs and strain from their service  basically   The Department encourages Veterans Courts as a rehabilitation model  noting they better serve  veterans struggling with addiction  serious mental illness  and PTSD  problems associated with  higher rates of drug abuse  domestic violence and other criminality  Since Holder took office in 2009  a dedicated Justice department program has advanced training and a national curriculum for Veterans Courts  in coordination with the Veterans Affairs Department  The attorney general is also calling for more federal Veterans Courts like the one in Virginia    In an interview for msnbc s  Presumed Guilty  series last week  Holder stressed that even beyond the improved recidivism rates  he views these reforms as a matter of principle   It s morally the right thing to do  he said  contending that these reforms make the criminal justice system more  fair  and better equipped to  act in proportionate ways  based on the conduct and situation of each defendant  Taucher  the Air Force veteran who graduated from the Veterans Court Holder visited  clearly agreed   Without a doubt  he says   a second chance is what a lot of us need   ,01/29/14 05:30 PM,drugs

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/why-the-medical-marijuana-industry-opposes, Marijuana legalization advocates won some major victories in the last election  but a new report from Politico is spotlighting the divisions within a still emergent industry  Legal marijuana vending appears to be splitting into two camps  medical and recreational  Though both sides have fought the federal law which still classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 illegal drug  medical marijuana dispensary owners have a financial interest in keeping their selling rights exclusive  As Byron Tau reports in Politico  this has driven some in the medical marijuana industry to fight with authorities against further legalization  Legal in 18 states  medical marijuana has had a big head start on recreational marijuana  which became legal in Washington State and Colorado only last year  and is yet to be fully implemented in either  Since California became the first state to legalize medical marijuana in 1996  the industry has ballooned  This is thanks in part to medical marijuana s virtual monopoly on legal selling rights  which keeps prices high because of scarcity and lack of competition  In Maine  for example  where medical marijuana was legalized in 1999  a proposed measure to legalize the possession of small amounts of pot by sending the issue to statewide referendum failed to pass in the legislature by a handful of votes earlier this year  One of the measure s key opponents was the Medical Marijuana Caregivers of Maine  MMCM   The main objections came from the fact that the bill was not built around Maine s medical marijuana industry  lobbyist for the group Paul McCarrier told Politico   Philosophically  we re not opposed to the decriminalization of marijuana  but the devil is in the details  The bill was not only going to legalize the possession of up to 2 5 ounces  or six plants  of marijuana  it was also going to grant licenses to cultivators  retailers  and laboratories  McCarrier told the Morning Sentinel when the measure was still pending that the bill threatened to put Maine s medical marijuana industry out of business by being preferential to recreational dispensaries over caregivers who give the drug to small groups of patients  Full legalization advocates see the MMCM s objections as purely self serving There are people who are benefiting financially and would prefer to see nothing change that  said Erik Altieri  northeast communications direct for National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws  NORML  As it stands  the U S  marijuana market  legal and illegal  is a  30 billion dollar industry  according to a March study from the Oregon Law Review  If allowed to be farmed professionally  says the study  that  30 billion worth of pot could be manufactured  on the order of  100 million  or something like  20 per pound  which is about one percent of the current amount paid to illicit marijuana growers in the United States Simply put  state revenues from legal pot could be enormous  So could profits to medical marijuana dispensary owners if they can keep other players out of the game  With the legalization of marijuana for recreational use  more dispensaries mean more competition means lower prices  Maine isn t the only state to experience infighting among marijuana advocates  The Cannabis Action Coalition s executive director Steve Zarich opposed Washington State s 2012 ballot measure  And though efforts to stop legalization were unsuccessful in Colorado  existing dispensaries were granted the privilege of turning themselves into recreational shops before others could apply for licenses   It is a necessary but fascinating footnote in history that some of the most active opposition is oddly coming from those who are fellow travelers of the road  shall we say those who enjoy and use marijuana  be it for medical reasons or recreational  director of NORML Allen St  Pierre said in April  But both sides have a common enemy  Federal law still puts anyone who grows  sells  or possesses marijuana in danger of arrest  Though Attorney General Eric Holder said in 2009 that  it will not be a priority to use federal resources to prosecute patients with serious illnesses or their caregivers who are complying with state laws on medical marijuana  the Drug Enforcement Administration  DEA  is still making raids  Just last Wednesday  DEA officials raided several dispensaries in Washington State  NBC News reported  seizing business records and thousands of dollars worth of medical marijuana  ,07/29/13 11:07 PM,drugs

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/holder-snowden-plea-deal, Attorney General Eric Holder addressed the indictment of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell for the first time Thursday and vigorously defended the pursuit of political corruption cases more broadly  In an exclusive interview with msnbc  Holder also said the Justice Department would be open to plea negotiations with Edward Snowden    McDonnell and his wife Maureen were charged in federal court Tuesday for allegedly taking tens of thousands of dollars worth of gifts from a supporter who sought help from the state government  McDonnell has said he is being wrongly accused and his legal team argued that he engaged in  routine politics   The notion that public officials trade their office for their own personal gain  said Holder   is something that s inconsistent with good government  Stressing that he was speaking about corruption in general  Holder added   People who are in these positions have the public trust  they have great benefits that go with them in these positions  and they should be held  I think  to the highest standard  Some of the gifts the McDonnell s accepted included a  6 500 Rolex watch   10 000 worth of Oscar de la Renta clothing and  15 000 for his daughter s wedding expenses   I think the indictment lays out in pretty specific detail our theory of the case   ultimately a jury will decide  Holder said    Holder is a close friend of President Obama and has served as attorney general since 2009  He has devoted a significant part of his career to the Justice Department  where he spent years prosecuting political corruption cases for the public integrity section   We brought cases all the time where public officials received money  got gifts in exchange for official action   that is classic corruption  he said   Those are the kinds of cases that we traditionally bring  Holder spoke in Roanoke  Virginia  where he was visiting a federal veterans  court  part of the Justice Department s focus on prioritizing rehabilitation over prison for certain drug defendants  On the fate of Snowden  the former CIA officer and NSA contractor who leaked tens of thousands of classified documents  Holder said the prospect of amnesty  goes too far   He broke the law  he caused harm to our national security   I think he has to be held accountable for his actions  Holder said  If Snowden s lawyers sought a deal with some accountability  Holder said he would  engage in conversations  as in any plea negotiation   Returning to the US  I think  is the best resolution for the government  the public  and myself  but it s unfortunately not possible in the face of current whistleblower protection laws  which through a failure in law did not cover national security contractors like myself  Snowden said in an online chat Thursday The hundred year old law under which I ve been charged  which was never intended to be used against people working in the public interest  and forbids a public interest defense  This is especially frustrating  because it means there s no chance to have a fair trial  and no way I can come home and make my case to a jury  Snowden was granted temporary amnesty by Russia last summer  Snowden has been charged with theft and two serious charges under the espionage act   unauthorized communication of national defense information  and  willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person  Last month  a federal court in Washington ruled against an N S A  program based partly on Snowden s revelations  but Holder said such rulings do not change Snowden s status   People have really gotten hung up on the idea of whether he s a whistleblower or something else  Holder said   From my perspective  he s a defendant  He s a person that we lodged criminal charges against  I think that s the most apt title  Holder added that the debate Snowden helped spark may be good for the country  despite his actions   I think the dialogue that we are engaged is in fact something that is ultimately going to be productive   it s healthy  Holder said   but that doesn t necessarily excuse that which what he did  Holder declined to address claims by Congressional leaders that Snowden may have worked with a foreign government  citing the ongoing investigation against the former contractor  The Attorney General also addressed Obama s recent comments on marijuana   I think the positions that we re taking   in terms of setting up those eight priorities that would warrant federal intervention   are consistent with what the President said  Holder stated  referencing 2012 guidelines that leaned away from prosecuting private use   Small time small amount marijuana cases are not

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/the-war-drugs-lost-cause, We re devoting tonight s D block to the subject of drugs  President Nixon launched the war on drugs 40 years ago  But a new report from the Global Commission on Drug Policy  composed of former presidents  prime ministers and other worldwide leaders  suggests these crackdowns have done more harm than good  The report says usage has actually increased in from 1998 to 2008 alone  opiate use is up 34 5 percent  cocaine use is up 27 percent and marijuana is up 8 5 percent  So basically  all those  this is your brain on drugs  PSAs with the scrambled eggs didn t help President Jimmy Carter wrote an op ed in The New York Times  calling for the end to war on drugs as we know it and offers up some alternative suggestions on how to stop the illegal trade of drugs In a message to Congress in 1977  I said the country should decriminalize the possession of less than an ounce of marijuana  with a full program of treatment for addicts  I also cautioned against filling our prisons with young people who were no threat to society  and summarized by saying   Penalties against possession of a drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself These ideas were widely accepted at the time  But in the 1980s President Ronald Reagan and Congress began to shift from balanced drug policies  including the treatment and rehabilitation of addicts  toward futile efforts to control drug imports from foreign countries This approach entailed an enormous expenditure of resources and the dependence on police and military forces to reduce the foreign cultivation of marijuana  coca and opium poppy and the production of cocaine and heroin  One result has been a terrible escalation in drug related violence  corruption and gross violations of human rights in a growing number of Latin American countries The commission s facts and arguments are persuasive  It recommends that governments be encouraged to experiment  with models of legal regulation of drugs   that are designed to undermine the power of organized crime and safeguard the health and security of their citizens  For effective examples  they can look to policies that have shown promising results in Europe  Australia and other places Tune in at 8pm ET for more on this story  We ll be joined by Michelle Alexander What s your stance on the issue  Tell us in the comment space below  Follow  digimuller    ,06/17/11 05:24 PM,drugs
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/wide-ranging-talk-eric-holder, On January 23  Attorney General Eric Holder sat down with msnbc s Ari Melber for a wide ranging conversation that covered Edward Snowden  Wall Street crime  voting rights  and the war on drugs  Their talk  Melber  You heard the president s remarks on marijuana  not only about how it s used by individuals and its risk but also seeming to welcome legalization efforts in states like Colorado  You ve already shifted enforcement policy  Do you have to shift it more to harmonize with his views here  And what did you think of his remarks  Holder  No  I think the positions that we re taking in terms of setting out those eight priorities that would warrant federal intervention are  are consistent with what the what the president said  Small time  small amount  of marijuana cases are not the kinds of things that deserve to be in the federal system  We have the interstate transportation of it where violence is a part of the  the dissemination of marijuana  Those are the kinds of cases that oughta be in the federal system  And those are the changes that we ve made  And as I said  I think those are consistent with what the president said  And the president  of course  was at the Justice Department just last week outlining reforms to the NSA  We have reports of a new government watchdog report that says the bulk collection program was unlawful  it was a subversion of the Patriot Act law  and also not very useful in discovering any terror plots  Is that report  in your view  incorrect  And is there anything more that needs to be done to rein in these programs  Yeah  I ve not seen the report  But I will say that  at least 15 judges on about 35 occasions have said that the  the program itself is legal  Now  that answers only one part of the question  It s legal  It s something  And I agree with that  I  I think the program is in fact legal  But the question is  is the program as useful as it can be  And is it something that  that we ultimately need  And those are the questions that the president has put to me  to the director of national intelligence Jim Clapper  And we re gonna be looking over the next 90 days or so to make determinations about  answer the questions the president said  Just because we can do something should we should we do it  You have mentioned those courts  And there are definitely those decisions  But there s also a D C  court that ruled against the NSA and Judge Bates in the spy court in 2011 saying parts of the program at one point were unconstitutional  Your view  though  is  it s final that is completely legal based on the totality of all those judgments  Yeah  I think that  those other judges  those 15 judges  I think  got it right  I think the modifications that have been made in the program have made it legal to the extent that there were issues that might have been raised before  But again  that only answers one part of the  of the equation  The other question is  simply because we can do it  should we And that s what we re still working on  The president s acknowledged the discussion is partly because of the revelations published and released by Edward Snowden  There have been allegations recently  the suggestion that he may have worked with foreign governments  by the intelligence chairs  Are you aware of any evidence of that  Is that something you re investigating to add to the criminal complaint against Mr  Snowden  Well  this is an ongoing investigation  I don t wanna necessarily get into all of the  all of the details  I will say that  you know  he broke the law  that  he caused harm to our national security   And I think that he has to be held accountable for his actions  Now  I think the dialogue that we are engaged in  the debate that we are engaged in is in fact  something that is  ultimately  I think  gonna be productive  And I think there is  it s healthy  But that doesn t necessarily excuse  I think  that which he did  There are other ways that he might have brought this to the attention of the nation  Have you seen evidence that he worked with a foreign government  Because those are charges coming from senior congressional officials    Well  I  as I said  I don t wanna get into what is an ongoing investigation and say something that might end up in a pre trial motion when we get to that stage  Does the fact that the D C  court did rule against the NSA make him more of whistleblower potentially in the eyes of the law or in your view  I mean  people have really gotten hung up on whether he s a whistleblower or something else  From my perspective  he s  he s a defendant  He s a person that we have lodged criminal charges against  And I think that s the most apt title  Turning to the indictment of Governor McDonnell and the open inquiry in New Jersey looking into allegations against Governor Christie  First of all  McDonnell s attorneys have said that this was  quote  routine political conduct  that there was no real exchange of services  Broadly  what is your view of that argument  And how do you approach these federal investigations into state governors  Well  without talking about the McDonnell case specifically  I  I grew up in the Justice Department in the public integrity section  And we brought cases all the time where public officials received money  exchanged  got gifts in exchange for official action  That is classic corruption  And that is the  those are the kinds of cases that we traditionally bring  We have brought an indictment against Governor McDonnell  It s a case that will ultimately be tried in court  I think the indictment lays out in pretty specific detail our theory of the case  And ultimately  a jury will decide whether we are right or wrong  And then when you look at that idea though  the people say   This is politics as usual  broader than that individual case  And you did work for many years in the public integrity section  Is that offensive  Well  you know  that s something for the American people  I think  to decide  But from my own perspective  the notion that  you know  public officials trade their office for their own personal gain is something that is inconsistent with the notion of good government  And again  I m not talking about the McDonnell case  I m talking about this just  you know  more more generally  People who are in these positions have the public trust  They have great benefits that go with them in these positions  And they should be held  I think  to the highest standard  Looking at voting rights  an area where you have clearly led the Justice Department not only to  patrol and enforce the right to vote but to be somewhat flexible after the Supreme Court decision last year  You shifted resources  You ve said you re gonna make sure people have the right to vote  And now you re working with members of Congress in both parties  Does that Voting Rights Act amendment do what we need  while also avoiding what used to be your purview  which is Justice Department objections  in the voter ID context  which as you said yourself  is so important  I think the statute that has been introduced goes as long way to dealing with  that very  I think  wrongly decided  Shelby case  There are some things that I think need to be looked at though in connection with this  recodification of the Voting Rights Act  Chief among them  I think  is this whole notion of this photo ID requirement  And if we can show that  that photo ID efforts are done inappropriately and for improper reasons  I  I think that oughta be the basis for federal intervention  And so I m a little concerned that that appears at least for now not to be a part of the scheme  So you would like this bill that s being sponsored by Congressmen Sensenbrenner and John Lewis to include Justice Department photo ID objections in its formula for federal supervision  It is certainly something I think we  we d like to talk about and have a consideration made as to whether or not that ought to be included and then  you know  come up with language that would be appropriate  People have to understand that we are not opposed to photo identification in a vacuum  But when it is used in certain ways to disenfranchise particular groups of people  whether by  racial designation  ethnic origin  or for partisan reasons  that  from my perspective  is  is problematic  And so I would like to work with members of Congress to make this bill as strong as we possibly can make it  And so when some Republicans say that voter identification is for election integrity and thus is different than the history of racial discrimination we have seen in this country  they may be of good faith  but you think they re wrong  Yeah  There are some  I think  who are coming that  from a good faith perspective  But I think many are using it for partisan advantage  The reality is that  all the studies show that this whole question of ballot integrity  in person voter fraud  simply does not exist to the extent that would warrant these kinds of measures  We had the commission that the president appointed just yesterday  And they indicated this was not  was not a significant problem  And so I think they have come up with a remedy in search of a problem  And I think it is being used in too many instances to depress the vote of particular groups of people who are not supportive of the party that is advancing these photo ID measures  Now  also in the New Yorker interview  when the president was asked about potential deals or clemency for Edward Snowden which is something some NSA officials have said should be on the table  he said it s not a yes no issue  Does that mean that a deal of some kind could still be possible for Mr  Snowden  Well  he is a person who will  is charged  will be charged with  a variety of crimes  When he has legal representation and if those lawyers wanna talk about a resolution of the case  we would obviously engage in those  in those conversations  But that means it s not  you haven t ruled it out  The notion of clemency  a simple  you know  no harm  no foul  I think that would be going too far  But in the resolution of this matter  with an acceptance of responsibility  you know  the  we would always  you know  engage in those kinds of conversations  We have been talking about your approach to incarceration and smart on crime initiatives  Another criticism that is made of  not only this Justice Department but your predecessor  is that individual Wall Street executive misconduct doesn t often lead to jail time outside of the specifics of insider trading  In addition  as you know  there has been discussion in the economic realm  that some institutions are either too big to indict or too big to really deal with in a criminal context  Now you have been on the job even longer  Those criticisms remain  Your response to them  Are there things that you need from Congress or in our laws so that companies are not too big to indict if they do wrong  Let me make this very clear  There are no institutions that are too big to indict  There are no individuals who are in such high level positions that they cannot be indicted  criminally investigated  And we have brought charges against thousands of people over the course of these last four and a half  almost five years  We have brought significant cases against some of the largest financial institutions in the country  the last of which was the J P  Morgan case  which significantly did not include a resolution of the criminal investigation that is ongoing and could result in charges against either the institution or individuals  who are engaged  who were involved in those activities  And we have ongoing investigations that  I m really not at liberty to talk about but involve significant financial institutions  And the focus of those investigations is not only on the institutions but on individuals as well  So I think  you know  what we are gonna have to do is wait for us to be finished with all of the things that we want to do  and then look and make an assessment of  how well we did and the kinds of charges that we brought  I think it s a little too early at this point  But the record suggested a great deal of money has been clawed back in some cases  and that working with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  sometimes that money goes to victims of financial crimes  But many  as we know  of the completed investigations involved deferred prosecution agreements or deals where people often don t even have to say that there was official wrongdoing  And many say that is an insufficiently punitive or harsh approach to those actors  Is that fair  Well  you know  people say these things without having the ability to look at the files that we have  the  the cases that we could possibly bring  To the extent that we have the ability to bring cases against individuals or institutions  criminal charges   we will bring them  But we have certain responsibilities to only bring those cases that we think we have an ability to prove beyond a reasonable doubt  It doesn t mean we only  that we won t take hard cases and  you know  be prepared to take potentially  you know  losses where we think it is appropriate to bring those charges  But it is not for lack of looking  or lack of aggressiveness  that we have not done all that people think that we should have done  And as I said  I  I think people need to just be a little patient  I know it s been  it s been a while  But we have other things that are in the pipeline  One of the other most controversial legal issues has been the boundaries over the targeted killing or drone program  Are you satisfied with where that debate has landed and the transparency that has been provided  which I believe was more than the administration initially planned on  And do you think Americans have a clear understanding of what the line is and how you advise the president to define who can be targeted and whether individuals who haven t had any due process or any claims proven about their ties to terrorists can still be killed  Well  we  I think we have been pretty transparent  I gave a speech at Northwestern University Law School that laid out some of the legal bases for this kind of action   John Brennan  Brennan gave a speech as well  So I think we have been forthcoming in that regard  And  I think the  the use of those kinds of weapons and  in the numbers of times we ve done it with regard to American citizens has been justified both by the law and by  by circumstance  And so I m   I think I m   I m comfortable with the way in which we have both conducted ourselves and the way in which we have explained it  The president has wanted to have as much transparency as is possible  understanding that a good portion of these operations must be kept secret if they are to be  if they are to be effective  And as you think on your  legacy  however long you are in office  you are one of the longest  ninth longest serving attorney general  Is that right  That is right  I didn t  I did not  okay   LAUGH  All right  Do you think  when you look at the smart on crime initiative and some of the reforms we ve been talking about  do you  and you presiding over  an actual drop in the total number of the prison population for the first time in a generation  is part of your legacy moving from overincarceration to rehabilitation and other approaches to social problems  Yeah  I would hope that one of the things that people look back on and say that we got right  was to do things in a different way  not to be stuck in things that are traditional but perhaps ultimately don t work to break the cycle  not to reflexively say that we were simply tough on crime but as we use the phrase  to be smart on crime  And that necessarily means engaging in prevention activities  rehabilitation activities  re entry activities that ultimately keep the nation safer at a smaller cost  And it  and it s also the morally the right thing to do  to have a system  of  criminal justice system that is perceived as being fair and that acts in proportionate ways  We have  you know  we erred  I think  a little in the the war on drugs in going too far with regard to some of the sentences that  that Congress mandated  And I think we have a moment in time now where Congress as well as those of us in the executive branch think that it s time to pull back just  just a bit  And so I think that  I hope that will be a part of my legacy  Do you feel you are able to do more of that because of the  a change in the politics of fear in this country  Politics of fear  Yeah  the people being afraid of crime so much regardless of the data  that they seek punishment above all other remedy  I think there is a growing recognition in  I think in the American people that different approaches ought to be tried  You know  this mass incarceration happens with a cost   If you look at the way it impacts certain communities and it s  let s be honest about this  communities of color  where young men should be the future of these communities are taken out  labeled  then have inabilities to obtain good employment  to be the kinds of productive citizens that they might be  Now  they  people have to be held accountable for individual decisions that they make  But we need to have proportionate penalties  And the ability for  a recognition that you can make a mistake  rehabilitate yourself  and then come back and be a productive citizen  And those are the kinds of policies that I m trying to advance  that this administration is trying to advance  Mr  Attorney General  I appreciate your time today  Thank you     ,01/28/14 09:50 PM,drugs
