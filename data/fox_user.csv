authorities say Two former FBI agents from the Joint Terrorism Task Force or JTTF revealed for the first time on a Fox News special Greta Investigates The Lone Wolves of Terror that they believe Ali Muhammad Brown may have traveled to one of the first terrorist training camps on US soil when he was a teenager Former FBI agents David Rubincam and David Gomez were interviewed by Fox News in Seattle David Gomez told Fox I believe Ali Muhammad Brown at some point traveled to Bly Ore prior to his arrest for financial institution fraud The JTTFexecuted 19 search and arrest warrants in November 2004 after a 30month investigation which became known as the Ranier Valley Roundup No one including Brown was charged with terrorism  Ahmed Said  Gomez recalled the case The objective is to make money so they were involved in trying to raise money for themselves but they were also raising money for a jihadist movement in Seattle There is a quote in the indictment that says you cant go to war broke  The JTTF investigation centered around Crescent Cuts a small barber shop frequented by Brown The shop was owned by Ruben Shumpert a convicted drug dealer familiar to Gomez and other members of law enforcement Ruben Shumpert was a prison convert to Islam noted Gomez He learned to cut hair in prison Ruben would not only cut hair but was attempting to indoctrinate a lot of the youth into radical forms of Islam by showing them videos about the 911 hijackers and Al Qaeda Gomez added in 2004 with Ali Muhammad Brown what we were looking at was the raising of funds for overseas material support of terrorism He Brown was convicted of fraudulently producing checks depositing them into accounts and spending the money basically  Leroy Henderson  Brown was sentenced to two years in prison but only served 84 daysHe would lead a life of depraved crime and violenceWashington state court records from 2012 obtained by Fox News show Brown was charged with child rape before pleading guilty to three lesser counts of communication with a minor for immoral purposes Ruben Shumpert went on to fight alongside terrorists Just prior to his sentencing in 2006 Shumpert wrote a 12page letter to US District Judge Marsha J PechmanIn it he claimed he was a changed man because of Islam and begged for leniency He also criticized news organizations including Fox News However Shumpert who was never asked to surrender his US passport never showed up for his sentencing Shumpert fled to Somalia to fight for the Al Qaedaaffiliated group Al Shabaab From there Shumpert made taunting calls to the FBI team that had investigated him In 2008 reports of his death in a missile attack were reported by the SITE intelligence group SITE noted that Shumpert had been declared a martyr in an online jihadi magazine  Dwone AndersonYoung  It is clear that prior to the attacks of 911 the Pacific Northwest had become a lure to create a mujahadeen  and Al Qaedarelated training camp As early as 1999 Dog Cry Ranch near Bly Ore was envisioned as a jihadist training camp by Londons notorious radical Islamic cleric Abu Hamza alMasri The oneeyed handless alMasri 56 now faces sentencing before the US Attorneys Southern District of New York following his conviction in May 2014 on 11 federal terrorism charges These convictions include some related to the plans for the Oregon ranch Testifying this spring at alMasris trial was James Ujaama one of the clerics most devoted followers Ujaama was familiar to the Crescent Cuts barber shop in Seattle and had attended Ingraham High School Now in his late 40s Ujaama testified in April that he wrote and sent a fax to alMasri in 1999 stating the land we spoke of is about 160 acres and looks just like Afghanistan Former FBI agent and Seattle Joint Terrorism Task Force member David Rubincam recalled Ujaama to Fox News James Ujaamas inspiration came not from videos of Abu hamza alMasri he actually went to the Finsbury mosque and was tutored by him in the ways of violent jihad and then attempted to bring that back that original group of converts some of whom stayed on and worked with Shumpert in the Crescent Cuts case They tried to set up a mujahedeen training camp here on US soil  Ali Muhammad Brown  Fox News also reviewed videos obtained by the Investigative Project on Terrorism showing Ujaama present with alMasri at the London mosque in 2000 In 2003 it was announced by thenUS Attorney General John Ashcroft and former Attorney General Michael Chertoff that James Ujaama pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide goods and services to the TalibanIn exchange for a twoyear prison sentence Ujaama was cooperating with the government in ongoing terrorism investigations  However after completing his sentence in 2005 Ujaama fled the US on a fake Mexican passportHe was arrested outside a mosque in Belize in December 2005 and returned to the United States Now still facing decades in prison with terrorism charges reinstated under seal Ujaama remains a key government witness in ongoing core Al Qaedarelated terrorism trials  And there was another visitor to the barber shop that interested members of the JTTF David Rubincam investigated Sheikh Mohamed Ibrahim then the imam of the Abu Bakr Mosque At the time the mosque was located 500 feet away from Crescent Cuts I had a piece of that investigation that involved an imam at the Abu Bakr MosqueRubincam explained A point of overlap between the investigations is the fact that the converts like Rubin Shumpert and others would attend AbuBakr Mosque And Sheikh Ibrahim the imam was also known We surveilled him actually going over to Crescent Cuts David Rubincam Remains certain about the radical motivation of the thenimam from the Abu BakrMosque  Sheikh Ibrahim  Former FBI Special Agent David Rubincam Hes an extremist religious zealot of the worst kindhe went to the University of alMadinah in Saudi Arabia He was educated as an Islamic religious scholar Rubincam said the imam was a member of the precursor to the Al Qaeda affiliate in Somalia AlShabaabHe was over here to raise money through the Hawala system of  of money transfer to fund them overseas and to recruit people to their cause to actually go back to Somalia to take up arms or go into Ethiopia and take up arms The imam was finally arrested in Seattle in late 2005 after returning from a trip to Texas says Rubincam As soon as we saw who he was meeting with in Dallas we thought OK you know what enough This you know hes meeting with other people that are kind of in the same line of work as him  Ruben Shumpert  Three months after Shumpert disappeared in 2006 to fight alongside terrorists in Somalia Sheikh Ibrahimwhose real name is Mohamad Dheere was deported because according to the immigration court the sheikh had no legal basis to remain in the US A public affairs spokesman for the Seattle office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE confirmed to Fox News that the sheikh was deported to Kenya his country of birth not Somalia Federal investigators say the sheikh lied in documents he signed in 2000 to obtain legal asylum in the United States  James Ujaama  Im glad that we dealt with it in immigration court Rubincam continued The best thing is to get him off our soil and get him out of here and never let him come backI am 100 percent certain 100  a national security threat to the United States of America or to any country in which he resides Ali Muhammad Brown who hung out at the barber shop is facing four murder charges in two states as police investigate his life thoroughly A Fox Newsrequest for an interview with Brown and his attorney were declinedBrown is currently held in New Jerseys Essex County jail Frank Cilluffo the director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute at George Washington University told Fox News the investigation is still playing outbut in this case I do think he would fit in the category of lone wolf because he did affiliate with others who were traveling to Somalia and in this case AlShabaab Christina Diaz Hall Angela Tarrant Steve Tierney and Cyd Upson contributed additional reporting to this story,0.7,0,0
Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/11/04/kurds-help-isis-with-terrain-language-in-battle-for-kobani/,world,This undated image posted on a militant website shows Abu Khattab alKurdi or Abu Khattab the Kurd one of the Islamic State groups top military commanders in the offensive on the Syrian city of Kobani APJihadis website BEIRUT  Ethnic Kurds are helping members of the Islamic State group in the battle for the key Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani sharing their knowledge of the local terrain and language with the extremists according to Iraqi and Kurdish officials It is not clear how many Kurds are aiding the estimated 3000 Islamic State militants in the Kobani area  and fighting against their own Kurdish brethren  but activists say they are playing a major role in the 7weekold conflict near the Turkish border ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT A top military commander for the extremists in the town is an Iraqi Kurd known by the nom de guerre of Abu Khattab alKurdi helping them in the battle against fellow Kurds Officials with the main Syrian Kurdish force known as the Peoples Protection Units or YPG say they became aware of the Kurds among the mostly Sunni Muslim extremists early in the fighting As Kurdish fighters were defending the nearby Syrian village of Shiran in September two Kurdish men with different accents and wearing YPG uniforms infiltrated their ranks Kurdish officials said Upon questioning however they were captured and admitted to fighting for the Islamic State group the officials added Iraqi and Kurdish officials say many of the Kurdish fighters with the Islamic State group are from the northeastern Iraqi town of Halabja which was bombed with chemical weapons by Saddam Husseins forces in 1988 killing some 5000 people Shorsh Hassan a YPG spokesman in Kobani said although most of the Kurdish jihadi fighters come from Iraq some are from Syrian regions such as Kobani Afrin and Jazeera He added that the number of Syrian Kurds is small compared with the dozens of Iraqis fighting with the IS group The fighter who is from Kobani is not like someone who hails from Chechnya with no idea about tracks and roads Hassan said Thousands of militants from all over the world  including north Africans Asians and some Westerners  have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join the ranks of the Islamic State group Turkish nationals are among them but it is unknown if any are fighting in Kobani Hassan said many of the Iraqi fighters were from Halabja including alKurdi Websites affiliated with the Islamic State group recently published several photographs of the young bearded man including some of him wearing the traditional Kurdish garb of baggy pants and others of him standing in front of Kurds killed in Kobani In Baghdad an Iraqi security official said alKurdi was a member of Ansar alIslam a Sunni militant group with ties to Abu Musab alZarqawi the late leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq who was active in the early 2000s AlKurdi later joined the Islamic State group the official said The Iraqi official said alKurdi is also from Halabja and is wanted by Iraqi authorities He refused to give the mans real name when pressed by The Associated Press Our latest information is that he is in Syria fighting in the Kobani area He is an expert in mountainous areas the Iraqi official said speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media He is commanding the Kurdish group within Daesh because he is a Kurd he added using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group Halabja was known as a secular village and the home of Abdullah Goran one of the bestknown Kurdish poets in the 20th century and a member of the Iraqi Communist Party But in the past three decades Muslim preachers have become active and have turned it into one of Iraqi Kurdistans most religiously conservative areas Still most of the Kurds are moderate and secularleaning Muslims Many Kurds in Iraq were stunned when they learned that Kiwan Mohammed the 25yearold goalkeeper of Halabjas soccer team was killed last month in Syria while fighting for the Islamic State group in Kobani Mohammed was identified by jihadi websites as Abu Walid alKurdi Dana Jalal an Iraqi journalist who follows jihadi groups said the Iraqi athlete left Syria in July 2013 and had not been heard of until his death Some 70 Iraqi Kurds mostly from Halabja went to fight in Syria with the Islamic State group Jalal said Most go through Turkey where they say they are going for tourism but theu then they cross into Syria and some even take their wives with them Jalal added Nawaf Khalil the Europebased spokesman for Syrias powerful Kurdish Democratic Union Party said Kurdish fighters within the Islamic State group are invaluable in the Kobani battle because they know the geography as well as the language and the mentality of fellow Kurds A main part of their work is tapping electronic surveillance and intelligencegathering They might be also using some from the Kobani area to benefit from the geographical knowledge of the area he said Mustafa Bali a Kurdish activist in Kobani said that by having Kurdish fighters Islamic State extremists are trying to win the hearts and minds of Syrian Kurds in the area Daesh is trying to tell the people of Kobani that it does not consider them enemies and its fighters include Kurds

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/11/04/0-year-old-among-first-charged-under-fort-lauderdale-strict-rules-against/,politics,Arnold Abbott plans to defy Fort Lauderdales ordinance against feeding the homeless again on Wednesday Courtesy SunSentinel Fort Lauderdale police say Arnold Abbott violated a new city law but the 90yearold homeless advocate says his only crime was to love thy neighbor Abbott was charged Sunday along with two local pastors with violating the citys new ordinance that effectively bans giving out food in public He faces 60 days in jail and a 500 fine and he intends to get cited again Wednesday night when he sets out to feed some of the Florida citys estimated 10000 homeless on a public beach ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT  Arnold Abbott homeless advocate I know that I will be arrested again and I am prepared for that Abbott said by phone from his office at Love Thy Neighbor Inc a nonprofit he established in honor of his wife Maureen after her death in a car accident 23 years ago I am my brothers keeper and what they are doing is just heartless Fort Lauderdale passed an ordinance late last month that included a slate of new regulations on where and how groups can provide food to homeless people The vote made the city the 13th in the nation since 2012 to pass restrictions on where people can feed the homeless according to a report by the National Coalition for the Homeless The regulations enacted in Fort Lauderdale state that no two indoor feeding sites can be within 500 feet of one another or on the same block outdoor feeding programs require a permit or permission of the property owner and must provide portable toilets and outdoor stations cannot be within 500 feet of residential properties Abbott whose charity has battled city officials for years in court and on the streets of the southern Florida city said the toilet requirement was too much for his group I have tried to abide by their regulations but we just are not able to provide a portapotty he said I believe that is the job of the municipality anyway Cited along with Abbott were Dwayne Black pastor of The Sanctuary Church in Fort Lauderdale and Mark Sims of St Mary Magdalene Episcopal Church in Coral Springs according to the Fort Lauderdale SunSentinel Although the three were not handcuffed or taken to jail they were cited and must appear in court or face a bench warrant Fort Lauderdale officials defended the ordinance saying it does not bar people from helping the hungry The ordinance allows for legal clean and safe distribution of food to the homeless said Fort Lauderdale Police Department Det DeAnna Greenlaw For example if a minister priest or member of clergy wishes to provide food to the homeless at their establishment Ie community hall church or gathering place they can do so if the proper facilities as listed in the ordinance are in place  Supporters of the strict laws say that allowing programs like Abbotts encourages homelessness Cal Deal a 65yearold former journalist who videotapes homeless people in the city and says they commit crimes cause sanitation problems and need more help than simply food The people feeding them are enablers and they enable the homeless by making their lives easier Deal told the New Times of Broward County Hunger is a big motivator Are people more likely to seek help when theyre hungry or when theyre fed and happy Ron Book chairman of the MiamiDade County Homeless Trust told city lawmakers at the raucous Oct 21 meeting at which the new laws were passed that they would have a positive effect Feeding people on the streets is sanctioning homelessness Book said Whatever discourages feeding people on the streets is a positive thing Sims acknowledged that Fort Lauderdale has a problem with homelessness but said the answer isnt laws that make it hard to feed people Its not an easy issue not cut and dried Sims said But what is cut and dried is that people deserve to eat when they are hungry And people of faith are compelled to reach out to people who are in need We need to work harder to solve the problem rather than just shutting it down he added Abbott said there is a simple explanation for Fort Lauderdales outsize homeless population The homeless people come here for the weather he said They know they wont freeze to death in Fort Lauderdale Abbott a World War II veteran who won two Purple Hearts as an infantryman said he wont stop the fight he has dedicated to his wife She tried to help as many poor and homeless people as she could said Abbott a retired jewelry salesman who grew up in Philadelphia When I lost her I decided the best tribute to her would be a fulltime program in her name In addition to feeding the homeless Love Thy Neighbor operates a culinary training program that Abbott says has helped more than 400 people learn food service skills But the food programs have gotten him in trouble for years In 1999 the city tried to stop Abbott from feeding the homeless on Fort Lauderdale Beach the same location he plans to go to Wednesday Abbott sued and won and says he will go back to court if necessary Ill go to court again and sue the city said Abbott They are doing the bidding of the very wealthy and they are trying to sweep the poorest of the poor under the rug,0.7,0,0

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/11/04/wreckage-from-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-found-35-miles-from-crash-site-ntsb/,us, The National Transportation Safety Board said late Monday that tiny pieces of debris from the wreckage of Virgin Galactics SpaceShipTwo were found 35 miles from the main crash site Acting NTSB chairman Christopher Hart said that the pieces could have been carried over that distance by the wind but did not say whether that was the case The main wreckage from Fridays crash is spread over a 5mile area in the Mojave Desert ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Earlier Monday Hart said that Hart said cockpit video and data showed that the copilot unlocked SpaceShipTwos unique feathering system earlier than planned The system works somewhat like the wing flaps that airplanes use to slow for landing  except that SpaceShipTwos twin tails rotate up at a far more extreme angle to a position that creates strong resistance and slows the descent But while the copilot unlocked the system before planned that action alone should not have been enough to change the crafts configuration Activating the feathering system requires the pulling of a lever not unlike a gun fires only when the trigger is pulled not just because the safety has been disengaged That information raises the question of why the copilot activated the system when he did as well as why the tails rotated without the copilot starting them The copilot was killed in the crash while the pilot was badly injured after parachuting out of the ship NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson said Monday that investigators believe once the feathers were unlocked aerodynamic forces buffeting the craft as it hurtled along about 760 mph caused the feathers to start rotating Within a few seconds the craft began to disintegrate NTSB investigators determined Knudson stressed that a final cause will take months to determine and that investigators were looking into other factors including pilot training mechanical failure and design flaws The ultimate goal of Virgin Galactic coowner Richard Branson is to create an industry that can move people around the globe in a fraction of the current time it takes passenger jets by rocketing them into space and back down But the company now lacks not only a craft to fly but also an understanding of what caused the crash Though rival companies also are pushing ahead the dawn of space tourism seems to have been pushed beyond the horizon yet again SpaceShipTwo has been under development for years and Branson originally predicted passengers would be enjoying the wonders of flight by now In the weeks before the crash he said he hoped to fly in 2015 Branson still plans to be on the maiden voyage with his family He said that day will not come before a new round of crewonly flights We need to be absolutely certain our spaceship has been thoroughly tested  and that it will be he said And once its thoroughly tested and we can go to space we will go to space Fridays crash could trigger increased government regulation To give the fledgling commercial space industry space to innovate the Federal Aviation Administration has not overregulated test flights during the past decade according to Diane Howard an assistant professor at EmbryRiddle Aeronautical University who specializes in space law But the crash could allow the FAA to propose new rules that would affect future Virgin Galactic flights and it will be very interesting to see how Congress and the FAA and industry respond Howard said The FAA did not immediately comment Monday The agency is able to initiate a rulemaking process that would affect the design or operation of a spacecraft involved in a fatal accident but is unlikely to do so before the end of the NTSBs investigation The Associated Press contributed to this report,0.7,0,0

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/11/04/poll-shows-teachers-parents-give-common-core-low-marks/,us,Much of the opposition to Common Core appears to be rooted in its emphasis on standardized testing APAP Teachers and parents are not giving high marks to Common Core according to a series of new polls which show widespread dissatisfaction with the national curriculum standards in the first months of widespread implementation A poll released last week by Gallup which is conducting an extensive series of surveys on Common Core found that nearly twothirds of public school teachers have concerns about the program which is designed to implement a national math and English learning baseline for all participating states An earlier survey conducted as part of the same project found that 44 percent of teachers view Common Core negatively ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT The national polling data reveals more bad news for the Common Core because 60 to 65 percent of Americas teachers are either frustrated or worried by it only 20 percent of teachers are enthusiastic and 44 percent of teachers now view Common Core negatively Jamie Gass director of the Center for School Reform at the Bostonbased think tank Pioneer Institute said to FoxNewscom Common Core has been in the works since 2009 but is only this year being rolled out in schools across the country The debut has brought a backlash from parent groups teachers unions and even several state legislatures which have repealed decisions to participateThe poll found opposition to Common Core among parents growing since last year with 35 percent of parents opposing it and 33 percent viewing it positively In April a survey determined that 35 percent of parents were in favor and 28 percent opposed  One Michigan high school teacher But while parental opposition appears to be growing as the standards are put in play a close look at the Gallup data shows that teachers who are most familiar with Common Core particularly those who began to implement the standards last year are most likely to have positive opinions of it In schools where the Common Core standards were fully implemented in the 20132014 school year 61 percent view it positively One of the real sources of anxiety regarding Common Core is the standardized testing that measures performance on the benchmark curriculum Parents are increasingly having their children opt out of the testing and teachers have long objected to heavy emphasis on standardized tests complaining that it encourages them to simply teach to the test The standards were positive until standardized testing was involved said one Michigan high school teacher who took part in Gallups survey A summary of the poll underscored the suspicion with which teachers view standardized testing From their vantage point on educations front lines US public school teachers see the potential for problems with the computer testing of students that has become integral to the Common Core program reads a summary from the poll The majority of teachers in Common Core states indicate that the students they work with lack the level of typing and computer skills needed to perform well on the tests And nearly half say their school is illprepared when it comes to the computer hardware or network capabilities needed to administer them Although 46 states initially signed on to all or part of Common Core Indiana Oklahoma and South Carolina have repealed it and similar movements are underway in Missouri North Carolina and Louisiana Alaska Nebraska Texas and Virginia never signed on Officials at the Council of Chief State School Officersone of the two organizations that devised the standards says that that the results show that Common Core will work when properly implemented These survey results show what we have seen happening in classrooms across the country Carissa Moffat Miller deputy executive director for CCSSO told FoxNewscom The more time teachers spend with the Common Core State Standards the more they understand how these standards will help improve learning for all children,0.7,0,0

centre in the Port Loko Government Hospital for those suspected of having Ebola virus disease at the balcony of a community centre in Foredugu Port Loko District October 8 2014 Kamaras wife and other family members also suspected of having Ebola virus disease had passed away the day before More than 4000 people have died of the viral haemorrhagic fever in West Africa mostly in Liberia neighbouring Sierra Leone and Guinea Picture taken October 8 2014 REUTERSChristopher BlackWHOHandout via Reuters Ebola fears are calming in the United States but in embattled West African countries like Liberia Guinea and Sierra Leone the disease still conjures up fear and isolation even when it comes to its smallest survivors While reports from the World Health Organization WHO suggest new infections are slowing in Liberia the country hardest hit by the disease the number of children orphaned by Ebola continues to rise along with the death toll nearly 5000 people as of Friday ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Our orphanages are full right now so we are not able to take in more children Kay Knapp a US liaison at Lifesong for Orphans Liberia a Christian nonprofit that runs orphanages in several developing nations told FoxNewscom in an emailThe estimates from our directors are that there are 2000+ children newly orphaned as a result of Ebola in Liberia alone Nearly 4000 children in Liberia Guinea and Sierra Leone have lost one or both parents to Ebola according to the United Nations Childrens Fund UNICEF and many are being rejected by their surviving relatives Death and disease are not novel in developing countries like Liberia where aid groups have been working for decades to help improve access to quality health care and orphans are often taken in by members of their extended families But all bets are off during this unprecedented Ebola crisis and in some communities fear outweighs family ties Our director tells us that we need to house these children off campus for six months to a year before people will believe that they pose no threat to others Knapp said  Its a huge stigmatization in this culture We are currently seeking funding to house 10 of these children in an apartment or house with caregivers who are Ebola survivors Save the Children a nonprofit aimed at providing health care for mothers and their children has been working diligently with the Liberian government to set up interim care centers to monitor children orphaned by the disease through their 21day quarantine period But with fear and stigma gripping communities in the Ebola hot zone survivors are often the only people willing to care for them The community is afraid of them Greg Ramm country director for Save the Children in Liberia told FoxNewscom Weve seen people who have survived being shunned by their communities  Were working hard to let people know that if youre a survivor youre actually safe But thats a long hard struggle in the midst of a crisis Knapp said volunteers for Lifesong for Orphans Liberia are working with local pastors and aid organizations to find places for children whose families have rejected them Our directors have also been involved in what they call Love in Action where we have sent funding to provide sanitary supplies Ebola education and food for families and individuals affected Knapp said More than 500 families have been helped in the last few months If we receive more donations we will continue to provide staple food items like rice oil flour and sugar to affected families some of whom are headed by children In Kenema Sierra Leone 35 Ebola survivors recently met to share their experiences and learn to cope with the psychological trauma and stigmatization associated with having the disease according a UNICEF press release The meeting marked the first in a series of events to enlist the help of those now immune to the disease in educating and caring for Ebola stricken communities A recent survey of 1400 households throughout Sierra Leone found that 96 percent reported some sort of discriminatory attitudes toward those suspected or confirmed to have Ebola and 76 percent said they would not welcome an Ebola survivor back into their community according to UNICEF Diseases making a comeback Stigmatization is not the only thing threatening the wellbeing of children who have already lost so much to Ebola Treatable diseases are making a comeback in Ebolastricken countries where health care systems weakened by decades of civil war have crumbled and victims continue to overwhelm treatment centers Our directors tell us that many people are suffering and dying unnecessarily due to the breakdown of the health system Knapp said Diseases like malaria pneumonia and conditions causing severe diarrhea once considered death sentences for the young Liberian children afflicted with them have become opportunists during the Ebola crisis Weve been working for the last 20 years to fight malaria and end child deaths because of these things Ramm said Whats happened here is that Ebola has profoundly affected the health care system In a country where there is only one doctor for every 100000 patients according to Ramm a shortage of health care workers is just one of the reasons people are going without treatment for curable diseases Ive seen closed health clinics so in some ways its what you dont see that is telling the story Ramm said I know if they were open there would be mothers and babies there for treatment The rapid spread of Ebola in Liberia has forced the closure of clinics due to contamination and potential patients fear contracting the disease at treatment centers inundated with victims And sometimes that fear goes both ways There are many clinics here that will not take people with a fever said Ramm Ive seen people asking for help and have seen survivors being shunned by the communities But Ramm said its not that these sick Liberians are being ignored Instead he said its that the health system in the country has almost collapsed on the back of Ebola There has been a problem for the last several months with vaccinations and with basic primary health care  With care of pregnant women and mothers and their babies he said There is a way to treat these other diseases if we can get clinics disinfected but that has been a challenge in the midst of this crisis However Ramm said he has seen signs of hope During a trip to one of the organizations recently reopened health clinics Ramm recalled seeing 15 new mothers and their babies receiving lifesaving vaccinations  something that had been all but lost when the Ebola crisis started wreaking havoc on the region As clinics begin to slowly reopen Save the Children is working to help implement infection control measures and train health workers on how to protect themselves and stop the spread of the disease Trying to rebuild In late September Save the Children finished constructing a 70bed Ebola treatment center in Bong county Liberia a rural area more than 100 miles outside the nations capital Bong is one of the five counties in Liberia worst affected by the outbreak which experts say could claim up to 14 million lives by January In partnership with International Medical Corps the organization built another treatment center in Margibi county complete with isolation wards and highly trained medical personnel to provide some relief to the countrys mainstream health care services that outside of Monrovia have shut down because of the deadly toll they have taken on health care workers But until recently the sheer volume of patients were overwhelming treatment centers which did not have enough beds to accommodate all of the sick according to Ramm With infection rates on the decline while there is still a need for new Ebola treatment centers caring for the sick has become much more manageable The nice thing about these units is theyre protected and safe but they have chainlink fences so family can come and talk with sick family members said Ramm And if someone dies they can come and watch the burial which is something that is really important to these communities I think one of the hardest things is they worry about is whether the body will be treated with dignity Early on in the outbreak experts identified burial practice as a major contributing factor in the rapid spread of the disease According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC 50 to 70 percent of new Ebola infections occur during the burial of victims In the absence of an undertaker Ramm said Liberians often clean the bodies themselves to give their loved ones a proper burial You kiss the body you wash the body you touch the body  but its at the moment of death that the body is most infectious Ramm said The viral load is the highest because theyve probably been hemorrhaging for some time before death and unfortunately in the absence of protective gear its a very dangerous thing to do in the presence of Ebola Overcoming the stigma Small successes have been seen through the collective efforts by aid groups and government organizations to encourage safe burial practices in some of the regions hit hard by the outbreak United Nations ambassador Samantha Power reported a drop in new infections Sunday in places where US and British aid workers are providing support and education to community members Everywhere you go now people are not shaking hands to protect themselves and people are washing their hands Ramm said And its those steps along with the treatment centers which will help to stop this disease Aid groups and government agencies alike have stressed the need for health care workers from all over the world to come to the region to lend their expertise In many cases the nurses and doctors here have been absolutely heroic in the way they have treated tirelessly the people in their communities Ramm said But they need to be able to do that in safe circumstances and we know how to do that now The two priorities are to care for people with dignity and give them a chance to survive Ramm added But the most important thing we can do to prevent deaths here is to keep it from spreading because once you have it the odds are against you he said Click here to learn how you can help Save the Children Click here for more on UNICEFs Ebola response

Scott appointed to the seat vacated by Jim DeMint in December 2012 will now serve out the final two years of the term Its a historic moment With his victory Scott will be the first African American elected to the Senate from a former Confederate state since the end of Reconstruction Republicans are aiming for a big election night as polls continue to close in other states  hoping that two years of intensive campaigning will net them the six seats they need to take over the Senate even as top Democrats vow their ground game ultimately will keep the Senate in their hands Voters headed to the polls Tuesday in every state to decide hundreds of congressional races and thousands at the state legislative level At stake are 435 House seats 36 Senate seats and another 36 gubernatorial races  The US Senate battle with control of Capitol Hill at stake is the most closely watched If Republicans win and keep the House it gives them full control of Congress during President Obamas last two years in office The Obama factor may weigh heavily over the vote Tuesday night Fox News Exit Polls show more than a third of voters  34 percent  said they voted to show theyre opposed to Obamas policies That number was a bit higher in 2010 By contrast just 20 percent voted to show support for Obama Fortyfive percent said it was not a factor The economy is by far the biggest issue for voters 43 percent said it was the most important issue Of those worried about the direction of the economy they voted for the Republican candidate by a 20point difference exit polls show Republicans are thought to have locked down three of the Senate races Montana South Dakota and West Virginia Most the campaigning and the big money in recent months have concentrated on roughly 10 competitive contests Seven were for seats held by Democrats in Alaska Arkansas Colorado Iowa Louisiana New Hampshire and North Carolina Three were for seats held by Republicans in Georgia Kansas and Kentucky Surprise developments colored the elections in several states  most notably the Democratic candidates decision to drop out of the race for Senate in Kansas His decision immediately boosted independent Greg Orman in his race against longtime GOP Sen Pat Roberts who until that race shakeup was leading in the polls In Kentucky Grimes also suffered a PR blow after she repeatedly refused to say whether she voted for Obama In the final days of the race both campaigns turned to accusing each other of putting out inappropriate mailers Theres a possibility America wont even know the outcome on election night Latetallied votes from rural Alaska and a likely runoff in Louisiana between Democratic Sen Mary Landrieu and Republican challenger Rep Bill Cassidy  and a possible runoff in the Georgia race where a nominee must get 50 percent of the votes to win  could keep control of the Senate undecided for days or even until next year On the House side all 435 House seats are on the ballot Of them 233 are held by Republicans and 199 held by Democrats The other three races are for vacant seats Democrats would need 17 seats to take the majority an unlikely possibility Rather Republicans are expected to pick up at least five more seats At the state level nearly a dozen US governors are considered in political peril making it one of the toughest years for incumbent governors in decades",0.7,0,0

Crist campaign files motion to extend voting hours in Florida county 730 pm ET The campaign for the Democratic candidate forFlorida governor has filed an emergency motion to extend voting hours in one Florida county saying issues at polling places have left many unable to cast a ballot ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Charlie Crists campaign filed a motion Tuesday night with a Florida state court requesting voting hours be extended in Broward County from 700 pmto 900 pm The campaign said several individual and systemic breakdowns have caused issues for voters attempting to cast their ballots In one example the campaign said a polling place at an elementary school was offline for over an hour and a half Tuesday morning which caused major delays The campaign also said malfunctions with the machines that were checking in voters had led to widespread problems and some voters gave up attempting to cast a ballot The campaign said that they made a similar request to the Broward County Supervisor of Elections but it was denied Crist the states former Republican governor is trying to unseat GOP incumbent Rick Scott Voting irregularities reported in multiple states 600 pm ET Voting irregularities have been reported in several states with polls about to close  In Connecticut  where voters are choosing candidates for governor Congress the state legislature and other offices  several polling places didnt receive printed ballots in time for the 6 am start of voting The issue prompted Democratic Gov Dannel Malloy to ask a state judge to extend voting hours in Hartford where the problem was reported Malloy said the problem caused him to vote about 35 minutes late and may have discouraged others from casting ballots His Republican challenger Tom Foley said theres no legitimate reason to extend voting hours in the capital city Problems also were reported in a few other towns including Wolcott where one polling place ran low on ballots briefly Irregularities with voting machines meanwhile were detected in Virginia in places like Virginia Beach and Newport News According to Republican Rep Scott Rigell the incumbent competing against Democrat Suzanne Patrick in the 2nd District voting machines were switching electronic votes from Republican to Democrat Because of a machine malfunction we have had reports of nearly 40 different polling locations in which voters are attempting to vote for me and it comes up as our opponent Rigell said in a mass email sent to voters Tuesday afternoon This disenfranchisement of voters strikes at the very heart of our republic  We are urging you to vote and check the summary page on your voting machine prior to casting your ballot Rigell included a video taken in Virginia Beach in which an electronic machine appears to select Patrick even though the voter taps the machine to select Rigell Representatives from the Virginia Department of Elections told Watchdogorg they are aware of the issue and said faulty touchscreen machines were removed immediately In a statement obtained by the VirginiaPilot the department said the problem appears to be with the AccuVote TSX Touch Screen voting machines and involves touch screen calibration Patricks campaign in contrast said they had received a very low and limited number of complaints In all cases the problem was resolved quickly and the voter walked away satisfied that each had cast his or her ballot successfully Patricks campaign manager Michelle Gajewski said in a statement provided to the newspaper In South Dakota officials announced first results wont be reported until 10 pm ET tonight because one countys polls opened an hour late Secretary of State Jason Gant posted a tweet announcing that results would be delayed an hour because polls in Shannon County did not open until 8 am Because state law required that polling locations stay open for 12 hours statewide results wont be reported until later Kansas Republican pounces on Biden claim

undated image posted on a militant website shows Abu Khattab alKurdi or Abu Khattab the Kurd one of the Islamic State groups top military commanders in the offensive on the Syrian city of Kobani APJihadis website BEIRUT  Ethnic Kurds are helping members of the Islamic State group in the battle for the key Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani sharing their knowledge of the local terrain and language with the extremists according to Iraqi and Kurdish officials It is not clear how many Kurds are aiding the estimated 3000 Islamic State militants in the Kobani area  and fighting against their own Kurdish brethren  but activists say they are playing a major role in the 7weekold conflict near the Turkish border ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT A top military commander for the extremists in the town is an Iraqi Kurd known by the nom de guerre of Abu Khattab alKurdi helping them in the battle against fellow Kurds Officials with the main Syrian Kurdish force known as the Peoples Protection Units or YPG say they became aware of the Kurds among the mostly Sunni Muslim extremists early in the fighting As Kurdish fighters were defending the nearby Syrian village of Shiran in September two Kurdish men with different accents and wearing YPG uniforms infiltrated their ranks Kurdish officials said Upon questioning however they were captured and admitted to fighting for the Islamic State group the officials added Iraqi and Kurdish officials say many of the Kurdish fighters with the Islamic State group are from the northeastern Iraqi town of Halabja which was bombed with chemical weapons by Saddam Husseins forces in 1988 killing some 5000 people Shorsh Hassan a YPG spokesman in Kobani said although most of the Kurdish jihadi fighters come from Iraq some are from Syrian regions such as Kobani Afrin and Jazeera He added that the number of Syrian Kurds is small compared with the dozens of Iraqis fighting with the IS group The fighter who is from Kobani is not like someone who hails from Chechnya with no idea about tracks and roads Hassan said Thousands of militants from all over the world  including north Africans Asians and some Westerners  have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join the ranks of the Islamic State group Turkish nationals are among them but it is unknown if any are fighting in Kobani Hassan said many of the Iraqi fighters were from Halabja including alKurdi Websites affiliated with the Islamic State group recently published several photographs of the young bearded man including some of him wearing the traditional Kurdish garb of baggy pants and others of him standing in front of Kurds killed in Kobani In Baghdad an Iraqi security official said alKurdi was a member of Ansar alIslam a Sunni militant group with ties to Abu Musab alZarqawi the late leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq who was active in the early 2000s AlKurdi later joined the Islamic State group the official said The Iraqi official said alKurdi is also from Halabja and is wanted by Iraqi authorities He refused to give the mans real name when pressed by The Associated Press Our latest information is that he is in Syria fighting in the Kobani area He is an expert in mountainous areas the Iraqi official said speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media He is commanding the Kurdish group within Daesh because he is a Kurd he added using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group Halabja was known as a secular village and the home of Abdullah Goran one of the bestknown Kurdish poets in the 20th century and a member of the Iraqi Communist Party But in the past three decades Muslim preachers have become active and have turned it into one of Iraqi Kurdistans most religiously conservative areas Still most of the Kurds are moderate and secularleaning Muslims Many Kurds in Iraq were stunned when they learned that Kiwan Mohammed the 25yearold goalkeeper of Halabjas soccer team was killed last month in Syria while fighting for the Islamic State group in Kobani Mohammed was identified by jihadi websites as Abu Walid alKurdi Dana Jalal an Iraqi journalist who follows jihadi groups said the Iraqi athlete left Syria in July 2013 and had not been heard of until his death Some 70 Iraqi Kurds mostly from Halabja went to fight in Syria with the Islamic State group Jalal said Most go through Turkey where they say they are going for tourism but theu then they cross into Syria and some even take their wives with them Jalal added Nawaf Khalil the Europebased spokesman for Syrias powerful Kurdish Democratic Union Party said Kurdish fighters within the Islamic State group are invaluable in the Kobani battle because they know the geography as well as the language and the mentality of fellow Kurds A main part of their work is tapping electronic surveillance and intelligencegathering They might be also using some from the Kobani area to benefit from the geographical knowledge of the area he said Mustafa Bali a Kurdish activist in Kobani said that by having Kurdish fighters Islamic State extremists are trying to win the hearts and minds of Syrian Kurds in the area Daesh is trying to tell the people of Kobani that it does not consider them enemies and its fighters include Kurds Bali said,0.7,0,0

Abbott plans to defy Fort Lauderdales ordinance against feeding the homeless again on Wednesday Courtesy SunSentinel Fort Lauderdale police say Arnold Abbott violated a new city law but the 90yearold homeless advocate says his only crime was to love thy neighbor Abbott was charged Sunday along with two local pastors with violating the citys new ordinance that effectively bans giving out food in public He faces 60 days in jail and a 500 fine and he intends to get cited again Wednesday night when he sets out to feed some of the Florida citys estimated 10000 homeless on a public beach ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT  Arnold Abbott homeless advocate I know that I will be arrested again and I am prepared for that Abbott said by phone from his office at Love Thy Neighbor Inc a nonprofit he established in honor of his wife Maureen after her death in a car accident 23 years ago I am my brothers keeper and what they are doing is just heartless Fort Lauderdale passed an ordinance late last month that included a slate of new regulations on where and how groups can provide food to homeless people The vote made the city the 13th in the nation since 2012 to pass restrictions on where people can feed the homeless according to a report by the National Coalition for the Homeless The regulations enacted in Fort Lauderdale state that no two indoor feeding sites can be within 500 feet of one another or on the same block outdoor feeding programs require a permit or permission of the property owner and must provide portable toilets and outdoor stations cannot be within 500 feet of residential properties Abbott whose charity has battled city officials for years in court and on the streets of the southern Florida city said the toilet requirement was too much for his group I have tried to abide by their regulations but we just are not able to provide a portapotty he said I believe that is the job of the municipality anyway Cited along with Abbott were Dwayne Black pastor of The Sanctuary Church in Fort Lauderdale and Mark Sims of St Mary Magdalene Episcopal Church in Coral Springs according to the Fort Lauderdale SunSentinel Although the three were not handcuffed or taken to jail they were cited and must appear in court or face a bench warrant Fort Lauderdale officials defended the ordinance saying it does not bar people from helping the hungry The ordinance allows for legal clean and safe distribution of food to the homeless said Fort Lauderdale Police Department Det DeAnna Greenlaw For example if a minister priest or member of clergy wishes to provide food to the homeless at their establishment Ie community hall church or gathering place they can do so if the proper facilities as listed in the ordinance are in place  Supporters of the strict laws say that allowing programs like Abbotts encourages homelessness Cal Deal a 65yearold former journalist who videotapes homeless people in the city and says they commit crimes cause sanitation problems and need more help than simply food The people feeding them are enablers and they enable the homeless by making their lives easier Deal told the New Times of Broward County Hunger is a big motivator Are people more likely to seek help when theyre hungry or when theyre fed and happy Ron Book chairman of the MiamiDade County Homeless Trust told city lawmakers at the raucous Oct 21 meeting at which the new laws were passed that they would have a positive effect Feeding people on the streets is sanctioning homelessness Book said Whatever discourages feeding people on the streets is a positive thing Sims acknowledged that Fort Lauderdale has a problem with homelessness but said the answer isnt laws that make it hard to feed people Its not an easy issue not cut and dried Sims said But what is cut and dried is that people deserve to eat when they are hungry And people of faith are compelled to reach out to people who are in need We need to work harder to solve the problem rather than just shutting it down he added Abbott said there is a simple explanation for Fort Lauderdales outsize homeless population The homeless people come here for the weather he said They know they wont freeze to death in Fort Lauderdale Abbott a World War II veteran who won two Purple Hearts as an infantryman said he wont stop the fight he has dedicated to his wife She tried to help as many poor and homeless people as she could said Abbott a retired jewelry salesman who grew up in Philadelphia When I lost her I decided the best tribute to her would be a fulltime program in her name In addition to feeding the homeless Love Thy Neighbor operates a culinary training program that Abbott says has helped more than 400 people learn food service skills But the food programs have gotten him in trouble for years In 1999 the city tried to stop Abbott from feeding the homeless on Fort Lauderdale Beach the same location he plans to go to Wednesday Abbott sued and won and says he will go back to court if necessary Ill go to court again and sue the city said Abbott They are doing the bidding of the very wealthy and they are trying to sweep the poorest of the poor under the rug,0.7,0,0

Washington state since April 2014 is under renewed scrutinyAfter his arrest in July Brown 29 told detectives from both states that he was engaged in jihad and referred to the specific murder of one victim Brendan Tevlin as a just kill ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT  A 2004 JTTF investigation centered around Crescent Cuts a small barber shop owned by Ruben Shumpert a convicted drug dealer KCPQ13 PHOTO  Tevlin 19 was murdered in West Orange NJ on June 25 while sitting in his car at a traffic lightHe was shot eight times Besides Brown two other men have been arrested in Tevlins murder  Jeremy Villagran and Eric Williams Seattle authorities say ballistics link the same 9mm handgun that Brown used to kill Tevlin in New Jersey to three other homicide investigations in Washington stateOn June 1 23yearold Dwone AndersonYoung and 27yearold Ahmed Said were killed execution style as they sat inside a car in Seattle Wash  Brendan Tevlin seen with his mother  The same weapon was used to gun down 30yearold Leroy Henderson on April 27 as he walked the streets of Skyway Wash authorities say Two former FBI agents from the Joint Terrorism Task Force or JTTF revealed for the first time on a Fox News special Greta Investigates The Lone Wolves of Terror that they believe Ali Muhammad Brown may have traveled to one of the first terrorist training camps on US soil when he was a teenager Former FBI agents David Rubincam and David Gomez were interviewed by Fox News in Seattle David Gomez told Fox I believe Ali Muhammad Brown at some point traveled to Bly Ore prior to his arrest for financial institution fraud The JTTFexecuted 19 search and arrest warrants in November 2004 after a 30month investigation which became known as the Ranier Valley Roundup No one including Brown was charged with terrorism  Ahmed Said  Gomez recalled the case The objective is to make money so they were involved in trying to raise money for themselves but they were also raising money for a jihadist movement in Seattle There is a quote in the indictment that says you cant go to war broke  The JTTF investigation centered around Crescent Cuts a small barber shop frequented by Brown The shop was owned by Ruben Shumpert a convicted drug dealer familiar to Gomez and other members of law enforcement Ruben Shumpert was a prison convert to Islam noted Gomez He learned to cut hair in prison Ruben would not only cut hair but was attempting to indoctrinate a lot of the youth into radical forms of Islam by showing them videos about the 911 hijackers and Al Qaeda Gomez added in 2004 with Ali Muhammad Brown what we were looking at was the raising of funds for overseas material support of terrorism He Brown was convicted of fraudulently producing checks depositing them into accounts and spending the money basically  Leroy Henderson  Brown was sentenced to two years in prison but only served 84 daysHe would lead a life of depraved crime and violenceWashington state court records from 2012 obtained by Fox News show Brown was charged with child rape before pleading guilty to three lesser counts of communication with a minor for immoral purposes Ruben Shumpert went on to fight alongside terrorists Just prior to his sentencing in 2006 Shumpert wrote a 12page letter to US District Judge Marsha J PechmanIn it he claimed he was a changed man because of Islam and begged for leniency He also criticized news organizations including Fox News However Shumpert who was never asked to surrender his US passport never showed up for his sentencing Shumpert fled to Somalia to fight for the Al Qaedaaffiliated group Al Shabaab From there Shumpert made taunting calls to the FBI team that had investigated him In 2008 reports of his death in a missile attack were reported by the SITE intelligence group SITE noted that Shumpert had been declared a martyr in an online jihadi magazine  Dwone AndersonYoung  It is clear that prior to the attacks of 911 the Pacific Northwest had become a lure to create a mujahadeen  and Al Qaedarelated training camp As early as 1999 Dog Cry Ranch near Bly Ore was envisioned as a jihadist training camp by Londons notorious radical Islamic cleric Abu Hamza alMasri The oneeyed handless alMasri 56 now faces sentencing before the US Attorneys Southern District of New York following his conviction in May 2014 on 11 federal terrorism charges These convictions include some related to the plans for the Oregon ranch Testifying this spring at alMasris trial was James Ujaama one of the clerics most devoted followers Ujaama was familiar to the Crescent Cuts barber shop in Seattle and had attended Ingraham High School Now in his late 40s Ujaama testified in April that he wrote and sent a fax to alMasri in 1999 stating the land we spoke of is about 160 acres and looks just like Afghanistan Former FBI agent and Seattle Joint Terrorism Task Force member David Rubincam recalled Ujaama to Fox News James Ujaamas inspiration came not from videos of Abu hamza alMasri he actually went to the Finsbury mosque and was tutored by him in the ways of violent jihad and then attempted to bring that back that original group of converts some of whom stayed on and worked with Shumpert in the Crescent Cuts case They tried to set up a mujahedeen training camp here on US soil  Ali Muhammad Brown  Fox News also reviewed videos obtained by the Investigative Project on Terrorism showing Ujaama present with alMasri at the London mosque in 2000 In 2003 it was announced by thenUS Attorney General John Ashcroft and former Attorney General Michael Chertoff that James Ujaama pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide goods and services to the TalibanIn exchange for a twoyear prison sentence Ujaama was cooperating with the government in ongoing terrorism investigations  However after completing his sentence in 2005 Ujaama fled the US on a fake Mexican passportHe was arrested outside a mosque in Belize in December 2005 and returned to the United States Now still facing decades in prison with terrorism charges reinstated under seal Ujaama remains a key government witness in ongoing core Al Qaedarelated terrorism trials  And there was another visitor to the barber shop that interested members of the JTTF David Rubincam investigated Sheikh Mohamed Ibrahim then the imam of the Abu Bakr Mosque At the time the mosque was located 500 feet away from Crescent Cuts I had a piece of that investigation that involved an imam at the Abu Bakr MosqueRubincam explained A point of overlap between the investigations is the fact that the converts like Rubin Shumpert and others would attend AbuBakr Mosque And Sheikh Ibrahim the imam was also known We surveilled him actually going over to Crescent Cuts David Rubincam Remains certain about the radical motivation of the thenimam from the Abu BakrMosque  Sheikh Ibrahim  Former FBI Special Agent David Rubincam Hes an extremist religious zealot of the worst kindhe went to the University of alMadinah in Saudi Arabia He was educated as an Islamic religious scholar Rubincam said the imam was a member of the precursor to the Al Qaeda affiliate in Somalia AlShabaabHe was over here to raise money through the Hawala system of  of money transfer to fund them overseas and to recruit people to their cause to actually go back to Somalia to take up arms or go into Ethiopia and take up arms The imam was finally arrested in Seattle in late 2005 after returning from a trip to Texas says Rubincam As soon as we saw who he was meeting with in Dallas we thought OK you know what enough This you know hes meeting with other people that are kind of in the same line of work as him  Ruben Shumpert  Three months after Shumpert disappeared in 2006 to fight alongside terrorists in Somalia Sheikh Ibrahimwhose real name is Mohamad Dheere was deported because according to the immigration court the sheikh had no legal basis to remain in the US A public affairs spokesman for the Seattle office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE confirmed to Fox News that the sheikh was deported to Kenya his country of birth not Somalia Federal investigators say the sheikh lied in documents he signed in 2000 to obtain legal asylum in the United States  James Ujaama  Im glad that we dealt with it in immigration court Rubincam continued The best thing is to get him off our soil and get him out of here and never let him come backI am 100 percent certain 100  a national security threat to the United States of America or to any country in which he resides Ali Muhammad Brown who hung out at the barber shop is facing four murder charges in two states as police investigate his life thoroughly A Fox Newsrequest for an interview with Brown and his attorney were declinedBrown is currently held in New Jerseys Essex County jail Frank Cilluffo the director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute at George Washington University told Fox News the investigation is still playing outbut in this case I do think he would fit in the category of lone wolf because he did affiliate with others who were traveling to Somalia and in this case AlShabaab Christina Diaz Hall Angela

This is an ideal option for those who dont like to eat first thing or who get nauseated by the smell of food You could add fruit greens and nuts or seeds to boost your nutrient intake Drinking a protein shake within an hour of waking is a big part of my Three Weeks to Endless Energy program and my patients have seen remarkable results from making this one change only

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/11/04/november-2014-will-youth-sit-out-another-midterm-election/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+foxnews%2Fopinion+%28Internal+-+Opinion+-+Mixed%29,opinion," In recent weeks both the Democratic and Republican parties have engaged in lastditch efforts to sway young voters in the 2014 midterm electionsa fleeting election year trend that unfortunately is nothing new in politics

More than 20 million young Americans ages 1829 cast their vote in the last two presidential elections Both in 2008 and in 2012 young people voted at a turnout rate of nearly 50 percent and were a determining factor in electing and reelecting Barack Obama to the White House But 2010 was a different story as Democrats lost the House and national youth turnout was 24 on par with many previous midterm elections

Often political parties and campaigns have funds to do more voter outreach than the great majority of civic organizations that promote democratic participation While weve seen recent nationallevel party outreach and messaging to youth it may be too late for it to have a big influence on youth turnout in 2014 That is a missed opportunity as young voters are poised to play a potentially key role in some hotly contested states ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT In Alaska for example young people aged 1829 make up more than a quarter of the population In Colorado youth voter turnout has been around 30 percent in the last four midterm elections higher than the turnout rate for youth nationally Small projected margins of victory in competitive Congressional contests mean young voters could play a significant role

However it will take more than rhetoric and lastminute pleas to mobilize young people over the long term Young people are not a monolithic group they are a diverse crosssection of the country and political efforts must be equally diverse in order to appeal to their various ideological cultural and social perspectives Just as past campaigns were crafty at aggressively targeting seniors the same energy and thoughtful outreach is needed to attract young voters

That strategic political approach is starting to happen and efforts by both parties to court young voters at the national level are good for our democracy Republicans who lost the national youth vote in 2012 by 23 points and much more in some states are taking steps to try to reverse that trend However recent lastminute efforts by both Republicans and Democrats to connect with young voters have been a mixed bag The Republican National Committee had launched a Campus Captains program to reach college students across the country and the College Republican National Committee also recently launched targeted outreach to young women And the Democratic National Committee has done campus outreach in Colorado where there are competitive House and Senate races underway and issues faced by millennials are part of many talking points

While these approaches may have garnered some media attention about each partys commitment to the youth vote merely winning news cycles about young voters is not the same as winning their actual votes over time What captures youth voters is what captures every other kind of voter building trust and consistency through steady investment as prominent national youth organizer Biko Baker argued in 2010 and other youth organizers have argued since

Our research at the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning  Engagement CIRCLE part of the Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service at Tufts University underscores Bakers point After President Obama won young voters in 2008 we analyzed national survey data from 2010 to try to understand how 2008 influenced 2010 We found that a substantial proportion of registered young voters had simply not been mobilized This kind of inconsistent investment shows up at the polls when young people dont

Campaigns need to engage young people in a meaningful way that includes opportunities for youth to voice their opinions interact with peers and take an active roleconcerted efforts and concrete opportunities for political engagement over time These principles and best practices have been developed and used effectively for many years by youth organizations and could prove invaluable to campaigns and committees who have the resources to implement them

As we enter the final weeks of the midterm election cycle campaigns would do well to reach out to youth at the state and district level and to develop a sustained and serious plan to reach out to them between elections Otherwise campaigns run the risk of leaving a crucial part of the electorate registered to vote but sitting at home Abby Kiesa is a Researcher and Youth Coordinator at the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement CIRCLE the nations premiere nonpartisan think tank on youth civic engagement based at Tufts Universitys Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service  Abby Kiesa is a Researcher and Youth Coordinator at the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement CIRCLE the nations premiere nonpartisan think tank on youth civic engagement based at Tufts Universitys Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service  + FollowFoxNewsOpinion on Facebook",0.7,0,0

class president ends up in Washington I should know I am one With so many high school political types here it is no surprise that Washington politics seems like one big high school drama played out on a national stage ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Political conventions are the proms Election Day is the graduation and the election night coverage on cable news is the yearbook The school year is not yet over so we cant yet close the book on the political Class of 2014 But with days to go and hundreds of millions of dollars spent here are my top awards for the 2014 campaign and this years midterm elections Best campaign surrogate Shared award Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren for the Democrats and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul for the Republicans The award for most sought after surrogate goes to Jeb Bush for Republicans and Bill and Hillary Clinton for the Democrats But for congressional candidates seeking a national partisan figure sure to draw crowds raise money and spill newspaper ink by the barrel then Elizabeth and Rand were your first calls this campaign season Both of these senators have their fingers firmly on the pulse of their parties bases They both speak in a way that resonates deeply with the party faithful and gets them excited to be on the blue or red team Midterm elections can be sleepy Warren and Paul have reliably rallied the troops by reminding them to write the checks make the phone calls and canvass the neighborhoods Sen Warren speaks to the heart of the Democrats belief in economic populism social justice and a return to the progressive roots of the Democratic Party She rails against the greed of the big banks and Wall Street raiders who make money by exploiting hardworking middleclass Americans She is an FDR Democrat who wants the government to protect the middle class from these forces and give them a fighting chance Her newly released book in actually titled A Fighting Chance Sen Paul speaks to the GOP heart His calls for a limited government and a return to strict Constitutionalist principles are red meat to the conservative base of the GOP at a time when many Republicans are mistrustful of President Obamas foreign policy and wary of getting involved in another war in the Middle East That is why Sen Pauls isolationist view of foreign policy is making inroads on the GOPs right wing It is no wonder both senators are talked about as presidential candidates for their parties And after this election they will both have collected plenty of political chits from party members all over the country Worst campaign surrogate given in absentia Sorry to say it but the political analyst in me has to give the award to President Barack Obama Heres how The Washington Post began an article about the President on October 10 For the first time in this election season President Obama on Thursday actively campaigned with a congressional candidate The Post wrote What would normally be an ordinary campaign ritual stood out as an extraordinary event because sagging popularity and multiple foreign crises have rendered the president a noshow on the 2014 campaign trail Even some Democrats who hold nearly identical policy positions  have opted not to appear beside him The failure of Democrats to point out that congressional Republicans are less popular than the president is puzzling They have allowed themselves to be put on the defensive even though the president can claim the economy is vastly improved under his watch wars are ending and more people have health care Strangest advertising  In Georgias Senate race the Republican David Perdue ran an ad that tied the Democrat Michelle Nunn to terrorists because she once worked with a charity and some of its aid went to Muslims The factchecking group Politifact gave the ad its worst possible rating for being an outright distortion Strangest claims  Domenic Recchia a Democrat running for Congress in Staten Island NY claimed to have foreign policy experience because he once hosted a foreign exchange student Cory Gardner the Senate candidate in Colorado claimed in a debate that he does not support a Personhood bill that gives rights to fetuses But Gardner voted for a bill in the state legislature to do just that Best executed campaign Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capitos campaign for US Senate in West Virginia Capito is poised to become the first female US senator in West Virginias history with strong fundraising and avoiding extreme political positions As a result Capito may be on the verge of ending the domination of state politics by the Democratic Party machine built by retiring Democrat Sen Jay Rockefeller and the late Sen Robert Byrd Polls show Capito leading her opponent Democratic Secretary of State Natalie Tennant by double digits If Capito wins look for her senior Senator Joe Manchin a Democrat to seriously consider pulling a Jim Jeffords and switching parties to caucus with the Republicans Manchin is already one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate and sometimes angers his own party by voting with the GOP If a Republican Senate Majority Leader could promise Manchin a Senate committee chairmanship that might be enough to bring him over Biggest surprise As Thomas Frank might say Whats the Matter with Kansas Both Kansas Republican Gov Sam Brownback and senior Republican Senator Pat Roberts are in danger of humiliating defeat this November Since taking office Gov Brownback has been wildly unpopular because of his draconian cuts to the state budget particularly education spending His cuts are so radical and so unpopular that 100 current and former elected officials came together calling themselves Republicans for Kansas Values and trashed Brownback by publicly endorsing his Democratic opponent Paul Davis Polls show the race a dead heat in a state that Mitt Romney won in 2012 by 20 percentage points Sen Pat Roberts also is in trouble He has been in Congress since 1981 He thought his troubles were over when he dispatched Tea Party candidate Milton Wolf in his GOP primary But now there is an independent candidate named Greg Orman pulling votes from both Roberts and his Democratic opponent The Democrat withdrew from the race knowing that his supporters would flock to Orman That is why Kansas Republicans are desperate to keep the Democrat on the ballot despite his wishes Polls show Orman slightly ahead in a headtohead matchup against Roberts Smallest surprise Unlike Kansas we should have all seen this one coming The Louisiana Senate race between Republican Rep Bill Cassidy and incumbent Democratic Sen Mary Landrieu is likely to be so close that it will end in a runoff election that wont take place until December Another independent candidate Rob Maness is enough of a factor that neither Cassidy nor Landrieu may clear the threshold mandated by the states constitution In the event of a runoff in the Pelican State we may not know if the Republicans got the 51 votes they needed to take over the Senate until December We may not know that we dont know until well after midnight on election night So there you have it Be sure to keep these superlatives in mind when

Barack Obama gestures toward the crowd after participating in a roundtable discussion with working parents small business owners students and faculty Friday Oct 31 2014 at Rhode Island College in Providence RI AP PhotoStephan Savoia There are a number of basic questions that will be answered very soonWe will know if Democratic control of theSenatecontinues and what kind of support President Obama willhavefor his agenda overthe next two years Crucially we will know whether we will get any compromise or conciliation before we elect a new president in 2016 ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT If the past six years area good guide  and I believe they are  were most likely to see more of the same Confrontation and discord will continue to characterize interparty dealings and even intraparty dealings Divisions within both the Democrats and Republicans were on full display during the midtermswith challenges from Tea Party and Independent candidates highlighting a lack of cohesive ideology and shared sense of purpose on both sides of the aisle It follows that evenifRepublicans controltheSenate the most likely outcome as final polling shows tossup races across the country steadily shifting toward the Republicans  it is unlikely that they will be able to govern effectively This is partly due to internal divisions that will make it difficult to come together in support of an agenda  orsignificant bills for that matter Compounding this problem is the fact that its extremely unlikely that President Obama will bedoinganything otherthan vetoing Republican bill after Republican bill Considering that the president has shown little interest in compromising with Republican lawmakers over the course of his tenure evenwhen Democrats had at least some control of the House I cant imagine a scenario wherein the legislation Republicans come up with on their own will become law Key figures in the Republican leadership have acknowledged that theyre going to have to change the way they operate in order to take advantage of controlling both chambers House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthybluntly told a group of donors I do know this If we dont capture the House stronger and the Senate and prove we could govern there wont be a Republican president in 2016 In an interview with the Atlantics Molly Ball Ohio Sen Rob Portman said that a Republicancontrolled Senate would be committed to working with President Obama Portman mentioned tax reform a grand bargain on the budget an energy budget  perhaps something that combines Keystone XL pipeline approval with reductions in carbon emissions  and new free trade agreements There is much to be excited about in the agenda that Sen Portman laid out But theres also very little reason to think that anything like that would even get enough Republican support to get to President Obamas desk And then theresObamas preference togovern by executive order which is top of mind for the Republicans and even some Democrats The presidents promise todelivercomprehensive immigration reform after the election byway ofexecutive orderhas naturally ruffled feathers McCarthyleft open the possibility of an immigration overhaul but added that if the president approached it by executive order it would stop everything Judging by the presidents attitude I think were headed forthe stop everything scenario as well as the possibility of a constitutional crisis and a renewed push for impeachment In other words w e will be right back where we started The Republicans will continue to seek to repealObamaCareAnd there will be more investigations by the Republicans likethe oneswe saw with the IRS NSA and Benghazi Truth be told theres no reason for the Republicans to do anything differently If they take the Senate they will have managed to win the election without a clear plan or strategy The New York Times panned their socalled economic plan as just a bunch of small ideasandRepublicanshave yet tooffera meaningful reform package for health care or immigration reform It follows that the Republicantakeawayfrom thisvictorywill bethat the way to win in 2016 iswithmore attacks So whats at stakeEverything and nothing

 In this Jan 3 2001 file photo thenPresident Bill Clinton left and daughter Chelsea hold a Bible during a mock swearingin for freshman Sen Hillary Rodham Clinton DNY by Vice President Al Gore in Washington AP PhotoHillery Smith Garrison File To answer whats at stake for Republicans in the 2014 election lets dispense with the obvious assuming the GOP walks away with majority control of both halves of Congress it means passing real federal budgets instead of cliffhanger stopgap resolutions properly putting judicial and administrative nominees through their paces and forcing President Obamas hand on legislation heretofore unable to reach his desk so far Obama has issued the fewest vetoes since Warren Harding However all of thats lowhanging political fruit For Republicans the bigger challenge is identity ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Is the GOP destined to remain the alpha dog kenneled at the eastern end of Pennsylvania Avenue Or can it get back in the business of winning presidential elections and get off the congressional leash by coming up with a strategy that ironically capitalizes on the GOPs dominance of Capitol Hill Whats at stake in 2014 Try this getting the partys act together in time for 2016 By the time President Obama completes his final term and leaves office Democrats will have occupied the White House for 16 of the 24 years since Bill and Hillary Clinton first moved to Washington Republicans will have controlled one or both chambers of Congress for 18 of those 24 years Now consider the partisan rolereversal that went on from 1954 to 1994 Democrats controlled one or both congressional chambers for the entire fourdecade stretch Republicans controlled the White House for 26 of the 40 years And with that control came real accomplishments Eisenhower built highways Nixon went to China Reagan and Bush concluded the Cold War the younger Bush led a war on terror Feel free to name four things as remotely transformative over the past 20 years of Republican congressional influence So how do Republicans go about this image makeover Three suggestions Futility Is Not An Option Opinions differ as to where a Republican Congress should proceed  taxes military energy education Whatever the topic there should be one qualifier dont spin Congress wheels over futile gestures In that category repealing ObamaCare the president will never give up his signature accomplishment a constitutional amendment preventing judges from overturning samesex marriage bans the votes arent there to pass it or survive a presidential veto After 20 years of being portrayed as Washingtons henchmen congressional Republicans should know that they suffer from media stereotyping  a party thats angry punitive and will use the next two years to engage in zeropolitics Why foster that image Extend an Olive Branch to Obama Conservatives hate the notion as it suggests capitulation The point is while Barack Obamas approval rating has hovered around 40 percent in this election Republicans stand to inherit an institution only half as popular as the campaigntoxic president So theres an urgency to seizing the political high road and being seen as the more adult branch of government  even if the president rebuffs the overture Republicans can at least say they tried Obama like Bill Clinton may emerge from Tuesday night a wounded partisan warrior But the president remains a formidable figure he has a bully pulpit his inkfilled pen makes him the towns lastword freak And as with Clinton and the GOP Congress back in the 1990s policy fights have a way of turning into PR fights pitting a likeable individual versus an unlikeable institution Disadvantage GOP Congress On that note finding likeable faces    Replace Upperclassmen With Freshmen There will likely be three GOP senatorselect by this time next week Arkansas Tom Cotton Iowas Joni Ernst Colorados Cory Gardner All three were born in the 1970s all bring a younger and a more vibrant image long missing among GOP senators not that Harry Reid is sweetness and light While Gardner and Cotton currently are sitting members of the House the three are not seen as of Washington as are the GOPs older Senate bulls And they can add a new perspective  whereas John McCain is a Vietnamera hawk Cotton and Ernst served respectively in Iraq Afghanistan and the Gulf War The generational aspect is not to be taken lightly since 1980 the six GOP presidential nominees averaged 66 years in age With the exception of George W Bush all were grandfathers in a changing era of national elections when voters shifted their preference from eminence grise to older sibling A cynic can rightly note that congressional Democrats stormed back to power in 2006 and Barack Obama won the presidency without the need for a party makeover Perhaps history will also unfold the same way for Republicans Still the benefit of a big win on Tuesday would be a chance for the GOP to wise up grow up and move the party up Pennsylvania Avenue to a work address In that regard the stakes couldnt be much higher Bill Whalen is a research fellow at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution where he analyzes California and

Kurdish peshmerga fighters leave the outskirts of Suruc Turkey towards the TurkeySyria border on the way to the Syrian city of Kobani  Friday Oct 31 2014 The 10 peshmerga fighters from Iraq who entered the embattled northern Syrian town of Kobani one day earlier returned to Turkey Friday to prepare for their forces full deployment and a senior Kurdish official blamed Ankara for the delay AP PhotoVadim Ghirda WASHINGTON  There is finally some good news from Iraq that the Obama administration ought to celebrate Unfortunately the OTeam at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave and their fellow travelers in the socalled mainstream media appears to be oblivious to whats really happening on the ground in Mesopotamia For the potentates of the press the gruesome struggle for Kobani just a few hundred yards from the SyriaTurkey border is all that matters The visuals of less than 200 Iraqi Kurds transiting Turkish territory to reinforce their kinsmen in a desperate housetohouse battle against 5000 ISIS fighters and the occasional detonation of airdropped munitions in the frontier city have become The Story According to Official Spokesmen and unnamed Senior Officials at the White House and the Pentagon these events are signs of important progress in the effort to destroy ISIS ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Hogwash The sanguinary contest in Kobani is a distraction  in military parlance a diversion  created by Abu Bakr alBaghdadi the selfproclaimed Sunni Caliph of the Islamic State and his military planners  once officers in Saddam Husseins Republican Guards The real fight for the future of the entire region is taking place within the ethnically diverse provinces of Nineveh and Anbar in northern and western Iraq The population centers in these provinces Mosul Iraqs second largest city Fallujah Ramadi Haditha and alQaim were all targeted by ISIS They are not only places where US Marines Soldiers and SEALs won vicious battles they are also where we found our best allies during The Awakening in 200607 that led to victory in 2008 Thats not political spin I know Our Fox News War Stories team was there for all of it Regrettably the sacrifice of so much American blood and treasure was squandered during what our troops call The Obama Bug Out  when our commanderinchief ordered all US forces out of Iraq in December 2011  Do not despair Heres the good news  all but ignored by the international press corps and those who are comatose in official Washington The Sunni tribes in northern and western Iraq  our friends in the middle of the last decade  can once again be the lynchpin for defeating ISIS in this decade A new Awakening is now under way that may well be far more effective than pin prick coalition airstrikes Militarily it will have to be different than the campaign in 20062007 when small cells of Al Qaeda in Iraq were defeated by superior firepower and well coordinated operations by US forces and our allies Today the situation is reversed There are no US boots on the ground and ISIS is better organized supplied and led than the Iraqi Army or the Sunni tribal militias Last month the Albu Namir tribe tried to fight back against ISIS When they ran out of ammunition ISIS slaughtered more than 250 fighters and an untold number of civilians Simply arming the tribes in Anbar to fight ISIS separately would condemn them to extinction At this very moment however while news and diplomatic elites are diverted by whats happening in Kobani a conference of reasonable moderate antiISIS Sunnis is being organized in Irbil Iraq Instigated by Mudhar Shawkat a successful Sunni businessman and a leader of the antiSaddam Iraqi National Movement the conference to be convened later this year will aim to create an umbrella organization of Iraqi Sunnis to defeat ISIS In view of the fact that ISIS in Iraq is a Sunni reaction to persecution and economic deprivation under the Iraniancontrolled Baghdad government Shawkat argues that the Sunnis need to create their own institutions to give voice to their grievances and to protect the alienated Sunni populations in northern and western Iraq In short the solution to ISIS in Iraq should be a Sunni responsibility  To some this seems like mission impossible Shawkat and his allies working on the conference in Irbil today are well aware that moderate Iraqi Sunnis  by 2008 US allies  are now deeply demoralized and alienated Conference attendees already know the Obama administration is wedded at the hip with the new Shiite dominated proIranian government of Haider alAbadi in Baghdad They are cognizant that ISIS known as Daesh  to crush or the destroyer  in Arabic propaganda promotes alBaghdadi as the messiah who will save Sunni Islam from Shiite domination by the Ayatollahs in Tehran the Alawite alAssad dynasty in Damascus and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon None of this has deterred the willingness of those who come at great personal risk to Irbil to discuss Sunni action against ISIS The principal goal for the conference is to reignite Sunni loyalty among the young and prompt a willingness to fight for a realistic future instead of martyrdom in the ISIS jihad The question now is whether the US will do anything to help the Sunnis who were once our friends At the very least the Obama administration needs to get out of the way and let Shawkat and his allies devise a course of action against ISIS At the very best they should send General John Allen the administrations newly appointed Czar for destroying ISIS to Irbil to meet with Shawkat and fellow Sunni leaders with the mission of determining how we can help their cause It is after all in our national interest That would indeed be the best news of all But dont count on it Col Oliver L North ret serves as host of the

Did you know that in the 2010 midterm elections only 57 of Americas veterans voted With so much at stake in Americaand across the worldveterans left 93 million votes on the table Not to mention the tens of millions of military family memberswives husbands mothers and fatherswho also failed to execute their most basic civic task When compared to the nation average for midterm voter participation 38 the veterans participation number looks good But considering the sheer potential of the veterans population and taken in the context of their shared understanding of the fragile nature of freedoma 57 voter participation rate is unacceptable ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT In 2014 veterans have the opportunity to change this trendand the stakes have never been higher This year after six years of the Obama administration veterans and military families saw the direction of the country they fought for fly off the rails From the Department of Veterans Affairs VA scandal the gutting of the DoD budget the rise of ISIS in Iraq and Syria an evermounting national debt and the trade of one American deserter for five Taliban terroristsAmericas veterans have been put through the wringer left feeling betrayed by the nation they served Moreover in political race after political race veterans watch politicians attempt to falsely tout glaze over or racetodefend their supposed proveteran bona fides Veterans have been taken for grantedand used as campaignseason propsfor too long and this year was no exception No longer Its time for veterans and their families to take back their country and their legacyand it starts by going to the polls Tuesday to make their voice heard There are just shy of 22 million veterans in America alongside over 40 million Americans that are classified as military family members If properly targeted motivated and organized its a voting block60+ million strongthat could chart the future of this nation To illustrate my point consider North Carolinaa state where my group Concerned Veterans for America CVA has been pushing to Get Out The Vets as part of our GOTVets initiative In 2010 roughly 27 million North Carolinians voted Of those about 434000 were veterans16 of total voters If all 775000 Tarheel veterans had voted adding 341000 voters then veterans would have been 25 of the voting electorate Considering the 2010 North Carolina senate race was considered by a lesser marginand this years race is razor thinthese numbers really do matter And while its unlikely that every veteran will be mobilized to get to the polls it is possible to get a good chunk of additional veterans to the pollsas well as a member of their military family Veterans never serve alone and they shouldnt vote alone either Military families support our troops when theyre abroad and should vote to support them at home as well Properly organized North Carolina veterans and military family members could realistically represent 1 million total voters With onethird of the total voting block coming from veterans and their families North Carolina politicians would ignore exploit or patronize veterans at their peril But North Carolina is just one example The same can be said of veteran and military family populations in nearly every state in the unionincluding and especially other swing states like Ohio Florida and Virginia to name few The main excuse I hear from people as to why they dont vote is that voting doesnt make a difference and that one vote cant change a nation On the latter point theyre rightone vote cant change a nation just like one soldier cant fight alone When I was in Iraq if I went out on patrol by myselfIm toast But alongside the other 39 members of my lightinfantry platoon suddenly Im part of the most fearsome fighting force the world has ever seen United in moral purpose clarity and actionveterans can be the fearsome fighting force they were on the battlefield So while one vote rarely decides a race groups of veterans fighting united at home like they once did in battle would be a fearless force for the freedoms and prosperity we love The first ten months of 2014 were not good for America and her veterans but there is no reason why November 4armed with our ballots and shared purposewe cannot chart the course for a freer more prosperous and more secure America Veterans and our families must ask if not us then who And if not now then when If we dont stand up and fight then politicians will keep making empty promises our freedoms will continue to erode and our military will continue to suffer Its time we got up off the couchand exercise the right that millions of Americans have fought and died to defend Its time to vote Vote for your children Vote for your grandchildren Vote to honor those who died on the battlefield so that you could Vote for America Pete Hegseth is a Fox News contributor He is the CEO of Concerned Veterans for America and the former executive director of Vets for Freedom He is an

19 2012 Job seekers line up to speak to a recruiter during a job fair in Irving  TexasAP A nations first loyalty must be to its own citizens But the immigration policies of President Obama and Congressional Democrats help only billionaire special interests amnesty activists and the citizens of other countries  while reducing jobs and pay for our own ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Every single Senate Democrat voted for the Obamabacked plan to provide immediate work permits to 12 million illegal immigrants  allowing them to compete for any job in America This legislation would also double the rate at which lowwage guest workers are brought into the US to fill jobs throughout the economy Further the legislation would triple the rate of permanent immigration giving lifetime work permits and citizenship to over 30 million immigrants over the next ten years America already has the worlds most generous immigration policy The foreignborn population is at record levels quadrupling since 1970 Since 2000 the US has issued nearly 30 million lawful visas to foreign guest workers and permanent immigrants During that time all net employment gains among the workingage went to immigrant workers This large surplus of labor has also pulled down wages family incomes are down more than 3000 since 2009 alone Harvard Professor Dr George Borjas estimates that our current high immigration rates result in a wage loss of 402 billion every year for competing American workers Imagine then what will happen if we double the supply of foreign labor For many Americans who will be pushed out of the workforce altogether their wages will be reduced to zero Democrats running for Senate pour millions into ads complaining special interests have too much influence And yet every Senate Democrat candidate has voted for the crown jewel of the corporate lobbyist agenda mass amnesty and uncontrolled immigration Their plan is championed by open borders billionaires like Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg  global CEOs who dont think youre entitled to the same protections their gates and fences provide them In fact these immigration lobbyists have so little regard for you that they are meeting in secret with the White House right now to plan executive amnesty orders These orders planned for after the election would implement by executive fiat the sweeping amnesty that was rejected by the Republican House The planned order would include work permits for millions of illegal immigrants while substantially boosting the supply of new foreign labor taking precious jobs directly from struggling Americans Efforts by Republican Senators to block this illegal amnesty were repeatedly thwarted by Leader Harry Reids Senate Democrat majority Immigration enforcement has already been decimated Interior removals have plummeted more than 40 since 2009 Forty thousand illegal immigrant family members who had just recently crossed the border were released by the feds and failed predictably to appear in court People just show up at the border and are simply released into the country  free to claim local benefits funded by US taxpayers Seventy percent of asylum applications show warning signs of fraud ICE officers report that they are barred from enforcing immigration law against the millions who illegally overstay their visas  a number surging every single day Internal DHS documents show that there are 167000 convicted criminal aliens who were ordered deported but are at large in the US and released from custody The administrations nonenforcement directives have placed almost the entire illegal immigrant and overstay population beyond the reach of law enforcement The presidents own former ICE director explained If you are a runofthemill immigrant here illegally your odds of getting deported are close to zero If the presidents promised executive amnesty goes through we will functionally have open borders in America But the citizens of this country through their vote have the power to stop it The elite denizens of Washington and Wall Street scorn and mock the good and decent people of this country for wanting their laws enforced and their communities protected They try to make you feel bad for having sensible and rational concerns about how uncontrolled immigration impacts your jobs schools neighborhoods and community resources After years of mass immigration falling wages and surging joblessness isnt it time we focused on the needs of the people living here today Isnt it time we got our own people back to work But these cosmopolitan elites these great citizens of the world turn a blind eye to the suffering and poverty in their own backyards These Masters of the Universe have forgotten that a nation owes its first loyalty to its own citizens And they want you to believe that you cant win But they are so wrong And with your vote you have the power to prove them wrong You have the power to deliver a message they wont forget Republican Jeff

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/science/2014/11/03/experts-virgin-galactic-crash-will-change-face-space-tourism/,science,AP PhotoNTSB The crash of Virgin Galactics SpaceShipTwo during a test flight over the Mojave desert last week will have a profound impact on the space tourism industry according to space experts thrusting safety firmly into the spotlight John Logsdon professor emeritus of political science and international affairs at George Washington Universitys Space Policy Institute told FoxNewscom that the crash will likely reshape the nascent market for space tourism ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Its bound to be a setback for the industry for some period to come he said adding that consumers will be closely scrutinizing future tests of space tourism craft I think that there has to be a number of demonstration flights and test flights and possibly much much more government oversight Logsdon explained that up to this point there has only been light regulation of the private space tourism industry The Federal Aviation Administration has some very rigorous standards that airline builders have to meet before they are certified to carry passengers  theres nothing like that for the space tourism industry he said  Andrea Gini chairman of the Information and Communication Committee of the International Association for Advancement in Space Safety IAASS also expects a renewed focus on safety I believe that this accident will change the general approach of the industry to safety he explained in an email The industry must establish some standards along with other stakeholders including governmental organizations like FAA and the International Civil Aviation Organization and make sure that they are followed Gini who is also editorinchief of Space Safety Magazine told FoxNewscom that best practices should be shared right across the space tourism industry The IAASS has proposed that commercial players should follow the path of selfregulation by forming an independent organization that could certify new design and new approaches to make sure that they follow the industrys best practices he said This is the approach that has been established in Formula 1 car racing and in the past 20 years has worked really well for them Fridays crash which is being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board killed SpaceShipTwo copilot Michael Alsbury and left pilot Peter Siebold seriously injured On Friday the Mojave Air and Space Port where the test took place confirmed that an inflight anomaly occurred about two minutes after SpaceShipTwo was released from WhiteKnightTwo the mothership plane that carries it to a high altitude Late on Sunday the NTSB said that the space plane broke apart just after its feathering reentry system deployed The system uses twin rudders to increase drag on the space plane during its return to earth However NTSB Acting Chairman Christopher Hart said that investigators are still a long way from finding the cause of the crash adding that it could take months of investigation Fridays flight marked the 55th for the spaceship which was intended to be the first of a line of craft that would open space to paying civilians At 60 feet long SpaceShipTwo features two large windows for each of up to six passengers one on the side and one overhead Virgin Galactic  owned by Bransons Virgin Group and Aabar Investments PJS of Abu Dhabi  sells seats on each prospective journey for 250000 with full payment due at the time of booking The company which had been planning to take its first paying customers to space around 2015 reports taking deposits totaling more than 80 million from about 700 people With no details available about what caused the crash Logsdon was unwilling to predict when space tourism will shake off the SpaceShipTwo incident We dont know what caused this  whether it was a fundamental design flaw or something that happened on a particular flight he said Until we know that its premature to say how long the setback will be In a press conference on Saturday Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson vowed to persevere with the ambitious space tourism program Once we have found out what went wrong if we can overcome it we will make absolutely certain that the dream lives on he said We would love to finish what we started some years ago In the early days of aviation there were accidents and then aviation became very safe he added However Chris Carberry executive director ofExplore Mars a nonprofit organization which aims to advance the goal of sending humans to Mars within the next two decades told FoxNewscom that the coming months will not be easy for Bransons space tourism venture  Virgin Galactic will have a challenging time ahead to determine what went wrong and get successfully back to flight he said Nonetheless Carberry is confident that commercial spaceflight will play a part in Americas future As a nation we cant back down from challenges like this he told FoxNewscom When the day comes that we lose the nerve to engage in endeavors like this that will be the day we know that we are in decline as a nation I dont think that day has come Roger Franzen technical manager of the Giant Magellan Telescope at the Australian National Universitys Mount Stromlo Observatory just outside Canberra said that the SpaceShipTwo crash underlines the sheer difficulty of spaceflight NASA has invested an enormous amount of effort to minimise risk to its manned missions but even with its resources failures occurred he told FoxNewscom in an email However space tourism is about vision and inspiration and those people that have the money to pay for a flight must understand the risks In reality the level of risk is no different now than it was before it is only more visible Last week was certainly a tough one for the US space industry Fridays crash came just four days after an unmanned US rocket to the International Space Station exploded shortly after liftoff from Wallops Island Va Built by Dulles Vabased Orbital Sciences as part of a 19 billion contract with NASA the Antares rocket exploded in a fireball just 6 seconds after liftoff Although the incidents have thrust private spaceflight into the spotlight Logsdon told FoxNewscom that the two launches should be viewed separately They were fundamentally different types of undertaking he said noting that Wallops Island was a government launch of a privatelybuilt rocket with a lot of government oversight In contrast the Virgin Galactic launch was a totally private undertaking he added Follow James Rogers on Twitter jamesjrogers The Associated Press contributed to this report  ,0.7,0,0

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2014/11/04/smartphone-apps-play-role-in-midterm-elections/,tech,The prototype of Intuitive VotingIntuitive Company True the Votes VoteStand appTrue the Vote As voters hit the polls today some have been turning to smartphone apps to help make sense of the candidates and issues at play during what has been a particularly contentious midterm election cycle Various groups from across the political spectrum  Republicans to Democrats to those choosing to remain nonpartisan  have developed a range of apps for those involved in the election process from voters to polling center volunteers With smartphone apps becoming increasingly more prevalent in all aspects of daily life it is only natural that their role will continue to grow in future elections according to Rob Tannen director of design and strategy at the Intuitive Company which recently developed Intuitive Voting a prototype app geared to improve the election process ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT You think the presence of apps in the political process would have happened more aggressively by now than it has Tannen told FoxNewscom Going forward I think there is the infrastructure in place for more people to get the right information at the right time While still in its conceptual phase Intuitive Voting is the kind of app that Tannen said he hoped would help improve the voting process in future election years Designed as two separate apps  one used by polling center volunteers and the other for actual voters  Intuitive Votings features include clear concise information on volunteer protocol a tool to help people register to vote and detailed information on candidate platforms The app was recently the winning design in the Human Factors and Ergonomics Societys 2014 voting Design Competition Tannen said the teams vision for the app is for it to be a nonpartisan tool that provides objective information to voters and volunteers While not yet a reality he said that tools like Intuitive Voting are necessary in helping voters make sense of the barrage of information they get on a daily basis from campaigns and interest groups There are currently several apps in existence that attempt to help voters determine who they should vote for this election season For example Votr developed by media company Vocativ is an election app that takes a few cues from popular dating app Tinder Votr gives users the opportunity to assess each of the 161 candidates vying for the 36 open US Senate seats in Tuesdays elections Users answer several emojianimated personal questions  some are issuebased like whether or not one supports gay marriage to the more trivial like whether a user is a dog or cat person  and then presents candidates who users can vote yes or no for If the candidates answers match those of the users then he or she will most likely get a decided yes For example when Emily Marie Sanchez 2014 Texasbased Green Party candidate for the US Senate pops up on the app her positions like prochoice supports stricter gun laws and supports marijuana law reform appear under her profile picture in addition to a few quick facts After looking at her overview the apps user has the option to swipe yes or no While the Intuitive Voting and Votr apps were developed by nonpartisan organizations various interest groups from both the right and the left have been applying app technology to try to make an impact during todays elections True the Vote a Texasbased conservative group has an app called VoteStand for both iOS and Android phones that is designed to allow users to report cases of potential election irregularity and fraud According to True the Votes website the geolocationbased apps users are encouraged to report incidents like absentee voting fraud machine tampering or voter intimidation by taking photos or writing posts that will be submitted to True the Vote The conservative nonprofit will post users submissions that have been vetted and potentially contact local polling officials about alleged incidents of voting fraud The current version of the app was released last week and Logan Churchwell True the Votes communications director told FoxNewscom that it currently has around 10000 users Churchwell said that so far the app has been downloaded the most in Texas California and Florida and does not collect information such as a users party affiliation Of course given the fact that all of VoteStands content is crowd sourced it is important that users avoid breaking any voting laws The group lists on its website guidelines and suggestions for the apps users For instance users have to be clear that they are not violating the state rules for shooting video and taking photographs inside polling locations as well as potentially intimidating any fellow voters Criminal penalties could result from violating voting laws With such increased interest in inserting apps into the election process one natural question immediately comes up  will online voting ever become a reality in an increasingly digitized world Tannen said it is a possibility that will take a while to become a reality You have real app designs for financial services and the banking industry and obviously people are very safely and easily processing confidential transactions online and on phones he explained Obviously that could be applied to voting down the line All of the technology is there the infrastructure is there but the question comes down to money and organizations like local governments that are responsible for voting machines It involves local money To bring the voting process online it is probably going to be driven by the private sector down the line Make sure to catch all of the election coverage here on FoxNewscom,0.7,0,0

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2014/11/04/top-10-black-friday-2014-shopping-tips/,tech,Are you one of those people already counting the hours until Thanksgivingbut not because of either turkey or football Then you must be gearing up for Black Friday which once again starts in some storesyes Kmart were talking about youas early as 6 am  Regardless of when your Black Friday shopping spree kicks off the game plan is to get the best deals you can on the items you really want Oftenthough not alwayselectronics items are at their lowest prices of the year on Black Friday and its easy to get caught up in the shopping frenzy and spend more than you really want to So heres a list of Black Friday shopping tips that should help ensure that you get not only the best deals but also some peace of mind once you bring the item home  1 Be prepared This means studying the ads before Black Friday We havent seen a lot of them yet but you can find some ad scans for major retailers on many of the comprehensive BlackFridayfocused websites such as bfadsnet blackfridayinfo theblackfridaycom and gottadealcom Some sites let you filter your searches by product categories such as TVs More ads are expected soon so keep checking back for the latest circulars  2 Sign up for email alerts and loyalty programs Many retailers now use email alerts to encourage store loyalty and frequent shopping Sign up for alerts that will let you know about coming promotions and to receive coupons or discounts Shoppers can also learn whether the products they want are stocked and available or whether an item is eligible for a buy online pick up at store option that can save shipping charges Loyalty programs often offer sales and promotions to their members first and let you earn rewards on what you buy  3 Shop online first Why leave the family and your comfy couch if you dont really have to Before you brave the crowds at the stores check to see if the retailer is offering the sameor even betterdeals on its website In past years some of the biggest retailers have offered online sales during Black Friday week that have included many of the same items offered as part of their instore Black Friday events and often combined with low or nocost shipping deals And some retailers will offer online exclusives you couldnt get even by walking into one of their retail locations 4 Use social media Before you decide to buy visit the Facebook pages and Twitter feeds of your favorite retailers and see if theyre offering any incentives such as discounts when you like their page or follow them Also if you have friends wholl be shopping on Black Friday for similar items text tweet or post to a socialmedia site the best deals you encounter and hopefully theyll return the favor  ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Find out the best places to shop for with our electronics store buying guide and Ratings And check our Holiday Gift Ideas page  5 Get appy Before you head out to the store make sure your smart phone is charged and loaded with a few key comparisonshopping apps such as ShopSavvy ShopKick and RedLaser that will let you see special deals and compare prices while youre in the store Many include a barcode scanner that lets you scan and compare prices plus a QRcode reader that can sometimes get you coupon codes or special deals Also more Black Friday sites now have their own shopping apps Check out ones from BlackFridaycom DealNewscom and FatWalletcom among others Want to take notes on the best deal Try Evernote or Google Docs And if you do see that an item is cheaper at a nearby store try showing that price on your phone to a store manager and see if he or she will match that deal 6 Create a budgetand stick to it Many Black Friday sales especially doorbuster specials that are typically available in limited quantities are designed to get you into the store so retailers can try to sell you something more profitable Decide ahead of time how much you want to spend and resist impulse buying in the store especially if you dont know how good a deal youre really getting  7 See if you can get a pricematch guarantee and check store return policies Often stores say theyre suspending pricematch guarantees during the Black Friday weekend but you should ask for one anyway After all these are supposed to be the lowest prices of the year To be safe also check your local chains return and exchange policies to make sure that they arent different for a Black Friday special Sometimes Black Friday sales are final meaning the item cant be returned Other items may have a shortened return or exchange policy or one where you can get only a store credit and not a refund Also make sure the store wont charge a restocking fee for a returned item  8 Check the warranty If youre loyal to a certain brand you may feel youre aware of its standard product warranty But even major brands offer special derivative models during promotional periods such as Black Friday and they may alter the terms of their standard warranties for these sets For example the term may be much shorter or the repair provisions could be different If a problem arises there may be no inhome service for larger products or you might have to pay shipping if the item needs to be sent to a service center If so make sure youre comfortable with the terms and find out in advance what will happen if you need your electronics item repaired You dont want to discover unexpectedly that it will be your responsibility  9 Buy the item you really want and avoid pricey accessories Items designated as doorbusters draw us in because of their low prices but they may not be the best products for your needs In electronics for example this is especially true of biggerticket items such as TVs which youll be living with for a number of years Many doorbuster items particularly derivative models created specially for the event may have lower specs or fewer features than found on a manufacturers standard lines While this may be fine for a second or third set you may want better performance or more features for your main TV Also a retailer may have more wiggle room on price for a stepup model than a barebones set so you may still get a great deal on a TV you really want to own  An easy way to blow those savings is to stock up on pricey accessories This is where retailers make their money so beware of the hard sell If you know youll need an HDMI cable buy it ahead of time from an online retailer such as monopricecom or bluejeanscablecom so you wont be pressed into overpaying at the store  10 Avoid the old baitandswitch trick If youre really buying only on price stick to your guns and dont get pushed toward a more expensive model Retailers will sometimes advertise a great deal on a certain TV but then its either out of stock or the dealer denigrates it once youre in the store hoping they can push you to a more profitable model Dont get taken in there are plenty more deals out there maybe even better ones if you can wait closer to the holidays  We hope these shopping tips will help make your Black Friday shopping excursion a less stressful more enjoyable outing Happy

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2014/11/04/hacker-attack-on-federal-security-contractor-not-noticed-for-months-report/,tech,October 17 2014 This photo shows the USIS building in Falls Church Va A cyberattack similar to previous hacker intrusions from China penetrated computer networks for months at USIS the governments leading security clearance contractor before the company noticed the breakin officials and others familiar with an FBI investigation and related official inquiries told The Associated Press AP PhotoJ Scott Applewhite A cyberattack on federal security clearance contractor USIS was unnoticed for months before it was revealed by the company and government agencies earlier this year according to a published report Officials and others familiar with an FBI investigation and related official inquiries told The Associated Press that the breach similar to previous hacker intrusions from China compromised the private records of at least 25000 employees at the Homeland Security Department and cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars in lost government contracts ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT In addition to trying to identify the perpetrators and evaluate the scale of the stolen material the government inquiries have prompted concerns about why computer detection alarms inside the company failed to quickly notice the hackers and whether federal agencies that hired the company should have monitored its practices more closely Former employees of the firm whose full name is US Investigations Services LLC also have raised questions about why the company and the government failed to ensure that outdated background reports containing personal data werent regularly purged from the companys computers A computer forensics analysis by consultants hired by the companys lawyers defended USIS handling of the breach noting it was the firm that reported the incident The analysis said government agencies regularly reviewed and approved the firms early warning system In the analysis submitted to federal officials in September and obtained by the AP the consultants criticized the governments decision in August to indefinitely halt the firms background investigations USIS reported the cyberattack to federal authorities on June 5 more than two months before acknowledging it publicly The attack had hallmarks similar to past intrusions by Chinese hackers according to people familiar with the investigation Last March hackers traced to China were reported to have penetrated computers at the Office of Personnel Management the federal agency that oversees most background investigations of government workers and has contracted extensively with USIS In a brief interview Joseph Demarest assistant director of the FBIs cyber division described the hack against USIS as sophisticated but said were still working through that as well He added There is some attribution as to who was responsible but he declined to comment further For many people the impact of the USIS breakin is dwarfed by recent intrusions that exposed credit and private records of millions of customers at JPMorgan Chase  Co Target Corp and Home Depot Inc But its significant because the government relies heavily on contractors to vet US workers in sensitive jobs The possibility that national security background investigations are vulnerable to cyberespionage could undermine the integrity of the verification system used to review more than 5 million government workers and contract employees The information gathered in the security clearance process is a treasure chest for cyber hackers If the contractors and the agencies that hire them cant safeguard their material the whole system becomes unreliable said Alan Paller head of SANS a cybersecurity training school and former cochair of DHS task force on cyber skills Last month the leaders of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Tom Carper DDel and Tom Coburn ROkla pressed OPM and DHS about their oversight of contractors and USIS performance before and during the cyberattack Another committee member Sen Jon Tester DMont said he worried about the security of background check data telling the AP that contractors and federal agencies need to maintain a modern adaptable and secure IT infrastructure system that stays ahead of those who would attack our national interests The Office of Personnel Management and the Homeland Security Department indefinitely halted all USIS work on background investigations in August OPM which paid the company 320 million for investigative and support services in 2013 later decided not to renew its background check contracts with the firm The move prompted USIS to lay off its entire force of 2500 investigators A company spokesperson complained that the agency has not explained its decision Representatives from OPM and DHS declined comment Last month the federal Government Accounting Office ruled that Homeland Security should reevaluate a 200 million support contract award to USIS The GAO advised the department to consider shifting the contract to FCi Federal a rival firm prompting protests from USIS In the private analysis prepared for USIS by Stroz Friedberg a digital risk management firm managing director Bret A Padres said the companys computers had governmentapproved perimeter protection antivirus user authentication and intrusiondetection technologies But Padres said his firm did not evaluate the strength of USIS cybersecurity measures before the intrusion Federal officials familiar with the government inquiries said those assessments raised concerns that USIS computer system and its managers were not primed to rapidly detect the breach quickly once hackers got inside The computer system was probably penetrated months before the government was notified in June officials said Cybersecurity experts say attacks on corporate targets often occur up to 18 months before they are discovered and are usually detected by the government or outside security specialists Still USIS noted its own security preparations enabled us to selfdetect this unlawful attack Padres said the hackers attacked a vulnerable computer server in a connected but separate network managed by a third party not affiliated with USIS He did not identify the outside company Former USIS workers told the AP that company investigators sometimes stored old or duplicate background reports that should have been purged from their laptops The reports contained sensitive financial and personal data that could be used for blackmail or to harm government workers credit ratings the former workers said Former USIS employees who worked with the federal personnel office said the system they used directed users to purge old reports But the workers said USIS and OPM rarely followed up with spot checks Employees who worked on systems with the Homeland Security Department said these had no similar automatic warning function and spot checks were rare The company insisted spot checks were regularly performed Several former USIS workers said they were told nothing by the company about the cyberattack for two months after the breach was exposed In emails obtained by the AP company workers were ordered to change their passwords without explanation The USIS spokesperson said the government directed the companys decision to keep silent about the breach Experts said companies often withhold such information for both security and management reasons Employees may not like it Paller said but from a business perspective thats what companies do The Associated Press contributed to this report,0.7,0,0

The past two decades has seen a rise in vacation experiences catering to the super rich  Everything from aroundtheworld private jet vacations to luxurious villas staffed by butlers and chefs have become the norm These travelers have the money to spend so travel companies are pulling out the stops to make sure they spend it with them ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT They do this by designing brands products and experiences around the highend traveler  But does this come at the expense of the mass market or everyday traveler The short answer is no and it has as much to do with how you define luxury as it does with how you define mass market  In one example massmarket ships are being expanded to cater to the luxury traveler by creating a ship within a ship concept that caters to virtually every economic level of travel How Do You Define Luxury The definition of luxury has been debated for years in the travel industry What is considered luxury when it comes to a cruise Is it a small highend cruise line that only features luxury experiences along with luxury pricing Or is it a mass market cruise product with 4000 passengers and a designated area thats created to cater to the luxury traveler  Youll find people calling it both based on this example and you may also find this the person paying 5000 standing next to the person who paid 500 all for the same ship and for the same week Its part of the strategy to expand the definition of luxury and to create unique experiences within an existing environment A concept like this one works well for the multigenerational family giving the individuals traveling together the ability to choose the accommodations and plans that best meet their ability to pay The same would be true for groups that like to travel together as they may have different budgets to work with Does this sound like travel for the 1 percent  Luxury doesnt always coexist peacefully with the mass market A brand new Ritz Carlton Hotel and Residence is being erected on the site of the former International Market Place in Waikiki upsetting some travelers who are surprised to see it missing when they arrive They long for the food court and the cheap eats that would come with it as well as the cheap shopping Others applaud the move as it provides more highend inventory in a destination that seems to have no problem filling those rooms  The move is driven by the demand from travelers for luxury accommodations dining and shopping and that is how markets and businesses respond  Just because travel suppliers are focused on where the big bucks are doesnt mean they want to forego the everyday traveler Indeed there are plenty of options for anyone to travel and explore the world  The biggest obstacle for those traveling long distances is the airfare as it has risen to dizzying heights on some routes After that the variety of choices can run from hostels for a few dollars a night to a luxurious penthouse suite fit for a king  Defining the Middle Class Traveler The middle class is defined as a household that makes a median income of 54000 but that varies based on geography and other factors Some describe the middle class based on the percentage of discretionary income not necessarily overall income thats available for purchases like travel Stagnant incomes coupled with increasing costs have left many middle class households pinched when it comes to vacation travel but they still have plenty of options to explore Heres just one Get it Included Up Front One of the greatest growth areas in travel is the allinclusive resort Properties that feature a single price and include everything from drinks to food to entertainment are booming And theyre booming at every level along the economic spectrum  Set aside the cost of airfare and you will find prices that range from 100 per person per day to more than ten times that amount depending on the level of luxury Since there are far more budget or mid market travelers youll also find far more product in that price range leading to a myriad of choices If allinclusives arent for you and youre not in that 1 percent do what a lot of college kids have done over the past decades grab a back pack and a plane ticket and head to Europe or another far flung locale You can still do Europe on far less than 100 a day you just might not be able to do it on

take up arms The imam was finally arrested in Seattle in late 2005 after returning from a trip to Texas says Rubincam As soon as we saw who he was meeting with in Dallas we thought OK you know what
