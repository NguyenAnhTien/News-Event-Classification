MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/rand-paul-cory-booker-reform-the-war-drugs, Condemning a war on drugs they call excessive  counterproductive and discriminatory  Sens  Rand Paul  R Kentucky  and Cory Booker  D New Jersey  are pushing a new bipartisan bill to reform criminal background checks and the juvenile justice system  The senators say their bill   the REDEEM Act   will cut the cost and stigma of non violent drug offenses by limiting how long criminal records stick to ex convicts  Under current law  ex convicts must answer employer questions about past convictions  That rule has major effects on the labor marker   even for low level offenses  a criminal record makes many job applicants far less employable  Studies show the impact increases unemployment and disproportionately hinders poor and minority communities  The senators  legislation aims to counter that trend by offering some non violent offenders a second chance  It would seal criminal records for teenage offenders  while adults could apply to have their records expunged  Judges would review those applications  under the proposal  by balancing an offender s interest in  employment  against the public s interest in  knowledge and safety  And when ex offenders win  they would get something pretty rare under federal law   a do over   The problem really of the war on drugs is taking a lot of people who make youthful mistakes and it s punishing them for a lifetime  Sen  Rand Paul on  The Cycle  The bill says that when a crime is expunged  it will simply  be treated as if it never occurred  Paul  who has backed several measures to limit punishment for non violent offenses  says that approach is crucial if the U S  wants to truly rehabilitate offenders and break the cycle of recidivism   The biggest impediment to civil rights and employment in our country is a criminal record  Paul told PBS   NewsHour  Tuesday   People can t get a job because they have to check off a box saying they re a felon  he said this week   I want people to work  There are certainly a range of rights and government benefits denied to ex offenders  including voting rights  government jobs and public assistance  The 1996 Welfare Reform Act  passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton  denies public assistance to many ex offenders  The Paul Booker bill would reverse that policy for non violent offenders   It restores welfare benefits and food stamps for people who complete substance abuse treatment  Both senators also emphasize the racial disparities at play  Black and white Americans use pot at similar rates  but blacks are almost four times as likely to face arrest for pot  While 13  of the nation is black  black Americans comprise 45  of inmates serving time for drug offenses  Booker  the fourth black senator elected since Reconstruction ended in 1877  has spoken out about both the racial disparities at play and the overuse of harsh sentences for Americans who commit low level  non violent crimes   The majority of our criminals that we lock up are non violent offenders  he said in the  NewsHour  interview   we ve got to start figuring out ways to empower them to succeed  The legislation would also roll back two harsh practices in the treatment of minors It discourages states from trying some teenagers as adults  a practice that has increased even as the rates of violent crime by juveniles are at a 25 year low And it would provide the first national ban on solitary confinement for children   In the U S  solitary confinement has proven increasingly controversial Last year  a United Nations human rights expert concluded that the psychological damage caused by solitary confinement can amount to torture  Congress has been slow to act on most non emergency legislation this year  but aides to both senators say criminal justice is emerging as a rare area of bipartisan agreement  The Senate Judiciary Committee passed reforms to mandatory minimums on a bipartisan vote earlier this year   a change backed by President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder   and this month the entire House of Representatives backed a bipartisan bill to ease banking access for marijuana sales that are legal at the state level  For more reporting on criminal justice  visit Ari Melber s MSNBC series on racial inequities in the law  Presumed Guilty  ,07/30/14 02:30 PM,marijuana
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/all-the-people-who-hate-the-war-drugs,   Activist Ethan Nadelmann is against the War on Drugs  but it s not just because he enjoys the occasional joint though he does   People will look at me and say   I know why you do this  It s because you like your marijuana  or those hallucinogens and what I have say to them is  There s a little truth to that  Nadelmann told the American Business Council Continuity Forum in a video released Monday   The fact of the matter is there are millions  tens of millions of people  all around the world  including me  who do like the occasional joint  or hallucinogens for vision questing  But Nadelmann  executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance  went on to explain that more kinds of people than just drug users oppose the  failed prohibitionist policies  that undergird the United States  40 year old War on Drugs  The coalition against that war includes people who hate drugs too  he said   We re the people who have seen the worst that drugs can do  Nadelmann said   We re the people who grew up cleaning up the puke of alcoholic parents  and worrying about our drug addicted kid  and having a sibling die of an overdose We are the ones who wish that we could have a drug free society wouldn t that be wonderful but who know that that is a mirage  Even people who don t really care about drugs can be opponents of the failed strategies that have hurt so many   You know what we care about  We care about the harms that the War on Drugs and its failed prohibitionist policy is doing in our homes  in our communities  in our society  in our country and around the world  he said  Nadelmann says the drug policy reform movement attracts Americans who  for example  think it s shameful their country has the highest incarceration rate in the world  largely thanks to draconian drug laws  And the movement attracts those who see the War on Drugs as racially biased  locking up African Americans  in a way that would make Apartheid South Africa seem like child s play  A recent report from the ACLU confirms that that African Americans have been disproportionately hit by the drug war  being four times more likely to get arrested for marijuana possession   even though black Americans and white Americans smoke the drug in equal amounts   This growing drug policy reform movement we re the people who love drugs  we re the people who hate drugs  we re the people who don t give a damn about drugs  But every one of us believes that the War on Drugs is not the way to deal with this reality in our society  ,11/18/13 10:00 PM,marijuana
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/martin-bashir/unlike-his-father-rand-paul-just-says-no-t, Sen  Rand Paul  R Ky  entered politics with more than just his father s name to his credit  As an insurgent  Tea Party candidate for the U S  Senate in 2010  Paul also benefited considerably from the movement that former Rep  Ron Paul built during his run for the Republican presidential nomination two years before  The elder Paul s campaign failed in 2008  as it did in 2012  but he succeeded in establishing himself as a kind of libertarian folk hero  especially for certain young voters who thrilled to his calls for ending government intrusion in all its forms  from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to the War on Drugs  Rand Paul followed the libertarian path blazed by his father all the way to the corridors of power on Capitol Hill  But now that he s made it to the Senate and perhaps contemplating his own designs on the White House Paul has to decide just how far his father s brand of libertarianism can take him  Sen  Paul demonstrated the sincerity of his libertarian convictions recently  when he made an observation about the absurdity of U S  drug laws  Look  the last two presidents could conceivably have been put in jail for their drug use  and I really think  you know  look what would have happened  it would have ruined their lives  They got lucky  but a lot of poor kids  particularly in the inner city  don t get lucky  They don t have good attorneys  and they go to jail for these things and I think it s a big mistake  Paul s comments  which came during an interview on Fox News Sunday  caused something of a stir  A close reading of them  however  shows that he is not willing to go as far as his father did in advocating for the repeal of laws that make the use or possession of drugs  such as marijuana  illegal  As he explained in the same interview   the main thing I ve said is not to legalize them  but not to incarcerate people for extended periods of time   To that end  Paul has teamed up with Sen  Pat Leahy  D Vt  the liberal chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee  to introduce the Justice Safety Valve Act of 2013  which would give judges greater flexibility in sentencing federal crimes where a mandatory minimum punishment might be considered too harsh  This is exactly the kind of  libertarian Republican approach  that Paul has said will bring more young people back into the GOP fold  But for fans of the more free wheeling libertarianism of his father  it might seem a little tepid  Paul senior attracted a large and devoted following of young people during his failed runs for the presidency  in part  because of his full throated embrace of legalization for all narcotics  not just cannabis but hard drugs like heroin and cocaine  Unlike the younger Paul  who opposes legalization and takes pains to point out that marijuana is  a bad thing to do  the elder Paul actually introduced legislation with arch liberal Barney Frank that would have repealed the federal ban on pot  After the last election  he even co wrote a letter with former Rep  Frank that called on the Obama administration to back off of enforcing the federal ban in Washington and Colorado  where voters have approved measures legalizing the recreational use of the drug  If Sen  Paul is really interested in being president some day  then he has probably decided to avoid some of the more extreme libertarian positions  as well as opposition to foreign wars  that made his father a fringe candidate in many GOP circles  But will his stance on reducing the harshness of penalties for drug offenses resonate with young voters  who rejected the Republicans  last presidential candidate by a margin of 24 percentage points  Guest host Karen Finney discussed Paul s efforts to win back the youth vote with political strategist Angela Rye  author Goldie Taylor and Republican strategist Hogan Gidley  You can watch their discussion here  ,03/27/13 08:48 AM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe-1, It s Election Day and voters are deciding a number of high profile races  In Virginia and Alabama  two races have become a referendum on the Tea Party  Boston and New York get new mayors for the first time in over a decade  And in Detroit a catchy jingle might just be the MVP  In Virginia once a red state stronghold  several state offices including the governorship may go blue  bucking the state s conservative trend for the first time in decades as Republicans face the liability of far right social views and the tea party  The latest poll shows Democrat Terry McAuliffe leading by six points over Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli  At around 8 15 p m  NBC News characterized the Virginia governor s race as too close to call  Around the same time  Democrat Ralph Northam was projected the winner of the lieutenant governor s race  Cuccinelli s stance on abortion issues  the environment  and healthcare were hammered by the McAuliffe campaign  Women have particularly responded in McAuliffe s favor  While independents are split between the two candidates  women support the McAuliffe by 14 points  Democrats have aimed to turn the gubernatorial contest into a referendum on the Tea Party  which has enjoyed extremely poor approval ratings after the shutdown   You have to look at Chris Christie or Bob McDonnell Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough said on Tuesday s show   There are ways to win in these purple  blue states  but you ve got to make people think  I guess  you re focused on jobs first and not ideology  and I don t think Cuccinelli has done that  For his part  Cuccinelli attempted to capitalize on the tumultuous rollout of president s health care bill to rally conservatives in his favor  In hopes of avoiding the Tea Party limelight during the shutdown  he co headlined an event with Texas tea party darling Sen  Ted Cruz  but left before the freshman senator spoke and shunned the association Libertarian Robert Sarvis is also running in Virginia  with polls giving him 8  of the electorate   This election is going to say a lot about Virginia s future  and the country s future  Obama said while stumping for McAuliffe over the weekend  Virginia s own restrictive voter ID law won t go into effect until 2014  but they did recently purge voter rolls of 40 000 reportedly ineligible voters  and according to many registrars  hundreds of eligible voters with them  just weeks before the election  In a court challenge  Cuccinelli defended the move in his role as attorney general  Democrats alleged that the purge disproportionately targeted Democratic voters and asked the attorney general to recuse himself  Cuccinelli declined  Despite it  Virginia s secretary for the Virginia State Board of Elections Don Palmer told reporters that voting was going  pretty smoothly despite a software glitch that slowed down check in processes in roughly half of one county s polling stations   I m sure it s probably made the wait a little bit longer than it should be  he said  according to The Washington Post   In New Jersey incumbent Republican Gov  Chris Christie is expected to sail to an early victory this evening over his Democratic challenger Barbara Buono the latest polls show Christie enjoying a 33 point lead over the state senator  On Tuesday  Christie said the governorship is the last elected office he d seek in New Jersey   I don t know if I ll ever have another chance to vote for myself  he said  according to the Associated Press   I won t ever run for another office in New Jersey  I can guarantee that  This is it for me  The governor s no nonsense style and his recovery efforts following Hurricane Sandy prompted sky high approval ratings that haven t fallen much despite recent controversial vetoes  including one that attempted to scuttle gay marriage  Many expect Christie to run for president in 2016  One of Buono s chief criticisms of the governor was that his presidential aspirations are governing the state and pushing him farther toward the right on matters of gay marriage and gun control  the governor notably vetoed the ban on a  50 caliber rifle  despite backing the proposal months earlier  Less than a month after a federal shutdown that tanked Americans  views of their elected officials in Washington  just one congressional race will be decided on Tuesday  In Alabama s first congressional district  a Tea Party activist and establishment GOPer battle for the Republican nomination a race that effectively decides who will take the extremely conservative district s House seat   Attorney Bradley Byrne representing the center right  business aligned Republican party is up against Tea Party activist Dean Young  who just last week declared the president was born in Kenya  Byrne earned the financial support of a number of business and Washington GOP groups hoping to keep Tea Partiers at bay his race is likely the first in a long series of outright battles in the GOP s civil war   Hopefully we ll go into eight to 10 races and beat the snot out of them  former Rep  Steve LaTourette of Ohio told the National Journal of their plan to fend off Tea Party challengers with a new group  Defending Main Street   We re going to be very aggressive and we re going to get in their faces  The End Spending PAC  founded by TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts that funded Ted Cruz in 2012 actually opted to support Byrne over Young  al com reported Monday  despite Young s promise to be a  Ted Cruz congressman   I wonder if the fever has broken  You look at what Joe Ricketts is doing  Scarborough said on Tuesday s Morning Joe  remarking that there may be a swell of support toward supporting more mainstream Republicans  He added that the Chamber of Commerce has also supported Byrne   Does the fever break tonight in Mobile  Alabama  Scarborough asked  Boston and New York will both choose new mayors for the first time in over a decade in New York

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/the-bipartisan-time-machine,  So can we really get down to it  for a second   Yeah  I guess we might as well        So I have this childhood best friend  let s call him John  John and I grew up in the same town on Long Island  about a mile and a half from each other  We went to the same middle school  and the same high school  We grew up as the oldest children  in two parent households  Our dads both owned their own businesses  We took  Religious Ed  classes together  we were confirmed together  we graduated from high school together  we road tripped to look at colleges together  We were in all the same classes  we got the same grades  we loved and hated the same teachers  We had a timeshare at each others  basements  I ate roughly 60  of my meals at his family s pizzeria  so they literally fed me when I was hungry   Only problem  They referred to this establishment as  the pizza store  so now I call every pizza place a  pizza store and as a result  people are positive I m deranged  On Friday nights  we d order an absurd amount of Chinese food  dump it into glorified troughs  and then sit and watch whatever basketball game was on that evening  Often the Knicks  That kind of mutually experienced torture creates a bond stronger than blood  I was John s mouthpiece  and he was my conscience  I was his live  24 7 stand up act  and he was the best audience I could ask for  We never needed any extra entertainment  just pair us up and we were set  No need to check in on us  no need to worry about us  We were inseparable  There was even a brief rumor that we were   together in high school  And while it never quite reached the rumored depths I ve always joked that John was my first committed relationship         I just feel like he s not the guy to lead this country  The number one issue has to be getting the economy restarted  and I think Romney has more experience  and a better plan to do it  I know Obama was handed a crisis  I recognize that  And I don t blame him for it in any way   But Romney is going to be better for business   Based on what  His platform  His tax plan  His mysterious five points  Dinner is on me if you can name me three of the five points  You can t        We ended up in different colleges  In different states  In different regions  He got engaged  I engaged in   other things  He got a job fresh out of school  I did a bid of unemployment  Years went by  He got un engaged and moved to Phoenix  while I couch surfed and worked in New York City  He bought a condo  I lived in 7 apartments over 3 years  I work in TV  he does data research and management for Wall Street firms  He s getting married in April  I couldn t afford a wedding between Ken and Barbie  But really  the only difference that matters is this  In the ten years that stretched between who we were and who we are  I became a marijuana rights lauding  homosexual hugging  redistribution pushing  hopey changey  commie ass liberal  And John is a church going  border worrying  Facebook trolling  Drudge reading  land owning  small government Republican  My better half walks around with Drudge in his pocket         How are they going to pay for it  Nick  They re going to extend health care to all of these extra people how could premiums NOT go up   They might   Of course they will  There are social safety nets in place for people that can t afford decent health care  forcing people into coverage it s going to be a disaster  You re better read on the subject than I am  do you see how it can work   You widen the pool of people with insurance  more people are paying in  there s more money to cover the sick  That s the system and yes  our costs may go up    THEY don t even know what s in the bill  and they VOTED on it  Something like this needs more care  more    Wouldn t you rather have leaders that reach for something great  Wouldn t you rather live in a country that tries to give everyone fair access to the best care in the world  Of course he does  but he s right there s no guarantee that this plan will work  There s no guarantee that people are going to get taken care of  or that we won t get gouged by opportunistic insurance companies  Hell  it could all fall apart five years from now but I d rather they dare greatly and fail greatly  John is cautious by nature  and always has been  See  you don t know John  You don t know that without hyperbole he was the nicest kid in my hometown  It s impossible to quantify how utterly  and annoyingly decent he is  My parents used him as my moral barometer   Oh EVERYONE failed the test  huh  Did John fail it   Is John going to be at this party   Do you think John is running around peeking into girl s windows  Girls started wanting to marry him when we were fourteen  He had that sexy stability appeal  like a Volvo Wagon  Turbo  When we were kids  I wanted to grow up to be like John   and he s two days older than me        Time is a funny thing  It bends and stretches  It grows you up  It breaks you down  People say it goes on forever  they talk about it like a predator  like a gift  like a sunrise  We re told it runs out  it goes on  it heals  forgives  and forgets  I don t have that kind of profound insight  I just respect it s strength  and I know it moves you  Usually away from the person you were  and toward the person you re becoming  And a lot of time had passed since John and I were best friends  We don t talk as much as we should  Every month or two  we call  or exchange a text  When he visits his family  we try to squirrel away an hour to catch up  But if we re being honest  I spend a lot more time feeling guilty about not reaching out to him than I spend trying to reach out to him  I suspect he feels the same way  We re a long way from inseparable  But two months ago I bought the ticket to go see him him in Arizona  anyway  After all  he s getting married in six months  and I wanted to see his new life  I wanted to see the new people he d surrounded himself with  Hell  I wanted to see Arizona  Really  though  I miss my best friend  I was nervous  I knew eventually  we d have to get into politics  I knew he was voting for Romney  I knew he was a Republican  I just didn t understand why he was a Republican    And less than 24 hours after I touched down in the desert  he was telling me        The southwest United States is unlike any other place on Earth  The mornings are cool  There s a dark frozen pond above you  dotted with stars  that warms and cracks as the sun rises  It gives way to yellows and greens  filtering in until the cloudless blue returns  Then it burns hot  The sun has a weight that you have to experience to understand  It leans on your neck and shoulders and face  drying you out  Burning you up  Keeping you thirsty  Then around four or five o clock  it backs off  The heat hovers above you  letting you know it s still warm but that fire is now the backdrop    From the back of John s house  I watched the sun set  Every night  And  every night it was different  Reds and oranges and white streaks explode from the sun as it s dragged down below the horizon  Then a calm settles in  as the stars begin to appear  There s an ease about it that lets you know the day is over  the skyline sighs along with you  relaxed  Block by block  the lights come on        The conversation moves from the pool to his balcony as the sun is setting  The air is cooling  but we re heating up  I have a beer in my hand  and I m pushing deeper I need to know if time is a river we can t ford   So what about abortion  then    I don t think Roe v  Wade is really in play   But what if it is  John  Justices are old  one foot in the grave  even  There are going to be replacements   Listen  I m pro life  Everything stops  I can t hear crickets  I can t hear cars going by  I notice I ve stopped breathing  We re completely different people  Our friendship is a memory  being played out in live action  Suddenly I miss home  not New York City  but the home we grew up in  It feels millions of miles away   But I m with Joe Biden on this one  I may be pro life but I m not going to impose my beliefs on anybody else  and I m certainly not going to tell a woman what she should do with her body   Thank f ing God   What  You expected something different   No  man  Of course not  I know you  And I do  He s exactly the man he was  when we were boys        I like talking politics  but I hate debating politics  Nobody is convinced  nobody is swayed  It s just verbal shell after shell on the other person s holy land  Some people feed off that interpersonal carnage  They want to have their fist held up as the victor when the dust settles  But I ve found that more often when the dust settles  all that remains is dust  Your political beliefs bleed into your personal beliefs political disagreements become personal disagreements  Feelings get hurt  Voices raise  Often  you end up viewing a person through the lens of their politics  I didn t want that to happen with John and me         What about Gay Marriage   I can t believe anybody would try to deny marriage to two people that love each other  It makes me sick   Me too  We actually high fived  I m a little embarrassed to type that  but it s true so why not  right  It s Friday evening  and a calm is settling in over the conversation between John and I  We get worked up about certain topics  I have problems with the Catholic Church  he s worried about public education  I m scared of the evangelical right that drives the Republican party  he s nervous about states  rights being trampled  We both think that congress is broken  But we agree on what s important  We re still the same kids we were  even as men  This talk  this dialogue it was something we had to get out of the way  so we could have a chance to enjoy the weekend  It was the elephant  and donkey  in the room  It was all happening according to schedule  Arrive  grab dinner  Wake up  play a little golf  Hash out our differences  Enjoy the weekend  and then fly home Sunday  and maybe cry a little  See you at the wedding  Sandy had other plans        We took breaks from ideology  We talked about Women  for maybe the first time in our lives  Seriously  In all the years we were best friends  through all the slings and arrows of our tween and teenage years  we never talked about girls  No crushes  No girlfriends  No hookups  It wasn t on our mutual radar  John was   well  conservative  And I didn t want to talk about it because he didn t like talking about it  Plus  there were far more pressing issues back then  No  I don t remember what they were  So we made up for lost time  He talked about his first engagement  and what happened  and how hard it was  I talked about my extreme efforts to avoid being anybody s  boyfriend  and how ashamed I was over it  He talked about his wife to be  and how he knows she s the one  I talked about my girlfriend  and how I know she s the one  We talked about how glad we are that our lives have developed away from our hometown  which started to feel like a fishbowl  I told him about my stretches of unemployment  and how hard I was on myself  and how bad it got  And I confessed that sometimes  I still worry that somebody is going to come along  tell me I m a horrible writer  and take it all away  We laughed about the insecurities  how early they start  and how hard they are to shake  We talked about our families  and each others  families  We just talked        It was just supposed to be a long weekend  A pilgrimage out of respect for the friendship we had  in the most formative years of our lives  I m not sure I would have made it out of my teens without him  And I kept telling him over and over  I was trying to come visit  even though until recently I couldn t afford it  So it didn t seem fair to just show up at his wedding  like  Hey man  long time no see  Sweet wife  The storm kept me in Arizona for nine days   Our hometown was flooded  Airports were shut down  Even though I was invading his life for more than a week  John wouldn t let me sleep on the couch  He put me up in his room  like it was a hotel  I tried to barter my way out of his room  he wouldn t have it  Every morning he d wake up at 5am  and start his day  working from home for an East Coast company  I d rise a few hours later  and share breakfast with him  egg whites and avocado  he s getting in shape for the wedding  Then I d go out into the desert  I d hike  walk  run  and keep in contact with him via text until his work wrapped up  Then we d meet up  and spend the next eight to twelve hours together  We didn t miss a beat  We watched sports  we saw movies  we ate Chinese food  He introduced me to In N Out  I cooked him and his fianc  dinner  For most people  it was a nightmare but for me  that storm was a time machine  It took me to a place I didn t think I d ever get to see again  A place I wasn t sure still existed  I was terrified of the idea that we d changed too much  You don t get to just make new childhood best friends  I tear up thinking about how lucky I was to find a friend like that  how lucky I am to still have him  and how lucky I was to get an extra week  Because we both know it ll never happen again         Man  after being in India after really seeing what a struggle it is for people to live  what real poverty is like the election doesn t get me as worked up as it used to   Yeah  I felt the same way when I came back from Africa   I mean  really either guy is going to be fine  Obama s not leading us to ruin  and Romney isn t going to drive us back to the Dark Ages  I don t think people realize how good we have it  I watched the election at msnbc studios with Krystal Ball  I was standing fifteen feet from Rachel Maddow when she announced the President had won Ohio America s only state  I thought of John  I wondered if he switched over to his DVR  if he was upset  or if he shrugged it off  John s never been one to hold a grudge  that s always been my thing  I wondered how many other liberals thought immediately of their conservative friends        The lights are zipping by my window in the passenger seat  I can barely make out the mountains in the night sky  black set against blue black  It looks exactly the same as when I arrived  It seems like minutes ago he was picking me up from the airport  and it feels like I ve been here for years  It feels like we ve been here for years  We joke about what our twelve year old selves would think about us  now twenty eight  Engaged  working  grown  old  We rattle off as many memories as we can  emptying our clips  trying to get everything out before the buzzer sounds  Biddy basketball tournaments  wiffle ball  Simpson episodes  the Pizza Store  that time our Spanish teacher said she dreamt about us  NBA Draft birthday parties  road trips  seriously  that Spanish teacher that dreamt about us  The stories come tumbling out with the laughs  one after the other  They fill the car to the brim  We re still best friends  From my seat on the plane  I can see lights of Phoenix burning below me  Sitting in the middle of the desert  in the middle of the election  in the middle of a storm I m staring down at my nine days with John  my conservative Republican childhood best friend  An oasis  ,11/21/12 02:40 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/evolving-presidential-position-drugs, President Obama has not always welcomed questions about his views on drug use  including marijuana  Dave Weigel noted that Obama has a habit of casually dismissing the topic  when he s not ignoring it altogether    And so it was noteworthy that the New Yorker s David Remnick explored the issue during a lengthy interview with the president  When I asked Obama about another area of shifting public opinion   the legalization of marijuana   he seemed even less eager to evolve with any dispatch and get in front of the issue   As has been well documented  I smoked pot as a kid  and I view it as a bad habit and a vice  not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life  I don t think it is more dangerous than alcohol  To his credit  Remnick pressed further  asking whether Obama believes marijuana might be less dangerous than alcohol    The president apparently paused before diving in  Less dangerous  he said   in terms of its impact on the individual consumer  It s not something I encourage  and I ve told my daughters I think it s a bad idea  a waste of time  not very healthy  What clearly does trouble him is the radically disproportionate arrests and incarcerations for marijuana among minorities   Middle class kids don t get locked up for smoking pot  and poor kids do  he said   And African American kids and Latino kids are more likely to be poor and less likely to have the resources and the support to avoid unduly harsh penalties  But  he said   we should not be locking up kids or individual users for long stretches of jail time when some of the folks who are writing those laws have probably done the same thing  Accordingly  he said of the legalization of marijuana in Colorado and Washington that  it s important for it to go forward because it s important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punished    As is his habit  he nimbly argued the other side   Having said all that  those who argue that legalizing marijuana is a panacea and it solves all these social problems I think are probably overstating the case  There is a lot of hair on that policy  And the experiment that s going to be taking place in Colorado and Washington is going to be  I think  a challenge  He noted the slippery slope arguments that might arise   I also think that  when it comes to harder drugs  the harm done to the user is profound and the social costs are profound  And you do start getting into some difficult line drawing issues  If marijuana is fully legalized and at some point folks say  Well  we can come up with a negotiated dose of cocaine that we can show is not any more harmful than vodka  are we open to that  If somebody says  We ve got a finely calibrated dose of meth  it isn t going to kill you or rot your teeth  are we O K  with that    That s quite a nuanced answer  as is his wont  but with the administration s raids on dispensaries in the not too distant past  on balance  it would appear the president s policy views are evolving in this area  too    ,01/20/14 11:00 AM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/can-anonymous-tips-justify-police-stop, In a world where police have the green light to swab arrestees  cheeks for DNA and   at least in some cases   test DUI suspects  blood without consent  it might be surprising to learn that courts have any qualms at all about police pulling drivers over based on anonymous tips  But so they do  The Supreme Court has long been suspicious of police searches or seizures based on tips from callers who don t give their names  On Tuesday  the court will revisit that issue for the first time in a decade when it hears a case presenting this question  Can police stop a driver based on nothing more than an anonymous tip that he or she was driving recklessly  The case  Navarette v  California  raises important doctrinal questions about the 4th Amendment  But it also has practical implications in the road rage era  After all  someone willing to shout obscenities at another driver could just as easily call 911 and say that driver is weaving all over the road  That scenario cuts to the heart of Tuesday s case  Can such callers be trusted  More to the point  can they be trusted enough to justify a police stop  Navarette began with a 911 call in California  The caller reported that a silver Ford pickup truck had just run her off the road  The dispatcher relayed that information to police  and officers soon spotted a silver Ford pickup with a license plate matching the one the caller had reported  Officers followed the pickup for a few minutes and didn t see any signs of reckless driving  Nonetheless  they pulled the pickup over  Inside they found two men  Lorenzo and Jose Navarette   along with four large bags of marijuana  The men pled guilty to drug charges  But they also challenged the legality of the police stop  The officers  they argued  did not have reasonable suspicion to pull them over based on nothing more than an anonymous tip of reckless driving  The case is now before the Supreme Court  and   as in so many cases   the outcome boils down to how the court chooses to read one of its earlier decisions  In 2000  in Florida v  J L  the court ruled that police could not stop and search a teenager at a bus stop based only on an anonymous tip that he had a gun  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg  writing for the court  explained that police have to have reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot before they can search a suspect  and an anonymous tip   without more   doesn t amount to reasonable suspicion  Instead  she wrote  police have to corroborate the tip  they have to have reason to think the tip is  reliable in its assertion of illegality  In reaching that result  Justice Ginsburg worried that letting police act based on uncorroborated anonymous tips would make it too easy for grudge holders to use police as their instrument of revenge  The government argued in J L  that firearms are so dangerous that tips about gun possession should automatically justify a search  Ginsburg rejected that argument  explaining   Such an exception would enable any person seeking to harass another to set in motion an intrusive  embarrassing police search of the targeted person simply by placing an anonymous call falsely reporting the target s unlawful carriage of a gun  At the same time  Justice Ginsburg left the door open to exceptions in other cases  She wrote  for example  that  a report of a person carrying a bomb  might be a case where the danger is so great that police can stop and search a suspect based on a pure anonymous tip  In Navarette  the state of California   supported by the Obama administration   is trying to shoehorn reckless driving within Justice Ginsburg s bomb exception  Police should be able to pull drivers over based on anonymous reckless driving tips  the state argues  because reckless driving often means drunk driving  and that presents an immediate danger to the public  The Navarettes  for their part  say this case is just like J L  They say police should be required to corroborate the tip by following the driver and observing reckless driving  And  they point out  Justice Ginsburg s concern about harassment is just as big a problem in this context  What s to stop an angry driver from taking out his rage by calling in a bogus tip   At least one person in virtually every car now on this nation s roadways has a cellular phone  some prepaid and therefore untraceable  they argue   making instant anonymous tips available to almost everyone caught up in road rage  The court will decide the case by June  Whether anonymous tips trump the Fourth Amendment will turn on whether five Justices think reckless driving is uniquely dangerous   and whether they think it would be too much of a burden to make 911 callers give their names  Poll  Can anonymous tips justify a police stop   ,01/20/14 05:00 PM,marijuana
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/colorado-washington-get-ok-feds, When voters in Colorado and Washington approved the legalization of marijuana possession for adults  it was a policy breakthrough  but there was a problem  the newly approved state laws conflicted with federal law Under the Controlled Substances Act  federal law bans marijuana use  so Colorado and Washington were left wondering whether the Justice Department would intervene and block the measures approved by state voters Today  as Ryan J  Reilly and Ryan Grim reported  Colorado and Washington got their answer The United States government took an historic step back from its long running drug war on Thursday  when Attorney General Eric Holder informed the governors of Washington and Colorado that the Department of Justice would allow the states to create a regime that would regulate and implement the ballot initiatives that legalized the use of marijuana for adults A Justice Department official said that Holder told the governors in a joint phone call early Thursday afternoon that the department would take a  trust but verify approach  to the state laws That last part is important  The DOJ is effectively letting the states know that they can proceed on their current course  but if federal law enforcement has reason to believe in the future that Colorado and Washington are failing to be responsible  the feds can revisit the new policy In the meantime  though  that means these states   and any others that choose to follow their lead   can move forward on legalization After watching the  war on drugs  move in only one direction for the majority of my life  this strikes me as a pretty amazing development  Up until fairly recently  it would have been unimaginable The Huffington Post added that Deputy Attorney General James Cole also issued a three and a half page memo to U S  attorneys outlining eight priorities for federal prosecutors enforcing marijuana laws  These are the areas where prosecutions will continue  the distribution of marijuana to minors  revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises  gangs and cartels  the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states  state authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity  violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana  drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use  growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands  preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property But note that this leaves a whole lot of recreational pot use that federal prosecutors will no longer feel the need to pursue Update  Sahil Kapur posted the full memo from Cole  ,08/29/13 02:25 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/scalias-intellect-and-integrity, While we wait for the Supreme Court s decision on the Affordable Care Act  there s increasing speculation about how Justice Antonin Scalia will rule  The answer now appears rather obvious  with the far right jurist starting to show his cards Before we get to that  though  consider a little history  I often think about this op ed Harvard Law scholar Laurence Tribe wrote last year  arguing that proponents of the law have nothing to fear   of course a high court majority will uphold the law  because it s such a  clear  and  open and shut  case  Tribe practically chided folks like me for questioning whether conservative justices would be responsible in this case   Scalia may be conservative  but to think he d ignore the law is  to insult both his intellect and his integrity A year later  as Sahil Kapur reports  Scalia s intellect and integrity are looking a lot shakier Now  within days of the historic ruling  Scalia is releasing a new book in which he finds fault with a Roosevelt era Supreme Court decision that forms a critical part of the legal undergirding for the health care reform law  For Scalia  that s a dramatic turnaround  because he has previously embraced the premise of that decision in an opinion he authored in 2005 that supporters of the health care law have frequently cited In Scalia s new book  a 500 page disquisition on statutory construction being published this week  he says the landmark 1942 ruling Wickard v  Filburn   which has served as the lynchpin of the federal government s broad authority to regulate interstate economic activities under the Constitution s Commerce Clause   was improperly decided According to an advance review in the New York Times  Scalia writes that Wickard  expanded the Commerce Clause beyond all reason  by deciding that  a farmer s cultivation of wheat for his own consumption affected interstate commerce and thus could be regulated under the Commerce Clause When did Scalia reach this conclusion  Well  quite recently  actually  Indeed  the far right justice seemed to change his mind about the Commerce Clause right around the time he was looking for a way to rule against the health care law Scalia himself cited Wickard in his 2005 opinion in Gonzales v  Raich  concurring with a 6 3 majority that said Congress may  under the Commerce Clause  prohibit a licensed medical marijuana patient from growing pot in his or her backyard even if it s legal in the state  A central foundation for that sweeping federal power  the winning side argued  flowed from Wickard At the time  Scalia emphatically agreed  writing in his concurring opinion that  where Congress has authority to enact a regulation of interstate commerce  it possesses every power needed to make that regulation effective And how does Scalia explain the shift  In his book  he now claims  wisdom has come late I see  So  Antonin Scalia waited until he was 76 years old  and had been a justice on the high court for more than a quarter of a century  and then he decided his perspective  rulings  and understanding of the Commerce Clause were all wrong   just in time to rule against a Democratic health care law that features a Republican idea that was assumed by everyone to be entirely constitutional I hope Prof  Tribe will forgive me if I feel inclined to insult both Scalia s intellect and his integrity  ,06/18/12 01:50 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/all-in/killing-trayvons-memory-metaphoric-murder, An opinion piece from frequent guest On Monday  July 15th  it hit me  A disturbing and destructive story line was building about George Zimmerman s acquittal  It goes like this  The jury did not just acquit George Zimmerman of murder and manslaughter on Saturday night  The jury convicted Trayvon Martin  I said as much that night on All In  In retrospect  it started Saturday night  George Zimmerman s defense attorney  Mark O Mara  said that Trayvon Martin  lashed out violently  at George Zimmerman  Then defense attorney Don West made one of the two most offensive comments of the press conference  second only to O Mara s statement that if Zimmerman was Black  he never would have been charged  West said that the state s decision to prosecute George Zimmerman for gunning down the skittle toting teen  was  disgraceful  Then there is Zimmerman s brother Robert  the self appointed George Zimmerman PR firm  The night of the verdict  Robert Zimmerman told CNN s Don Lemon   I want to know what makes people angry enough to attack someone the way that Trayvon Martin did  I want to know if it is true  and I don t know if it s true  that Trayvon Martin was looking to procure firearms  was growing marijuana plants  Then came the tweet  It read   You attack someone bad things are going to happen  Remember  Trayvon Martin was found guilty  Zimmerman was innocent  The tweet came from a viewer I d never met in response to my July 15th afternoon appearance on  msnbc s Now With Alex Wagner  That is when I realized that the story line had been building each day since the verdict and O Mara s  West s and Robert Zimmerman s outrageous statements  And it hasn t stopped  The O Mara West traveling side show appeared on Hannity not long after I appeared on All In  They roiled in their righteous indignation that  the most powerful evidence  that was kept out of the trial that would exonerate their client was Trayvon Martin s cell phone text that would show he could fight  Trayvon Martin is now being painted as a crazy  dangerous person who threatened George Zimmerman  the man who had never seen him before  assumed he was an  F ing punk  and stalked him after advised to stay in his car   Beyond reasonable doubt  That is the evidentiary standard prosecutors had to meet in the George Zimmerman trial  It means that the jury has to be pretty darn sure that Zimmerman had no excuse for the shooting  If we are going to put someone away for up to 30 years  we better be good and sure that we are making the right decision  It s a tremendous  and sometimes overwhelming responsibility ordinary citizens bear  An acquittal means the prosecution did not do away with reasonable doubt  It means that the Prosecution failed to give the jury the comfort it needed to put George Zimmerman away  Remember what the judge told the jury   A person is justified in using deadly force if he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm  The belief can be dead wrong  as long as it isn t crazy  That doesn t make Trayvon Martin an attempted murderer for fighting his stalker  Juror B37 has now told us that three of the six jurors wanted to convict George Zimmerman of something  That is telling  That means that three people think Zimmerman did something very wrong  but didn ot feel that the judge s instruction allowed them to  Trayvon Martin was not on trial  Maya Wiley is the Founder and President of the Center for Social Inclusion  ,07/18/13 04:56 PM,marijuana

previous chief was ousted in the fallout over the killing of Trayvon Martin  Smith  who is black  has made a habit of patronizing 13th Street  which runs through Goldsboro s core   If you have an issue  he urged residents and shopkeepers   pick up the phone and call me  Smith s good will tour down one of the toughest streets in town is meant to allay long simmering tensions felt between the black community and the police department  whose gleaming  20 million headquarters built in 2010  is located at the top of largely impoverished 13th Street  Goldsboro resident  Chill Will  stands in front of Goldsboro Food Mart  Photo by Wayne Lawrence Institute for msnbc The boulevard is a crumbling shell lined with shuttered storefronts and dimly lit mom and pop shops with sparsely stocked shelves  At night  gunfire is common  neighbors say  And the police routinely sweep through to disperse the crowds of young people that pool on street corners and in vacant lots  It is along this road  the once bustling main drag of what a century ago had been one of the first African  American incorporated towns in Florida  where tensions brewed and then spilled over after Martin s killing  And it is here where Sanford s black community will wait together for the verdict  Police initially declined to arrest George Zimmerman who claimed he shot the teen in self defense  Zimmerman is on trial in Sanford for second degree murder and has pleaded not guilty  Prosecutors say that Zimmerman profiled  followed and then killed Martin on Feb  26  2012  as Martin made his way through the neighborhood where his father s girlfriend lived  The shooting did not take place in Goldsboro but in a gated community a few miles away  Still  it highlighted a broad gulf between law enforcement and black residents that has widened through the years  Martin s killing and the lack of an immediate arrest conjured up memories for Goldsboro of a shooting that took place two years earlier  In that case  police shot and killed Eugene Scott  a black resident who had been jailed for armed robbery and was a fugitive on other charges  The shooting took place in a grocery store parking lot while police were attempting to arrest him  Scott was shot in the back  The officer who opened fire said he did so after Scott tried to run over his partner  The officer was cleared by law enforcement officials of wrong doing  but many in the black community remained unsatisfied with the findings  Mary Fudge in the passenger seat  on 13th Street  June  2013  Photo by Wayne Lawrence Institute for msnbc Along 13th Street  residents are following Zimmerman s trial closely from local bars and over games of dominoes  Some say that what hinges on the outcome of the case is what blacks here have been owed far too long  justice   People are trying to use this case to move us forward  said Pastor Valarie Houston  whose church is on the corner of Olive Avenue and 13th Street   For this community  she said  the trial brings  an opportunity for a spiritual awakening as well as a sense of hope and empowerment  A hard pill to swallow On most afternoons  older men take refuge from the biting sun under the palm and willow trees where South Pomegranate Ave  meets W  13th Street  Many of them spent years laboring in the region s citrus groves and celery fields but now commune over cold beer and boisterous games of dominoes  Their leisure time is equal parts fellowship and an informal people s court where they pass judgment on everyone from local politicians to neighborhood ne er do wells  They trade stories of run ins with white supervisors and the police  More recently the often raucous deliberations have been about Zimmerman s trial   I ll tell you this much  If he s found innocent there s going to be an uprising  said Cecil Nelson   There s going to be trouble  The collective of men let out a chorus of mm hmms above the clack clack of dominoes hitting tabletops   I had a 17 year old son when that boy was killed  Horace Cain chimed in   Suppose that was my son  It s a hard pill to swallow  George Zimmerman is living  Trayvon is dead  That boy s daddy can t hug him or touch him  Elijah Williams  L  and Horace Cain  R  a lifelong resident of Goldsboro  joined a group of men under the shade of palm trees just off 13th Street on a recent afternoon to drink beer and play dominoes  Cain lamented the death of Trayvon Martin and the long history of racial strife in Sanford   Photo by Wayne Lawrence Institute for msnbc Nelson  Cain and most of the others here remember childhoods with segregated public spaces  Most said they still don t feel comfortable going downtown  where nearly all of the businesses are white owned and patronized by white residents  The history of racial strife runs deep in Sanford  founded in 1870 by Henry Shelton Sanford  an American diplomat who served in the Congo  He later argued that the country would be better off if blacks were returned to Africa  according to historian Adam Hochschild in his seminal work  King Leopold s Ghost  In 1946 Sanford s police chief famously forced Jackie Robinson out of a minor league baseball game  refusing to let him integrate the exhibition   The Robinsons were run out of Sanford  Fla  with threats of violence  Robinson s daughter  Sharon Robinson  later wrote  In 1997 the city apologized for its treatment of Robinson  During the Civil Rights era  city leaders cemented over Sanford s lone public pool rather than allow black children to swim in it  While that time has long passed  the town remains largely segregated with the majority of blacks living in neighborhoods such as Goldsboro  About 30  of the city s 54 000 residents are black and 57  are white  according to the latest Census  Much of Sanford is the stuff of post cards  with red bricked streets downtown and a picturesque waterfront  Crooked oak and willow trees hunch over lazy roads  Further away from downtown are the fruits of Sanford s more recent sprawl  with newer developments similar to the gated community where Martin was killed  While the city has pumped millions into new projects and redeveloping its waterfront  there s been little investment in Goldsboro  Many of the streets don t have sidewalks  the sewer system is in disrepair and the closure of several public housing complexes has left acres of land pocked with shuttered cinderblock apartments and many residents displaced   I don t see how we as leaders could talk about developing Sanford to its fullest potential if you don t address the needs in the depressed areas  Velma Williams  the city s lone black commissioner  told msnbc  It s rough out there Juwann McCall  16  stands on the corner of Oleander Ave  and 13th Street on a recent afternoon  McCall said violence in the neighborhood is troubling  but it wasn t until Trayvon Martin s death that the community came together  McCall joined in the rallies and protests last year following Martin s death   Photo by Wayne Lawrence Institute for msnbc Further down on 13th Street  Juwann McCall  16  stood on the corner of Oleander Avenue  leaning on a stop sign that marks his slice of the neighborhood   It s rough out here  said McCall  a slender  somewhat sullen faced boy  looking anxiously over his shoulder   You just hope  just hope that you be the one to make it out  For months leading up to Martin s death  residents said there had been shootings between rival groups in the neighborhood  But Martin s death seemed to affect them in a different way  Martin s killer wasn t black  Zimmerman is of white and Hispanic descent  The deaths of other black men had not led to protests in Goldsboro but McCall joined the neighborhood rallies that followed Martin s killing  He would stand along busy streets with a pack of Skittles  like the one s Martin carried that night  holding a sign that read  Honk For Justice  A slow trickle of young men walked by and offered head nods or shouts from across the street  McCall threw up a hand or shouted back   Every day I worry  he said   So  just think like  just pray and everything should be okay but like it s a lot of crazy stuff going on around here and stuff so  I just try to stay out the mix  From her little church on the corner of Olive Avenue and 13th Street  Houston says she has witnessed the best and worst of Goldsboro   Shootings  drugs  prostitution  Houston  pastor of Allen Chapel A M E Church  lamented  But she also watched the community galvanize in ways she had not expected during last year s protests  Allen Chapel became ground zero for protesters  civil rights groups and organizers  Local community leaders and prominent national activists met in her sanctuary   African Americans who had been crying silently in their spirits for change  she said  finally found a voice   If you re going to bring about change you can t be timid  you can t be fearful  you ve got to kind of put yourself

Sanford  as we pray for the lawyers and the judge and the jurors  we pray today for the family of Trayvon Martin  Houston then stepped from the pulpit to a candle holder placed off to the side   We light this candle for Trayvon  she said  Sanford s stepchild Across the street and down the block  Francis Oliver  chairwoman of the Goldsboro Museum  a refurbished double wide trailer that once served as a police post mulled her community s long struggles   Seems like every so often  this race thing kicks its head up again  said Oliver  whose golden dreadlocks flowed over her shoulders and halfway down her back  Indeed  the long running racial fissure in the city of Sanford goes back more than 100 years  Goldsboro was the second town in Florida to be incorporated by blacks after Eatonville  ushered into literary history by author Zora Neal Hurston s  Their Eyes Were Watching God  Hurston lived in Goldsboro for a time and her father  John Hurston  was pastor of a local Baptist church  In 1911 Sanford expanded and stripped Goldsboro of its charter  absorbing the city into Sanford proper  Goldsboro s institutions were dismantled  including the post office  the jail and many of the black owned businesses  Streets named for Goldsboro s black founding fathers were changed to numbers instead  In more recent years there had been efforts to mend old wounds with proclamations  In 2012  a stretch of 13th Street was renamed Historic Goldsboro Blvd  in honor of the neighborhood s rich history   There were barber shops  beauty shops  restaurants  stores  even supermarkets  Oliver said of 13th Street s past  Most of those establishments have long since gone  But images of Goldsboro s past live on within the museum s walls  One photo captures William Clark  a town founder  atop his prized mule  A replica of an old barber shop that stood on 13th Street for generations is prominently on display  Century old court records document the debt Goldsboro was owed by Sanford when it was taken over in 1911  The total   10 375 80 for property and other stipulations   The Jim Crow part of Sanford is gone  Francis Oliver said   But you still gotta deal with part of segregation  As you can see  Goldsboro looks like the stepchild of Sanford  Sanford Police Chief Cecil Smith talks with a group of residents on 13th Street  which runs through the heart of Goldsboro  Sanford s historic black neighborhood  Photo by Wayne Lawrence Institute for msnbc Another 50 years Two blocks over on 13th Street near Mangoustine Ave  people gathered in front of the Goldsboro Food Mart  a teal  spare cinder block building  Some sat on milk crates  others gathered in an adjacent lot  Music from a car parked in front of the store spilled from an open window and out over the crowd  More than one young man was seen with a marijuana blunt behind his ear  Many here complained that police harassment has worsened since Martin s killing   It s like they used that as an excuse to apply more pressure to the community  not help us  but to hurt us even more  said Derwin Slayton  Brenda Hartsfield  a nurse at the county jail and owner of the Goldsboro Food Mart  said that she has filed numerous complaints about the treatment of her customers by the police   I m their voice  When things happen to them  the first thing they do is they come to me  Hartsfield said   The police basically done put like a chokehold on the neighborhood  As Hartsfield and a small crowd ran down a laundry list of complaints against the police  including allegations of overzealous enforcement of loitering and open container laws  the police chief strode down the block and into the gaggle  Goldsboro residents  Trevose  Tru Tree  Scott  L  and Tony  R  on 12th Street in Goldsboro  June 2013   Photo by Wayne Lawrence Institute for msnbc What ensued was part public debate  part peace summit   We re not here to harass anyone  Smith said  He said police respond to calls of noise complaints and other problems  His officers  he said  are there  making sure that the streets are safe  making sure that people can get up and down the sidewalks  that people in the middle of the night at 2 o clock in the morning can get up and down the street  We don t want to keep people from having a good time  But there is a time and a place  Smith believes that the anger and tensions that roiled after Martin s death could have been avoided had police brass had better communication with the black community  In the wake of the shooting  then Police Chief Bill Lee publicly defended the decision not to arrest Zimmerman  He cited the state s controversial Stand Your Ground Laws and said he was legally barred from arresting Zimmerman given the lack of evidence to counter his self defense claims  Zimmerman was arrested 44 days after the killing and only after a special prosecutor was assigned to the case  Chief Lee was later fired   I m black from Chicago  coming in to a highly inflamed community  Smith said  standing outside the Food Mart   It took 50 years for people to feel the way they do now  It s going to take another 50 years to try to get people to change their mindset  It may not even happen in all of this generation  But for me  if I have the ability to change ten people s attitudes  that s a step  Smith said part of bridging the gap between the police and the people are weeding out bad apples in the department  He has fired one officer for using a racial slur on Facebook  and said others are being investigated for similar racial incidents  The fired officer  Vanessa Knode  conceded to internal affairs investigators that she used the  n word  in a Facebook post  But she told investigators that the epithet was aimed at her white husband and that she saw it as synonymous with  bro  or  these guys  Standing back to survey the scene on 13th Street one recent evening  Smith seemed satisfied with the discourse his random appearance had sparked   I could send the dogs in here and chase everybody away  or I can come in here and try to talk to people  Smith said  Wayne Lawrence contributed reporting to this article  Goldsboro is a neighborhood literally on

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/christie-vetoes-medical-marijuana-measur, Regulated medicinal marijuana use is already legal in New Jersey  but a spirited debate has been underway recently about broadening existing rules a bit  The controversy took on greater significance this week after the father of a two year child suffering from a form of epilepsy confronted Gov  Chris Christie  R  explaining that a specific edible marijuana strain would alleviate his daughter s seizures  but it s not currently legal under the state s narrow rules The Democratic controlled state legislature has already approved legislation to allow wider use of medicinal marijuana  The governor responded this afternoon  rejecting the bill but leaving the door open to progress Gov  Chris Christie has agreed to give chronically ill children easier access to medical marijuana  However  the governor conditionally vetoed a bill on the issue because it goes further than he was willing to go As I have repeatedly noted  I believe that parents  and not government regulators  are best suited to decide how to care for their children  Christie said in a statement   Protection of our children remains my utmost concern  and my heart goes out to those children and their families who are suffering with serious illnesses  Today  I am making commonsense recommendations to this legislation to ensure sick children receive the treatment their parents prefer  while maintaining appropriate safeguards  I am calling on the Legislature to reconvene quickly and address these issues so that children in need can get the treatment they need Reading the governor s statement  one might get the impression that Christie supports the bill he just vetoed  The fact remains  however  that while the governor now backs some new expansion of medical marijuana access  he s still insisting the state legislature change the reforms to meet his specific demands  In this case  as an AP report explained  Christie will accept production of ingestible forms of pot at state approved dispensaries and to allow dispensaries to grow more than three strains of the drug  but in order for sick children to quality  they would need approval from a psychiatrist and a pediatrician  and possibly a third doctor if one of the other two is not registered as part of the state program It s unclear how quickly the state legislature  which is not currently in session  will respond to the governor s conditions  Look for more on this from Rachel on tonight s show  ,08/16/13 04:56 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/all/50-years-later-what-happened-the-dream, On August 28  1963  over 200 000 marchers assembled on the Washington Mall to hear Rev  Martin Luther King Jr  deliver his historic  I Have a Dream  speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial  This weekend  thousands more will commemorate the 50th anniversary of that March on Washington with one of their own  In some ways  this new march is expected to be a celebratory event  one which acknowledges the progress already made in America  However  speakers at the event are unlikely to declare the struggle for racial equality over  Although the intervening half century has seen some progress on that front  the United States remains a deeply segregated and unequal country  In some ways  America has regressed over the past couple of decades  A wealth of contemporary research shows how much further the United States has to go  In mid June  the Economic Policy Institute put together a comprehensive report on race based economic inequality in modern America  Called  The Unfinished March  the study found that African Americans are still twice as likely to be unemployed as white people  and that many of America s schools and neighborhoods continue to be de facto segregated  decades after segregation ceased to be official policy   In the late 1960s  76 6  of black children attended majority black schools  according to the report   In 2010  74 1  of black children attended majority nonwhite schools  Similarly  45  of poor black children were found to live in  neighborhoods of concentrated poverty  compared to 12  of poor white children  The disparity extends beyond employment prospects and geographic separation  Over the past 25 years  the wealth gap between the average black family and the average white family has tripled  according to a February report from Brandeis University  The wealth of the average black family has stagnated since 1984  while white families only saw their average wealth increase  at least until the 2008 financial collapse  Homeownership was apparently a major factor  According to the report   Residential segregation by government design has a long legacy in this country and underpins many of the challenges African American families face in buying homes and increasing equity  When it comes to the criminal justice system  the numbers are even more stark  African Americans are about 3 73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people  despite the fact that they use the drug at roughly the same rate  according to a recent report from the American Civil Liberties Union  One out of every 15 African American men is currently in prison  compared to one out of every 106 white men  according to the Center for American Progress  Dr  King began his  I Have a Dream  speech with a nod toward the progress which had already been made since emancipation  and went on to describe the racism of his own era   One hundred years later  the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination  he said   One hundred years later  the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity  One hundred years later  the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land  Fifty years after those words were said  Jim Crow laws and officially sanctioned racial segregation are dead  But their legacy lives on  ,08/23/13 06:00 AM,marijuana
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/melissa-harris-perry/who-are-the-newly-elected-ones-watch, Today on Melissa Harris Perry  our host and guests weighed in with their post election picks for the  Ones to Watch  concentrating on the newly elected senators  governors  and members of the House of Representatives on whom we should be focusing our attention  Some are surprise winners  some made history just by being elected  and some are already being called future leaders of their party  And some of them  frankly  we just need to keep our eyes on to make sure they don t make a worse mess of Washington  After hearing the picks of Melissa and ger panel  we on the  nerdland staff thought we d weigh in with our selections  Find them below  Eric Salzman  executive producer  Governor elect Mike Pence  R  Indiana The anguish of the GOP during the primaries made clear the party s dilemma  vote with the head  or vote with the heart  Conventional wisdom says the Republican Party believes in  turns  The nominee is the one whose turn it is  often translated by whoever came in second last time   Ronald Reagan  George H W  Bush  Senator John McCain  and this time  Mitt Romney   George W  Bush being an exception  Add in the so called  electability  argument and the Republicans went with their heads in 2008  There was no really strong  heart  candidate to choose  they were all flawed in some fundamental way  From Michele Bachmann to Rick Perry  the potential  heart  candidates flamed out  leaving Rick Santorum  never truly beloved by the Tea Party  as the last  but ultimately unsuccessful alternative to Romney  In 2016  no Republican will have a  turn  claim to make  Paul Ryan fans should look to the last unsuccessful running mate who went on to win the White House and note they have to go all the way back to Franklin Roosevelt   FDR was elected governor of New York before making his own bid for the presidency  And that s why my  one to watch  is Governor elect Mike Pence of Indiana  The six term Congressman had his presidential backers in 2012 and had he chosen to run  may would have been Romney s staunchest competition for the nomination  But the governorship is a much stronger platform to launch a presidential bid from than the House  Republican pining for Senator Marco Rubio will likely have to run its course  but I can t wait to see what Mike Pence does as governor of Indiana   and then  what he does next  Shanta Covington  segment   booking producer  Senator elect Angus King  I  Maine King  68  is a former two term governor of Maine  He ll succeed Senator Olympia Snowe who s leaving Congress after saying the system was broken and they couldn t get anything done  Well  now King wants to fix Congress  As an independent  he hasn t yet decided with which party he ll caucus when he reaches the Senate  Look for him to be heavily courted by both Democrats and Republicans  Michelle Cumbo  segment   booking producer  Senator elect Heidi Heitkamp  D  North Dakota Heitkamp won North Dakota s Senate race by fewer than 3 000 votes over her opponent  Rick Berg  She will replace retiring Democratic Senator Kent Conrad  her former boss at the North Dakota Tax Commissioner s office   and her eventual political inspiration  It was an unlikely victory for the former Attorney General in a state that backed Mitt Romney over President Obama by 20 points  but Heitkamp will become the first female senator from North Dakota when she takes office in January  She s  one to watch  because as North Dakota s Attorney General  she helped pass tougher sexual predator laws  revamped the state s juvenile justice laws and improved the anti domestic violence system  Heitkamp also lead the state s efforts against big tobacco companies that lead to a settlement bringing  336 million to North Dakota for programs to reduce teen smoking  She has also been aggressive on Native American issues  preserving the Indian healthcare improvement act  working on housing and education issues within the Native American Community  Heitkamp is also a breast cancer survivor  She credits her grandmother  who grew up under President Franklin Roosevelt  with her decision to become a Democrat  Traci Curry  segment producer  Congressman elect Hakeem Jeffries  D  New York Washington  DC area commuters may want to get used to seeing a new face hanging around Metro stations on Capitol Hill  That s because  for newly minted Congressman Elect Hakeem Jeffries  subway stops have long been a favorite spot for taking the pulse of the public  It s where I first encountered him when he was running for New York s State Assembly six years ago  And it s also the place where he continued communing with constituents after he was elected with his annual Summer at the Subways  Evening Office Hours  Every summer over the last six years  on Tuesdays and Wednesday evenings  there he d be   right outside one of the subway stations in Brooklyn s Assembly District 57  waiting to hear what commuters ending their workday had to say  Mr  Jeffries  novel approach to engaging citizens exemplifies his understanding of a seemingly obvious  but all too rare quality in public servants  you are there to serve the public  not the other way around  Also  Jeffries  determination to move the mark on the policies that have disproportionately affected New York s black and Latino youth resulted in legislation that would reduce the number of people arrested after a stop and frisk  With the backing of New York governor Andrew Cuomo  Jeffries succeeded in decriminalizing low level visible marijuana possession  and taking some of the teeth out of stop and frisk  As congressman for New York s 8th Congressional District  Jeffries has pledged to help homeowners struggling avoid foreclosure and survive the mortgage crisis  and I m looking forward to the work he ll do on their behalf  But now that he s a congressman  Mr  Jeffries may find himself too busy in his office on Capitol Hill to make time for his old open air office by the subway  Either way  I have no doubt that this one to watch will be on the fast track  so to speak  Kathleen Osborn  segment producer  Senator elect Elizabeth Warren  D  Massachusetts Because if you aren t already watching her  it is high time  Warren is the woman who brought some semblance of accountability to the finance industry  She oversaw the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act   known more commonly as the financial bailout   which helped bring our economy back from the brink  Warren once said she was willing to shed  blood and teeth on the floor  in her fight to create the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection  and got it done  Warren is the woman who ran on this sentiment   There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own   nobody   You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for  you hired workers the rest of us paid to educate  you were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for  You didn t have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory  and hire someone to protect against this  because of the work the rest of us did  Now look  you built a factory and it turned into something terrific  or a great idea  God bless   keep a big hunk of it  But part of the underlying social contract is  you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along  And I think we can count on her to legislate accordingly  Jamil Smith  segment   digital producer  Senator elect Ted Cruz  R  Texas I used to work in sports  and as such  speculation about  ones to watch  is reminiscent of the yearly NFL draft  Prospects are theorized about  examined  poked and prodded  all in the hopes that a general manager   or  better yet  a sports pundit   will make the right choice  and look really smart when that collegiate prospect experiences success  or failure  depending upon the prediction  on the professional level  If someone can say   I told you so  since that s what matters most to people who get paid to talk for a living  It s all about the hype  It s no different in politics  That s why even if you don t know one policy position espoused by Texas Senator elect Ted Cruz  you likely know that there is a Ted Cruz  To call the Harvard Law graduate a Tea Party darling would be an understatement  Cruz  42  is beloved by fiscal and social conservatives alike  largely because he is thought to lend an intellectual credulity to far Right policy positions that normally lose elections for people who articulate them less skillfully  According to Republican strategist Mark McKinnon  he s  the Republican Barack Obama  That is a terrifying prospect  considering his Rick Perry like desire to make the federal government more like that in Texas   In the interest of brevity  I ll refer you to Timothy Murphy s recent Cruz profile in Mother Jones  Frankly  Cruz is  one to watch  because none of us afford to take our eyes off of him  Lorena Ruiz  associate producer  Congressman elect Alan Grayson  D  Florida Representative elect Grayson was once Representative Grayson  having been first elected to the House in 2008  He is known for his outspoken  and auto tuned  defense of health care reform  He was ousted in 2010 during the Tea Party wave  but regained his seat on Tuesday by a 25 point margin  Grayson was already a fighter for progressive causes in his previous term  and I expect him to emerge as a strong voice for the Democrats in his next term  In an interview with

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/holder-moves-protect-reporters-records, File Photo  Attorney General Eric Holder addresses the media following a vote in the House of Representatives at the U S  Attorney s Office Eastern District  Photo by Chris Graythen Getty Images  File Time for a quick quiz  Last spring  much of the political media slipped into a frenzy for a few weeks  telling the public that the Obama White House was ensnared in three  big   mushrooming  scandals at the same time  Nine months later  can you name all three    One was the IRS controversy  which turned out to be meaningless  The second was the Benghazi attack from the year before  and more fair minded people would have to agree that the allegations and conspiracy theories involving this story turned out to be baseless    The third was   what exactly  Even at the time  the third was a little fuzzy  but for more of the political media  it was the Justice Department subpoenaing reporters  phone logs as part of a leak investigation  It was difficult to characterize this as a proper political scandal   most of the White House s GOP critics had no qualms with the subpoenas   but much of the media decided it d be more fun to say there were three  scandals  instead of two  since three ostensibly makes a pattern    Not long after the controversy  the Justice Department began an internal review process to determine how best to prevent similar concerns in the future  Friday  Attorney General Eric Holder signed new guidelines intended to make these subpoenas far more difficult  The rules  which will be published in the Federal Register next week  carry out a set of changes that Mr  Holder announced last July and described in a six page report at the time  A preamble described the revisions as intended to ensure that the department  strikes the proper balance among several vital interests  like protecting national security and  safeguarding the essential role of the free press in fostering government accountability and an open society    Among other things  the rules create a presumption that prosecutors generally will provide advance notice to the news media when seeking to obtain their communications records      The rules also address a law forbidding search warrants for journalists  work materials  except when the reporter is a criminal suspect  This is not to say the subpoenas will never happen   Congress hasn t passed a shield law   but they ll be rarer and more difficult  and news organizations will have more advance notice  which will offer editors and publishers a chance to mount a defense    And in the larger context  the recent argument about Holder s efforts continues to hold up  He recently unveiled  for example   a bold effort by his department to eliminate the distinction between same sex and opposite sex married couples in the federal justice system  He s fighting against conservative restrictions on voting rights  He s allowing Colorado and the state of Washington to pursue marijuana legalization  He s fighting for sentencing reforms  He s combating  Stand Your Ground  laws    And just two weeks ago  Holder made a very compelling case that it s unnecessary  unjust  and counterproductive to deny the formerly incarcerated the right to vote    On top of all of this  the A G  is now also taking steps to protect reporters  Granted  the need for these protections are now more acute in light of Justice Department excesses  but nevertheless  the new protections are welcome and evidence of progress    Update  Marcy Wheeler makes the case that the new DOJ guidelines include some important loopholes  most notably because they don t apply to National Security Letters    ,02/24/14 03:44 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/steve-king-fills-vacuum-left-boehne, The Democratic Party s general approach to immigration policy is pretty straightforward  create a legal process through which millions of undocumented immigrants already in the United States can become legal citizens  while taking concrete steps to improve border security  The Republican Party s position on immigration is   less clear GOP officials are divided  confused  and overwhelmed by uncertainty  House Speaker John Boehner  R Ohio  was asked over the weekend for his personal opinion on a pathway to citizenship  and the Republican leader was so overwhelmed by weakness and fear that he refused to give an answer This in turn creates a vacuum within the Republican Party  which is filled by folks like Rep  Steve King  R Iowa For those who can t watch clips online  here s what the GOP lawmaker told a right wing website about Dream Act kids There are kids that were brought into this country by their parents unknowing they were breaking the law  And they will say to me and others who defend the rule of law   We have to do something about the 11 million  Some of them are valedictorians  Well  my answer to that is   it s true in some cases  but they aren t all valedictorians  They weren t all brought in by their parents  For every one who s a valedictorian  there s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds and they ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert  Those people would be legalized with the same act In case facts still matter  King s assessment isn t even close to being accurate But even if we put that aside  King s offensiveness reinforce a larger dynamic in Republican politics that party leaders are eventually going to have to address To be sure  House GOP leaders eventually got around to criticizing King s comments last night  just as they did in March when another House Republican lawmaker used the  wetbacks  slur But soon after  King doubled down on his remarks  appearing on an Iowa radio show to say   It s not something that I m making up  This is real And while King keeps talking  and party leaders keep wringing their hands  it s worth appreciating the political circumstances that have brought us to this point  Note  for example  that the right wing Iowan may come across as a racist buffoon that the American mainstream finds repulsive  but at this point  he s winning   King has been fighting to kill comprehensive immigration reform  and by all appearances  House Republican leaders intend to hand him and his allies the outcome they prefer In other words  as ridiculous as Steve King appears  he and his kooky friends are shaping the House Republican caucus  position on immigration policy  largely because Boehner and his friends are too inept to lead What s more  the dynamic is getting worse  not better  As Jon Chait explained back in April   A drawn out immigration debate commanding center stage will simply create more opportunities for conservative Republicans to say offensive things about Latinos  And make no doubt  however diligently their consultants coach them not to  they will say offensive things about Latinos That was nearly four months ago  and Chait s prediction is holding up quite well If Boehner wants to make this nightmare go away  the Speaker is going to have to try to pass immigration reform  Unfortunately for his party  the weight falls on Boehner s shoulders  and he may not be up to the task  ,07/24/13 08:00 AM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/protests-st-louis-heat-weekend-resistance, FERGUSON  Missouri  A cold  steady rain is falling over Ferguson  cooling tension that reignited after a black teen was killed about a dozen miles away in St  Louis earlier this week For a second straight night  protesters took to the streets of St  Louis yesterday in an outpouring of grief and anger over the killing of 18 year old Vonderrit Myers Jr whom police say fired on an off duty police officer and was killed in the process  Police used pepper spray on the crowd  A few rogue protesters broke a couple windows and burned American flags  There were tears and disbelief   Today I woke up angry  Deray McKesson  one of last night s protesters said   This is not the America I know  This morning in Ferguson   as often is the case in this bruised little city still reeling from the killing of teenager Michael Brown by a police officer here two months ago   there s a sense of tenuous calm  Thousands of protesters from across the country are expected to land in Ferguson today for what organizers expect to be an historic weekend of rallies and protests  Billed as a Weekend of Resistance organizers have planned a series of actions that begin with today s march on the office of St  Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch and continue until Monday s widespread civil disobedience  a la the Moral Mondays movement  Photo essay How the crisis in Ferguson unfolded  in photographs Ahead of the expected influx of protesters  city officials are preparing for the worst  A city spokesman told msnbc that police have added additional officers to weekend shifts and that neighboring towns have lent the city additional manpower  The St  Louis County police  which recently took over protest control efforts from Ferguson police  as well as the Missouri State Highway Patrol  are also offering assistance   There are a lot of people coming into town  Ferguson Mayor James Knowles told Reuters   We are going to be prepared  There is intel out there that there are people wanting to do bad things  And people who want to cause a problem are going to use that  Myers  shooting  as a rallying cry  On Thursday night  hundreds of protesters spread across several blocks on St  Louis  south side  riled by the shooting death of Myers  who was shot and killed on Wednesday by a white off duty police officer  Police say Myers brandished a 9mm pistol and fired on the officer who then responded with approximately 17 shots  Family of Myers refute the claim that the teen was armed  They said he had nothing more than a sandwich he d purchased minutes earlier at a nearby convenience store  But police say they recovered a handgun at the scene believed to be used in the shooting and cite bullet casings and bullet holes in the officers direction as proof of Myers  misdeeds  Myers  killing energized protesters who  for more than 60 days  have made areas around Ferguson ground zero in their fight for justice for Michael Brown   I think it rejuvenates a lot of people  said Johnetta Elzie  who s been protesting since Brown s death   I was getting worn out  But once we started getting more details  about Myers  killing  all they had to tell me was that he just turned 18  Police said he had a gun  neighbor say he had a sandwich  I don t trust the police at all  I just don t believe them  While Myers  killing in St  Louis sparked spontaneous protests this week  it was the shooting death of Brown in Ferguson two months ago that has fueled widespread discontent and outright anger across the region  Brown was unarmed when he was shot dead by a Ferguson police officer on Aug  9  Since Brown s death some 63 days ago  protesters and supporters of Brown s family have demanded an arrest of Brown s killer  officer Darren Wilson  The Ferguson based protests and demonstrations have evolved from spontaneous and often violent to well organized and intentional with seasoned activists and organizers grooming the more inexperienced groups of protesters  But as the movement built around finding justice for Brown expands geographically   with supporters congregating from all over the country   and thematically   to the broader issues around police abuses and the plight of black and brown men more generally   there remains an unwieldy nature to it all here on the ground  Protesters said St  Louis police last night had ambushed them and that peaceful protesters were hit with pepper spray and roughed up  At one point  a fringe group of three or four white protesters in St  Louis allegedly threw a rock through the window of a private residence  and someone else smashed the storefront glass of a vitamin shop  Police say someone threw a large knife at a police officer  And still other burned a couple American flags as protesters at the scene last night say police responded to petty slights with heavy handed action  Some witnesses said St  Louis police demanded that everyone had to vacate the street or face arrests  No standing in the street  no standing on the sidewalk  no standing anywhere  Police eventually pepper sprayed dozens of protesters and made eight arrests   one for marijuana possession  two for property damage and five for unlawful assembly  McKesson said despite a small handful of protesters on the street last night with  bad energy  the majority of the protesters were peaceful  albeit angry   With Mike Brown there is this righteous indignation in the protests because we know that that was wrong  that there was something fundamental and core about what happened to him  That is unquestioned  McKesson said early on Friday morning With Vonderrit Myers there are a lot of questions and you can feel that as you protest But the common thread though both is what is the response to blackness  You maced us and I did nothing wrong   God only knows what you did to him without the crowd and without the press  Friday morning s steady rain dampened prospects of an ideal weekend of street demonstrations  The rain is forecasted to continue throughout the weekend  McKesson says his spirits aren t the least bit doused   Racism doesn t take a nap on a rainy day so I don t get to  McKesson said   Rain  snow  sleet  whatever  You don t get to wash away my feelings  ,10/10/14 01:18 PM,marijuana

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  Her role in the civil rights movement began as a college student at Antioch  where she was a Student Nonviolent Coordination Committee organizer and a signer of the Black Woman s Manifesto  Close video       Melissa Harris Perry  8 24 13  10 43 AM ET       Congresswoman reflects on organizing the 1963 march       Melissa Harris Perry watches remarks from

champion of gun violence intervention and prevention  She has personally lost a loved one to gun violence and has since become the co chair for the Gun Violence Awareness Month Initiative in New York City  She was also involved in Vice President Joe Biden s gun control task force  Rep  Norton and Tamika answered your questions from the msnbc community thread see her response below  Janiece Watts  How do we harness the energy of this time to spark changes like the Civil Rights movement  Rep  Norton History doesn t really repeat itself  but it can and usually does get better  A confluence of special circumstances stimulated my generation to take on issues of equality   I m impressed by how this generation quickly uses social media to take on emerging issues  Young people  using the strongest weapon of any movement  the vote  made all the difference in the last presidential election  Without them  Barack Obama would not be president  My generation took on political equality  I believe young people  who have graduated into a poor economy  have an incentive to take on much tougher issues of income equality  If they show the leadership they have demonstrated in the last few elections  they can bring changes even greater than my generation achieved  Tamika The key to harnessing similar energy of today lies in our ability to use resources like technology  Social media has allowed us to expand and strengthen our networks  and that is how we have to pass messages to each other  Civil rights activism has always been a matter of sharing information and coordinating action  Today  communicating has become easier  we have these ready made  virtual networks  which we must use to spread messages but we must be prepared to take our message to the street as well    Hugh B Delaney Civil rights begins these days with income disparity  How do we help the working poor  Tamika We help the working poor by improving the quality of education and expanding educational opportunities  not just for children but also for adults who ve been out of the workforce and need to broaden their base of skills  President Obama and many other leaders are talking about the importance of investing in education in the STEM fields  Science  Technology  Engineering   Mathematics  There is no denying the significance  but we need to increase technical education on all levels  so that our youth can develop the basic skills necessary to study STEM fields  We need to create an equal playing field  so we can increase opportunities for both youth and unemployed adults the build the foundational skills necessary to excel in STEM fields    Rep  Norton I agree that income disparity is the great issue of our time  It is even broader and more difficult than the civil rights issues of the 1960s  The  99 percent  is not just a slogan  The disparity in income has left the middle class with lowered  not rising income  and the poor unable to reach the middle class  Fortunately  the President has made income disparity his signature issue  The Democrats  fight for an increase in the minimum wage shows that the middle class and the poor are in this fight together  That issue has overwhelming public support because as the minimum wage is increased  wages above that floor almost always increase as well  I am optimistic because the poor do not have to take on the issue of income disparity by themselves  The poor and the middle class are in this fight together   Income disparity is the great issue of our time  It is even broader and more difficult than the civil rights issues of the 1960s  Rep  Norton Haleh Kanani Schools in many parts of the country have a lot of problems  but D C s seems to be the epitome of a lot of what s wrong with our education system  Why do you think that s the case  and how should we tackle that issue   Rep  Norton Actually  D C s school system has improved considerably  The 2013 National Assessment on Educational Progress  known as the National Report Card  showed that the District of Columbia  along with Tennessee  showed the greatest improvement in test scores in the nation  My experience in D C  Public Schools was different because the city was different  The suburbs were closed to African Americans  and the schools in the District had the disadvantage of being segregated  but children from the large middle class along with poor children were from mostly two parent families  while many of the children today are poorer and from single parent families  which is the most important determinant of progress in schools  I went to Dunbar High School  recognized as the best high school of the segregated era  The education enabled students from Dunbar to attend the best colleges and universities in the country  Alicia Maule  What do you make of the gun violence in Chicago  Have you spent time in the communities affected  Tamika The violence in Chicago is heartbreaking and scary  it is absolutely a public health crisis  Chicago is proof that what elected officials have been able or willing to do to address the problem thus far simply isn t enough  Chicago s Police Superintendent  Garry McCarthy  has openly criticized the loose gun laws in Illinois and surrounding states which allow weapons to flow freely into Chicago  The city can t solve this problem alone  solutions must be coordinated on the state and regional levels  For over a decade  I have worked closely with communities in New York City affected by gun violence  I have built networks with activists in other cities  like Cleopatra Cowley Pendleton the mother of Hadiya Pendleton  the 15 year old honor student who was slain in Chicago in January of 2013   digiphile  Where does D C  stand now  with respect to autonomy and self governance   and what s the strategy  legislative or otherwise  to move towards statehood or other conditions that would enfranchise the 600 000 or so American citizens who live in D C Rep  Norton We have been doing reasonably well  with most of the anti home rule bills no longer offered  That has everything to do with the fight we wage  letting no slight go unaddressed  and especially the support for the D C  equal rights movement we receive from District residents who take the time to show up  Now  a relatively new House member is trying to block D C s marijuana decriminalization law  but we think we can beat that in the Senate  We are making good progress on statehood with co sponsorship by the top three Democratic leaders and nearly half the Democratic senators  Statehood is the most difficult to achieve  but it is the only remedy that could give the city full citizenship  including votes in the House and Senate and the elimination of interference with D C s local laws  It is the fight of a lifetime   Chicago is proof that what elected officials have been able or willing to do to address the problem thus far simply isn t enough    Tamika Mallory Garnet News  It seems to me that the level of discourse in politics has dramatically deteriorated since President Obama took office  Do you agree and if so what do you attribute it to  Tamika I think we must continue to focus on the importance of the freedom of speech  even during a time when we are feeling frustrated by the discourse  The ability to freely express ourselves is one of the things that makes this the greatest country in the world  Currently  we re seeing a rise in extremists speaking out and sharing radical messages  and at times those drown out the credible and sensible messages  To deal with this  we have to actively exercise our own freedom of speech  and we have to do it persistently to counteract these fringe messages   AllAboveAll  While all 50 states may use their state funds to cover abortion care  Congress routinely overrules D C s own elected officials through the appropriations process and withholds abortion coverage from Washingtonians  What s it going to take to roll back this harmful policy Rep  Norton The ban on D C  using its local funds for abortion coverage for low income women is the only anti home rule rider to return after I got them all removed when the Democrats controlled the House  However  we have kept the anti choice people from making the rider permanent  We put up a good fight each and every year with great help from national and local pro choice organizations  We got the abortion rider eliminated when Democrats controlled the House in Fiscal Year 2010  and we do not intend to give up until we do it again  Keep up

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/supreme-court-justice-john-paul-stevens-legalize-pot, Former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens said Thursday he believes the federal government should legalize marijuana  In an interview with NPR s Weekend Edition Saturday the former justice said that marijuana should be made legal due to the shifting cultural tides   I really think that that s another instance of  public opinion has changed and recognized that the distinction between marijuana and alcoholic beverages is really not much of a distinction  Stevens said when asked by host Scott Simon if possessing marijuana should be legal under federal law   The alcohol   the prohibition against selling and dispensing alcoholic beverages has  I think  been generally  there s a general consensus that it was not worth the cost     We may have just made some news  NPR s Simon told Stevens  sounding surprised   And I think really that in time that will be the general consensus with respect to this particular drug  said the former justice  Appointed by former President Gerald Ford in 1975  the 94 year old retired from the bench in 2010  But Stevens points out an evolving landscape when it comes to attitudes on the drug  especially with two states legalizing recreational marijuana sales and usage  For the first time in four decades of polling  more than half of all Americans now favor legalizing marijuana  and that support is continuing to rise  according to the latest Pew poll  The same poll showed that 75  of Americans believe marijuana legalization is  inevitable  Stevens has been making news this past week while he is currently promoting his new book titled  Six Amendments  in which he details the six changes he would make to the Constitution  In his book  he proposes doing away with the death penalty  enforcing limits on corporate donations in elections  and implementing stricter gun control laws  Simon also asked Stevens about his views on marriage equality in the interview Stevens said that he remains confident that same sex marriage will be allowed in every state from witnessing the  dramatic change in public opinion   The fact that the general public s reaction to same sex marriage has changed so dramatically within the last decade makes me more confident that in due course  when people actually think through the issues  they ll be willing to accept the merits of some of my arguments  Stevens said  ,04/24/14 07:10 PM,marijuana
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/judge-bars-some-evidence-zimmerman-trial, Updated May 28  2 22 pm A Florida judge ruled Tuesday that George Zimmerman s defense team cannot mention Trayvon Martin s suspension from school  prior marijuana use  text messages or past fighting during opening statements at next month s trial  Judge Debra Nelson said that during the trial she will consider motions to admit details as evidence on a case by case basis  outside the presence of jurors who will decide if Zimmerman is guilty of second degree murder in the shooting death of Martin  Capping a slew of rulings on pre trial motions  Nelson rejected a defense request for a trial delay and ruled that jury selection will begin June 10   This case has dragged on long enough  prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda said in arguing for the trial to start as scheduled  Over the course of two hours  Nelson granted numerous motions by prosecutors  who argued that details of the slain teen s past are not be relevant to the Feb  26  2012  confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin and should not be discussed before the jury  Defense lawyer Mark O Mara asked the judge not to pre emptively exclude the information  saying that it bolstered their theory of the shooting   that the 17 year old was the aggressor and Zimmerman shot him in self defense   There is certainly enough evidence that s going to suggest Trayvon Martin involved himself ongoingly with fighting with other people  O Mara said  He said the defense had obtained video of three fights   two in which Martin acted as a referee and a third in which two friends  were beating up a homeless guy  The defense also wanted the right to present text messages  like one from November 2011 in which Martin seemed to refer to an organized fight   He got mo hits cause in da 1st round  He had me on da ground nd I couldn t do ntn  Prosecutors argued that since Zimmerman and Martin didn t know each other before the shooting  whether the teen had been involved in fights had no bearing on how the defendant reacted that night  The judge ruled that the evidence about past fights could not be mentioned in opening statements but said it could be admitted during trial if the defense can authenticate it and overcome rules against hearsay evidence  She said she may let the jury hear that Martin had a marijuana ingredient in his blood the night of the shooting after she hears from experts about the toxicology tests that were performed  The defense and prosecution disagree about whether the results show the teen had smoked pot before he and Zimmerman crossed paths  Outside the Seminole County courthouse  Martin family lawyer Benjamin Crump praised the judge for limiting what the jury hears about guns  drugs or fighting in Martin s past   Trayvon Martin did not have a gun  Trayvon Martin did not get out of the car to chase anybody  Trayvon Martin did not shoot and kill anybody  Trayvon Martin is not on trial  Crump said  The two parties will be back in court before the trial starts for more hearings  including one that will examine whether prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense  Zimmerman s team put an outside lawyer on the stand  Wesley White  who testified that photos from Martin s cellphone were never shared with them White  who resigned as a state prosecutor in December and is now in private practice  represents the state attorney s office s information technology director  Ben Kruidbos   who will be called to testify June 6 about the allegedly withheld images  In other rulings  Nelson decided the jury will not be sequestered as the defense wanted but will be referred to by number  not name  during the selection process  She also decided against bringing jurors to the place where Martin was killed  calling it a  logistical nightmare  and noting that it seemed to fly in the face of the defense request that the panel be kept under wraps  Zimmerman   who was not in court Tuesday   has pleaded not guilty  He told police he resorted to self defense after Martin punched him and beat his head to the ground after the two encountered each other in a gated community  Robert Zimmerman Jr  read a statement to the media after the hearing in which he described his younger brother as a civic minded crime fighter who became his  staunchest advocate  after he came out as gay more than a decade ago  The brother blasted the state special prosecutor for bringing a murder case against Zimmerman after he was not charged by Sanford police   The politics of race trumped the rule of law and a political calculation was made  Robert Zimmerman said   It was the wrong decision  Editor s note  George Zimmerman has sued NBCUniversal for defamation in civil court  and the company has strongly denied his allegations  This article originally appeared on NBCNews com here  ,05/28/13 11:55 AM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/week-god-50, As  This Week  in God  settles in on Saturday mornings  the God Machine has plenty to offer again this week First up is the latest nonsense from radical TV preacher Pat Robertson  who argued the other day that brutal tornadoes that sliced across the Midwest and the South should be blamed on the victims  Seriously  that s what he said As Brian Tashman reported  Robertson was asked on his  700 Club  program why God allowed the natural disaster to do so much harm  and the right wing host offered a rather startling response He said that the storms weren t a malicious act of God and instead turned it around on the victims  asking   why did you build houses where tornadoes were apt to happen   Robertson continued that the tornadoes may not have happened if people had prayed for divine intervention   If enough people were praying He would ve intervened  you could pray  Jesus stilled the storm  you can still storms  He also told people who live in areas prone to natural disasters that it s  their fault  not God s He did not appear to be kidding Incidentally  Robertson also caused a stir this week when he suggested that marijuana use should be legal  making this an odd week for the former Republican presidential candidate Also from the God Machine this week  The U S  Conference of Catholic Bishops sent a letter to members of Congress  urging them not to cut federal funding on safety net programs  including investments in health care  Pell Grants  affordable housing  and food stamps  While Republican lawmakers take the Bishops  thoughts on contraception very seriously  GOP officials are expected to ignore the Bishops  appeals in this area  There s an interesting dispute in Bideford  England  where a move to end Christian prayers at public meetings has touched off a larger fight over  the question of whether Christianity should hold a privileged place in a modern  diverse and highly secular society   thanks to reader V S  for passing this along  And as Alyssa Rosenberg reported this week  TLC has cancelled a reality show called All American Muslim  which was at the center of a culture war skirmish in which anti Muslim activists pushed advertisers to drop their sponsorship of the program  ,03/10/12 10:10 AM,marijuana
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/will-2014-be-anti-incumbent-wave-election, In one scenario  the 2014 midterm elections could become known as a throw the bums out  anti incumbent wave with more than a dozen sitting governors and senators being tossed from office by fed up voters  But it s just as easy to imagine that most or all the incumbents up for re election will narrowly hang on to their jobs  despite record levels of disillusionment and disgust with America s gridlocked government  During the primaries  several incumbent  establishment GOP senators were able to beat back surprising challenges from tea party backed candidates  That included Sens  Pat Roberts of Kansas  Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  Thad Cochran of Mississippi  John Cornyn of Texas  Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  INTERACTIVE  2014 Senate landscape In the House of Representatives  the biggest incumbent to get the boot in the primaries was House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia  who succumbed to tea party challenger Dave Brat in one of the most surprising elections in recent memory  On the Democratic side  Rep  John Tierney of Massachusetts lost to challenger Seth Moulton and Hawaii Gov  Neil Abercrombie s 40 year political career came to an end after losing to State Sen  David Ige  But  overall  incumbents  relative success in the primaries doesn t mean they re safe in November  Looking ahead to the general election  several incumbents   both Democratic and Republican   are in real danger  We received input from the msnbc com community on which of these races you are paying particularly close attention to  Here s a look at the most talked about incumbents who could be out of a job come next year  We want to hear from you  For the next article in this series  tell us  Which independent and third party candidates do you think could spoil election results this year  Kansas Sen  Pat Roberts  The Republican senator from Kansas has been in trouble for quite some time  narrowly beating out tea party challenger Milton Wolf in the state s GOP primary  This Senate race has thrown a wrench into both parties  plans  Democratic candidate Chad Taylor dropped out of the competition in September  leaving Roberts  the incumbent  trying to secure a fourth term against independent candidate Greg Orman  What makes the race even more of a wild card is that Orman hasn t said which party he would caucus with in the Senate  Roberts has tried to pain Orman as a liberal in disguise in this red state  Orman  meanwhile  has tried to pitch himself as an independent voice that is much needed on Capitol Hill  According to a new NBC Marist poll  Orman is leading Roberts by 1 point  Earlier this month  however  Orman led by 10 points  Alaska Sen  Mark Begich   The Democratic senator from Alaska  elected in 2008 after beating veteran Republican Sen  Ted Stevens  is in the hot seat himself  Begich faces a stiff challenge from Republican Dan Sullivan in a state President Obama lost by 14 points to Mitt Romney in 2012  Sullivan is trying to tie Begich to Obama  who is unpopular in the state  Begich  meanwhile  is trying to distance himself from the president  even going as far to recently say he s  not relevant  Begich has gone after Sullivan  who served as the state s natural resources commissioner  for not being an Alaska native  The RealClearPolitics average of polling data surrounding the race shows Republican challenger Dan Sullivan up by 4 2 points    Pennsylvania Gov  Tom Corbett   It s looking likely that the Republican Pennsylvania governor who was first elected in 2010  will lose to Democratic businessman Tom Wolf  Corbett has been under intense scrutiny over several issues  including his response to the Penn State sex abuse scandal  cuts to education and a sputtering economy that he inherited  North Carolina Sen  Kay Hagan  A new NBC News Marist survey released Sunday shows the Democratic incumbent senator tied with her GOP opponent  state House Speaker Thom Tillis  with 43  each  Hagan had a 4 point lead earlier this month  While Hagan has been trying to distance herself from Obama  who remains unpopular in the state  Tillis has gone after Hagan on a slew of issues  including her attendance record at Armed Services Committee hearings  He has also accused her of not doing enough in the Senate to combat the terrorist group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria  Louisiana Sen Mary Landrieu  The incumbent Louisiana senator is being challenged for a fourth term by Republican Rep  Bill Cassidy and tea party favorite Rob Maness  While polls have consistently showed Landrieu with a lead against Cassidy  she s not near the 50  threshold required by the state to avoid a runoff election on Dec  6 between the top two candidates  Right now  the GOP vote is being divided by Cassidy and Maness  But if Landrieu is forced into a runoff between just her and Cassidy  polls show the sitting senator could lose  Republicans have aired ads skewering Landrieu s support for Obamacare  Landrieu  meanwhile  is trying to distance herself from Obama s energy and health care policies  Arkansas Sen Mark Pryor   A new NBC News Marist survey showed the Arkansas incumbent Democratic senator  elected in 2003  with 43  support among likely voters  compared to GOP challenger Tom Cotton with 45   within the poll s margin of error  Pryor has been trying to distance himself from Obama  who remains unpopular in this red state where Obama lost to Mitt Romney in 2012 by a 24 point margin  Florida Gov  Rick Scott  Several polls have shown the Florida Republican governor deadlocked with Republican turned Democrat Charlie Crist  The two are not very popular in the Sunshine State and voter turnout is expected to be the tipping factor in this race  Crist  a former Florida governor  has tried to paint Scott as an out of touch businessman  while Scott has attempted to brand Crist as an untrustworthy flip flopper  The two have fought fiercely over several issues  including the economy  immigration  medical marijuana and state executions  New Hampshire Sen  Jeanne Shaheen  Republican Scott Brown  a former Massachusetts senator  hopes to unseat Democratic incumbent Sen  Jeanne Shaheen in this race in New Hampshire  Brown has trailed consistently throughout the campaign  but recent surveys indicate he is closing the gap  Brown  defeated in Massachusetts in 2012 by Elizabeth Warren  has been trying to tie Shaheen to Obama s positions on health care  immigration and foreign policy as the president remains unpopular in the state  Shaheen  in turn  has accused Brown of being a carpetbagger and has called him a protector of big oil companies  Colorado Sen  Mark Udall   According to a new NBC News Marist poll  Udall is in serious danger of losing his Senate seat  His Republican challenger  Cory Gardner  has a 1 point lead among likely voters in Colorado  according to the survey  In September  Udall had a 6 point lead  Udall has stressed his support for abortion rights and contraception in hopes of winning over young  single women who often don t vote in midterm elections  He has gone after Gardner s past support for  personhood  legislation  which would restrict access to certain types of birth control  Republicans  meanwhile  have tried to tie Udall to Obama  who is unpopular in the state  Gardner has repeatedly attacked Udall for voting for Obamacare  Wisconsin Gov  Scott Walker   Recent polls have shown Republican incumbent Gov  Scott Walker and Democratic challenger Mary Burke in a dead heat  The stakes are high  especially for Walker  who survived a recall election in 2012 and is considered a potential 2016 presidential candidate  Walker and Burke  a businesswoman and former Wisconsin commerce secretary  both played it safe during their final debate Friday  sticking to state and local issues and shying away from more controversial ones   like collective bargaining power  the minimum wage and reproductive rights   that have fiercely divided the electorate  Additional sitting governors in the danger zone include Republican Govs  Sean Parnell in Alaska  Nathan Deal in Georgia  Sam Brownback in Kansas  and Paul LePage in Maine  On the Democratic side  it s John Hickenlooper in Colorado  Dan Malloy in Connecticut and Pat Quinn in Illinois  Poll  Which incumbent candidate is the most likely to be unseated on Nov  4   ,10/27/14 11:58 AM,marijuana
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obama-sees-bigger-fish-fry, It s been over a month since voters in Colorado and the state of Washington approved ballot measures to legalize recreational use and sale of marijuana  despite federal law that reaches a very different conclusion  Yesterday  President Obama addressed the discrepancy for the first time President Obama says recreational users of marijuana in states that have legalized the substance should not be a  top priority  of federal law enforcement officials prosecuting the war on drugs We ve got bigger fish to fry  Obama said of pot users in Colorado and Washington during an exclusive interview with ABC News  Barbara Walters It would not make sense for us to see a top priority as going after recreational users in states that have determined that it s legal  he said  invoking the same approach taken toward users of medicinal marijuana in 18 states where it s legal The president added that this is a tough problem  because Congress has not yet changed the law  He told ABC   I head up the executive branch  we re supposed to be carrying out laws  And so what we re going to need to have is a conversation about  how do you reconcile a federal law that still says marijuana is a federal offense and state laws that say that it s legal While Obama s comments will be heartening to many on the left  especially those who voted with the majority in Colorado and Washington  and it makes sense the president has little interest in sending federal law enforcement after  recreational users  it s far less clear whether the DEA intends to take a similar approach when dealing with those who cultivate and sell marijuana  even in states where it s legal As Matt Yglesias explained   The DEA doesn t have the resources to target a guy for sharing a bowl with his friends  but they certainly do have the resources to target a large marijuana farm or a fixed location marijuana retailer trying to establish a legal business  What s more  they have the resources to arrest and prosecute state officials who involve themselves in the licensing and permitting for legal marijuana businesses Congressional intervention is needed and practically inevitable  Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt  said yesterday the Senate Judiciary Committee is planning a hearing early next year to examine the legal ambiguities and consider legislative options  ,12/14/12 11:42 AM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/the-reid-report/chat-gavin-newsom-and-the-moodie-mills-power-couple, In the msnbc original series Generation to Generation  we take a side by side look at the work of civil rights leaders from the 1960s and their modern day counterparts  This week  the series features Lt  Governor of California  Gavin Newsom and Politini Media Co founders  Danielle and Aisha Moodie Mills  Close video       The Reid Report  5 19 14  3 18 PM ET       All eyes on Oregon same sex marriage ruling       Aisha Moodie Mills and Danielle Moodie Mills  both of the Center for American Progress  join Joy Reid to discuss how the fight for marriage equality has transformed in the last decade    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss In 2004  as San Francisco s Mayor  Newsom defied state laws by directing the city county clerk to issue marriages licenses to same sex couples  He continued his fierce support of same sex marriage by being a vocal opponent of Proposition 8  The Moodie Mills are a media power couple who use Politini to  shift culture by exploring the personal side of politics  You ll often see them on msnbc speaking to LGBT  women in politics  and race issues   The LGBT advocates responded to a range of msnbc com community questions from AIDS to marijuana  Take a look at the conversation below   Aisha and Danielle Moodie MIlls responded to the questions collectively  Luke Leifeste  How did you deal with the onslaught of naysayers along the way in your fight for LGBT rights  Did you tune out the  haters  or prefer to take them head on  The Moodie Mills  There will always be haters that work tirelessly to block progress and never enough time in your day to take them all on  We focus on moving the ball forward and that takes energy and focus that can t be wasted on naysayers  Although  we are human  so when we shared our wedding photos on Essence and commenters came after our family  we did step in and try to shut the negativity down  The good news is that naysayers have been far and few in between in our experience  What we ve learned is that few can disavow or deny basic love  and so we try to lead from that place of love  We strive each day to live authentically and love openly and to connect with people around our common humanity  This has helped us to demystify stereotypes about LGBT people and connect with people who haven t been considered natural allies of the LGBT community   I am someone who cannot support denying a basic human right to two people who love one another  Gavin Newsom  Lt  Gov  of California Lt  Governor Newsom There was a lot of resistance around same sex marriage when we began issuing licenses in San Francisco in 2004  While good people can disagree  I am someone who cannot support denying a basic human right to two people who love one another  When we started issuing those licenses   and in the end had 4 036 couples come to San Francisco to get married   it was about doing the right thing and standing on principal  not on making headlines or confronting any naysayers  Early on  there were protests and a lot of hateful actions  But over the last 10 years  the public opinion has changed not only because of the court cases we ve seen at every level across the country  but also because of the thousands of conversations that are happening over the dinner table  at birthday parties  driving to work  etc  and people realize that granting same sex couples the right to get married is in the end no different than their own marriages  Matthew Kaye Should the transmission of HIV be decriminalized nationally  The Moodie Mills  Absolutely  From the beginning of the HIV epidemic  prevailing public misperceptions about the routes  risks  and consequences of HIV transmission have been wrought with homophobia  transphobia and stigma about LGBT people and people living with HIV   and public policy has often perpetuated that stigma  In 36 states  people living with HIV can be charged with felonies for having consensual sex  and for conduct  such as spitting or biting  which pose no measurable risk of HIV transmission  These laws don t even require any evidence of intent to do harm  and they do nothing to curb HIV transmission  Instead they humiliate and devastate the lives of people who are already dealing with a myriad of health issues  Lt  Governor Newsom HIV and AIDS are very serious diseases  Too many people around the globe are still infected  Though we ve been able to curb the rapid rate and spread of infections  work and investment still need to be done to find a cure  Access to health care needs to be increased  and we need to strengthen programs for support  including ending discrimination of those already infected  Nathan Wesley I ll never forget when you said   Oh  it s coming whether you like it or not  And now it s basically here  Now let s get marijuana moved from Schedule 1 with heroin  ahead of cocaine  and down to Schedule 3 or 4 where it has always belonged  Lt  Governor Newsom Nathan  you are correct  Marijuana is currently listed as a schedule 1 drug  next to LSD and heroin and above cocaine  This schedule also means marijuana has no medical use whatsoever  With numerous research officials disproving that and personal stories of family members or friends benefitting from medical use of marijuana throughout the country  we now have 23 states and Washington  D C  with laws allowing use of marijuana medically  We are also seeing members of congress calling for a change in the schedule and a shift in views for recreational use  You know that Colorado and Washington are already legally selling marijuana to adults  while Oregon and Alaska are looking at ballot initiatives in November  In California we are working on an initiative that addresses age limits  taxation  regulation and education about smoking and eating marijuana   before taking it to the voters  It s the old adage  If you want to go fast go alone  but if you want to go far go together  We want to do this right so we are looking at and learning from the implementation and application of legal recreational use in Colorado and Washington  From Jennifer Jackson With the current drought  what s the direction California is taking on climate change  Lt  Governor Newsom One of California s top priorities is combating climate change  Our focus is on adaptability and reducing greenhouse gas emissions  A lot of work is happening in California  We are leading the way in fuel standards  Under AB 32  our goal is to return our emissions back to 1990 levels by 2020  which we are on track to do  Then we have a goal to reduce our emissions by 85  by 2050  We continue to explore and make use of alternate energy in wind and solar  Additionally  as I sit on the California State Lands Commission  we are aggressively mapping our 1 000 miles of coastline  and the California Public Utilities Commission is establishing a framework for adaptability  We also have a governor who believes we need to combat climate change as well  In the past four years  Gov  Brown has agreed and signed a pact with our neighbors in Oregon  as well as Mexico  China and Canada  to address greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution   Working at your local LGBT youth center or chapters of national organizations like GLSEN and The Trevor Project are great places to lend your time and talent  Aisha and Danielle Moodie Mills From Alan Bumgarner  What s a good way for someone  young or old  to get more involved in advocacy in their communities  What are some good organizations to volunteer with    Lt  Governor Newsom  I would advise any person looking to get involved to seek first to understand  then to be understood  Be open to argument and interested in evidence and not be ideological  I would say that everyone s expression is unique   no on else has it  Be sure to maintain your authenticity and stand on principal  then volunteer with an organization you believe in  At this point  it s hard to expect anything good from politicians in Washington  They are going to continue using the border crisis as an excuse to  not  act on immigration  both  the president and congress  And if they ever give relief to the community  they will also militarize the border even more as a condition  What I expect from the rest of us  is to learn more about this border culture  why people are fleeing their homes  why that border is there and since when  The situation in which we live today has root causes  We need to build grass roots to change the communities we live in  where directly affected people are  The Moodie Mills LGBT equality needs to be achieved on two fronts  through culture and through policy  All politics are local  so starting with your local government and making sure that the policies that are created are LGBT inclusive is of the utmost importance  Volunteer with local campaigns of candidates that support LGBT equality  LGBT youth are some of the most vulnerable among us  They are more likely to be living on the streets than their heterosexual peers and more likely to attempt suicide  Working at your local LGBT youth

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/up-with-steve-kornacki/toast-the-organizers, On Tuesday night  after the race had been called for President Obama  the first call I made was to my brother Luke  When I got married in July of 2007  Luke had to take a few days off of his new job as an Obama campaign field organizer in Nevada to attend the wedding  That was more than five years ago  and in the intervening 64 months  my brother has spent every single day working for the Obama campaign and its sister organization Organizing for America  He s worked in eight states  at times literally living out of clothes in trash bags  while putting 87 thousand miles on a beat up old white ford pick up truck  Sixty to ninety hours a week  52 weeks a year for five years  my brother worked to get Barack Obama elected president  and then from his perch as the Nevada state director this time around  to get him re elected  I m biased of course  but to me  Tuesday s victory was Luke s victory as much it was anyone else s  Luke and the thousands like him  organizers of every hue and background and creed  in states across the union working preposterously long hours doing the grueling  sometimes comically mundane labor of making democracy work calling people knocking on doors  sending emails  sitting through endless meetings and conference calls and sorting columns on spread sheets  and buying office supplies  in bulk  or slightly used so as to come in under budget  negotiating leases for field offices  getting yelled at by disgruntled volunteers  getting yelled at by stressed out bosses  getting yelled at by diva esque local officials  There were thousands of people across the country like my brother doing this work  And not just for OFA  for local candidates from city council on up For the amazing successful  historic progressive ballot initiatives that passed across the country giving us the first popular victories for marriage equality in three states  and a beginning to the end of our insane policy of marijuana prohibition  When the victory bell rings  we rush to talk about the Great Men of History who made it so  the candidates and the master strategists who ran their campaigns  Or we point to the exit polling demographics and say it was destiny  fated and inevitable  But nothing in politics is inevitable and progress only comes about because of the tireless labor of organizers who never get to give speeches at podiums  who don t get vacation home money like the brand name strategists and who don t show up on cable news  unless they re in the background of a photo op  But the reward they do get is the fulfillment of the soul that comes from struggle  And the defeat and boredom that are inevitably part of that struggle make the rare moments of victory that much sweeter  If you want to see what that looks like check out this video from election night of Richard Carlbom of Minnesotans United for All Families  the group that fought the anti marriage equality ballot initiative in that state  At 1 45 a m  he addressed organizers and volunteers to tell them it was going to be too close to call and to go home and sleep and feel proud about the work they did  win or lose  And then communications director Kelly Schwinghammer announces that the AP has called the race  Richard Carlbom  I couldn t be more proud to have been in a position to lead you guys for the last over a year  And I can t thank you enough for all your hard work and dedication  It s blown my mind  every time every time I feel like we re just about to hit a wall  you guys blow right through that wall to make this a reality  so I want you to go to bed tonight  I want you to be very very proud of the result we have  Kelly Schwinghammer  Hey Richard  the AP just called it  Unless you ve done the work that the people in that room have done  you can t know how that feels  So to all the people in that room  and around the country and all the unsung thousands who toiled in the trenches of democracy  a toast  Thank you for what you did  thank you for what you do  Especially you  Luke  I m proud of you  ,11/10/12 08:29 AM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/it-was-the-economy-stupid, The 2013 elections were about Obamacare  say some  No  they were about the tea party  say others  No  they were about the war on women  say still others  The many and varied contests around the nation were about a lot of things  But in the three jurisdictions that garnered the most attention New York City  New Jersey  and Virginia the elections were about the economy  And if you had to declare an ideological victor  it would have to be liberalism  New York City The election of Bill de Blasio  the first Democrat sent to Gracie Mansion in two decades  affirmed the power of de Blasio s message on economic inequality  In the September primary  which made his Nov  5 victory a foregone conclusion  de Blasio moved up from fourth to first by telling voters that New York City had become a  tale of two cities  one rich and one poor  and proposed a tax on high incomes in order to fund universal pre K education  An exit poll showed that a 31  plurality of all voters deemed  jobs and unemployment  the most important issue  with education  21  a distant second  In the Nov  5 general  the proportion naming  jobs and unemployment  the most important issue rose to 38   I talk about a crisis of inequality  de Blasio told Dan Balz of the Washington Post on Oct  19   because it s not just about the cost of living  It s not just about the dumbing down of wages and benefits  It s not just about the effects of the recession  It is all that plus continuing inequalities in education  continuing inequalities in health care  obviously deeper inequalities in policing than we experienced  say  a decade ago  This mostly economic message resonated with all income groups  including the  one percent  Among voters whose income exceeded  100 000  de Blasio beat his Republican opponent  Joe Lhota  64 33  Virginia Political junkies are puzzled that Democrat Terry McAuliffe beat Republican Ken Cuccinelli  a hard right social conservative  by only two and a half percentage points in the gubernatorial race  After all  pre election polls had shown McAuliffe up by six to 12 points  A logical answer would be the bungled rollout of Obamacare  an exit poll showed that 27 of voters ranked health care the most important issue  These voters favored McAuliffe 49 45  But the issue that a 45  plurality of Virginians ranked first was  once again  the economy  With a Democrat in the White House and unemployment at 7 2 as of September  the October numbers will be released Nov  8  the economy was always going to hurt McAuliffe  And indeed  among those who ranked the economy first  Cuccinelli won  49 43  The economy may also explain why Cuccinelli won the state s independents  47 38  even though many of these voters were expected to be turned off by Cuccinelli s extreme views on abortion and climate change  In the end  however  McAuliffe won the election  McAuliffe is no de Blasio he s a centrist business tycoon but one result of his election is that Cucinnelli s plan to lower individual and business tax rates  at a cost he projected to be  1 4 billion per year  won t be enacted  In that sense  liberalism won  New Jersey  Chris Christie s second term landslide gubernatorial victory in New Jersey  which was entirely expected  is being widely interpreted as a dress rehearsal for the 2016 presidential race and a shoring up of the GOP s non reactionary wing  But what it really demonstrates is that New Jersey s increasingly Democratic electorate can nonetheless stomach a candidate whom Sean Trende of RealClear Politics correctly identifies as  easily the most conservative politician elected to statewide office in New Jersey in the past 60 years  Christie may be too liberal on gun control and immigration  and too willing to acknowledge climate change  to win his party s presidential nomination  But when Christie rejects the  moderate  label  there s no reason not believe him  Economically  he s quite conservative  An exit poll shows that New Jersey  even more than New York City and Virginia  saw the Nov  5 election as being primarily about the economy  A 49 plurality ranked the economy first  with taxes a distant second  22  On this issue  Christie beat his Democratic opponent  Barbara Buono  65 33  Christie has sought a 10  reduction in the state income tax  He s also opposed an increase in the state minimum wage from  7 25 to  8 50  and he s opposed indexing it in the future to inflation a measure once embraced  and never quite repudiated  by Mitt Romney   Christie did  however  state that he d tolerate a gradual increase to  8 25  But Christie never enacted his income tax cut because New Jersey s state legislature  which was  and will remain  heavily Democratic  blocked it  And though Christie did veto the minimum wage increase to  8 50  on election day New Jersey voters enacted  by ballot initiative  an increase to  8 25 and future automatic increases pegged to the inflation rate   That same day  voters in SeaTac  Washington  mandated a  15  living wage  for hospitality and transporation workers at Seattle s international airport  The only truly noteworthy election day victory for conservative economic policy occurred in Colorado  a state with a Democratic governor and legislature  Colorado voters rejected a  1 billion school financing measure that had backing from Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg  Even in Colorado  though  victory was less than total  An effort by rural counties to secede from the state  motivated by hard right views on various economic and social issues  fizzled  and Colorado voters approved a 15  excise tax and 10  sales tax on marijuana  From an economic perspective  taxing the herb would have to be judged liberal even if antitax advocate Grover Norquist muddied the waters a bit by giving such taxes his blessing in advance    Poll  What do you think was the key election issue   ,11/06/13 08:00

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/nyt-editorial-board-calls-end-pot-prohibition, The New York Times  opinion section has taken some curious steps in recent months when talking about marijuana  Last month  for example  Maureen Dowd wrote about a terribly unpleasant incident in which she ingested far too much pot and ended up  in a hallucinatory state for the next eight hours   panting and paranoid    It followed a David Brooks column from earlier this year in which he noted his own experimentation before concluding that he wants a society in which  government subtly encourages the highest pleasures  like enjoying the arts or being in nature  and discourages lesser pleasures  like being stoned    One of the problems with Brooks  piece  of course  is that the United States doesn t just  discourage  the use of marijuana  we spend billions to fight it  imprisoning many of those who embrace the  lesser pleasures  It is  in other words  a prohibition   which the editorial board of the New York Times now wants to end  It took 13 years for the United States to come to its senses and end Prohibition  13 years in which people kept drinking  otherwise law abiding citizens became criminals and crime syndicates arose and flourished  It has been more than 40 years since Congress passed the current ban on marijuana  inflicting great harm on society just to prohibit a substance far less dangerous than alcohol    The federal government should repeal the ban on marijuana    We reached that conclusion after a great deal of discussion among the members of The Times s Editorial Board  inspired by a rapidly growing movement among the states to reform marijuana laws  On the surface  it may not seem especially important to think a newspaper ran an editorial on legalizing marijuana  Lots of newspapers run editorials on all kinds of issues every day    But in practice  the New York Times isn t just any paper  and the editorial board s willingness to adopt a bold stance on drug policy is emblematic of a national conversation has fundamentally changed   and may never be the same    The editorial itself acknowledges  legitimate concerns  before concluding that the balance  falls squarely on the side of national legalization     Creating systems for regulating manufacture  sale and marketing will be complex  the piece adds   But those problems are solvable  and would have long been dealt with had we as a nation not clung to the decision to make marijuana production and use a federal crime    Mark Kleiman  a national expert on drug policy  believes the Times  editorial is incomplete  brushing past some legitimate questions while ignoring others  His concerns clearly need to be part of the conversation    But I m nevertheless struck by the fact that a conversation exists at all  In the not too distant past  the idea of lifting the prohibition on marijuana seemed as fanciful as  well  marriage equality    A societal evolution appears to be well underway    ,07/28/14 09:21 AM,marijuana
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/could-colorado-lose-democrats-the-senate, ELDORADO SPRINGS  Colorado   When Sen  Mark Udall tried to climb Mt  Everest in 1996  60 mile per hour winds on the mountain s north face forced him to turn back The point  the Colorado Democrat said last week as he walked down the road to the Mesa Trailhead near his home here   is to come home alive  It doesn t count if you touch the top of the mountain and you don t make it back The stakes Udall faces now aren t life and death but if he loses his unexpectedly close bid for re election against Republican Rep  Cory Gardner in November  control of the Senate is all but guaranteed to flip to the GOP  Democrats can only lose a net of five seats to retain control of the chamber  with red state races in Arkansas  Alaska  Arkansas and Louisiana all more likely to flip than blue Colorado  a Udall loss could be catastrophic This has always been a tough map from the very beginning  said Udall s fellow Democratic Colorado senator  Michael Bennet  who this year is running the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee   We ve known it was going to be a tough map But Udall s race in what has been an increasingly Democratic state has been creeping closer and closer as the months have worn on  President Obama is becoming more unpopular  The genial  mild mannered Gardner  his hobby  restoring antique furniture  is a contrast with the firebrand conservatives who ran unsuccessfully for Senate and governor in the state in 2010  and national Republicans considered it a coup when they convinced Gardner to jump into the race   It relegated Ken Buck  the erstwhile 2010 Senate nominee who lost to Bennet  to running for the House   A big smile s a nice thing  I think we hall have big smiles  but your record matters  your actions matter  To beat Gardner  Udall has been almost singularly focused on the Republican s support for hard line positions on abortion and contraception  Nearly half of Udall s ads have attacked Gardner for  among other things  supporting a state  personhood  initiative that could criminalize many forms of birth control A big smile s a nice thing  I think we hall have big smiles  but your record matters  your actions matter  Udall told msnbc   His positions would move us backwards Gardner has since reversed his stance on the state personhood measure   But his name is still on a very similar federal law There is no federal personhood bill   they re two different pieces of legsiatlion  And I understand Sen  Udall he wants to run away from the failed economy  Garnder said when asked about the Life at Conception Act  which Personhood USA  which supports such initiatives around the country  says is in fact a federal personhood measure Asked to identify the difference between Colorado s state initiative and the nationwide version  Gardner focused on procedural differences  not policy Again  you re talking about a bill that s at the state level that was at the amendment to the constitution  They re different from a procedural posture they re different language  Gardner s discomfort crystallizes what the race is really about  women  particularly unmarried women who live in Denver and its surrounding suburbs Younger  single voters tend to participate less in midterm elections than in presidential contests  With his focus on reproductive health care  Udall is counting on a turnout boost among young women  Gardner s challenge is convincing those women that they should be focused on other issues  His approach so far is twofold  He s trying to tie Udall to Obama  and he s going after the Udall family for its long history in politics  Mark Udall s father  Mo Udall  was a near legendary Democratic senator from Arizona who made a short lived run for president in 1976 Eighteen years in politics and he s got two cousins who are senators too  Mark Udall s dad even ran for president  a new Gardner ad declares  Udall s two cousins are Democrat Tom Udall of New Mexico and Mike Lee of Utah Udall took umbrage at the ad  demanding it be taken down No way  Gardner said   I m running against a person who has a Wikipedia page for his political dynasty   I m running against a person who has a Wikipedia name a Wikipedia page for his political dynasty that his family runs  Gardner said in an interview Gardner also insists that his rival is much closer to Obama than he tries to claim  during a recent debate  Gardner supporters hooted and laughed when Udall declared Let me tell you  the White House when they look down the front lawn the last person they want to see coming is me  Udall says he has stood up to Obama on a range of issues  including abuses at the CIA and National Security Agency  Still  he is one of the only lawmakers to ever play golf with the president Over the last six months I ve been a thorn in their side  On the NSA  on the VA  Veterans Affairs  on the CIA  they haven t always been happy to take my phone calls over there  Udall said What s not clear at this point  though  is whether Udall or Gardner will be able to break the race out of the pattern it s been stuck in for months  And observers are also raising questions about the governor s race also taking place in the state and how it will affect the Senate contest   Democratic Gov  John Hickenlooper has dropped in polls in recent weeks amid controversies over the death penalty and guns At particular issue  Hickenlooper s reprieve for Nathan Dunlap  who was convicted of killing four people in a shooting rampage at a Chuck E  Cheese where he worked  In an interview with CNN  Hickenlooper suggested that he might grant full clemency to Dunlap an idea that drew a rebuke even from Udall   No  Udall said when asked if he believed Dunlap should be granted clemency Hickenlooper s challenges could affect the makeup of the midterm electorate in Colorado  which is Udall s other critical hurdle  Democrats are quick to insist that their operation in the state is unparalleled  Udall aides say their data is so good that they are targeting not just counties or ZIP codes but individual voters  Nationally  the Democratic turnout operation is called the Bannock Street Project  after the Denver roadway where Bennet had his headquarters in 2010 and won in a strongly Republican year Forty days out we ve got a ground game here that we ve never seen in an off year election  Bennet said of the 2014 effort   Three times better than when I ran Another potential wrench for Democrats  Pot  When Obama won the state by  5 points in 2012  an initiative to legalize marijuana was on the ballot  possibly lifting participation among younger  Democratic leaning voters  There s no comparable measure ballot this time  Udall says that he s trying to help the new marijuana industry get access to banking services  but that s not a major issue in the race  As for the candidates themselves  Both say they ve stayed away No  I haven t  No  No  Gardner insisted when asked if he d consumed any legal marijuana Said Udall   I have not  Poll  Will Democrats hold onto the Senate in November   ,10/02/14 12:03 PM,marijuana
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/all-in/congress-plays-lets-make-deal, Big news on multiple fronts out of Washington  Wednesday  and the word of the day on Capitol Hill was  deal  The big deal Wednesday on Capitol Hill was the reaching or leaking of big deals  And the way that Washington talks about a deal is that a deal is inherently good because a deal is the end  in and of itself   You re always looking for a deal  so when you get one it must be good news  But in the real world  where we all have to live every day  a deal is good only if it s a good deal Deals are  almost by definition  cut in the center  And so what matters most in Washington deal making is how the center is defined And what made two of the deals being rolled out on Wednesday  at least tentatively promising is the fact that the center around which they are crafted is remarkably further to the left than it was just six months ago  Take the big  bipartisan gun deal  announced by Sens  Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey  It s pretty narrow deal  policy wise  simply designed to expand background checks to cover gun show and internet sales  The cost of the deal  apparently  was private  person to person sales  which still be exempt from background checks NBC reported today that the NRA was a  near constant  presence in the room as Manchin and Toomey worked out the details  And  for his part  Sen  Toomey would prefer that you not even refer to it as gun control  See that right there  that s the power of the center  The center gets to be  common sense  Everything else is defined as  politics   Now  as narrow as this background check deal may be when put up against the staggering problem of gun violence in this country   it is still a remarkable thing Even just six months ago  the idea of the senate opening debate on a bipartisan gun safety bill of any kind would have been unthinkable There has not been a major piece of gun control legislation debated in the senate since 1994   that was the last time we saw anything like what s happening right now  Almost 20 years ago  The only gun measure to get through Congress during Barack Obama s first term was  notably  an amendment to allow you to carry firearms into National Parks And even though the NRA was apparently physically looming over the negotiations  the deal announced on Wednesday is exactly the sort of thing that the NRA has been fighting like crazy to prevent The NRA s elite  placebo nightmare is now on its way to almost coming true  In real life  In a move from Capitol Hill that could not have been imagined last year  The other big deal in the news comes to us from the bipartisan group of eight Senators tasked with coming up with an immigration reform framework  Those eight senators are just about ready to present their proposal to the rest of the senate And Patrick Leahy  the chair of the Judiciary Committee has already set a hearing for the compromise bill for one week from today  This pivotal movement on immigration  just happened to coincide with rallies  held in Washington and all over the country pushing for reform Now  judging from the details of the immigration compromise that are leaking to the press at this point the path to legal status for undocumented workers in this country would be obstructed by some really draconian border security requirements But even so  again   any deal at all on immigration is a deal that would simply not have happened six months ago Six months ago  the leader of the Republican Party sounded like this on immigration  In a matter of months  Republicans have gone from being the party of    I can t have illegals   to working out a deal with Democrats on immigration that does not center around the mystifying and cruel concept of self deportation Of course  having lost the last election among Latino voters by a 44 point margin probably helped them along in their re awakening on the issue But even after that shellacking among Latinos  even after Republicans seemed to be coming to the table on immigration  there were moments  over the course of the last few weeks  when it looked like the base was about ready to abandon the effort  There was Jeb Bush s immigration book  out last month  arguing that undocumented immigrants should never be allowed a pathway to citizenship  And then  as recently as a couple of weeks ago  it was starting to look like Marco Rubio   a key member of that bipartisan group working toward a deal   might be getting cold feet  And  to be clear Republicans still might change their minds and decide to blow this whole thing up after all  But today they re talking about a deal on immigration  And that itself is a victory for the forces of righteousness  Both of these deals on Wednesday were  for progressives  encouraging developments because they show how what could broadly be called the Obama coalition is succeeding in pushing the center of domestic political conversation on a whole host of major issues to the left  On some issues  like marijuana legalization in the states and marriage equality   the Obama coalition has been able to move the conversation farther to the left  faster than anyone thought conceivable And in domestic politics one huge pressing exception to that pattern perhaps the only place where the center is still defined as so far to the right that we are still living in the 2010 Tea Party world  is austerity  The terms of the conversation about austerity and budgets and jobs are still defined by the peak moments of Gadsden flags and tri corner hats  Which brings us to Wednesday s third deal   a bad deal that is redeemed by the fact that it is the one of the three deals that is not yet struck  And probably won t be It is  instead  a deal offered in the form of the president s budget  Which  I should say  contains some great progressive stuff  But there s also this  The third to last bullet point in a five page summary of the president s budget is a proposed cut to Social Security benefits  Because the center of debate on fiscal policy is so far to the right  that cutting Social Security benefits is part of the Democratic president s budget proposal  The center gets defined in a whole host of ways   who shows up to elections  who gets to appear on cable news  who stands outside on the National Mall or in the street carrying signs And we ve seen activists mobilize to tremendous early effect on guns and on immigration  And what we have not seen at this point is mass sustained mobilization against austerity  And we are seeing the results of that absence of political pressure

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/washingtons-silence-the-racial-wealth-gap, In 1967  with the Civil Rights movement still in full swing and Jim Crow still looming in the rearview mirror  median household income was 43  higher for white  non Hispanic households than for black households  But things changed dramatically over the next half century  as legal segregation faded into history  By 2011  median white household income was 72  higher than median black household income  according to a Census report from that year  PDF  To say that economic inequality is still a heavily racialized phenomenon  even a generation after the end of the Civil Rights era  would be an understatement  Yet both major parties continue to discuss inequality in largely color blind terms  only hinting at the role played by race  The trend is even more startling when one looks at median household wealth instead of yearly income  In 1984  the white to black wealth ratio was 12 to 1  according to Pew Research Center  By 1995  the chasm had narrowed until median white income had only a 5 to 1 advantage over black income  But over the next 14 years the wealth gap began to grow once again  until it had skyrocketed up to 19 to 1 in 2009  Yet even a recent 204 page analysis of the federal War on Poverty  spearheaded by Rep  Paul Ryan  R Wis  gives only passing mentions to racial disparity  In the first section of the report  which purports to explain the causes of modern poverty  Ryan and his co authors bring up race only twice  Once to identify  the breakdown of the familiy as a key cause of poverty within the black community  citing Daniel Patrick Moynihan  and again to applaud the narrowing of the  achievement gap  between white and black schoolchildren  Weeks later  during a radio appearance  Ryan said poverty is in part to blame on the fact that  inner cities  have a culture of  men not working  President Obama went a step forward in December s major address on inequality  when he noted that  the painful legacy of discrimination means that African Americans  Latinos  Native Americans are far more likely to suffer from a lack of opportunity higher unemployment  higher poverty rates  Yet that amounted to a footnote in a speech that also included the line   The opportunity gap in America is now as much about class as it is about race   I think it doesn t make for good politics  said Color of Change executive director Rashad Robinson of the racial wealth gap   It s messy and requires us to be deep and think about much bigger and more long term solutions than Washington s oftentimes willing to deal with  Yet in a serious discussion about American inequality  the subject of race is essentially unavoidable  That s because most of the pipelines to a higher economic class such as employment and homeownership are  oftentimes not equally accessible to black folks  said Robinson  Disparities in homeownership are a major driver of the racial wealth gap  according to a recent study from Brandeis University  According to the authors of the report   redlining  a form of discrimination in banking or insurance practices  discriminatory mortgage lending practices  lack of access to credit  and lower incomes have blocked the homeownership path for African Americans while creating and reinforcing communities segregated by race  Many of the black families that have successfully battled their way to homeownership over the past few decades saw their nest eggs get pulverized by the 2008 financial collapse  The Brandeis researchers found that  half the collective wealth of African American families was stripped away during the Great Recession  in large part due to the collapse of the housing market and the subsequent explosion in the nationwide foreclosure rate  Similarly  employment discrimination has done its part to ensure that black unemployment remains twice as high as white unemployment a ratio that has stayed largely consistent since the mid 1950s  National Bureau of Economy Research fellows have found that resumes are significantly less likely to get a positive response from potential employers if the applicants have names that are more common in the black community  And an arrest for even a non violent drug offense can haunt a job applicant for the rest of his life  combined with the fact that black people are nearly four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than whites  despite using the drug at roughly the same rate  criminal background checks have helped to fuel racial inequity in job hiring  Yet both parties have stressed personal responsibility to an outsized degree  said William Darity Jr  the director of Duke University s Consortium on Social Equity   The underlying narrative that many people share is that whatever inequities still exist  they re due to the misbehavior or disfunctional behavior of black folks themselves  said Darity   So there s no reason to pay attention to racial disparities because one doesn t believe they re still significant  or there s no need for public policy action by the government because it s just a question of black folks changing their own behaviors  Darity portrayed this as a bipartisan problem and criticized President Obama for  playing  into that behavior  by emphasizing personal responsibility in the  My Brother s Keeper  initiative to help young men of color  The conservative notion of a  culture of poverty is another example of the fallacy  he said   I think a lot of people are really attracted to stories about personal uplift or social mobility  but these are very exceptional cases  he said   That s not the norm  Most people who are born into deprived circumstances do not really have the capacity or support to come out of those deprived circumstances  Instead  he argued that the only way to break self perpetuating inequality was through wealth transfers   People s behaviors are largely shaped by the resources they possess  and if their resources alterned  than they might change their behaviors  he said  Poll  What do you think is the primary factor perpetuating the racial wealth gap

sweatshirt playing at her feet  She scooped him up and swiped at his runny nose with her shirt sleeve   I don t know what s wrong with him  she said  sinking back into her living room sofa  watching the two year old bounce like a pinball across the living room floor to the kitchen  down a hallway and back  This isn t what her life is supposed to look like  She d imagined herself a college co ed  partying somewhere with a drink in her hand  giggling with girlfriends  or pulling an all nighter for an exam she didn t study for  Instead she s an underemployed 19 year old mother and wife  struggling to keep her young marriage together and raise a kid in a small rural town where opportunities are few and disappointments are many   Trouble  she lamented quietly   You re always in trouble here  There s nothing positive  Stormy Davidson with her son Aiden in Rattan  Okla   She  and her husband Glen were teenagers when she got pregnant  they have had a characteristically up and down relationship  Ultimately Glen decided to take responsibility for their child and now counsels other young teenage fathers  an underserved demographic in the Choctaw Nation communities  Photo by Peter van Agtmael Magnum for MSNBC Life as a teen mom could be difficult under any circumstances  But it s even more so here in the Choctaw Nation  a vast  rural expanse in southeastern Oklahoma where poverty and unemployment are rampant and the teen pregnancy rate is nearly double the national average  While the teen birth rate has fallen drastically among all racial groups over the last two decades  the pregnancy rate for American Indian teens between 15 and 19 years old is 36 2 per 1 000  15 points higher than their white counterparts and about 5 points higher than the national average  according to the Center for Disease Control  American Indian teens also lead all other groups in the rate of repeat births  With so many young parents in the Choctaw Nation  an area larger than the state of Massachusetts  tribal leaders have made outreach to teen parents a priority  Those efforts were given a boost recently when the Obama administration designated the Choctaw Nation one of its first five Promise Zones  a program aimed at strengthening the relationship between impoverished communities and the federal government  The tribe hopes to use the designation to access grants they ll use to bolster some of the work they ve already been doing  particularly around youth and families   What we re doing isn t just about changing today s parents  said Angela Dancer  senior director of the Better Beginnings Program  which serves at risk and high needs families   It s about changing the parents of the future  Dancer s program helps ease the burdens many of these families face  including food insecurity and access to adequate medical care  The outreach workers  all of whom are Choctaw  do at home visits and try to walk young mothers through the uncertainty of new parenthood  They give away free diapers and car seats  And they help overwhelmed teen parents deal with stress management  create a healthy environment and teach them skills to build stronger attachments to their babies  all of which are challenges in the small impoverished communities that dot the Nation   They ve had people come in and out of their lives and tell them all of the negative things about their weaknesses  But we help them understand their strengths  Dancer said   If we didn t go out and touch them where they are  there s no way we could touch as many as we do  But the challenges of reaching this demographic  many of whom are high school dropouts without much financial or emotional support from their families  can often seem unsurmountable  They re geographically spread across very isolated communities within the nearly 11 counties that comprise the Nation s service area  And emotionally  many are saddled with feelings of shame  guilt and the generational curse of teen pregnancy  Others are victims of domestic abuse   So many of them just close themselves off because they re already worried about being judged   judged for getting pregnant in the first place  said Hanna Wood  29  an outreach worker who has worked with Sisco and her family  The Nation also offers sex education courses to schools within the Nation s boundary  an effort that remains somewhat controversial in an area of the state dominated by conservative politics and where abstinence only education is the preferred model  Outreach workers have found navigating the politics of teaching teens and pre teens about safe sex and personal boundaries a delicate endeavor  Nearly all Choctaw Indian students attend public schools where the majority of students are non Native  And despite high rates of teen pregnancy and a rate of sexually transmitted disease that is four times the national average  many public school districts within the Nation won t allow the sex ed courses taught in their schools  For More on the Choctaw Nation see our photo essay  Hope on the Horizon for Choctaw Nation Some schools will allow parts of the curriculum to be taught in their classrooms but won t allow others  like condom demonstrations  On a recent evening nearly two dozen eighth graders whose school forbade such a demonstration gathered at Choctaw Nation outreach services headquarters  giggling and guffawing as an instructor urged them to slide a latex condom down their fore and middle fingers   We re dealing with some pushback  said Dancer   But the statistics don t lie  National politics have also become intertwined with the Nation s efforts  as much of the funding for Better Beginnings is tied to the hotly contested Affordable Care Act  aka Obamacare  Last year  sequestration cuts and a shrinking number of grants  stripped funding from many of the tribe s critical  government funded programs  Better Beginnings was no different   I don t care about the politics of it  I m not a political person  Dancer said   But that s what my funds are tied to  If that means it gets reinstated over and over  that s just fine by me    While programs to help at risk youth in the Nation have grown from just a few 20 years ago to dozens today  there still are major gaps  The nearest substance abuse treatment facility for juveniles is nearly 300 miles away  and there s no in patient mental health facility or homeless shelter  And there s still a stigma around many of the issues these young people face  a hurdle outreach workers must handle with care   It s the cycle  Their mothers went through the same thing  said Shonda Shomo  an outreach worker with the Better Beginning program   I was a teen mom  I was 18  so I know what they re going through  I just keep encouraging them  And that s something they don t always hear from their mother figures Autumn Sisco  19  and her son Bobby at home in Quinton  Okla    Photo by Peter van Agtmael Magnum for MSNBC On a recent afternoon  Hannah Wood  another outreach worker  visited Sisco at her apartment  which she shares with her 17 year old husband Mike and their son  Bobby  Wood joined Bobby on the floor with a worksheet of benchmarks that a child Bobby s age should be hitting and a stacking game with various sized bowls  A big part of Better Beginnings and its sister program  Support for Pregnant and Parenting Teens  is identifying developmental delays in children  a problem that is often overlooked in poor communities where access to quality healthcare is limited  Sisco sat back on the sofa  swallowed up by an oversized hooded sweatshirt  watching Bobby shakily slide the smaller bowls into the bigger bowls  Over the years  Sisco said she d grown accustomed to having Wood around  especially during tough times  of which she said there ve been many   She helped me learn how to take care of my child and helped me with my anger  Sisco said of Wood  who until getting married recently had been a single mother of a little boy not much older than Bobby   She taught me ways to keep it from harming Bobby  to take him away before I get to a bad place  But after months of progress  things have slowly unfurled  Mike Sisco  17  at high school wrestling practice in Quinton  Okla  Mike and his wife Autumn had a child when she was 17 and he was 15    Photo by Peter van Agtmael Magnum for MSNBC Sisco said Bobby almost died a few weeks ago after getting into a bottle of his grandmother s muscle relaxers  They were able to get him to the hospital on time to have his stomach pumped  And after about seven hours at the hospital  Bobby finally woke up  Sisco said she has also seen her own life flash before her eyes  A year or two ago  Sisco said  she was hanging out with friends when she was passed a blunt  an emptied cigar filled with marijuana  But after toking from it  she said she began to feel sick and eventually passed out  She thinks the blunt was laced with something   I OD d  she said   I saw a big white light and heard a voice saying that I didn t make it to judgment and that I was going to hell  She didn t die  but she landed back in Quinton   a small town which she described as hellish in its own right  Autumn and Mike got married about six months ago on the Quinton High School football field before a game  The couple soon moved in together with their little boy in tow Mike  a senior in high school  has been consumed with football and wrestling practice after school for the better part of a year  His extra curriculars have left Autumn  a Certified Nursing Assistant  to bear the brunt of the family s financial responsibilities  Fights over  dumb stuff  have increased and the pangs of new marriage and keeping watch over a rambunctious little boy have become overwhelming  Things got so bad last year that Autum handed over custody of Bobby to her mother for several months so that she could attend school   I didn t visit much  she admitted   I m still struggling with the idea of being a parent  Autumn grew up not too far from the little corner apartment in Quinton where she lives now  When she was a younger teen  she and her friends would spend their days skipping school and breaking into abandoned houses to drink and smoked weed  Her acting out began even earlier  sometime around 6 or 7 when her parents divorced  Autumn started running away from home  By 13 she was smoking  By 15 she said depression set in and she started sleeping around  She got pregnant when she was a 16 year old junior in high school  Mike  Bobby s father  was 15 and a grade level below her  When word of her pregnancy began to spread  her classmates taunted her and jeered   They called me a whore  Sisco said  When she turned to school counselors  they said I wasn t going to be anything in life  She said that she was literally on her way to get an abortion when her mother convinced her to hold off at least a few weeks until her first pre natal screening with a doctor   I was scared to death  Sisco said   The whole time up to that point I was drinking and smoking  At the appointment  she heard Bobby s heartbeat for the very first time  And it changed everything  She was set on having her baby  She returned to school  her belly now bulging  to face down the insults and bullying  Eventually  Sisco said that school administrators tried to get her removed from school and placed in some sort of alternative academic program  She d become a distraction and a bad influence on other students  they said  At the same time  her relationship with Mike was falling apart   He ran away from it  Sisco said  He spent more time with his friends than with her and her growing belly   I cried a lot  she said   I kept thinking he wasn t ready and maybe he was going to leave me    Mike s father  who is Cherokee and Choctaw and became a parent himself at 15  sat Mike down at age 10 and made him promise that he wouldn t make his father s mistakes   One thing he always told me was not to follow in his footsteps  Mike said after school and wrestling practice on a recent afternoon  Just five years later  there Mike was  a self described high school  troublemaker  and knucklehead with a pregnant girlfriend   I m dead  Mike recalled thinking at the time  He was afraid of having to grow up quickly  of raising a kid while he was still very much a kid  albeit a big one at well over 6 feet tall and weighing more than 200 pounds  He wanted to hide  to get away from it all  to shirk whatever responsibility being a father would mean  What changed

still pinballing across the family s knotty brown carpet   And an old principal had a talk with me  He told me if I didn t change my ways  I d be in jail  He asked if I wanted some other guy being called daddy by my son   I just had to grow up instantly  he said  his grey sweatshirt still drenched in sweat from practice  Autumn s gaze slid slowly between the little boy on the floor and the big boy leaning with his back against the living room wall  as the big boy talked about wanting to go off to college and then become a football coach someday   I can see me having a coaching job  Make it to where Autumn can stay home and clean if she wants or go get a job  Mike said  smiling wryly over at his young wife   I ll probably never stop working  Autumn replied  without blinking   I m used to being the one that puts food on the table and paying the bills  Whatever happens  Autumn said she can t help but fear things won t work out  So often throughout her life  good things have been fleeting while the bad tends to linger   I m nervous about the future  she said   And my son s future here  Autumn counted nearly a half dozen drug dealers who sell out of nearby apartment buildings  a far greater number than the good employers in the area  Stormy Davidson with her son Aiden playing in Rattan  Okla   She  and her husband Glen Davidson were teenagers when she got pregnant  they

 If he is anything like I was he d be dumb enough to do it  Autumn doubts she ll ever go to college   It s never going to happen  she said   No money or time  Young people from towns across the Choctaw Nation see few of their friends go off to college  Instead  many hang around town or go to  T U   Tyson s University  which is a euphemism for the Tyson s chicken processing plant in McCurtain County   Everybody talks about leaving this place  but hardly anyone does  said Mike   Most of them are stuck here depending on people  But I just want to ride out of this town to a future  But Mike recently put his future prospects in jeopardy  He said he d been offered a scholarship to play football at a local college  but after he was ejected for fighting during a football game this past season  his second ejection of the season  the coaches threatened to pull his scholarship   They said they don t want any violence at their school  Mike said  fearing that if he doesn t get the scholarship he ll be stuck in Quinton  For more than two hours Hannah Wood  the outreach worker  sat back and listed to Mike and Autumn recount their lives leading up to that afternoon on the couch  After more than two years of weekly visits and growing closer to the family  so much of the pain the two had shared was news to her  Driving away from Quinton  Wood seemed deflated or at the very least least at a loss   It s not the good that weighs on you  she said   It s the bad  Editor s note this is the second of two stories on the Choctaw Nation  exploring the tribe s outreach efforts to

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/st-louis-cuts-222000-warrants, St  Louis Municipal Court on Monday cancelled 222 000 arrest warrants for traffic offenses after the killing of unarmed teen Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson exposed systemic disparities in local law enforcement  The warrants were automatically eliminated and offenders will now have three months to get a new court date to face those previous charges  according to the city  The warrant amnesty includes all moving and non moving traffic violations that do not include alcohol related charges  DWI DUI or leaving the scene of an accident  The killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson  Missouri uncovered a regional criminal justice system rife with inequality and vast racial disparities The city  a suburb of St  Louis  has generated millions by ensnaring mostly poor and black residents in a sticky system that kept them burdened by exorbitant fines and fees associated with arrests associated with non violent offenses mostly  including traffic infractions and simple marijuana possession  Ferguson s City Council recently moved to pass a slew of new ordinances aimed at dismantling that system by eliminating fees and establishing a warrant recall program   But warrant amnesty is nothing new in St  Louis  As recently as earlier this year  the municipal court established a week in which people with warrants for non violent ordinance violations to receive a new court date rather than be arrested  The cost was  35  But the sheer number of warrants cancelled in this single sweep is remarkable   We issue traffic tickets for public safety  not as a revenue generator  Mayor Francis Slay said in a statement   We will hold people accountable for traffic offenses  But  a missed court date for a minor traffic violation should not stand in the way of a job  access to housing  or anything else  It s a balancing act  We want people to take care of their obligations under the law  but we understand that it can be burdensome and worrisome  We want to make it easier for people to get their affairs in order  The city will send out postcards to people with outstanding warrants with instructions on how to establish a new court date  People will have until Dec  31 to get a new court date  If not  warrants will be reissued  Back in Ferguson  residents have consistently complained about years of unfair arrests and crippling court fees that have kept many in debt and prevented them from getting good jobs and housing  Last month during the city s first City Council meeting since Brown s shooting  the council rolled out sweeping new changes it hoped to make to it s court system  As part of the city s planned changes to the way it collects fees and fines is a proposal that would cap budgeted court fine revenue to 15  of the city s revenue and that any excess revenue is earmarked for community projects  The funds are currently fed into Ferguson s general purpose fund and were the second highest revenue stream for the city last year  The changes in the way fees are collected were considered the first real tangible steps taken since Brown was shot and killed by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson under questionable circumstances on Aug  9  The shooting sparked outrage and greater scrutiny into what many described as a system of cops and courts that targeted minorities and profited off the poor  Black motorists have been stopped twice as much as white motorists despite whites being more likely to be caught with contraband  according to a 2013 report by the state attorney general s office Last year the city collected more than  2 million in such costs  ,10/01/14 04:54 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/crist-scott-turn-party-stars-nasty-race-hits-home-stretch, ORLANDO  Fla    With just one day until voters in Florida cast their ballots in what could be the most expensive and tightest gubernatorial race in the country  Republican Gov  Rick Scott and Republican turned Independent turned Democratic former Gov  Charlie Crist are relying on major political star power in the hopes of increasing their chances of winning the Sunshine State s highest office   We need your youth  we need your energy  President Bill Clinton Crist  after making stops in the Democratic heavy counties of Miami Dade  Palm Beach and Broward  rounded out Monday at a rally at the University of Central Florida alongside former President Bill Clinton  Scott  meanwhile  campaigned with Louisiana Gov  Bobby Jindal and Texas Gov  Rick Perry  making stops in Clearwater  Lakeland  The Villages  Plant City and Orlando Over the weekend  Scott appeared with popular former Gov  Jeb Bush while Crist campaigned with Vice President Joe Biden  Biden  Bush  Perry and Jindal are all considered potential 2016 GOP presidential candidates  and battleground Florida  of course  will be critical to the fortunes of any serious presidential candidate for the foreseeable future    view photo essay     Voters  young and old  take to polls       Across the country  young and old will join together to elect leaders in a process enshrined by our Founding Fathers     At the rally  Crist and Clinton stood in front of a giant American flag in the school s auditorium  and behind a podium with a sign that said  Charlie Crist  The people s governor  Clinton began by thanking Crist for  running and going up against this amazing money machine that s against them  referring to Scott s nearly 2 to 1 fundraising advantage  He added   You cannot leave anybody home  At this campus there are still people who could vote in this election who want to build their futures in Florida   We need your youth  we need your energy  Clinton was just in Florida last month   attending an event for Crist in Tampa and another one for congressional candidate Gwen Graham in Tallahassee   We see the GOP going further and further to the right  I don t blame Crist for switching parties  I don t see him as a flip flopper  I see him as someone whose views have evolved  Michael Krysinski Democratic Sen  Bill Nelson also made a surprise appearance at the rally  criticizing Scott on a slew of initiatives including cuts to education and climate change  Nelson quoted Scott infamously saying earlier this year that he didn t know if climate change is man made  arguing  I m not a scientist  Nelson hit back to applause   Your senator is not a scientist but I can sure learn and study  Nelson  added   You have seen what has happened in the last four years and it has not been good  Before Clinton  Crist spoke for about two minutes  joking  I won t give a long speech because I know who you came to hear  He encouraged students to vote if they want equal pay  a raise in the minimum wage and a woman s right to choose   Go get five more  votes   tomorrow   because if we vote  we win  Polls have continually shown Crist and Scott in a dead heat  A Quinnipiac University survey released Monday echoed that pattern with Crist garnering 42  compared to Scott s 41  well within the poll s margin of error  Libertarian candidate Adrian Wyllie raked in a decent 7  and is taking away votes from both candidates  With the race neck and neck  the key to victory will be which candidate can turn out the most votes on Election Day   which may well be driven by which of these unpopular politicians is disliked the least  Both Crist and Scott have suffered from low favorability ratings   below 50    throughout the election cycle  Scott has tried to paint Crist as a political opportunist  and a flip flopper   pointing to his time as a Republican governor  then as an independent during his failed Senate bid in 2010  and finally his decision to run as a Democrat to try to win back the governorship  PHOTO ESSAY Election Day 2014 is here  America votes on the future of the Senate But the incumbent has baggage of his own that Crist   who was elected governor in 2006   is trying to capitalize on  The Democrat has repeatedly attacked Scott s time as head of hospital chain Columbia HCA  which was hit with a  1 7 billion fine for Medicare fraud  Scott also come under fire   largely from the left   for a host of conservative initiatives  such as pushing for drug testing of welfare recipients and pushing an austere budget that included big cuts to education spending in addition to slashing about 12 000 public sector jobs  The race has taken several nasty turns  with the two candidates trading jabs over their personal wealth  Crist has highlighted Scott s repeated use of the 5th Amendment when his hospital chain was found guilty of fraud  and Scott has called Crist a lackey of President Obama  Television ad spending has surpassed the  100 million mark  including a recent  13 million directly from Gov  Scott s own personal fortune  At times  the campaign has become downright silly   with a recent debate being infamously held up over whether or not a fan at Crist s podium was against the rules  Several national issues have sparked fierce debate between the two candidates  That includes the minimum wage  Crist wants to increase it to  10 10  Scott doesn t  medical marijuana  Scott is against a state amendment that would allow it  while Crist supports the legislation  and abortion  Scott is against abortion and has backed additional restrictions to reproductive rights  while Crist says he s against any additional restrictions  Crist has been trying to make inroads with minority  gay and young voters   many of whom tend to vote Democratic  That was apparent during his election eve rally at the UCF campus on Monday  where students lined up hours to gain entry  Whether or not Crist s last minute push will work remains to be seen  Several students expressed disillusionment with the political infighting between Crist and Scott at the rally and said they were more interested in seeing the former president than the man running for governor   I m more here to see Bill Clinton  said 21 year old senior Jon Walker  who said he was voting for Wylie  Of the party switching Crist  he said   I don t trust that he s going to have solid Democratic views  Gabriela Wolk  a 20 year old junior who identified herself as an independent  said   Both Scott and Crist are not overly appealing candidates   It s picking the lesser of two evils  Others  like 25 year old senior Michael Krysinski  dismissed Crist s party switching as no big deal   We see the GOP going further and further to the right  I don t blame Crist for switching parties  I don t see him as a flip flopper  I see him as someone whose views have evolved  said Krysinski  who already cast a ballot for Crist in early voting  In terms of minority outreach  over the weekend  Biden appeared at an event at Florida International University that focused on Hispanic voters  and went as far as to suggest the demographic could decide the race  Scott is also trying to woo Hispanic voters  In Hialeah  Scott appeared with Bush and Hispanic politicians speaking in both English and Spanish   to make his case  Early voting in Florida ended on Sunday  and about three million votes have already been cast  That includes 1 3 million ballots cast by Republicans and 1 2 million by Democrats  Kevin Wagner  a political science professor at Florida Atlantic University  said because this gubernatorial race has been so ugly and divisive  whoever wins may actually feel like a loser   It s going to be hard for whoever wins to govern in terms of pushing bills  navigating the legislature and working with local counties and municipal governments  Poll  Predict the midterms 4  ,11/03/14 11:12

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/official-autopsy-michael-brown-shows-close-range-wound, The official autopsy on Michael Brown  obtained by the St  Louis Post Dispatch shows the Ferguson  Missouri  teenager was shot in the hand at close range The accompanying toxicology report reveals the 18 year old had a trace of marijuana in his system  according to the local newspaper  RELATED  Plans for Ferguson s future revealed The reports provide the most detailed description of Brown s injuries from the confrontation on Aug  9 with Officer Darren Wilson  who fatally shot the African American teen The results  together with a separate autopsy conducted in August  attempt to piece together a narrative of the circumstances leading to Brown s death  a storyline that shifts at crucial junctures depending on which side interprets the findings  The autopsy leaked on Wednesday largely aligns with a separate report conducted at the behest of Brown s family after the killing but for the distance at which they say Brown was shot  The family s autopsy released on Aug  18 by nationally renowned forensic pathologist Dr  Michael Baden  indicated that it appeared Brown s wounds were suffered from some distance  from one foot to 30 feet away  The first autopsy indicates that Brown was shot at least six times  The county autopsy released today includes nine wounds  six entry wounds and three exit wounds  The latest autopsy also accompanied by a narrative of events that preceded the shooting  That narrative aligns with Officer Wilson s version of the story  and is gleaned from an investigator with the St  Louis County Police Department  In this version of events  the autopsy says that Wilson confronted Michael Brown and a companion in the middle of the street  It states that when Wilson ordered the two out of the roadway  Brown became belligerent  At that point Wilson attempted to get out of the vehicle and it says Brown pushed the door shut and began to struggle with Wilson  According to the autopsy report  Wilson then upholstered his weapon and  the weapon was discharged during the struggle  The narrative continues that Brown fled at that point  that Wilson gave chase and that at some point Brown turned around and charged at Wilson  The officer then fired off several shots  according to the report  The narrative concludes with a critical point   As this is preliminary information it was not know in which order or how many time the officer fired his weapon during the confrontation  Close video       PoliticsNation with Al Sharpton  10 21 14  6 57 PM ET

share group discuss  It s not surprising at all  to the family  that this St  Louis medical examiner who works with the police every day would say any of this  said Ben Crump  an attorney for Brown s family   Witness  Dorian Johnson told the family and everyone from day one that there was a brief struggle at the car  that the police officer tried to grab Michael and pull him into the car and that Michael tried to pull away  He says that there were two shots fired  He didn t know whether or not Michael was hit or not but they both ran   The question that the autopsy does not address and everyone has been asking from day one  is why did the police officer keep shooting as the threat was eliminated  as they were running away  Crump said  What the results do not definitely determine one way or another is whether or not Brown had his hands up at the time he was fatally wounded The narrative of the circumstances that lead to the shooting  detailed in the autopsy  is based on Wilson s recollection of the events  In it he says that he fired a first shot as Brown was reaching for his gun  which struck Brown s hand  Forensic examiners interviewed by the St  Louis Post Dispatch say the wound likely means that Brown was not shot with his hands up in surrender as nearly half a dozen witnesses have said  But if the first shot fired from inside Officer Wilson s vehicle struck Brown s hand before Brown fled and before the remaining shots were fired  it would be irrelevant to Brown s hand positioning as he was the final shots struck his head and upper body  Close video       The

wound to the thumb is also consistent with the family s autopsy released weeks after the killing  The relevance of that wound also offers a couple of possible scenarios  Wilson said he fired off that first shot  which struck Brown s hand  as Brown reached for his gun  It would also seem plausible that the wound came during the struggle at Wilson s car window  as a defensive wound  as Brown may have attempted to shield himself from the weapon or as Wilson asserts  as Brown reached for his weapon  Crump said the details regarding the wound Brown suffered to his thumb  which the medical examiner s report says was suffered at close range  does not say much about what happened after that first shot  which is critical to the family s case   It doesn t say anything about what happened after they ran away  And so  it is very clear that nobody has the answer as to why the police officer continued to shoot once they ran away  Crump said It s the police version  which the family believes is very self serving  and the version of seven independent witnesses who all say that his hands were up  The Post Dispatch has not disclosed how reporters acquired the autopsy  which was reviewed by experts not involved directly in the case  The St  Louis County Medical Examiner s office said by law  autopsy results may not be released to the public until the investigation and trial into the killing are complete  RELATED  How the crisis in Ferguson unfolded  in photographs Wilson  who is white  fatally shot Brown on Aug  9  The grand jury  which has been hearing evidence since Aug  20  is considering charges against Wilson  Last week The New York Times reported that Wilson told investigators he was pinned to his vehicle and was in fear for his life as he struggled over his gun with Brown  The officer hasn t spoken publicly since Brown s death  On Wednesday  the Post Dispatch reported that the officer told investigators that Brown pressed the barrel of Wilson s gun against the policeman s hip  Wilson attempted to prevent Brown from reaching the trigger  and when he thought he had control  he fired  But Brown s hand had been blocking the object  Earlier this week  police arrested Missouri state Sen Jamilah Nasheed during a protest in the suburb  where unrest continues as residents await the detainment of Wilson  She had joined her fellow residents in a gathering outside of the Ferguson Police Department  where officers requested the demonstrators refrain from entering the street  or risk arrest  Protesters want Wilson arrested immediately  Poll

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/melissa-harris-perry/the-war-drugs-finally-going-pot, Washington state on Thursday became the first in the nation to allow adults the legal recreational use of marijuana  Colorado will soon join the Evergreen state in enacting marijuana legalization laws after voters in both states approved ballot initiatives that defy federal laws deeming pot illegal Saturday in  nerdland  host Melissa Harris Perry took a look at Washington s historic step  as well as the possibility of how regulated marijuana could provide a boost to the recovering American economy  Doug Fine  author of  Too High To Fail  Cannabis and the New Green Economic Revolution  spoke to the potential financial boon to cannabis farmers in a multi billion dollar industry on the wholesale level   We re talking about America s biggest crop  Fine said Saturday   And so we re looking at a  40 billion industry when the sheer nonsense of the drug war ends  which hopefully will be pretty soon  The possibility of the proverbial War on Drugs ending may not come anytime soon since  as the New York Times reported on Friday  the Department of Justice is considering what action it will take against Washington and Colorado  But as Matt Welch  editor in chief of Reason  pointed out  politicians may have to carry out the will of the people as current drug policy may not be sustainable   We still have more than 700 000 people a year coming face to face with the justice system in America over marijuana  That is an outrage  it should be an outrage on everybody s conscience  These are people who will have a criminal record for the rest of their lives  They won t be able to get a job  It disproportionately affects poor minorities  always has  always will even though they don t smoke it any more than white dudes with beards  It s a shock on our conscience and what we should be focusing on right now at this historic pivot point is pressuring politicians  Democrats and Republicans  in particularly the President of the United States who has a choice  how are you going to change your policy  your enforcement policies in the wake of two states basically seceding from your policy and also a majority  a growing majority of Americans who want full legalization  Democratic Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez of California  a state which passed Proposition 215 in 1996 that legalized medical marijuana  spoke about the problems caused by the federal government intervening after states make individual decisions about marijuana   The unfortunate thing of the experience in California is that the federal government has come right in the middle of it  It s gone to landlords and said  listen if you don t get these medicinal marijuana places out we re going to take over your asset because this is a Class 1 drug and you know that s it  And I have said to the federal government  to President Obama you know get out of this  Let us take a look at how this works  Let us see if we can do this the right way and maybe we expand it  The bottom line once we get past the politics  are the people whose lives are ruined because of unnecessary incarceration for minor drug offenses  The documentary  The House I Live In  examined the failure of America s drug war and the film s director  Eugene Jarecki  underscored the point today on MHP that this isn t so much about the drugs themselves   This epidemic is an epidemic of man s inhumanity to man here in America  So we can talk about small marijuana victories which are valuable because they show that the public taste  the public sort of opinion on this has shifted  The public does not want to see us waste billions anymore  criminalizing non violent people as though they were violent  That s the key  Washington and Colorado may not only serve as groundbreaking states allowing adults to use marijuana for recreational purposes  They may also signal the beginning of fair drug policy  and an end to the long and problematic war on drugs  See the second half of the pot politics discussion below  ,12/08/12 05:44 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/stick-fork-the-irs-controversy-it, The good news for conservatives is that new information about the IRS controversy came to light late yesterday  which renewed coverage of the story Republicans are heavily invested in  The bad news for conservatives it that the revelations were the opposite of what they wanted to hear Following up on Rachel s segment from last night  the last remaining pillar of the Republican talking points   groups on the right were singled out for unfair scrutiny   has collapsed The instructions that Internal Revenue Service officials used to look for applicants seeking tax exempt status with  Tea Party  and  Patriots  in their titles also included groups whose names included the words  Progressive  and  Occupy  according to I R S  documents released Monday The documents appeared to back up contentions by I R S  officials and some Democrats that the agency did not intend to single out conservative groups for special scrutiny  Instead  the documents say  officials were trying to use  key word  shortcuts to find overtly political organizations   both liberal and conservative   that were after tax favors by saying they were social welfare organizations But the practice appeared to go much farther than that  One such  be on the lookout  list included medical marijuana groups  organizations that were promoting President Obama s health care law  and applications that dealt  with disputed territories in the Middle East The fact that the practice apparently went  much farther  than previously thought certainly doesn t cast the IRS in a more positive light   but as far as the ongoing political controversy is concerned  this new information is the final nail in the coffin  Americans have been told repeatedly that conservative groups had been singled out for unfair scrutiny and we now know that isn t true There was no effort to penalize White House critics  there was no partisan or ideological vendetta  there was no conspiracy involving President Obama or his campaign team There s just nothing left  Since this  scandal  erupted in early May  the right has raised a series of allegations  and as of this morning  each of them have been discredited  It s remarkably similar to the efforts to turn the Benghazi attacks into a political controversy   serious allegations  followed by plenty of sound and fury  resulting in a  scandal  that ends with a whimper There is  however  one thing I d like to know  why didn t we learn about this new information sooner We learned about the extent of the problem related to Tea Party groups seeking tax exempt status through an inspector general s report released several weeks ago  But why did that document overlook these relevant details about liberal groups being subjected to the identical treatment House Democrats are eager to find out The inspector general report that fueled the IRS tea party targeting scandal is  fundamentally flawed  because it failed to include details that progressive groups were also flagged for extra attention  a senior House Democrat said late Monday Michigan Rep  Sander Levin  the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee  is demanding answers from Treasury Inspector General J  Russell George about whether it investigated the use of search terms aimed at liberal organizations in the same manner as it probed the agency s oversight of groups that used terms such as  tea party  or  patriot  in their application for a tax exemption The American public expects competent  impartial  unbiased  and non political treatment from the IRS  Levin wrote   That same standard is also applicable to you and your organization  Your audit served as the basis and impetus for a wide range of congressional investigations and this new information shows that the foundation of those investigations is flawed in a fundamental way So what s the explanation  I ll be eager to hear the response from the IG s office  but it s worth noting that J  Russell George has told lawmakers that his office launches probes at the request of members of Congress  In this case  House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa  R Calif  asked for a review of IRS actions related to conservative groups  so that s what the inspector general did In other words  we received a limited and incomplete analysis from the IG s office because Issa asked for a limited and incomplete analysis  The whole story wouldn t have created a  scandal  so it was preferable to keep the truth hidden for a long while As for the political fallout  if the traditional trajectory of stories like these is any indication  Americans will hear quite a bit about the allegations  but the resolution will get far less play   Obama Scandal  is a front page story for weeks   Obama didn t do anything wrong and there is no scandal  is generally buried on page A7 as the political world s search for a new controversy begins But if accountability still means anything  every lawmaker and pundit who made Nixon comparisons  and accused the president of using the IRS as a political weapon  has a responsibility to be equally as aggressive in telling the public that those allegations were wrong  ,06/25/13 08:53 AM,marijuana
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/majority-americans-want-experiment, A majority of Americans support legalizing marijuana  a first in more than 40 years of Gallup polling the question  In 1969  when President Richard Nixon first directed significant federal resources toward interdicting marijuana smugglers at the U S Mexico border  only 12  of Americans supported legalization  According to Gallup  58  of Americans now support legalization  up more than 10  in just the last four years  Two states  Washington and Colorado  legalized recreational marijuana use following statewide referendums in 2012  Perhaps sensing the size of the shift in public opinion  the Obama administration announced in August it would allow such states to continue their experiment with legalization marijuana is still illegal under federal law as long as they follow certain guidelines  The reversal in public opinion is so rapid  it s comparable to perhaps one other issue  same sex marriage  Here s Gallup s chart showing polling on same sex marriage throughout the years  Courtesy of Gallup And here s their chart on marijuana legalization  Courtesy of Gallup What accounts for the shift  Though sexual orientation and recreational marijuana use aren t comparable  it s possible that Americans  increased willingness to be public about recreational marijuana use has eroded the once widely held stigma associated with smoking weed  It s also possible that Americans are more aware of the uneven racial impact of the war on drugs  which disproportionately targets minorities despite the fact that levels of drug use are similar across ethnicities  ,10/22/13 03:30 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/melissa-harris-perry/obamas-new-clarence-aaron-burden, As we ve detailed previously  Dafna Linzer s May 13 report in ProPublica and The Washington Post has led to pressure being placed directly upon the White House   thanks to a letter from Michigan Democrat John Conyers and another member of the House Judiciary Committee   to investigate that report s claims  that triple life prisoner Clarence Aaron s commutation plea was allegedly mishandled in 2008 by Ronald Rodgers  the current head of the U S  Pardon Attorney s office On Sunday s  MHP  the volume was turned up considerably by someone who knows the Aaron case intimately  Sam Morison was working within the U S  Pardon Attorney s office in 2008  handling Aaron s case while there in 2008  He closed his  nerdland appearance  below  on Sunday with an emphatic statement directed at the President President Obama could solve this problem this afternoon if he asked  my opinion  I would tell him   since you ve been elected to office  Mr   President  you ve had to make a lot of tough decisions  This isn t one  of them  There is no reasonable person who really believes Clarence  Aaron deserves to die in prison Morison had  in 2008  recommended that Aaron s triple life sentence be commuted  The harsh sentence was handed down as a mandatory minimum for what amounted to a first time  and minor drug crime  as Melissa herself described the issue as such prior to Sunday s interview  Conservative San Francisco Chronicle columnist Debra J  Saunders  while taking issue with the word  minor  found herself agreeing with Morison in a Monday blog post He was a small player in two large planned cocaine deals   one happened   one didn t  But his role in those crimes does not warrant a sentence  that would keep a 23 year old with no criminal record in prison until  his natural death Saunders prefaced that assessment with this   This story provides another example of how Barack Obama is worse in the war on drugs than George W  Bush  That seems like quite the rhetorical leap  but Saunders doubled down today in her column As a candidate for president in 2008  Barack  Obama pledged to  immediately  review federal mandatory minimum  sentences  to see where we can be smarter on crime and reduce the  ineffective warehousing of nonviolent drug offenders  Obama also had  written memoirs  in which he admitted to using marijuana and cocaine     maybe a little blow when you could afford it    as a teen  And he s the  first black president Linda Aaron  a black  Alabama grandmother  voted for Obama  For years  Aaron had been hoping  that President George W  Bush would commute the obscenely long prison  sentence of her son  Clarence  Because of Draconian federal mandatory  minimum sentencing  a federal judge sentenced Aaron when he was 24 to  three sentences of life without parole for a first time nonviolent drug  offense Obama was supposed to bring sanity to a  federal sentencing structure that over punishes nonviolent drug  offenders  But I guess he s just too busy to get to Clarence Aaron Her language there at the end seems a bit snarky  the shots at the President s past drug use are Fox News y  and the bit about Aaron s mother  a black Alabama grandmother  voted for Obama  is somewhat patronizing  But Saunders does make an important point  President Obama should be held responsible for following up on that campaign promise to review mandatory minimum sentences  three of which Aaron received all at once It s a good thing  then  that such a review is already underway   Oddly  it went unmentioned in Saunders  column In the autumn of 2010  the President signed the defense spending bill for the next year   and authorized  on its last page  the U S  Sentencing Commission to undergo a year long review of federal mandatory minimum sentencing laws  The group which organized last week s Aaron press event at the National Press Club  Families Against Mandatory Minimums  has a detailed timeline noting the results of that review   which was critical of mandatory minimum sentences   and what s happened since Saunders  argument also fails when it comes to the issue of President George W  Bush  considering that Linzer s report also details how another inmate serving life for a drug offense  Reed Prior  was granted clemency on the same day that Aaron s request was denied  Prior  a big time meth dealer and recidivist from Iowa  was set free despite a recommendation from local prosecutors and the Pardon Attorney s office that he be kept right where he was So why did President Bush set him free  Prior s attorney played the game the right way and networked  raising questions about how seriously the Bush White House took the clemency process Prior  had the support of influential family friends  senior judges and  the wife of Iowa s then governor  In addition to petitioning through the  pardon office  Prior s lawyer met with Fred Fielding  the White House  counsel  A week later  Prior was ordered freed after 14 years of incarceration Going through the pardons office didn t work  said Robert Holliday  the Des Moines lawyer who handled Prior s case for free Going directly to the White House did Clarence Aaron didn t have that luxury at the time  Thanks to Linzer s journalism and Congressman Conyers  co authored letter  his case is finally being brought directly to the White House  While it s certainly fair to put pressure upon the President s shoulders to review the details of this case and urge him to expedite his administration s review of mandatory minimum sentencing  it is fallacious to argue that he has ignored the issue altogether  and that he is significantly worse on the issue than was President Bush

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/rand-pauls-long-game, Rand Paul this week announced a class action lawsuit against President Obama to curb the NSA s ability to gather domestic phone records  insisting such surveillance efforts should be  specific to the person  to the place and to the items  But lurking behind the policy argument is a clear political motive as well  the Kentucky senator  who s considering a bid for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016  has argued for years that his libertarianism is just what the party needs to attract a younger  more diverse base  Paul s lawsuit  which is backed by former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli and tea party group Freedomworks  is the latest phase in Paul s long running campaign against government spying  But lately his political motives have been more visibily attached to the war on surveillance  Paul s asking Americans to show their support for his lawsuit by giving him their e mail addresses and zip codes   information that some commentators noted is more valuable to a candidate building a voter database than to a judge considering a lawsuit  Paul s critique of the NSA isn t unique to the right  many progressive activists are similarly appalled by evidence of widespread government spying  And opposition to such surveillance programs isn t the only area where Paul has some overlap with the left  Some of his more libertarian positions  like scaling back the war on drugs and restricting drone strikes  also cross party lines  One of Paul s top allies in the Senate when it comes to spying concerns is Ron Wyden  an Oregon Democrat who is also intensely critical of the NSA  Paul has argued such crossover issues will attract voters not traditionally associated with the GOP  He s made an effort to reach out to African Americans by criticizing mandatory sentencing laws  And he insists protesting government intrusion will win back the so called Millennial voters   young people born after 1980 who backed Obama by large margins in 2012  Young voters  don t really care as much about taxes  regulation  balanced budgets might not be their big deal either  but they care about their liberty  they care about their privacy  Paul said at a forum hosted by Young Americans For Liberty in July   I think if we do  the youth will come  Paul s efforts may even resonate with more traditional GOP base voters  Republican strategist Ford O Connell told msnbc that Paul s NSA attack would appeal to that group because it dovetails with conservatives  general anxieties about government overreach under Obama   This is about not just getting to the general election and winning young voters  it s also high on the mind of tea party folks and constitutional conservatives  O Connell said  For now  neither party has a monopoly on the battle over civil liberties  Many Republican leaders  who gleefully attacked Democrats for opposing warrantless wiretapping under President Bush  are still uncomfortable with Paul s positions  And Democrats have yet to reach a consensus either  with some more hawkish officials like Senator Dianne Feinstein aggressively defending the NSA s surveillance practices  Some progressives are making a parallel case to Paul s as well  arguing Democrats shouldn t cede political ground to the GOP on the issue of privacy  Shenna Bellows  a Democrat challenging Republican Sen  Susan Collins in Maine  has made the incumbent s support for the NSA and the PATRIOT Act her top campaign issue   Privacy is a winning issue in 2014 because there s a really interesting coalition of progressives and libertarians across Maine and across the country interested in restoring our constitutional freedoms  Bellows told msnbc in a phone interview   I think privacy is incredibly important to young people who understand technology and understand that our laws have not kept pace with technology  Paul s earned plenty of praise from progressives for his positions on surveillance  drone strikes  and drug laws  But his political ambitions can be a source of tension in those circles  Paul is intensely conservative on budget issues  favoring the rapid elimination of huge swaths of the federal government  and he opposes abortion rights  His libertarianism has also led him to some politically explosive places  like criticizing the 1964 Civil Rights Act that ended segregation  and some fringe associations  like a neo Confederate aide who resigned last year  And that s not even counting his father s far more inflammatory history  The closer the younger Paul gets to a plausible presidential campaign  the harder it gets for some progressives to separate his issues from his ambitions  Van Jones  the progressive activist and former Obama adviser who now hosts CNN s Crossfire  carefully qualified his support for Paul s filibuster against drone strikes last year by labeling him  a civil liberties hero and a civil rights villain  in a column  Liberal columnist Adele Stan took fellow left wing activists to task over their support for Paul the same month  warning that they were legitimizing his more extreme positions by extension  Concerns on the left about boosting Paul s presidential stock might make it marginally harder to find activist allies for his policy causes  but they aren t particularly relevant to his electoral ambitions  In fact  one of the biggest obstacles he could face in 2016 is that his rivals actually buy into his argument  Many of Paul s signature issues are gaining ground within the GOP  The Republican National Committee recently adopted a resolution sponsored by a Paul supporter decrying NSA spying  Texas Gov  Rick Perry  who might run again in 2016  recently suggested Texas move towards decriminalizing marijuana and has defended the right of states to legalize the drug  Chris Christie  who has clashed with Paul on national security issues  slammed the war on drugs as  a failure  in a speech last month  Two other likely presidential candidates  Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio  joined Paul for his anti drone filibuster last year  Paul is surely heartened to see libertarian policies gain ground among Republican leaders  But the more they do  the less unique his appeal might be to Republican voters  There s a long history of political insurgents fading away as the major parties co opt

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/all-in/welcome-the-freest-state-in-america-north, Here s something you probably didn t know about North Dakota  the oil rich  population poor state is a beacon of freedom at least  according to the experts at the libertarian Mercatus Center  whose annual freedom index lists North Dakota as the freest state in America   A big part of North Dakota s high ranking on regulatory policy is due to the state s excellent liability system  explains Mercatus   North Dakota also scores well on land use freedoms  with better than average residential land use regulations and significant eminent domain reform  Plus  it s a right to work state with  relaxed  gun control laws  And  spirit taxes are fairly low  What s not to love  Here s what else you might not know about North Dakota  the cost of living is soaring  And the state s governor recently signed a set of laws that could shut down the state s sole abortion clinic and ban abortions in the first trimester if doctors can detect a fetal heartbeat  Sexual assault is on the rise there  in the oil boom town of Williston  women in particular live with the constant threat of violence  None of that makes it into the Mercatus Center s rankings  The tax burden of a state s citizens accounts for 28 6  of their index  with  freedom from tort abuse  accounting for another 11 5  While civil liberties make up 0 6  of the rankings  reproductive rights are not included at all  Nor is there any measurement which accounts for the threat of non state violence  workplace coercion  or most major kinds of inequality  whether along class  gender  or racial lines  Marriage freedom as in the freedom to marry same sex partners accounts for 2 1  of the rankings  but there s no measurement to account for other forms of anti LGBT discrimination  Is freedom really 28 6  low taxes and 0  bodily autonomy  While the Mercatus Center s omission of abortion from its rankings is odd and born out of a half hearted compromise between competing accounts of  individual liberty  as they explain elsewhere on the site its rankings method otherwise adheres faithfully to the spirit of libertarianism  And as such  it illustrates just what libertarian rights theory really is  Take how the index treats LGBT rights  States which allow same sex marriage get a post to their ranking  but that s the only nod towards equality which gay  lesbian and trans people receive  The freedom index is functionally blind to non state coercion  such as gay bashing or workplace discrimination  In the version of freedom tacitly endorsed by the index  government action can make an individual less free  but the actions of homophobic bosses and violent bullies cannot  Last July  political theorists Chris Bertram  Corey Robin and Alex Gourevitch wrote a hotly contested essay on  Libertarianism and the Workplace  in which they argued that libertarians have trouble accounting for workplace coercion as an infringement on personal freedom  They said the writers at the blog Bleeding Heart Libertarians  believe that workplace coercion is not coercion  or at least not impermissible coercion  The same seems to apply to the Mercatus Center  whose rankings recognize a freedom to not pay union dues  right to work states are ranked positively on the freedom index  but not a freedom to collective action in the workplace  If you already subscribe to a libertarian view of rights  then the reasoning behind these rankings is impeccable  Maybe you would assign a different numerical value to  property right protection  or rank  marijuana and salvia freedom  higher than  gun control freedom  but the essential principles on which those numerical values are based hold firm  Freedom from government interference is the only relevant form of freedom  There is no positive liberty which entitles citizens to health care  education  or housing  Keeping the government out of people s business is the main thing  If the internal logic of the Mercatus Center s rankings is not lacking  then those principles certainly are  An alternative  progressive account of liberty needs different principles  and a more robust understanding of what makes people free  Maybe small r republicanism  ,03/29/13 03:52 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/victims-gun-violence-gather-zimmerman-t, Sanford  Fla  Jennifer Sherman  a grandmother of three from Atlanta  drove eight hours to be here  Cephus Johnson  whose nephew was killed by transit police in Oakland  flew all the way from California  And Noche Diaz  an anti police brutality activist from New York City  boarded a bus in Chinatown and spent the next 16 hours en route to Georgia before joining a group of friends for the 10 hour drive to Sanford   I was anxious  I was afraid  but I knew I had to be here for the start of this trial  said Sherman  standing on the grass outside of the Seminole County Criminal Justice Center  where the trial of George Zimmerman for second degree murder began on Monday morning with jury selection  Sherman stood with a dozen or so other people who d gathered in front of the courthouse  holding a large sign with a picture of her 9 year old grandson Semaj that read   Could He Be The Next Trayvon Martin  Trayvon Martin  17  died just about six miles from the court house where scores of potential jurors were convened and questioned today  Zimmerman  who has pleaded not guilty  says he shot Martin in self defense after the teenager attacked him  When police initially declined to arrest Zimmerman  thousands of protestors  descended upon Sanford  There were massive rallies with celebrity activists who compared Sanford to Selma and Montgomery  The case has remained controversial  And yet the crowd outside the courthouse on Monday was small  City officials have been preparing for the trial for about a year  creating so called free speech zones for protestors  making accommodations for the national and international press figured to be in town for the trial  and assigning officers with the county sheriffs and police departments to guard the courthouse and other key locations in town  The planning so far has cost more than  500 000  according to City Manager Norton Bonaparte  But little of that exhaustive preparation seemed necessary Monday  as some of the protesters  many wearing hooded sweatshirts like the one Martin was wearing the night of his death  began trading their protest signs for places in the shade as the late morning sun crept higher and hotter  There was no chanting  no apparent rancor  There seemed to be just as many members of the media present as there were protestors  But the surprisingly sparse crowd did little to dim the spirit of those who d trekked from across the country or from across town to be here   I said I would be here for the start of the trial and I made it  said Sherman  who used four days of vacation from her job with AT T   I m here to support Trayvon Martin and his family  It s not just his family that was hurt by this  We ve all spent a year and a half being mad  being sad and being angry  I m here for justice  Cephus Johnson  the uncle of Oscar Grant  22  who was shot and killed by a Bay Area transit officer on New Year s Day in 2009  said he made the trek from Oakland to carry the spirit of all the young  unarmed black and brown men killed by law enforcement  security guards and others each year   When we heard about Trayvon it hit us hard  It was painful  gut wrenching  and we knew exactly what his family was going through  said Johnson   We couldn t have made it without the support of the community  coming to court with us  helping us to get through the process  So that s why we re here  Grant s killing was captured on video which later went viral  It renewed debate over the treatment of black men by law enforcement   It s a group that none of us want to be a part of  said Johnson  of the families of gun violence   but we have to stand together  An award winning film   Fruitvale Station  depicting the life and death of Oscar Grant  is scheduled to be released in theaters in July  The officer who killed Grant was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to two years in prison  but served less than a year because of time served in jail while he awaited trial  Over the course of the next week or more  some 500 prospective jurors will file into the county court here in Sanford  That number will be whittled down to six jurors and several  alternates  The jurors will remain anonymous and will be asked a litany of questions by the judge  defense attorneys and the prosecution most likely about what they know about the case  how they feel about race  guns and marijuana  among other things  The trial could last six weeks  Ultimately  the jury will have to determine Zimmerman s guilt or innocence  was his shooting of the unarmed teenager legal self defense or second degree murder  Noche Diaz has already made up his own mind   Trayvon Martin is not on trial here  said Diaz   If we don t get justice  if Zimmerman is not found guilty  vigilantes out there will think vigilantism is free and the courts will have your back  There was no visible presence of Zimmerman supporters outside of court today  but Robert Zimmerman  George Zimmerman s brother  who has been one of his most vocal defenders  held an impromptu press conference during a court recess  He said that his family has received death threats and have few interactions with people outside of the family  Robert Zimmerman reiterated his brother s account of what happened just before Martin was killed  saying that Martin struck Zimmerman first  breaking his nose  He expressed faith in the justice system  and said that he believes his brother will ultimately be vindicated   We are very confident in the outcome of the case  he said   and we are confident that the state will not be able to meet its burden  Note  George Zimmerman has sued NBCUniversal for defamation  The company has strongly denied his allegations

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/soft-drugs-talking-points-go-smoke, Attorney General Eric Holder took a step without modern precedent last week  giving Colorado and Washington the green light on voter approved marijuana legalization measures  After four decades of a  war on drugs  that only moved in one punitive direction  the Justice Department decided to go in a decidedly more progressive direction Immediately after  congressional Republicans did something fascinating  nothing A stark radio silence is emanating from Republicans on Capitol Hill in the wake of the Justice Department s  DOJ  decision this week not to sue Colorado and Washington state  which legalized the recreational use of marijuana  or other states that have approved its medicinal use While Democrats have largely supported the state initiatives   and lauded the DOJ s decision on Thursday   Republicans have historically objected to the legalization and decriminalization of pot And yet  only a handful of GOP lawmakers have weighed in against this week s landmark DOJ announcement  which helped clear the muddy waters about how the federal government  which still considers marijuana a Schedule I drug along with heroin and LSD  plans to treat the state measures If previous administrations were inclined to take the steps on drug policy the Obama administration has taken  fear kept them from doing so   no one wanted to be condemned as being  soft on drugs  or  soft on crime But the landscape has changed quite quickly  Holder very likely assumed that if there was political pushback  it d be mild and unpersuasive  if it existed at all  The usual  regressive talking points  the A G  probably assumed  just don t resonate the way they used to  and much of the American mainstream has lost its appetite for an expensive policy that tears apart families and communities while failing at its purported goals And Holder s assumptions were correct Indeed  this wasn t the first time A few weeks ago  Holder also announced sentencing reforms intended to circumvent mandatory minimums in non violent drug crimes  And immediately thereafter  Republicans didn t say much of anything about this  either If Republicans thought they could benefit politically from going on the offensive on this  they would  If they had any reason to believe jumping up and down about the rascally Obama administration destroying America by undermining the  drug war  would give them a bump in the polls and or help motivate the party s base  that s exactly what they would do But therein lies the point  even GOP leaders don t see this as a fight worth having anymore Roll Call added   A day after the Department of Justice announced it would not challenge state laws legalizing marijuana  not a single top leader in Congress has weighed in on the issue   signaling  perhaps  the noxious nature of pot politics Rep  Jared Polis  D Colo  called this  progress  I m very much inclined to agree  ,09/03/13 09:17 AM,marijuana
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/thomas-roberts/no-gay-conversion-therapy-allowed-nj, New Jersey Gov  Chris Christie quietly signed into law on Monday a bill that prohibits licensed professionals from counseling gay and lesbian minors into feeling attracted to members of the opposite sex  First introduced in October 2012  Assembly Bill 3371 banning so called  conversion therapy passed both houses of the New Jersey Legislature with bipartisan support in June  The Garden State is now the second in the country to prohibit conversion therapy by law  California adopted a similar ban in 2012  In an accompanying signing note obtained early by the Associated Press  Christie appeared to contradict his Catholic faith in saying that he believed people were born gay and that homosexuality was not a sin  Catholic teaching argues that homosexuality is acquired  not inborn  and that acting on same sex desire is sinful  Such declarations were not included the governor s statement upon signing  released Monday  Rather than citing his personal beliefs on homosexuality  Christie deferred to medical experts  who argue that conversion therapy rarely works as intended and can cause serious harm to the recipients   The American Psychological Association has found that efforts to change sexual orientation can pose critical health risks including  but not limited to  depression  substance abuse  social withdrawal  decreased self esteem  and suicidal thoughts  said Christie   I believe that exposing children to these health risks without clear evidence of benefits that outweigh these serious risks is not appropriate  Christie also expressed reservations that the law would infringe on parental freedom  something he cited last week in referencing a bill that would ease access to medicinal marijuana for sick children   At the outset of this debate  I expressed my concerns about government limiting parental choice on the care and treatment of their own children  said Christie in his statement upon signing the conversion therapy ban   I still have those concerns  Government should tread carefully into this area and I do so here reluctantly  Human Rights Campaign spokesman Paul Guequierre applauded Christie s actions on Monday  but noted that the fight for marriage equality in the state was still unresolved   It s great for LGBT youth in New Jersey who need to be given the message that they are loved just the way they are and that there s nothing wrong with them  Guequierre told MSNBC   Coming from Gov  Christie  this is encouraging news  and we hope he will come to support marriage equality in New Jersey and everywhere else  The conversion therapy ban comes on the heels of a renewed push to legalize same sex marriage throughout the Garden State  which is currently one of four to allow civil unions  Six gay couples were back in federal court Thursday  arguing that the U S  Supreme Court decision striking down a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act does not apply to those in civil unions  meaning that gay couples in New Jersey will not be entitled to federal level spousal benefits  In order for same sex couples to receive the same benefits given to heterosexual spouses  protections that were mandated in a 2006 state Supreme Court ruling  New Jersey would have to legalize same sex marriage  not just civil unions  argue the plaintiffs  Christie s administration is defending the state s Civil Union Act  arguing that it s the federal government at fault  not New Jersey  if couples in civil unions are denied certain federal benefits  The judge said she would not issue a ruling before September  The Republican governor is currently enjoying a moment of enormous popularity  having earned the top slot on Quinnipiac University s survey of  hottest  politicians  as well as encouraging signs for a potential 2016 White House run  But as the New York Times notes  while Christie does possess widespread appeal  there also exists legitimate skepticism toward him from within the Republican base  which has warmed to gay rights at a considerably slower pace  Guequierre said Christie s support of the ban on conversion therapy marks an  encouraging  turn from the governor  but that  it s tough to say if this bill has anything to do with his views on marriage equality  ,08/19/13 02:22 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/new-day-the-war-drugs, It didn t get much attention  but the Obama administration did something interesting yesterday  it unveiled a new approach on U S  drug policy  As Keli Goff reported   It appears that the administration may finally be ready to put the so called drug war to bed and replace it with a much more commonsense drug policy focused on rehabilitation  not incarceration D uring a call with reporters  Gil Kerlikowske  director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy  signaled that the administration s approach to marijuana going forward would deprioritize criminalization  This acknowledgment   that marijuana can  in fact  uproot lives and land individuals in the criminal justice system   is an important one  which up until now the White House has downplayed   But perhaps the most significant component of the new strategy is that the White House is making a commitment to work to reform laws and restrictions that penalize drug offenders by limiting their employment  housing and educational prospects This issue has been lurking  just below the surface for quite a while  and last summer  Obama aides signaled that reforming drug policies would be a priority in a second term  The promises were part of a long term strategy that began in 2009  with President Obama putting the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy in the hands of Gil Kerlikowske  who said the whole concept of a  war on drugs  is misguided  and called for a massive shift in emphasis away from incarceration and towards treatment With yesterday s announcement on a new   smart on crime  approach  the Obama administration is taking the next step in this larger evolution The White House published a relatively detailed report yesterday  along with the above video of President Obama addressing the drug issue in an interview  and it s worth checking out  thanks to my colleague Anthony Terrell for the tip From Kerlikowske s report The programs and policy reforms set forth in the 2013 Strategy are built upon decades of scientific research demonstrating that addiction is a chronic disease of the brain that can be successfully prevented and treated  not a moral failure on the part of the individual  The Strategy directs Federal agencies to expand community based efforts to prevent drug use before it begins  empower healthcare workers to intervene early at the first signs of a substance use disorder  expand access to treatment for those who need it  and support the millions of Americans in recovery The Strategy details actions to implement the most significant expansion of access to substance use treatment in generations  Through a new rule made possible by the Affordable Care Act  insurers will now be required to cover treatment for substance use disorders just as they would for any other chronic disease  Specifically  this new rule expands mental health and substance use disorder benefits and Federal parity protections for 62 million Americans  making it a key element in the Administration s public health approach to drug policy in the United States The Strategy also contains action items in support of a  smart on crime  approach to drug enforcement  protecting communities from domestic and international drug related crime while diverting non violent drug offenders into treatment instead of prison  As part of this approach  the Strategy highlights promising criminal justice reforms  including drug courts and smart probation programs that reduce incarceration rates  along with community based policing programs that break the cycle of drug use  crime  and incarceration while focusing limited enforcement resources on more serious offenses NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous said in a statement   This strategy demonstrates that the Obama Administration is serious about criminal justice reform  The president s strategy puts in place an approach which acknowledges that we cannot incarcerate our way out of the drug problem and that we have an obligation to expand  smart on crime  approaches that place individuals  their welfare and dignity  at the center of drug policy in America In the recent past  all of this would draw quick condemnations from the right  with accusations about being  soft on crime  But my suspicion is the political winds have turned a bit  and the electoral risks associated drug reforms have faded   there s just no reason for even the most conservative Republican to support a failing policy that costs too much and does too much damage The debate is overdue  Kerlikowske s new strategy is a healthy way to get the conversation started  ,04/25/13 11:25 AM,marijuana
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/chicago-obama-talks-about-the-work, President Barack Obama returned to the South Side of Chicago on Friday  bringing  a message of hope and resilience in the face of the rising  demoralizing gun violence that has plagued his hometown   No laws or set of laws can prevent every senseless act of violence  President Obama told an audience of hundreds at Hyde Park Academy   When a child opens fire on another child  there s a hole in that child s heart that government can t fill  only community and parents and teachers and clergy can fill that hole  In Chicago last year  65 children were killed by gun violence  in other words  the equivalent of a Newtown level massacre occurring every four months  He noted that more than 443 people were killed by guns in Chicago over the last year   And that s precisely why the overwhelming majority of Americans are asking for some common sense proposals to make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun  Obama said   In too many neighborhoods  the future only extends to the next street corner or the outskirts of town  he said   For a lot of young boys and young men  they don t see an example of a father or grandfather who are in the position to support families and be held up and respected   And so that means that this is not just a gun issue  its also an issue of the kinds of communities we are building  and in that  we all share a responsibility  The speech comes less than a week after the burial of Hadiya Pendleton  a Chicago honor student who was gunned down by alleged gang members just a mile from Obama s south side home earlier this month  Obama invoked her memory during his address to the nation on Tuesday  in which he implored Congress to act on gun legislation  saying Hadiya and other victims of gun violence  deserve a vote  Hadiya s family was in attendance on Friday  and the president again acknowledged their loss   Unfortunately  what happened to Hadiya is not unique it s not unique to Chicago  it s not unique to the country  Obama said   Too many of our children are being taken from us   I pray that my daughter s death becomes a turning point  Cleopatra Cowley Pendleton  Hadiya s mother  told msnbc com shortly after the president s speech  with a button bearing her daughter s picture pinned to her sweater   I know President Obama and Michelle Obama care about our community  and care about us  What he said today  it was comforting  President Obama largely avoided the issue of gun control during his first term  but with the fervent debate around gun legislation prompted by the Newtown massacre  and growing national attention on the violence in his hometown  Obama delivered what many in Chicago and across the country had been waiting for  Chicago residents have longed for the day when the president would return home and give them  the attention they feel they and the issue deserve   It was unbelievable  Stuart Taylor said of Obama s remarks   It was a very important message  that we as a community need to come together  Before the president s speech  Aisha Truss Miller  whose 17 year old cousin was shot and killed last summer  just blocks from where Hadiya Pendleton was killed  said she feared that the president s visit would be a  grand gesture  but not much more   Until he speaks openly and honestly about the problems of gun violence and the trauma associated with it  only then will I think he s trying to hold himself and American history accountable for sustaining the violence and the culture of violence in Chicago and elsewhere in the nation  Truss Miller told msnbc com  Truss Miller said she was disappointed that the president did not directly address what she called  the generational trauma  inflicted upon inner city black youth   He did his job as the president  Truss Miller allowed   But only time will tell what impact his words had on the young people in the room and those young people who weren t in the room  In the days following Pendleton s killing  little more than a week after she marched in Obama s inaugural parade  Truss Miller started a petition on Change org asking that Obama come to Chicago and speak on the girl s death  As the story gained national attention  the number of signers of the petition grew  In just a couple weeks more than 45 000 people signed the petition  Many have credited Obama s homecoming to Truss Miller and her petition   I had to do something  Truss Miller said  Before delivering his speech  Obama met privately with more than a dozen students at the school who are part of a youth anti violence program  all young black men from the city s South Side neighborhoods  not far from where Obama said  Michelle and I met  where we fell in love  The crowd of hundreds  including students  politicians  and clergy collectively swooned in a chorus of  awwwww   We needed to hear from the president up close and personal  said Corey Stevens  17  who was one of the students Obama met with  Stevens said that Obama opened up to them about his own mistakes as a young person  including smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol   He told us he went through some of the same things we go through  Stevens said   That he s like us   I told them I had issues too  Obama said during his speech   And we talked about what it takes to change  He talked to the crowd about gun control measures and the ways in which stable homes  families  and communities can help keep youth out of gangs and violence  Obama spoke broadly about the economic proposals laid out during his State of the Union address  The Chicago event capped a post State of the Union tour this week that took Obama to Asheville  NC  on Wednesday and Decatur  GA  on Thursday  focused mostly on proposals to strengthen the economy for the middle class through so called  ladders of opportunity  which include raising the minimum wage to  9 and expanding early childhood education  In closing his Chicago remarks  the president talked about Hadiya s trip to Washington just a week before she was killed  to march in his inaugural parade and take in the sites and monuments  He said she and her classmates visited the Rev  Martin Luther King Jr  monument  and that the monument was a  testament not to work that is completed  but to the work that remains unfinished   His goal was not only to free us from the shackles of discrimination  but from the shadow of poverty that plagues too much of our country  Obama said   I cannot do it by myself  he said   we are going to have to do it together  ,02/15/13

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/evolving-conversation-drug-policy, A few months ago  Gallup reported that for the first time  a clear majority of Americans  58  support legalization of marijuana  When Gallup first polled on this question  in 1969  only 12  endorsed legalization  The results were largely in line with Pew Research Center findings published in April  when it found a narrow majority favoring marijuana legalization  too    The next question  of course  is whether political leaders would follow the public s lead  and there s some evidence that the answer is yes  President Obama  for example  made headlines this week when he suggested marijuana is less dangerous for users than alcohol    Texas Gov  Rick Perry  R  raised even more eyebrows yesterday when he signaled support for decriminalization  Texas Governor Rick Perry said Thursday that he is in favor of softening penalties for pot users  touting strides his state has made towards decriminalizing marijuana use     As governor  I have begun to implement policies that start us toward a decriminalization  Perry said at a World Economic Forum panel on drug legalization in Davos  Switzerland  Perry proposed the idea of alternative  drug courts  that provide treatment options and softer punishment for minor offenses  Though Perry s spokesperson clarified that the governor has not endorsed legalization  he supports decriminalization and believes states  should be allowed  to legalize the drug if they choose to do so    It s worth noting that this appears to be a new position for the Texas Republican  Ana Ya ez Correa  director of the Texas Criminal Justice Coalition  said she was  shocked  by the governor s comments  adding   The decriminalization of marijuana is not something Perry has historically supported    There s a real  practical reason developments like these matter    We talked last fall about U S  Attorney General Eric Holder  who made several progressive moves on federal drug policy that represented a genuine breakthrough moment  The nation spent four decades waging a costly and punitive  war on drugs  which proved to be something of a disaster  and here was the nation s chief law enforcement official making clear that it was time for a meaningful policy shift    Holder wasn t the first to believe this  but he and the Obama administration were among the first to take the lead in changing the public conversation at the national level  Why did it take so long  The political environment was  to put it mildly  inhospitable   Democrats who dared to question the wisdom of U S  drug policy risked being labeled a left wing radical who s  soft  on crime    But after the Obama administration endorsed a change  something interesting happened  there was no conservative pushback  There were no attack ads or smear campaigns   Indeed  just the opposite has happened   Rick Perry  whom no one would describe as a moderate in his party  is adopting a new  more progressive posture on marijuana for the first time    What s more  he s not alone  New Jersey Gov  Chris Christie  R  blasted the  failed war on drugs  this week  Sen  Rand Paul  R Ky  routinely urges reforms to the nation s drug laws  and even Louisiana Gov  Bobby Jindal  R  is open to legalization    The debate is not only changing quickly  it s evolving in a bipartisan way that was hard to even imagine a decade ago    ,01/24/14 09:45 AM,marijuana
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/the-ed-show/the-other-other-conversation-the-drug-war-d, Mass shootings may be particularly horrific  but they don t represent the most common form of gun violence in the United States  In mid October  Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron told msnbc that the War on Drugs is a significant driver of violent crime in the United States   There s plenty of violence that I think has nothing to do with prohibition   but there s a substantial part of violence that s due to prohibition  he said at the time   And the part that we can most easily address is due to prohibition  Overall  violent crime has decreased significantly over the past couple of decades  dropping by as much as 50  between 1991 and 2009  Part of that  said Miron  is because Washington s Drug War fever has waned since the Reagan Bush years  Drug related carnage has now been exported to our southern neighbors  Since the escalation of Mexico s U S endorsed drug war in 2006  its murder rate has skyrocketed  At least on this issue  U S  policy is inching in the right direction  this year  Washington state and Colorado both legalized recreational cannabis use  However  many states not to mention the federal government still favor a policy regime which lets organized crime monopolize drug distribution  leads to the unjust imprisonment of countless non violent offenders  keeps possible treatments out of the hands of cancer patients  and promotes escalating police violence in marginalized communities  The Obama Justice Department may even continue to enforce federal anti marijuana laws in states that have legalized the drug  And in recent years  the United States military has deployed troops in Honduras to fight the Drug War abroad  Limiting access to guns and improving mental health care access are both much needed policy responses to shooting rampages  But we also need to take a long  hard look at the senseless violence which the government invites and often even inflicts through prolonged  pseudo military wars with no limits and no clear objective  ,12/17/12 05:26 PM,marijuana

big cuts to education spending in addition to slashing about 12 000 public sector jobs  Terry Jones  a 57 year old vocational counselor at a substance abuse clinic and St  Petersburg resident  said he voted for Crist  in part because the former governor wants to raise the minimum wage to  10 10 something Scott is against   It doesn t bother me that Crist has switched parties  I m about what s best for the people  and he s not the first politician to ever switch parties  Polls continually showed Crist and Scott in a dead heat  A Quinnipiac University survey released Monday echoed that pattern

repeated use of the Fifth Amendment when his hospital chain was found guilty of fraud  and Scott has called Crist a lackey of President Obama  At times  the campaign has become downright silly   with a recent debate being infamously held up over whether or not a fan at Crist s podium was against the rules  Several national issues have also sparked fierce debate between the two candidates  The includes the minimum wage  medical marijuana  Scott is against a state amendment that would allow it  while Crist supports the legislation  and abortion  Scott is against abortion and has backed

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/geoffrey-cowley-answered-your-obamacare-questions, Geoffrey Cowley  national health reporter for msnbc  answered your Obamacare questions  We took questions from both msnbc com and Facebook Check out Geoff s responses below  Reader questions were edited for typos and remain in their original format  Gloria Gevirtz What will happen with the ACA if the next president is a Republican  Geoffrey Cowley  If the GOP wins the White House and both houses of Congress  unlikely  we ll no doubt see new efforts to scale back the health care law  But it s hard to imagine lawmakers repealing the Affordable Care Act in 2017  By then  according to the Congressional Budget Office  25 million previously uninsured people will have gained coverage  The CBO projects that 24 million Americans will buy their insurance through the exchanges in 2017  and 12 million will benefit from the Medicaid expansion  Politically  taking health care away from 36 million people would be a hard sell   DWAT8002 I currently do not have healthcare coverage  I just started a new job that offers healthcare benefits  but I will not be able to sign up until April 1  Since the deadline to sign up for health insurance and avoid the tax penalty is March 31  will I have to pay the penalty fee even though I will have coverage on April 1  Geoffrey Cowley  No one who enrolls in a health plan by March 31 will face any penalties this year  even if the coverage takes a while to kick in  By waiting until April 1 to enroll  you would cross the three month threshold and incur a penalty for the part of the year you spent uninsured  details here  The penalty for going uninsured all year is  95  or 1  of your income if you make more than  95 000  The baseline fine for three uninsured months would be a fourth of that amount  or  23 75  If you want to save the money  maybe your employer will move up your start date by a day  Ademocrat My husband and I rarely have need for doctors but because he is self employed and makes an average of  150k  we will have to pay over  500 per month for  affordable  health coverage with a large deductible to boot  Yes  we can afford the cost  but why should we pay for something we have no need of  We paid so much less for the few times we did need a doctor as self pay patients  Please explain to me what is  affordable  for those of us that would rather keep our money instead of lining the pockets of these insurance monsters  Geoffrey Cowley  There s a difference between not needing something and not needing it at this moment  We require drivers to insure themselves because some will have accidents and the costs they can t cover will fall upon others  The argument for mandatory health coverage follows the same logic  Self pay may work well while you re healthy  but few of us could pay cash for the care we would receive when mortally injured or seriously ill  Since we re all likely to require serious care at some point  we owe it to each other to pay our share of the cost  Conservatives used to champion that idea  but something has eroded their sense of shared responsibility  As for affordability  health care is expensive and often wasteful  The health care law includes many provisions to make it more efficient and to help people who truly can t afford it  Fortunately for those who can afford coverage  health care costs are now rising more slowly than they have in decades  Tom Kruse via Facebook Dental health is health  Why wasn t dental insurance included in ACA  Geoffrey Cowley The health care law treats dental care as an essential health benefit for children and youth less than 19 years old  Any health plan offered to that age group will include dental coverage  but Obamacare makes dental coverage optional in adult health plans  Some offer it  some don t  and consumers can choose the level of coverage they want  There s no tax penalty for skipping dental coverage  but you re right that it s worth having  Untreated cavities and gum disease can foster everything from pregnancy complications to heart disease  KaitlynK For unknown reasons  many doctors are not accepting ACA exchange insurances  If this trend continues  can t the government compel physicians to accept these insurances so that Americans can continue to have access to affordable care  Geoffrey Cowley Doctors can refuse any form of payment they don t like  Many refuse Medicaid because of its traditionally low reimbursement rates  and some refuse all insurance to avoid being second guessed by claims adjusters  It s hard to imagine any doctor caring whether a patient s health plan was purchased through an insurance exchange  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act  those policies provide the same coverage as the policies people get through their jobs   LLeno22 My 88 year old mother has Medicare through her former employer  the state of Michigan  where she retired as a teacher 30 years ago  The prescription coverage thru Catamaran is horrible  only allowing for old generic meds which have not helped her issues with diabetes and neuropathy and they offer no therapeutic meds for dementia  Can the ACA help my mother or supplement her prescription coverage  Geoffrey Cowley It sounds like your mom is using Medicare Part D  the prescription drug plan that President George W  Bush signed into law in 2005  The program is administered by private insurers  through Medigap or Medicare Advantage plans  Different insurers charge different premiums and cover different collections of drugs  so you should shop around for the right plan  Medicare has an online plan finder you may find helpful  Under federal law  all Medicare Part D plans must provide a minimum level of coverage  The law also limits the deductibles and copays insurers can impose  This year s maximum deductible will be  310  down from  325 in 2013  and copays will be capped at  2 850  down from  2 970  in 2013  The Affordable Care Act doesn t restructure Medicare Part D  but it does close a big gap in coverage  Because of a quirk in the 2005 law  Part D benefits fall off sharply after a subscriber s total drug bills reach a certain threshold  2 970 last year  and resume only after the subscriber crosses a  catastrophic  threshold  4 750 last year  For more details on this  doughnut hole  see this fact sheet from the AARP  The Affordable Care Act is slowly closing the hole  both by shifting its boundaries  to  2 850 and  4 550 this year  and by helping people pay for their medications while they pass through it  Last year  between federal subsidies and drug company discounts  people in the doughnut hole paid 48  of the retail price for brand name drugs and 79  of retail for cheaper generics  Obamacare ensures that by 2020  no one in the gap will pay more than 25  of a drug s retail price  AltaAndy sent via email In your recent article on Arkansas  approach to Medicaid expansion  A red state breakthrough on health care reform  you mention a graduate student who  earns too little to qualify for a discount on private health insurance  I don t get that  Are you saying he has to earn MORE to qualify for help  Geoffrey Cowley Yes  it s strange but true  Here s the back story  As signed into law four years ago  the Affordable Care Act extended Medicaid coverage to everyone living below 138  of the federal poverty level  roughly  16 100 a year for a single adult and it used tax credits to help people with moderate incomes buy private insurance through the new health insurance exchanges Those subsidies are available to anyone earning 100  to 400  of the federal poverty wage  11 670 to  46 680 for a single adult  Just about everyone would have been covered if that formula had stuck  But two years ago  the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out of the Medicaid expansion  and 23 of them have done just that  If Arkansas had turned down its Medicaid expansion funds  that grad student would be out of luck  His  9 000 a year internship would make him too rich for traditional Medicaid  he would have to earn less than  2 000 a year to qualify for that  But his  9 000 salary would make him too poor for a marketplace subsidy  Some 5 million low income people have fallen into that coverage gap in the Medicaid refusal states  Congress could fill the gap by lowering the floor for marketplace subsidies  but no one expects that to happen as long as the GOP controls the House of Representatives  SocialmedicToo I would like to know why crippling student loan debt is not taken into account when figuring how much a person is able to pay  Student loan debt payments are not exactly optional or dischargeable through bankruptcy and do rob the individual of discretionary income  Geoffrey Cowley Means testing is generally based on your income and assets  not your obligations  Without that distinction  anyone even the rich could qualify for benefits by loading up on debt  People living on fixed assets sometimes opt into Medicaid by paying down debts until they they re poor enough to pass the means test  As you point out  the monthly payment on a student loan can have the same effect  Unfortunately  social programs just aren t set up to take that into account  Here s the upside  The ACA subsidizes health coverage for anyone earning between 100  and 400  of the federal poverty wage  11 490 to  45 960 for an individual  and the biggest subsidies go to those with the lowest incomes  If a student loan payment is taking a significant chunk out of your paycheck  chances are you fall into that range  To learn more  check out this primer on eligibility and this guide to checking your own status   cjkid1964 Section 18115 of the Affordable Care Act is titled  Freedom not to participate in Federal health insurance programs  Can you tell me more about this  Geoffrey Cowley Sure  this section simply tells insurers that they don t have to sell their plans through the exchanges or take part in other Obamacare programs  Here s the full text  No individual  company  business  nonprofit entity  or health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall be required to participate in any Federal health insurance program created under this Act  or any amendments made by this Act  or in any Federal health insurance program expanded by this Act  or any such amendments  and there shall be no penalty or fine imposed upon any such issuer for choosing not to participate in such programs  Mathies Gorm Jensen As the ACA goes forward and becomes  as Mr  Boehner has called it  the law of the land  my question concerns the projects that individual states will start running in 2017  Do you feel these may lead to more states running single payer systems if  for instance  Vermont is successful  We have seen how other states are jumping in on legal marijuana after Colorado was successful with it  Do you feel a similar parallel could be drawn to health care  Thank you  Geoffrey Cowley I suspect legal weed will prove more popular than single payer health care  at least in the short term  But yes  states are exploring a lot of interesting variations on Obamacare  So far  only 10 have embraced all three of the law s main provisions  state run exchanges  and Medicaid expansion and insurance industry reforms  But nearly all states have embraced parts of the law and several are using Obamacare funds to pursue novel approaches to health care reform  Arkansas and Vermont are both good examples  Last year  the feds approved Arkansas  bid to spend its Medicaid expansion funds on commercial insurance policies rather than government benefits  As a result  nearly 100 000 poor Arkansans now enjoy the same coverage as other private consumers  and 150 000 are still eligible  Vermont is pursuing the opposite tack hoping to pool private  state and federal resources to create its own single payer system  To succeed  the state would have to reallocate all of its federal health funds  not just those earmarked for Medicaid expansion  The feds can t legally approve that request before 2017  and some experts even those who favor a single payer solution doubt the experiment will work at the state level  But all of these experiments will hold valuable lessons for the rest of the country  And like Romneycare  the successful ones are likely to spread  Fred Orth What is going to happen to medical facilities in states that do not accept Medicaid expansion  I understand that federal payments will be reduced to reflect the compensation they would have received if their states had expanded coverage  What will the ensuing cost shift mean to charges for those insured outside of ACA  Geoffrey Cowley Hospitals could suffer huge losses in states that refuse to expand Medicaid  because they re the provider of last resort for people who lack health insurance  Under a 1986 law called EMTALA  hospitals that receive federal funding have to attend to dangerously sick or injured patients regardless of their ability to pay  Hospitals have traditionally recouped their losses from  uncompensated care  by shifting the cost onto paying patients and by drawing on a federal account called DSH  which provides partial reimbursement  It s more efficient to give people routine care than to rescue them from medical crises  so the Affordable Care Act moves money out of the DSH program and uses it to help states expand their Medicaid programs  In states that refuse to expand Medicaid  uninsured people will

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/holder-puts-things-right-terrorist-trials, Attorney General Eric Holder s legacy on progressive policy is often under appreciated  As we talked about last month  the A G has shown real  consequential leadership  for example  on the issue of LGBT rights  He s challenged Republican restrictions on voting rights  He s fought for sentencing reforms  He s condemned  Stand Your Ground  laws and showed effective leadership during the crisis in Ferguson  He cleared the way for Colorado and the state of Washington to pursue marijuana legalization  He s worked to reverse the disenfranchisement of the formerly incarcerated    But Matt Apuzzo this week highlighted an aspect of Holder s work that s every bit as important  shifting terrorism trials back to American courts    The news peg  of course  is Ahmed Abu Khattala  the suspected terrorist accused of launching the 2012 Benghazi attack  The right demanded that the Obama administration deny Khattala a civilian trial and ship him to Guantanamo Bay  Cuba  Holder ignored the Republicans  demands  and this week  Khattala was arraigned   in open court  in a routine legal proceeding  just as the American justice system is supposed to operate  Five years ago  the debate over whether terrorists should be prosecuted in criminal courts was so contentious that it made its chief advocate  Attorney General Eric H  Holder Jr  a political liability  Republicans argued that F B I  interrogation was not suited to wartime intelligence gathering  By extension  civilian courtrooms were no place for terrorists  who did not deserve the same rights as common criminals    But as Mr  Holder prepares to leave office  his success in reversing the Bush administration s emphasis on trying terrorism suspects in secret prisons or at offshore military tribunals may be one of his most significant achievements  While he did not end the debate   each new arrest brings fresh statements of disapproval from critics   the Justice Department can now point to a string of courtroom victories that his liberal supporters  as well as many law enforcement officials  believe has reshaped the government s approach to prosecuting terrorism     History will remember these years as the time when we resolved one of the most contentious debates in the post 9 11 era  about whether our legal system was equipped to handle national security cases  Mr  Holder said recently in a written response to questions about the issue  This is one of the A G s most important successes  and it s also one of the areas in which Republicans were completely wrong   whether they re prepared to admit that or not    Remember  when Holder started trying terrorist suspects in civilian U S  courts   the way nearly every president s administration has for all of American history   the right was absolutely convinced this was a disaster of epic proportions  Such trials would not only create a national security nightmare  Republicans said  but it would create a platform for lunatics to spread their twisted  hateful message  Worse still  conservatives insisted  are courts are so unprepared for these trials that acquittals would inevitable    None of this turned out to be true  The American criminal justice system is perfectly well equipped to indict  arraign  try  convict  and imprison terrorists  Republican predictions about our court system were about as accurate as their predictions about the Affordable Care Act    Apuzzo s New York Times piece concluded with this quote from Holder   We have shown  time and again  that upholding the rule of law is not inconsistent with safeguarding our national security  We have honed an approach to apprehending  questioning and convicting terrorism suspects that I think will serve as a blueprint for years to come    That s not what his far right detractors want to hear  but in the interest of justice  here s hoping Holder s prediction turns out to be true    ,10/23/14 05:01 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eric-garner-chokehold-death-nypd-reform, Just months after the choking death of Eric Garner at the hands of New York City police officers  the NYPD s commissioner has called for a  fundamental shift in the culture of the department  Commissioner Bill Bratton  the head of the nation s largest police force  testified during a city council hearing Monday that the NYPD is looking for ways to bolster training in the use of force for patrol officers and that the department is committed to addressing concerns that officers disproportionately stop and use force against black and Latino residents   We are committed to constitutional and respectful policing  Bratton said during the hearing  Garner s chokehold killing by an NYPD officer in mid July after he was stopped for selling  loosies  single  untaxed cigarettes sparked anger and greater scrutiny of the department s bolstered broken windows policing strategy  in which officers aggressively attack minor offenses with the aim of suppressing other crimes  The strategy  a hold over from the uber violent New York City of decades past  was invigorated by Commissioner Bill Bratton  who in the 1990s served as commissioner under Mayor Rudy Giulliani and was an original architect of broken windows  Garner s killing  ruled a homicide by the medical examiner and the police killing of teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson  Mo  on Aug  9  has sparked national outrage and a call for greater accountability on the part of police who kill civilians  Both Garner and Brown were African American and unarmed at the time of their deaths   If you don t address the race and class issues  which are at the core of the issues between the police and the community  and if you don t focus on the history there you re not addressing the fundamental problems  said Jumaane Williams  a New York City councilman who represents Brooklyn and sits on the council s public safety committee  Close video       Melissa Harris Perry

more towards federal authorities than local police    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss Mayor Bill de Blasio was elected on a campaign that rejected controversial police tactics like stop and frisk  an outgrowth of broken windows policing that flourished under the previous administration  The tactic disproportionately targeted young black and Latino men for random stops and searches Supporters and critics alike of de Blasio s have called for a more thorough review of the department s use of force procedures as well as greater insight into demographics of New Yorkers most often subject to stops and police use of force   It was evident to me and Mayor de Blasio at the time of my appointment as police commissioner that there was a need for a fundamental shift in the culture of the department  Bratton said during the hearing  according to reports   From an overarching focus on police activity  as measured in the number of stops  summonses and arrests  to an emphasis on problem solving in the community  Bratton said that he plans to launch a pilot program that would include additional training for officers on the use of force and that he hoped to expand the program from three precincts in November to include more than 20 000 patrol officers The commissioner also said that he is consulting the heads of other big city police departments across the country on new ideas on how to retrain police officers and that he s looking for overtime money to pay officers to take additional training sessions   The verbal and physical tactics necessary to assess and control a situation are perishable skills  We cannot reasonably expect police officers to maintain those skills on the basis of training they received as academy recruits without regular refreshers  Councilman Williams said that while there are a number of outstanding concerns over the NYPD s strategies and tactics  particularly around how black  Latino and poor communities are policed  today marked a bit of progress   If you don t address the race and class issues  which are at the core of the issues between the police and the community  and if you don t focus on the history there you re not addressing the fundamental problems  Jumaane Williams  I wish they would address the issues with broken windows in terms of the historical issues of race and class  That will get us closer to where we want to be  Williams told msnbc minutes after Bratton concluded his testimony to the council   Before  we couldn t even get acknowledgement of what the problems are on the ground  At the minimum  there is an acknowledgement that there needs to be a cultural shift in the NYPD  he said   I think we still have some way to go in addressing some of the things going on now  but at least there s an acknowledgement that race and class has historically played an issue here  Williams said he asked Bratton directly if he thinks issues of race and class factored in to the way people are policed in the city  and that Bratton said those issues have an impact on the city and precinct level as much as they do elsewhere in the country  This to Williams was a long awaited affirmative   If we don t deal with the central issues we are going to fall into historical patterns  Williams said   Everything else is overlaid that pattern  Unless we deal with race and class  anything you put on any of these strategies is going to be a problem The abuses of stop and frisk and broken windows are inherently issues about the violation of the rights of black and brown residents  he said  During the hearing  Williams said he cited data on summonses issued to people for riding bicycles on city sidewalks and pointed to statistics from three different police precincts  Between 2008 and 2011  he said police issued an average of eight summonses in a largely white  upper income precinct in Parke Slope  Brooklyn  During the same time period police issued an average of 1 000 and 2 000 summonses in largely black  largely poor nearby precincts in the Brownsville and Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhoods  Ahead of Monday s hearing  the New York Civil Liberties Union submitted testimony to the City Council demanding  increased oversight and transparency  regarding the NYPD s use of force  officer training  and violations enforcement   Eric Garner s tragic death highlights the disastrous consequences of NYPD policies that aggressively target low level nonviolent offenses and rely on excessive force  said NYCLU Executive Director Donna Lieberman   Black and Latino New Yorkers are more likely to be the subjects of force than their neighbors  The City Council must act today to bring transparency  oversight and accountability to the Police Department s training and enforcement priorities  It s time for the NYPD to abandon broken windows policing and to make training in de escalation tactics a key part of police training  As part of the NYCLU s testimony to the council  the group urged the council to  put an end to the NYPD s needlessly aggressive enforcement of nonviolent  noncriminal infractions  such as selling untaxed cigarettes  possessing an open container of alcohol  riding a bicycle on the sidewalk  and possessing small amounts of marijuana  Candis Tolliver  assistant advocacy director for the NYCLU  sat through and testified at the council hearing  She told msnbc that one of the more concerning takeaways from Bratton s testimony was that police officers are only trained on the use of force once  during their training at the police academy and that there is no other mandated training after they ve graduated to full fledged officers  Tolliver called the revelation  very troubling  At one point  in light of Garner s death by chokehold  a maneuver banned by the department more than 20 years ago  a councilmember asked Bratton if he d support legislation that would make chokeholds by police illegal  He said that he would not and that a department ban was enough Tolliver allowed that Bratton s testimony was extraordinarily open and blunt and that  it was almost alarming how honest he is being Still  she said there needs to be more insight and oversight into the NYPD s use of force practices  Over the last decade  as murder and other major crimes including aggravated assault  rape and robbery have all dropped significantly in New York City  summonses for petty crimes and misdemeanor arrests have skyrocketed  Those arrests include mostly violations for possession of small amounts of marijuana possession  traffic infractions and noncriminal offenses  The surge has mostly been fueled by stops of young men of color who have been disproportionately targeted by police   Eric Garner s tragic death highlights the disastrous consequences of NYPD policies that aggressively target low level nonviolent offenses and rely on excessive force  Donna Lieberman According to a report by the State Attorney General s Office  just 1 5  of all stop and frisk arrests resulted in a jail or prison sentence  Just one in 50 stop and frisk led to arrests  0 1  concluded in a conviction for a violent crime or possession of a weapon  Close to half of all stop and frisk arrests did not result in a conviction Though the practice has waned under the administration of Mayor de Blasio  so called broken windows policing has flourished  Critics call it  stop and frisk light  with less random stops but ramped up aggression in policing low level crimes  The NYPD s stop and frisk database indicates that blacks and Latinos were much more likely to be stopped than whites and also significantly more likely to have force used against them  23  more likely in fact  About 81  of the complaints filed with the Civilian Complaint Review Board were made by blacks and Latinos  much of which were for allegations of excessive use of force by police  A federal judge has ruled that the NYPD s use of stop and frisk violated the rights of the black and Latino men who were targeted by officers  As part of the judge s findings in a federal lawsuit brought against the city and the department  a federal monitor will be assigned to the NYPD and some police officers will be outfitted with body cameras  Just last week  the first round of 60 officers was outfitted with the cameras  The NYCLU said the ramped up encounters between police and innocent or minor offenders driven by such police tactics  have the potential to turn violent and even deadly as in the case of Mr  Garner   The Council should seriously consider whether New Yorkers should be subjected to serious penalties for these minor violations  the civil liberties union said in its letter   What we wanted from today was answers  Tolliver said  moments before delivering testimony to the council on behalf of the NYCLU   We wanted to know more about how police are trained in the use of force and we wanted to make it clear to folks that we need to know who force is being used against  We have data that force is most likely used on black and Latino New Yorkers  We need to know more about what they are doing and how they will be held accountable when  when someone is hurt or killed   We still need way more answers around the accountability aspect  she said   We need more accountability  we need more oversight and we need it now  We don t have time to wait  According to Tolliver  when pressed about racial data the department has gathered around stops and use of force  Bratton said the NYPD had stopped gathering that type of data before he took over and that he wasn t sure exactly why But analysis of police stops and the frequency in which those stops result in use of force by police offers a startling glimpse into how often routine stops escalate into the use of force by officers During a 10 year span between 2003 and 2013  police officers self reported 1 381 843 acts of force in 4 984 393 stops   This extraordinary number of acts of force self reported by officers is particularly alarming when one considers that nearly 90 percent of stops during this period were of innocent people  people who were neither issued a summons nor arrested  the NYCLU said its statement  The NYCLU s recommendations to the council include a demand for transparency around simple violation enforcement and demographic data  a requirement that the police disclose the frequency and content of officer training on use of force  The group also called for increased oversight of use of force training and that the NYPD create  opportunities for stakeholders to weigh on proposed changes or new trainings  and ensuring the NYPD is adopting best practices in its training and policies  ,09/08/14 04:20 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/marijuana-scare-stories-legalization, Coverage of marijuana legalization in Colorado has often focused on rare  genuinely tragic occurrences involving overuse of the drug  But  Reefer Madness style stories coming out of Colorado won t tell us much about whether or not legalizing marijuana was a good idea   I think we ve learned very little so far from Colorado  said Mark Kleiman  a professor of public policy at UCLA who advised Washington State in developing its legal marijuana policy   There will be bad things coming out of legalization  but they re not going to happen quickly   Americans use marijuana billions of times a year  and there s very few stories like this  Keith Humphreys  Stanford University School of Medicine There s little data so far to suggest that marijuana legalization has led to serious public safety problems  Despite the proliferation of terrifying anecdotes publicized by anti legalization advocates  crime has actually dropped in Colorado since legalization  One of these stories is that of Richard Kirk  who killed his wife after possibly ingesting marijuana and prescription pain pills  Some reporting has actually omitted the pills  the interaction of the two could have contributed to the incident   leaving readers with the impression that consuming a marijuana candy bar alone may have caused the psychotic episode that led Kirk to retrieve a gun and shoot his wife Police took a blood test  but the results may not be revealed until Kirk s case goes to court  so we won t know for a while what role drugs may have played   These are all multi determined events  We know that because they re rare   if they were simply determined they d be happening more often  said Keith Humphreys  a professor of psychiatry and behavioral medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine In the aggregate  Americans use marijuana billions of times a year  and there s very few stories like this If marijuana had this effect in a prevalent fashion  these things would have been happening for years and years and years  Also prevalent has been the sad story of Levy Thamba Pongi  a 19 year old college student in Wyoming who came to Colorado and leaped off a hotel balcony after eating a marijuana cookie that  according to police documents  contained six and a half servings of THC  the compound in marijuana that leads to intoxication  The coroner concluded that marijuana intoxication was a  significant contributing factor  in Pongi s death  But these are not typical experiences  According to Humphreys  it s  highly unusual  for people  without steady use and without a tendency toward psychosis to become psychotic from using marijuana  though he said he could not comment on any specific incident  Then there s the question of overuse  New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote Tuesday of a trip to Colorado where she had a bad experience after eating a marijuana laced candy bar that left her  curled up in a hallucinatory state for the next eight hours  Kirk and Pongi are both mentioned in the column  Yet the risks of marijuana intoxication pale in comparison to the number of deaths attributable to alcohol  which Dowd describes as her own drug of choice  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention there are around 88 000 deaths related to alcohol overuse every year about 7 500 of which are the result of falls  Kleiman estimates that alcohol related falls may account for as many as two deaths per week in Colorado alone  But Dowd s column wasn t about the risks of legal alcohol  And since there are no highly motivated groups fighting for the prohibition of alcohol  they re not likely to make news  Still  Dowd s column deals with a genuine issue   unlike with smoking  people can have a hard time understanding how much THC they re taking in when they consume marijuana edibles  People consuming edibles sometimes believe they re not getting high because of a delayed reaction  and then end up much more intoxicated than they intended   a problem of which Colorado state officials are well aware  But no one would be surprised if you told them a story about someone getting in trouble after drinking an entire handle of bourbon  either  And unlike with bourbon  there s never been a documented case of someone overdosing on marijuana   There s clearly an edibles problem  meaning that Maureen Dowd is not the only idiot in the world  said Kleiman   Eating is dangerous because it s harder to control the dose  Under legality that problem should go away  because the dose is on the product  You should be able to take just the right amount  just like a drinker knows how many drinks they want to drink   Eating is dangerous because it s harder to control the dose  You should be able to take just the right amount  just like a drinker knows how many drinks they want to drink  Mark Kleiman  professor of public policy at UCLA No one is proposing we go back to the days of Prohibition  despite the fact that people often become reckless or violent when they abuse alcohol The evidence suggests that they re more likely to do so under the influence of alcohol than marijuana  But as Rolling Stone s Bruce Barcott notes   Legalization rides on the growing belief that marijuana should be treated like alcohol  not like heroin or cocaine  The perception that marijuana  independent of other factors  can turn any teenager suicidal or any husband homicidal  would alter that belief  which is why anti legalization advocates are focusing on stories like Kirk s or Pongi s  There may be greater problems with marijuana legalization down the line   particularly as the marijuana industry s political ambitions rise with their profits  But the rare scary story from Colorado or Washington doesn t tell us much about whether or not legalization is working   So far there s nothing coming out of Colorado that says they made a mistake  Kleiman said  ,06/04/14 10:42 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/leave-the-girl-scouts-alone, Girl Scouts sell cookies as a winter storm moves in on February 8  2013 in New York City   Photo by John Moore Getty Images A Girl Scout in California last week drew quite a bit of attention last week after she came up with a very clever marketing ploy  The 13 year old entrepreneur had the bright idea of selling Girl Scout cookies near a marijuana dispensary  where she sold 117 boxes in two hours    And so  if you heard some recent complains from the right about the Girl Scouts  you might have thought it had something to do with this nontraditional cookie strategy  But as is it turns out  conservatives are actually complaining about the Girl Scout for entirely different reasons  During the controversy over Chick fil A s stance on gay rights issues  Fox News pundit Todd Starnes said that people boycotting the restaurant chain are  un American  and warned that  the days of persecution are upon us  But apparently boycotts aren t  un American  as long as Starnes supports them  as today he endorsed the Religious Right boycott of the Girl Scouts over bogus accusations that Girl Scout cookies fund Planned Parenthood  A few hours after Fox News  Todd Starnes endorsed a boycott of the Girl Scouts  Fox News  Bill O Reilly complained on his show about the  homosexual overtones  surrounding a Girl Scout spokesperson    It may seem odd  if not ridiculous  to think Girl Scouts could be at the center of a culture war  but this has been going on for a while    We last talked about this a couple of years ago  but the push seemed to begin in earnest in 1994  when James Dobson s Focus on the Family published a memorable attack on the Girl Scouts  insisting the group  lost their way  after the Scouts made a religious oath optional for membership    I also remember a 2005 piece from Amanda Marcotte  which doesn t seem to be online anymore  but which documented various conservatives complaining about  radical lesbian feminists  having taken over the Girl Scouts    In 2012  even the U S  Conference of Catholic Bishops entered the fray  At issue are concerns about program materials that some Catholics find offensive  as well as assertions that the Scouts associate with other groups espousing stances that conflict with church teaching  The Scouts  who have numerous parish sponsored troops  deny many of the claims and defend their alliances    The inquiry coincides with the Scouts  100th anniversary celebrations and follows a chain of other controversies    Earlier this year  legislators in Indiana and Alaska publicly called the Scouts into question  and the organization was berated in a series aired by a Catholic broadcast network   In 2011  the Scouts angered some conservatives by accepting into a Colorado troop a 7 year old transgender child who was born a boy but was being raised as a girl    Some of the concerns raised by Catholic critics are recycled complaints that have been denied by the Girl Scouts  head office repeatedly and categorically  It says it has no partnership with Planned Parenthood  and does not take positions on sexuality  birth control and abortion  Gladys Padro Soler  the Girl Scouts  director of inclusive membership strategies  told the AP at the time   It s been hard to get the message out there as to what is true when distortions get repeated over and over    Conservative criticism of the Girl Scouts became so common that Comedy Central responded with the appropriate derision   Don t be fooled by those cute little outfits or merit badges  The Girl Scouts aren t just selling you a pack of cookies   they re selling you a pack of lies  with a light coating of toasted coconut communism  Why do the Girl Scouts teach survival skills  It s clearly an attempt to build some kind of liberal tween militia  Volunteering and  helping  others  Just another strategy to mobilize the working poor and other key Democratic voting blocs    The piece  which was published in 2011  was obviously sarcastic  But the right s preoccupation with the Girl Scouts still hasn t gone away    ,02/24/14 10:41 AM,marijuana

 the 18 year old s remains were finally buried  There  the family s grief was on display  That s what we tuned in to witness  the multicolored suits and hats  the buttons and clothing bearing Brown s image  and the civil rights leaders and clergy who made a pilgrimage to Ferguson to lend their platform to a family who  until the unrest over their son s death  lacked a national voice  All of that was just a formality  though  a ceremony to cap the public exhibition of grief we d also been watching on television for more than two weeks  The nightly police violence in Ferguson that played out at the peak of the crisis obscured what I saw as a community in the midst of grief and loss  and at its wit s end  Most of America  myself included  watched it unfold on a screen   a television  phone  a laptop  And with the ease of a text to vote for our favorite talent show musician  too many of us judged  Brown s alleged theft of cigarillos and the fact that he d smoked some weed cast him as an imperfect victim    no angel  to borrow the parlance of the New York Times  And as people watched  they judged him and those in Ferguson who were overcome with grief and anger after the teen s death

were on the street those nights  They were mourning  America was born with both civil disobedience and a discomfort with black discontent within its genetic code  We have seen it in the resistance to virtually every social advancement by African Americans and other peoples of color    so much so that it has become easier to dismiss racial concerns altogether  and put the onus of racism onto the marginalized   Race cards  and such  But the caustic reaction to Ferguson s mourners was further evidence that a discomfort with black progress is just the beginning  If there is to be racial peace  we are being told to do it only in a way that makes other people feel comfortable  We need to not only die as  angels  but mourn like them  too  Justice and equality have become conditional upon the behavior of the aggrieved  What kind of grief do we recognize  When we see Michael Brown s father wailing over his son s casket  America gets that  After all  that s how people do it on television or in the movies  and even on the spectacle of our local newscast  So when Ferguson says goodbye to Michael Brown  mourners are expected to have their makeup done  clothes tailored  and to hit their mark  And  action  On cue  Ferguson must mourn and be perfect in the face of provocation  of triggers of every definition  Riot gear cannot break the concentration  nor can a shove or pair of hog tie

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/marijuana-legalization-elites, Colorado rang in 2014 by becoming the first state to sell marijuana to its residents for recreational use  Along with Washington  Colorado legalized recreational marijuana use by state referendum in the 2012 election  Despite the fact that marijuana use is still illegal under federal law  the feds have decided to allow these two states to experiment with legalized marijuana as long as they follow certain guidelines  Along with the usual barrage of tired stoner jokes  there has been some handwringing over the possible consequences of legalized pot use  Among them  the potential health risks  the possibility of more marijuana users  and  in particular  increased use among children  But rarely do those concerned about the consequences of legalized marijuana confront the consequences of our current marijuana prohibition regime  under which some groups of Americans are swiftly labeled criminals and set on a path of being marginalized by society for what the elite and well off usually end up recalling as foolish but ultimately harmless experimentiation with drugs  Consider that at least the last three American presidents  Bill Clinton  George W  Bush  and Barack Obama  have all more or less admitted to smoking weed  Bush s former budget director and former Indiana Gov  Mitch Daniels  was arrested for possession of marijuana and other drugs while a student at Princeton  On Friday  two major newspaper columnists  Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post and David Brooks of the New York Times  admitted to using marijuana  Yet just as all three of the above presidents presided over a criminal justice system that imposes harsh punishments for marijuana use  Marcus and Brooks argue against Colorado and Washington s marijuana initiatives  on the basis that marijuana is bad for you  The real question with marijuana legalization  however  is not whether it s not healthy to consume  but whether our current system of prohibition makes things worse  Excessive consumption of alcohol is not healthy  either  but after more than a decade of banning alcohol  Americans decided the collateral consequences of prohibition were far worse than the consequences of letting people have a drink  Presumably  Brooks and Marcus don t think of themselves as criminals who should have gone to jail for their drug use  any more than our three past presidents  Marcus all but acknowledges as much  saying that  t hrowing people in jail for smoking pot is dumb and wasteful  But that s what marijuana being illegal means in most states and under federal law  It means people go to jail   It almost never means  however  that people like Brooks and Marcus go to jail  Anyone who wants to see what a de facto legalization environment looks like can visit an elite college campus  where both the trade and use of marijuana are highly visible  and where those who get caught face the relatively minor sanctions associated with breaking campus rules rather than the lifelong consequences of breaking the law  What we basically have now is a system where marijuana is practically legal for the wealthy and white and illegal for everyone else  Although marijuana use among blacks and whites is about the same  according to a 2013 report by the ACLU  blacks are almost four times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession  This startling graph from the report tells the story  According to the report  there were more than 8 million marijuana related arrests between 2001 and 2010  almost 90  of which were for possession  Marijuana arrests now make up more than half of all drug arrests in the country  And use of the drug has only increased over time  As Michelle Alexander notes in her book  The New Jim Crow  the consequences of being convicted of felony marijuana possession can be far more dire than the sentence itself  Former offenders can find themselves deprived of professional or driver s licenses  educational aid  food stamps  public housing  their right to vote  and they may find themselves fired and unable to find new employment  having been marked by society as little more than a criminal  For blacks caught up in the system it can compound the already considerable effects of ongoing racial discrimination  Yet with their own acknowledged marijuana use our current and former presidents  as well as our well respected newspaper columnists  are implicitly acknowledging that mere marijuana use does not make you a criminal who should be driven from society and made a pariah  it does not consign you to fate as an addlepated dunce or violent sociopath incapable of holding a job or raising a family  Would that the worst consequence for marijuana use was something resembling Brooks  recollection of a botched attempt to deliver a presentation in English class while stoned  Legalization means that other people  not just elites and their children  can have the opportunity to shrug off past drug use as a youthful dalliance rather than a life sentence  There are degrees of decriminalization between marijuana prohibition and legalization and people can argue how far the government should go  What s clear is that under the current system  the wealthy and connected are almost entirely shielded from the consequences of marijuana being illegal  while the poor and non white face catastrophe for engaging in the same behavior  Brooks writes that legalizing marijuana means  nurturing a moral ecology in which it is a bit harder to be the sort of person most of us want to be  The current system already can make it not a bit harder  but insurmountably hard to become the sort of person most of us want to be  But not for Brooks or Marcus  not for any of our recent presidents  and probably not for their children  Poll  Legalize it  Close video       The Cycle  1 3 14  4 23 PM ET       Not everyone is stoked about legal pot       Two

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/renisha-mcbride-shooter-stand-trial, The man who shot and killed Renisha McBride  an unarmed 19 year old who was seeking help after a car accident  will stand trial on second degree murder and manslaughter charges  a Michigan judge ordered Thursday after two days of testimony  Judge David Turfe said Thursday that based on the evidence presented  Wafer made a poor decision in shooting McBride  and he failed to pursue other  reasonable opportunities to defend himself  including calling the police for help     He chose to shoot rather than not answer the door  the judge said  Theodore Wafer was charged with second degree murder  manslaughter  and felony firearm  in the shooting death of McBride Wafer has admitted he shot and killed McBride on his front porch after she was  banging  on the door of his Dearborn Heights  Mich  home in the early hours of Nov  2  McBride had been in an accident earlier that morning  crashing her car into a parked vehicle a short distance from the shooting  She had both alcohol and marijuana in her system according to the toxicology report Defense attorneys argued Wafer s actions were justified under Michigan s 2006 Self Defense Act  Wafer s lawyers pointed to smudges on the screen door as a sign of aggression and suggested that McBride could have sustained a head injury during her car accident that could have caused such aggressive behavior  A 21 year old woman who witnessed the accident and spoke to McBride afterward testified Wednesday that McBride seemed confused and  in shock Another witness  Carmen Beasley  heard the car accident happen outside her home  She called 911 and spoke to McBride  later calling McBride s behavior as  discombobulated   She just kept saying she wanted to go home  Beasley said  Both witnesses said McBride held her head in her hands after the crash  They said McBride seemed neither belligerent nor testy when they spoke with her    Assistant Wayne County Medical Examiner Kilak Kesha testified Wednesday that it is possible that McBride could have been more aggressive after sustaining a head injury  but that the injuries she sustained when Wafer shot her in the face were too severe for him to determine whether or not she had prior brain damage from the car accident The injuries are so severe I couldn t even reconstruct the brain  Kesha said  Det  Sgt  Stephen Gurka  called by the prosecution  testified that while the door was dislodged when he arrived on the scene  it was locked and he believed it was closed when Wafer fired his shot The defense called firearms expert David Balash  who said during testimony that McBride was two feet away from Wafer when he fired his shot and that the screen door had been knocked from its frame before the shot was fired  supporting the defense s theory that McBride s aggressive behavior justified Wafer s shot in self defense  Close video       Thomas Roberts  12 19 13  1 00 PM ET       Man to stand trial in Renisha McBride s death       A judge has ruled that a Detroit man who admitted to shooting Renisha McBride on his front porch will stand trial  Jamelle Bouie and Goldie Taylor discuss    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss  ,12/19/13 01:00 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/de-blasios-police-problem, The scene was eerily reminiscent of New York City s bad old days  when the streets were boiling over with racial strife  tension and violence  A black man is surrounded by a group of NYPD officers  One throws an arm around the black man s neck from behind The man is wrestled to the ground  His shouts of  I can t breathe  are ignored  Then  minutes later  he is dead  The apparent chokehold death of Eric Garner  who was accused of selling loose  untaxed cigarettes on a Staten Island sidewalk just moments before being accosted by police last month  has reignited a decades old debate over the NYPD s so called  Broken Windows  policing  in which officers aggressively attack minor offenses with the aim of suppressing other crimes   There s something disjointed about what the mayor says and what is actually happening  Yul san Liem   Justice Committee co director New York s Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio was elected on a campaign that rejected controversial police tactics like stop and frisk  an outgrowth of Broken Windows policing that flourished under the previous administration  The tactic disproportionately targeted young black and Latino men for random stops and searches  De Blasio s commitment to undoing stop and frisk helped to solidify his support among black and brown voters   many felt he offered hope of a paradigm shift in the way the city s poorer communities would be policed  They all but carried him into City Hall on their shoulders  In the short time since his inauguration  though  the mayor has been an ardent defender of Broken Windows and his police commissioner Bill Bratton In the early 1990s  on the tail end of the crack era  Bratton served as police commissioner under then mayor Rudy Giuliani  He helped to shape the department s robust push into communities of color via Broken Windows  Supporters credit the crackdown with driving down crime in the city  though the connection remains foggy at best  since crime has gone down across the country during the same time period in cities that did not employ similar tactics  But in light of Garner s death   which began with the paltry offense of selling 50 cent cigarettes on a city street   and all of the controversy kicked up around it  questions have arisen as to how this administration s policing of communities of color will differ from those that came before it   The mayor has made no bones  about  where he is coming from and where his values are in terms of policing  He has an African American son  He knows what the challenges are for an African American and a mixed family  He campaigned like he gets it  said Donna Lieberman  executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union   But I think that this issue of Broken Windows policing is something that is a serious problem and we have yet to hear from the mayor that he sees  that he believes  that it carries with it enormous danger and a lack of benefit  Lieberman called the administration s continued practice of Broken Windows policing as  continuing the distrust and the tale of two cities that was the narrative of the prior administration  Close video       Melissa Harris Perry  8 2 14  9 58 AM ET       Eric Garner s death ruled a homicide       Seema Iyer  Dorian Warren  Jamelle Bouie and Dean Obeidallah join to discuss the medical examiner s ruling in the death of Eric Garner    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss Last week  the city s medical examiner ruled Garner s death a homicide  The officer who appeared to place Garner in a chokehold shortly before his death has since been stripped of his badge and gun  Chokehold maneuvers have been banned by the NYPD since 1993  The Staten Island District Attorney s Office has said prosecutors are still reviewing evidence in the case  Had Garner not been killed  he likely would have landed on the city s massive roll of petty violators  the vast majority of whom are black and Hispanic  A recent report by the New York Civil Liberties Union compiled more than a decade s worth of police data   and it illustrates a stark disparity in exactly who the police have targeted for minor infractions  According to the NYCLU report and an analysis by the New York Daily News  81  of the 7 3 million people slapped with low level summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic  The data includes summonses spanning the whole of Michael Bloomberg s mayoral term  a period when New York City ramped up an aggressive police campaign in poor  mostly minority communities Critics of Broken Windows say that countless millions of dollars have been spent on targeting minority and low income neighborhoods for petty crimes   even while crime by many measures is at an all time low  Garner s death  which was captured by a witness on cellphone video  and a slew of other alleged police abuses in recent weeks have put de Blasio and Bratton under growing scrutiny De Blasio has defended Broken Windows  saying that unlike random stops  those stopped for minor infractions are suspected of breaking the law  Yul san Liem  co director of the Justice Committee  said the mayor s rhetoric and what s actually happening on the ground differ broadly   The issue is that this kind of policing is not being applied consistently across the board  that the orientation of the department is to go into specific communities and low income communities of color  Liem said   White folk from affluent neighborhoods are not getting stopped and beaten up for jay walking  There s something disjointed about what the mayor says and what is actually happening  Liem said that  while stop and frisk has decreased  recent data suggests that police stops for summonses and misdemeanors are having a similar and disparate impact on minority residents   The state should be acting in cooperation with communities to repair broken windows and improve quality of life instead of criminalizing the people who survive the persistence of both  Glenn E  Martin  JustLeadershipUSA founder Over the last decade  as murder and other major crimes including aggravated assault  rape and robbery have all dropped significantly  summonses for petty crimes and misdemeanor arrests including marijuana possession  traffic infractions and noncriminal offenses are way up  The upswing has largely been driven by people caught in possession of a small amount of marijuana  who disproportionately happen to be young men of color   This kind of policing  as we ve seen with the Eric Garner case and the many cases of brutality that have surfaced  this kind of policy can have brutal and fatal consequences  she said   The mayor would be keeping with his campaign platform if he were to turn away from it  Repeated requests for comment from the mayor s spokesmen about the issue were not returned by Thursday afternoon  Per the NYCLU Daily News reporting around the racial implications behind the issuance of summonses  the number of summonses have skyrocketed since the implementation of Broken Windows policing in the early 1990s  In 1993 there were 160 000 issued compared to a peak of 648 638 in 2005  The number fell to 431 217 last year and continues to trickle downward  But according to the Daily News writing out summonses for low level violations make up the majority of police activity  even more than felony and misdemeanor arrests combined  Last week  the NYCLU sent a letter to Bratton  the chairman of the New York City Civilian Complaint Board  and the city s Inspector General calling for reforms in the police department The letter states that beyond the circumstances of Eric Garner s death  the incident raises a number of other critical issues  including the use of force by police in enforcement of low level offenses  use of force training within the department  and the NYPD s lack of responsiveness to substantiated complaints of misconduct  The NYCLU mined the NYPD s comprehensive stop and frisk database to cobble together a picture of the number and frequency of stops that escalated into use of force by police During a 10 year span between 2003 and 2013  police officers self reported 1 381 843 acts of force in 4 984 393 stops  Analysis of stop and frisk has indicated just how ineffective the tactic has been  According to a report by the State Attorney General s Office  just 1 5  of all stop and frisk arrests resulted in a jail or prison sentence  Just one in 50 stop and frisk arrests  0 1  led to a conviction for a violent crime or possession of a weapon  Close to half of all stop and frisk arrests did not result in a conviction   This extraordinary number of acts of force reported by officers themselves is particularly alarming when one considers that nearly 90  of stops during this period were of innocent people  the NYCLU s letter  stated   White folk from affluent neighborhoods are not getting stopped and beaten up for jay walking  Yul san Liem   Justice Committee co director Glenn E  Martin  founder of JustLeadershipUSA  an advocacy group that aims to reduce the prison population  said the aggressive policing of poor communities of color works hand in hand with the prison industrial complex and that it fuels the cycle of poverty and incarceration   That the pattern continues to persist and materialize in ostensibly benign tactics of policing in New York City underscores this reality as more rule than aberration  Martin said   As evidenced by the recent reform and consequent maintenance of stop and frisk  the mayor s declaration to improve the NYPD s Broken Windows tactics will only allow the policy to become more deeply entrenched and intractable  He said the lopsided application of  quality of life  offenses in communities of color allows mostly harmless individual behaviors to justify collective suspicion and surveillance   When a community s quality of life is compromised the last thing that community needs is heightened police aggression and enforcement mechanisms  inevitably capturing and trapping even more folks in the cycles of incarceration and poverty that give rise to those offenses in the first place  he said  Studies show  particularly with young people  that involvement with police on any level increases the likelihood that you ll end up in the criminal justice system  Those concerns are obvious  but perhaps particularly problematic in New York City  A recent report by the Justice Department found rampant and systemic abuses at Rikers Island  The DOJ s inquiry cited a  culture of violence  particularly aimed at teenage inmates at the jail  the country s second largest   The state should be acting in cooperation with communities to repair broken windows and improve quality of life instead of criminalizing the people who survive the persistence of both  Martin said    Despite the latest controversy and calls for the NYPD to reevaluate its use of force policy and more broadly its Broken Windows style of policing  some long time community activists say the relationship between the police and the community under the de Blasio administration is a far cry from that of previous administrations  Tony Herbert  a Brooklyn based community activist  said the department has extended its hand to community groups in ways administrations haven t in the past  Anti violence activists have been invited to speak before police roll calls  The NYPD s community affairs officers have been more visible and responsive  There have been several community events sponsored by the department in which residents have been invited and there seems to be greater access to police commanders   There are a lot of aggressive police officers out there and a number of them need to be retrained as it relates to community interaction  Herbert  head of the Brooklyn East chapter of the Rev  Al Sharpton s National Action Network   Some are just totally ignorant to the fact that a little bit of compassion goes a long way  But there are also a lot of great cops out here  Herbert said that the quality of life issues the department has cracked down on  including public drinking and public urination  for instance  are real issues that led residents to complain to the police   People are complaining about certain things but sometimes people have to be careful what they ask for  Herbert said   Because when they start cracking down the good can get caught up with the bad  ,08/07/14 04:03 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/political-fight-over-marijuana-opens-new-bipa, Amid last week s brouhaha over Mitt Romney s tax returns  staunch conservative Tom Tancredo endorsed the legalization of marijuana in Colorado  Tancredo s support for Amendment 64  a proposed state constitutional amendment to regulate the drug much like alcohol  came as a surprise to many given his boisterous reputation as a longtime Republican lawmaker  Yet  his departure from GOP orthodoxy is hardly unique  He joins a growing list of prominent Republicans who support ending the drug war  including libertarians Ron Paul and former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson  and even conservative evangelical Pat Robertson  In writing of his support for Amendment 64  Tancredo said   I am endorsing Amendment 64 not despite my conservative beliefs  but because of them   Meanwhile  support for Amendment 64 is up by 11 points  according to a recent poll by Survey USA and The Denver Post  As schisms form within the Republican Party on various social issues  including marijuana and gay marriage  Democrats must be willing to reach out to the disaffected and moderates to build coalitions around ballot initiatives and non conventional candidates  These coalitions can lay the groundwork for electing preferential  if not ideologically pure  Democratic candidates in conventionally Republican parts of the country  This isn t to say that former congressman Tancredo or Johnson are going to be running for office as Democrats any time soon  They won t  But the people who support these men aren t necessarily going to be the conventional GOP rank and file voters that the national party would like them to be  The widely circulated  GOP purity test  from 2009 that would have barred moderate  and even conservative  Republican candidates from receiving funding and would have disqualified Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W  Bush was one of the many signs of the collapsing of  Big Tent  thinking from the right  The issue of marijuana legalization  however  might be the match that sets the entire tent ablaze  There are few issues that pitch hard right social conservatives against their socially moderate to liberal libertarian counterparts in such clear terms  It is hard to find a self identified libertarian who today supports the continued prohibition of marijuana  For libertarians  the issue is a principled one  do we trust informed citizens to govern their own lives and claim responsibility for their decisions  or do we cede that decision making power to government  The drug war may not be the most prescient issue for libertarian voters  but I can think of few others that highlight the philosophical conflict between these two wings of the Republican Party in such concise terms  As the GOP grapples with these questions  it is critical that Democratic politicians and activists reach out to those who will be disillusioned by the response they receive from their one time Republican compatriots  They will have different values  different ideas  and different policy positions  They will also represent one of the best opportunities our generation will see in advancing some of the most important causes of our time  Working across somewhat unconventional aisles in Colorado  Washington  and Oregon should be only the beginning  We have to be ready to work with those who want out even and especially if we don t see eye to eye on every single issue  While we cannot and should not gloss over the real ideological differences that do exist  those of us on the left would do well to understand the opportunity in front of us  Zach Wahls is a sixth generation Iowan  author of My Two Moms  Lessons of Love  Strength and What Makes a Family  Green Bay Packers fan and a commentator on LGBT and youth issues  He lives in Iowa City  Iowa  ,09/27/12 06:57 PM,marijuana

voters backed moderates  Virginia voters chose Democrats to be their next governor and lieutenant governor in an apparent referendum against the Tea Party which has extremely poor approval ratings after last month s government shutdown Once a Republican stronghold  Virginia demonstrated that the party s far right wing was a liability a result that party elders will be analyzing as they head for the 2014 midterms  Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli hoped the race would be an election about Obamacare  and he tried to capitalize on the tumultuous rollout of president s health care law to rally conservatives in his favor  But his stance on abortion issues  the environment  and health care were hammered by the McAuliffe campaign  Unmarried women  in particular  responded in McAuliffe s favor   This election is going to say a lot about Virginia s future  and the country s future  Obama said while stumping for McAuliffe over the weekend  Virginia s own restrictive voter ID law won t go into effect until 2014  but the state did recently purge voter rolls of 40 000 reportedly ineligible voters  and  according to many registrars  hundreds of eligible voters with them  just weeks before the election  In a court challenge  Cuccinelli defended the move in his role as attorney general  Democrats alleged that the purge disproportionately targeted Democratic voters and asked the attorney general to recuse himself  Cuccinelli declined  Despite that  Virginia s secretary for the Virginia State Board of Elections Don Palmer told reporters that voting went  pretty smoothly despite a software glitch that slowed down check in processes in roughly half of one county s polling stations   I m sure it s probably made the wait a little bit longer than it should be  he said  according to The Washington Post  New Jersey incumbent Gov  Christie easily beat his Democratic challenger Barbara Buono The governor s no nonsense style and his recovery efforts following Hurricane Sandy prompted sky high approval ratings that haven t fallen much  Christie opposes gay marriage  but he is stylistically and politically a far different breed of Republican than Virginia loser Cuccinelli  In his victory speech Tuesday night  Christie sent a message to the national party about what it takes for Republicans to win  He highlighted his leadership style of bringing people around the table  listening to each other   and  showing them respect   While we may not always agree  we show up  he said   We don t just show up in the places where we re comfortable  we show up in the places where we re uncomfortable  Because when you lead  you need to be there Christie added that he will not let any political party or outside force interfere with his  mission  to lead as governor of New Jersey  Many expect Christie to run for president in 2016  One of Buono s chief criticisms of the governor was that his presidential aspirations were pushing him further toward the right on matters of gay marriage and gun control  the governor notably vetoed the ban on a  50 caliber rifle  despite backing the proposal months earlier  Hillary Clinton may be the person to stop Christie in his tracks in a potential matchup  according to an NBC News exit poll  It showed Christie would lose to Clinton by 7 points if the 2016 presidential election were today  Less than a month after a federal shutdown that tanked Americans  views of their elected officials in Washington  voters also got their say in one congressional race between an establishment Republican and a Tea Party activist  In Alabama s 1st Congressional District attorney Bradley Byrne representing the center right  business aligned Republican party won in the runoff election against Tea Party activist Dean Young  who just last week declared he believes the president was born in Kenya Byrne earned the financial support of a number of business and Washington GOP groups hoping to keep Tea Partiers at bay his race is likely the first in a long series of battles in the GOP s civil war   Hopefully we ll go into eight to 10 races and beat the snot out of them  former Rep  Steve LaTourette of Ohio told National Journal of their plan to fend off Tea Party challengers with a new group  Defending Main Street   We re going to be very aggressive and we re going to get in their faces  The End Spending PAC  founded by TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts that funded Ted Cruz in 2012 actually opted to support Byrne over Young AL com reported Monday  despite Young s promise to be a  Ted Cruz congressman  Boston and New York both chose new mayors for the first time in over a decade  Bill de Blasio won the New York City mayor s race by a landslide  becoming the first Democrat elected to the office in 20 years  It was the first time in three elections billionaire Independent Michael Bloomberg wasn t on the ballot  Voters rejected his de facto successor  City Council Speaker Christine Quinn  in favor of the uber liberal de Blasio  who was a clear front runner in the contest against Republican Joe Lhota  whose controversial late in the game advertising push made some headlines  but did little to affect the polls  In Boston  the Associated Press reported Massachusetts state Rep  Martin Walsh pulled off a victory to become the city s next mayor  Walsh  who tied himself to minorities and labor duked it out with a fellow Democrat City Councilman John Connolly  who pinned his campaign on education reform Boston s legendary Tom Menino did not seek re election for the first time in two decades  In bankrupt Detroit one local businessman rode a catchy jingle all the way to the mayor s office  Mike Duggan was kicked off the primary ballot over a residency issue  the former hospital executive used to live in the suburbs  but crafted an incredibly catchy jingle of the spelling of his name encouraging voters to write his name in on the ballot in August  He beat out Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon  according to the AP  making Duggan the city s first white mayor in roughly 40 years  Elsewhere  amendments and ballot initiatives were being decided  Voters in Colorado approved a measure to levy taxes on recreational marijuana We are grateful voters approved funding that will allow for a strong regulatory environment  just like liquor is regulated We will do everything in our power to make sure kids don t smoke pot and that we don t have people driving who are high  said Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper in a statement   In Washington State  residents in the Seattle suburb of SeaTac  home to the Seattle Tacoma International Airport approved a ballot measure to raise the minimum wage to  15 per hour and mandate paid sick leave for airport and hotel employees  It s a big win for workers Statewide  a closely watched initiative to require labeling on food with genetically modified ingredients appeared to be headed for failure  Though many voting laws won t apply until next year restrictive laws kicked in in several states a full year after the president promised Americans that  we re gonna fix that  In Texas  former Speaker of the House Jim Wright  90  was nearly prevented from casting a vote the first election Wright would have missed since 1944 when he realized his driver s license was expired and made multiple trips to government offices to procure the proper ID  which he was finally able to do on Monday  Married or divorced women whose names don t perfectly match the voter logs may also be prevented from voting  ,11/05/13 10:15 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gop-infighting-threatens-immigration, Hard line anti immigration reform Republicans derailed an effort by a member of their own party to allow men and women brought to the U S  as children to qualify for Legal Permanent Resident status if they serve in the military  California Republican Rep  Jeff Denham wanted the House Armed Services Committee to include his proposal  the Encourage New Legalized Immigrants to Start Training  ENLIST  Act  in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act  After an outcry by conservative Republicans  committee chair Buck McKeon  a fellow California Republican who co sponsored the original bill  said Friday that he will not include the measure in the defense legislation  Denham could still introduce the proposal as an amendment  but that path would likely also face fierce opposition  Denham introduced the bill last year  as Congress tried and eventually failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform  Since that failure  GOP leaders have promised to act but have not yet unveiled any new plans  Opponents of reform continue to decry any bill that confers legal status on even a small number of undocumented immigrants as  amnesty  for lawbreakers  Rep  Mo Brooks of Alabama is circulating a letter opposing Denham s move to include the ENLIST Act in the next NDAA and suggested that children raised in the United States without legal status might be innately disloyal to their home country   How do you ensure that illegal aliens are loyal to America and not another country  Brooks asked   Is it wise to entrust illegal aliens with questionable loyalties with America s military secrets and weapons  including weapons of mass destruction  Iowa Republican Rep  Steve King said that instead of allowing young DREAMers to enlist  they should be deported   As soon as they raise their hand and say   I m unlawfully present in the United States  we re not going take your oath into the military  but we re going to take your deposition and we have a bus for you to Tijuana  said King   That s the law  King has made derogatory comments about young undocumented Latino immigrants in the past  In July 2013  he said that the majority of DREAMers were drug smugglers with  calves the size of cantaloupes because they re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert  The ENLIST Act is essentially the position former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney took once he backed away from early promises to veto the DREAM Act  the bill that would have given legal status to young people brought to the U S  as children if they met certain conditions  In a January 2012 primary debate  Romney said he would sign a version of the DREAM Act that focused on military service  But as members of the GOP fight over whether or not including the ENLIST Act in the NDAA qualifies as a  sneaky  move  as South Carolina Republican Rep  Jeff Duncan said in a Facebook post announcing he was withdrawing co sponsorship of the bill  the possibility that Republicans can pass any piece of immigration legislation grows slimmer  Denham s move to advance his bill is the first by a member of that party since the release of new immigration  principles  in January  House Majority Speaker John Boehner has refused to schedule a vote on comprehensive immigration reform  and it is unlikely to advance this year  House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has said he wants to pass legislation that would grant citizenship to men and women brought here as children  but he has proposed nothing  Denham is a veteran of the Air Force who is also a co sponsor of the House s version of the Senate s comprehensive immigration reform bill  He represents a district where some 40  of the population were born outside the U S    one of the highest immigrant populations of any Republican district  ,04/04/14 04:23 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/feds-will-let-states-experiment-pot%E2%80%94, The U S  will allow states to continue their experiments with legalized marijuana as long as they enact  strict regulatory schemes  that adhere to federal priorities such as keeping the drug out of the hands of kids  the Justice Department said Thursday  The Obama administration s new stance does not change the federal classification of marijuana as an illegal drug but does free up the nearly two dozen states that have recently made small amounts of marijuana legal for medicinal purposes  or  in Washington and Colorado  for recreational purposes to move forward with their local laws   These schemes must be tough in practice  not just on paper  and include strong  state based enforcement efforts  backed by adequate funding  Deputy Attorney General James Cole wrote in a memo to US Attorneys   I f any of the stated harms do materialize either despite a strict regulatory scheme or because of the lack of one federal prosecutors will act aggressively to bring individual prosecutions focused on federal enforcement priorities and the Department may challenge the regulatory scheme themselves in these states  The memo provides guidance for federal prosecutors  setting eight specific enforcement priorities for them to follow  which double as  harms  states need to avoid if the wish to prevent federal interference with state marijuana laws  While those priorities apply to US attorneys nationwide  they will have the biggest impact in states where some form of marijuana production and use is legal under state law  Earlier this month  Attorney General Eric Holder said that that federal prosecutors would stop seeking harsh mandatory minimum sentences for low level drug crimes  a policy which helped put record numbers of people behind bars  Eighteen states and the District of Columbia now allow some distribution of marijuana  mostly for medical reasons  Washington and Colorado became the first states to legalize recreational marijuana use in referendums last November  setting up a conflict with federal law which still prohibits marijuana use  The Justice Department s memo ostensibly sets that conflict aside for now  by stating that the feds will not challenge those laws in court  If the results of legalized recreational marijuana use in Washington and Colorado are seen as positive  other states could follow suit  In the past  however  federal prosecutors have taken a hard line on legalized pot use even as Obama administration officials publicly insisted otherwise  In order to forestall federal interference with state marijuana laws  Cole s memo says states must work hard to prevent   the distribution of marijuana to minors   revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises  gangs and cartels   the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states   state authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity   violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana   drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use   growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands   preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property  Legalized marijuana could ultimately have a significant impact on the number of people coming in contact with the criminal justice system  A 2013 report from the American Civil Liberties Union found that marijuana possession arrests account for nearly half  46  of all drug arrests  and that  on average  a black person is 3 73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white person  even though blacks and whites use marijuana at similar rates  ,08/29/13 03:34 PM,marijuana
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/what-real-drug-law-reform-would-look, The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing this week to discuss an emerging tension in marijuana policy  Washington and Colorado have legalized small amounts of marijuana and 20 other states have legalized it for medical use  These policies put the federal government into something of a quandary  since marijuana is illegal for any use under federal law  should the feds enforce its laws in these states  The federal government has devised a temporary solution that skirts the problem and could create a series of new ones  Last month  the Department of Justice released new guidelines on marijuana prosecutions  The essential message was that federal prosecutors should not interfere with state marijuana laws  Prosecutions should be reserved for those who sell marijuana to minors  use state laws as a cover for illegal drug sales  or as a means to distribute marijuana in states where it remains illegal  Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy was unambiguous about his support   The absolute criminalization of personal marijuana use has contributed to our nation s soaring prison population and has disproportionately affected people of color  said the Vermont Democrat  But soon there were questions about whether marijuana television commercials would run in Colorado  or if there was a plot to addict the nation s kids to harder drugs through pot laced gummy bears  While drug legalization advocates are hailing the new guidelines as  the most heartening news to come out of Washington in a long  long time  many are skeptical  The Judiciary Committee s ranking Republican  Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa  condemned Colorado s approach and the Justice Department s new policy  He asked Deputy Attorney General James Cole  who wrote the guidelines   Why has the Justice Department decided to trust Colorado  Colorado has become a significant exporter of marijuana  But there is reason even for drug reform advocates to be wary  the new approach will do little to mitigate the failed  war on drugs  and it puts the Justice Department in an untenable position  First  the change in the Justice Department s stance is only advisory  The directive to the nation s U S  Attorneys can easily be reversed by Cole s successor  This is not an actual change to the federal drug laws  The federal government will continue to prosecute drug crimes  which trigger harsh mandatory minimum sentences  These overly punitive sentences have led to almost half the federal prison population locked up for drug convictions  Second  because of the preemption doctrine  in which federal law displaces contradictory state law  prosecutors are opting not to enforce laws they are sworn to uphold  That may be laudable when it comes to marijuana but would not be so praiseworthy if the issue were  for example  voting rights  Grassley understood this when he said it was  disastrous  that the Justice Department was  giving the green light to states that decide to ignore laws they don t like  Criminal justice reform advocates should not be diverted by this recent shift  To create genuine and lasting progress  federal drug laws must be completely revamped  Congress should remove harsh mandatory minimums for drug crimes or remove crimes like possession of marijuana from the list of jail able crimes  Better yet  it should commission and evaluate public health data on whether marijuana actually should be classified as a  dangerous  drug and if it isn t  Congress should rethink criminalizing and punishing it so harshly  In this way  the federal government can lead the nation toward a sane criminal justice system one that protects the public from the serious safety threats and prosecutes and incarcerates only when absolutely necessary  ,09/14/13 08:45 AM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/rand-paul-defends-incredibly-talented-aide, Sen  Rand Paul strongly defended his hiring of staffer Jack Hunter on Thursday  a former shock jock who spent years promoting neo Confederacy organizations  advocating for Southern secession  and bemoaning threats to white culture  In an interview with the Huffington Post s Howard Fineman  Paul said he doesn t agree with Hunter s views on Abraham Lincoln  the Confederacy  and secession  But he added that the social media aide  is incredibly talented  and said he passes his office s  zero tolerance policy for anybody who displays discriminatory behavior or belief in discriminating against people based on the color of their skin  their religion  their sexual orientation  anything like that   People are calling him a white supremacist  Paul said   If I thought he was a white supremacist  he would be fired immediately  If I thought he would treat anybody on the color of their skin different that others  I d fire him immediately  Related  Rand Paul can t understand why black voters don t vote GOP  Here s a clue Paul compared attacks on Hunter to criticism of his own past marijuana use Are we at a point where nobody can have had a youth or said anything untoward  he asked  Paul s reference to  youth  is a relative term  to put it mildly  Hunter is 39 today As recently as 2009  he wrote a column defending secession  as in  something to consider today  as well as his personal affection for the Confederacy  In 2007  he warned that a  non white majority America would simply cease to be America for reasons that are as numerous as they are obvious   In 2005  he wrote that he celebrates John Wilkes Booth s birthday and in 2004  he wrote a column entitled  John Wilkes Booth Was Right  In 1999  he chaired the League of the South  a group devoted to Southern secession  As the conservative Free Beacon reported on Tuesday  Hunter held his radio job as the  Southern Avenger  as late as 2012 In 2010  he co authored Rand Paul s book The Tea Party Goes To Washington  A familiar pattern Hunter said in a statement Tuesday that he no longer holds his old views and is embarrassed they came to light  He added that  I abhor racism and have always treated everyone I ve met with dignity and respect as individuals  But he also told the Beacon that he still believes the Civil War was a mistake  The biggest problem is that Hunter fits a familiar pattern  Senator Paul has been working hard to position himself as a mainstream legislator in contrast to his father Ron Paul  whose own brand of libertarianism is steeped in neo Confederate ideology  The elder Paul considers Abraham Lincoln a tyrant  published years of racially inflammatory newsletters  and his organization today employs a variety of fringe figures with views similar to Hunter  Senator Paul had his own blowup in 2010 when he criticized the 1964 Civil Rights Act  but for the most part has avoided the more extreme edges of his father s support network even as he s relied on its backing to build his career  That phase appears to be over  Paul is defending his fringe associates at all costs now  If a lifetime of Confederate fetishism isn t enough to disqualify a close aide  it s not clear what would be   All this comes as Paul is working on a campaign to attract African American voters to the GOP   The thing is  I grapple with this  Paul told Fineman   What am I supposed to do  I m going to have a lot of people working for me  They ve all got writings and opinions  ,07/11/13 11:26 AM,marijuana
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/holder-people-just-need-be-patient, Attorney General Eric Holder dismissed a new government watchdog report which declared some NSA programs illegal  insisting that the spy agency s vast secret surveillance is on strong legal footing  In an exclusive  wide ranging interview on Thursday with msnbc  Holder also spoke about new voting rights legislation  Republican Voter ID laws  Wall Street prosecutions and the Obama administration s efforts to reform the War on Drugs with more rehabilitation programs   See video below  On the NSA findings  Holder said he hadn t read the new report from the government s privacy and civil liberties board  but noted that  at least 15 judges on about 35 occasions have said that the program itself is legal  RELATED Snowden   No way I can come home  When asked about judges who disagree  including a Washington federal court that rebuked the bulk data collection last month  Holder  himself a former Washington judge  contended the legal consensus is now clear   I think that those other judges  those 15 judges  got it right  Holder said  The Obama administration s recent  modifications  to the NSA program addressed any outstanding legal issues  Holder added  and he is now focused on working with James Clapper  the National Intelligence Director  on a harder policy question for surveillance today

Rights Act  He credited a bipartisan bill  introduced last week by Rep  John Lewis  a Democrat  and Republican Jim Sensenbrenner for going a  long way  towards addressing the Supreme Court s ruling against the law last June  However  Holder said the bill should patrol voter ID laws more assertively   If we can show that that photo ID efforts are done inappropriately and for improper reasons  Holder said   that ought to be the basis for federal intervention  The bill only counts voter ID violations found by a court   not violations filed by the Justice Department   to trigger supervision of local voting rules  That s a less stringent approach than the original Voting Rights Act of 1965  and it relies less on the Attorney General s judgment than the original law  Close video       The

Rights Act bill should target voter ID issues and    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss Holder had strong words for Republicans who use voter ID laws to suppress or distort voter turnout   People have to understand that we are not opposed to photo identification in a vacuum  he said  but it must not be used  to disenfranchise  people for racial or  partisan reasons  While some GOP lawmakers may have a  good faith  concern here  Holder said  others are disingenuously  using it for partisan advantage   The reality is that all the studies show that this whole question of ballot integrity  in person voter fraud   simply does not exist  he stressed  Given all the data  Holder contended  Republicans  fixation on voter ID suggests  a remedy in search of a problem   It is being used  in too many instances  he continued   to depress the vote of particular groups of people who are not supportive of the party that is advancing these photo ID measures  The attorney general said he d like to talk with Congress about legislative  language  to ensure the bill prevents any misuse of ID requirements   I would like to work with members of Congress  he pledged   to make this bill as strong as we possibly can make it  Too big to indict  Turning to the Justice department s Wall Street record  Holder rejected the criticism that prosecutors go easy on large companies based on their power or economic position   There are no institutions that are too big to indict  he said   We have brought charges against thousands of people over the course of these last four and a half years  Federal prosecutors have certainly racked up record breaking fines against some major financial companies  but most financial executives have avoid any jail time  and many companies pay fines without admitting any wrongdoing   One exception is insider trading cases  Holder cited the JP Morgan investigation as an example of strong oversight  noting that prosecutors reached a tentative  13 billion settlement   without letting the bank off the hook   Significantly   the settlement  did not include a resolution of the criminal investigation that is ongoing  Holder said   and could result in charges against either the institution or individuals  involved in misconduct  Yet Holder also pushed back on the idea that these cases can be easily judged from afar   People say these things without having the ability to look at the files that we have  Holder noted   We have certain responsibilities to only bring those cases that we think we have an ability to prove beyond a reasonable doubt  he said  And he suggested that some results may just be a matter of time   I think people need to just be a little patient  I know it s been a while  he said   but we have other things that are in the pipeline   We have ongoing investigations that I m really not at liberty to talk about  but involve significant financial institutions  Holder continued   and the focus of those investigations is not only on the institutions but on individuals as well    While relatively few people tied to the financial crisis are in jail  Holder believes too many drug users are incarcerated under outdated and ineffective laws   a core focus of his agenda during Obama s second term  Close video       The Cycle  1 24 14  3 41 PM ET       Atty  Gen  Eric Holder goes one on one with Ari Melber       In an

that prioritizes rehabilitation  instead of jail  for selected veterans battling substance abuse  It is only the second such federal court in the nation  Holder is calling for more through his  smart on crime  initiative  Speaking at the court  as several successful graduates of the program looked on  Holder said court mandated rehabilitation can break the  cycle of crime and incarceration  Holder believes providing that service  and that second chance  is essential for veterans   We owe them in the most profound of ways  he said  Holder also used the visit to endorse legislation to reduce disparities in drug sentencing  the Smarter Sentencing Act  The bill  sponsored by tea party favorite Sen  Mike Lee and Democratic Majority Whip Dick Durbin  has drawn attention for its bipartisan approach to reforming the war on drugs  A related proposal has the backing of Senators Rand Paul and Pat Leahy  Reflecting on his tenure  including one of the longest stints as attorney general in the modern era  Holder said he hopes these reforms set a new standard  A  smart  legacy  I would hope that one of the things that people look back on and say that we got right was to do things in a different way  he said   not to reflexively say that we were simply  tough on crime  but  as we use the phrase  to be smart on crime  In that vein  Holder touched on the widely documented racial disparities in criminal sentencing   This mass incarceration happens with a cost  he said   If you look at the way it impacts certain communities  Holder continued   let s be honest about this  communities of color   where young men who should be the future of these communities are taken out  labeled  and prevented from pursuing life as  productive citizens    they often bear the brunt of tough sentences   People have to be held accountable for individual decisions that they make  Holder stressed   but we need to have proportionate penalties  and the chance for people to rehabilitate after making a mistake  He pointed to the excess of mandatory minimums in the War on Drugs  a practice he reformed last August   I think we have a moment in time now where Congress  as well as those of us in the executive branch   may  pull back just a bit  He continued   I hope that will be a part of my legacy  Watch Part I of Ari Melber s msnbc interview with Eric Holder  on Edward Snowden  Gov

enough job to continue or that Romney has not advanced a credible recovery program Voters didn t like my personality  is a loser s excuse BERNANKE S CLIFFHANGEREDITORIALWALL STREET JOURNALEveryone is suddenly waking up to the horrors of the  fiscal cliff  that arrives on January 1  2013  but the real clear and present danger keeps getting misdiagnosed  It s the taxes  not the spending   After a five year spending binge and  5 trillion in new debt  markets want to know if Washington can control its tax and spending appetites  Any such signal would be bullish for growth  In the faux debate between growth and austerity  the Keynesians have deliberately confused the terms  They want to impose austerity on the private economy with tax increases  But for the private economy to grow faster  we need austerity for the government  ,06/08/12 10:57 AM,marijuana
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/after-the-shots-ring-out-regrets-and-redempt,  Bam  Bam  Bam  Demetrius Harris remembers hearing just before his legs failed him and he was thrown to the ground   Bam  Bam  More shots rang out   Bam  Bam  Bam  Harris winced and squeezed an imaginary trigger as he reenacted each blast   I tried to run but one of the bullets crashed through the car window and hit my spine  said Harris  a former drug dealer on Chicago s South Side   Something said get up  When I tried to get up my lower half just slumped  Joel Irizarry  a one time gang member on the northwest side  remembers the moment he was shot with just as much clarity  He said he watched his shooter pull out a pistol  raise it and fire a single shot   The bullet went through the backseat and hit me dead in the spine  said Irizarry  who was 17 when he was shot   As soon as it hit me I was instantly paralyzed  Both men were caught in Chicago s violent gun culture when they were wounded  In Cook County Hospital alone  doctors treated more than 1 000 people for gunshot wounds in the last year  Like so many other Chicagoans wounded by gunfire each year  Irizarry and Harris survived  but suffered catastrophic physical injury  Officials in some of the city s hospitals and trauma centers say that while accurate statistics are difficult to come by  they are seeing more patients suffering from spinal cord injuries associated with gun violence  a haunting uptick that seems to be trending with the city s rising homicide rate  They say the rise in such injuries comes after steady declines from the bad old days of the early 1990s when the boon in crack cocaine fueled a record level of shootings and killings  The gnarled spines and shattered limbs are the most direct correlative  aside from the mounting dead  of a city seemingly consumed by relentlessly whizzing bullets and bloodshed  Across Chicago  in hospitals and rehab centers and among a growing  loosely affiliated network of survivors many of whom have been paralyzed by gunfire the physical and emotional remnants of violence are all too present  Disfigurement  disability and  oftentimes  shame   I knew at some point it was going to happen  said Harris  33  who was shot in 2003 and  left paralyzed from the waist down   I knew at some point I was going to go to jail I knew at some point I was probably going to get shot  I just didn t know that when the bullet hit me it would tear my spinal cord up and I would be confined to a chair for the rest of my life  Among this unfortunate club of hobbled survivors  there is a growing camaraderie  Harris and Irizarry are part of an anti violence program called In My Shoes  a peer led curriculum funded by Schwab Rehabilitation Hospital that speaks mostly with youth about the consequences of gang and drug involvement  Peer leaders of In My Shoes say the program is part practicum on how to be independent after suffering a spinal cord injury  and part therapy and rehab group  Mostly  they re a group of cautionary storytellers  The program s staff is made up almost entirely of people who have been paralyzed as a result of gun violence   Seeing a young person get shot and end up with a disability  that to me is one of the most heart wrenching things  because a lot of times they are so young  12  13  14 years old  said Irizarry   These are babies  They haven t begun to live yet  And now they have to live the rest of their life with a disability is very  very disheartening  But we let them know that life isn t over  Victims of our own circumstance On a recent afternoon Harris and Irizarry rolled their wheelchairs down the corridors of Schwab  on Chicago s West Side  chatting with passersby and trading smiles and handshakes with random staff who whisked through the center s main lobby  Far from their former street life  they spend countless hours in hospitals regaling those who will listen with their war stories  They talk in painful detail of the burn of a bullet cutting through their flesh  and the moment they realized that they would never walk again  But they also talk about the role they played in their own  tragic misfortune   At the end of the day we re all victims victims of our own circumstances  Irizarry said   A lot of times young people only hear about death or jail  They don t hear about the disability  They don t know that this  he said motioning to the wheelchair he was sitting in   is an option  When someone is newly injured there is also grief  denial  regret and figuring out how to navigate the physical space around them while in a hulking wheelchair under unsteady hands  The group pairs those who were shot with mentors with similar disabilities  They set personal goals  Help people get back into school  They teach them how to plan out their every trip outside of home  Schools and buildings without wheelchair ramps and un shoveled sidewalks are the bane of a wheelchair bound person s life  especially during the brutal Chicago winters  Irizarry and Harris say  With equal parts clarity and candor  Irizarry and Harris drum up the ghosts of their pasts and the violent episodes that led to their injuries   Being a gangster isn t something that you do  It s a result of what happens to you  Harris said   Nobody wakes up at eight and says I m  going to be a gangster   You react to the lifestyle that you re put in and the situations that mold you and it makes you hard  and it makes you cold  it makes you callous and have no compassion  The night that Harris was shot  he says his killer squeezed off as many as eight shots before his gun jammed  As he lay there  he said he turned to look his killer in the face  but instead saw his legs kicking uncontrollably even though he couldn t feel a thing from his waist to his toes   I know I m not crippled  he pleaded to himself   I know I m not paralyzed  Long before those first shots rang out  Harris said he had a bad feeling about how the night might end  It was about 8 p m  on a spring evening in 2003  and Harris  who said he d traded education and legal jobs for a hustler s life  set out on his neighborhood s main strip to make a couple dollars selling drugs  Harris said he had a bad feeling about going out that night  but the prospect of getting paid clouded his instincts  Earlier in the day there was an informal meeting with his crew  And one of its leaders warned everyone to stay off the block that night  that there d been too much shooting and too much attention from the police  Harris said he saw the warning as an opportunity  if the entire clique was staying low key  that meant more customers and more money for him   He kept saying  I got a real bad feeling  Harris recalled   While he s telling us all this as a group  I m sitting there thinking that if he wants everybody to stay in the house  I d be able to make a killing  a bigger profit  Later that night  Harris hit the strip and almost immediately ran into a local flower peddler known in the neighborhood as  Flower Man  standing in the doorway of a bar  He was looking to buy some marijuana and crack cocaine  The weed Harris had on him  The crack was in his car  which was parked down the block  After handing Flower Man the weed  he made his way down the street to his car to retrieve the cocaine  He reached for the car door handle then heard gunfire  The impact of the bullets tossed him to the ground  Harris said he turned to look at his legs and they were still kicking   I couldn t stop them  Harris said  He tried to get up  but couldn t  Harris suffered a gunshot wound to his T7 vertebra  A nurse would later break the news to his family that he d never walk again   They were in denial for a long time  he said  Some of them still are  But Harris isn t   When you 13 and 14 you might convince yourself that you Superman  but when you 23 and you ve been to over 20 funerals you don t believe in Superman or bulletproof  Harris said  Harris said he has buried at least 10 close friends killed by gun violence in the 10 years since he was paralyzed  He rattled off a list of names  Gary Pinex  Keith Daniels  Rally Prichard  Paris Mercer  All dead   I m just lucky to be alive  I ve seen people way tougher than me  way stronger than me  lying dead in the streets  Harris said   I ve seen death  I ve lost count of how many times I ve seen death  Gang Banging at 15 By the time Irizarry was in his mid teens he was living a double life  At home he was a protective big brother and a loving son to his single mother  But in the streets of his West Humboldt Park neighborhood  he was something else entirely   I started gang banging at an early age  about 15  Irizarry said   I couldn t get to school  I couldn t get to work or go the local grocery store without being chased  harassed  beat up  There s only so much you can take of being a victim  I felt my only option is to join this gang and get this little protection that they claim to give you  For Irizarry  then a tall  skinny kid all of  135 pounds soaking wet  the odds of surviving on his own weren t worth taking  One gang controlled his high school  Another controlled his neighborhood  Shooting and fighting were everyday occurrences  But even as he became a more active  combative member of his gang and started selling drugs to  keep some money in my pocket  the two realities he was living were becoming starker  His mother and father had separated  so he was the man of the house  He did his best to keep his little brother and sister in line while his mother worked long hours at a local retailer  Irizarry said he even managed to keep up decent grades in high school  and as the end of his senior year approached he was excited about becoming the first in his family to earn a high school diploma  Then  on a sunny afternoon in the Spring of 1998  it all came to an end   He pulled out a pistol and shot just once  Irizarry said  Irizarry said he was targeted by a rival gang member who d seen him pull up to a neighborhood park  along with a friend whom he d had beef with from an earlier fight  First he threw bottles and bricks  Then  as Irizarry peeled away from the park  the young man whipped out a gun and fired  The bullet crashed through the back of the car and directly into Irizarry s spine  He knew immediately that he d been hit  Unable to move his legs  he said his foot smashed down on the accelerator  sending his car careening down the street  He finally managed to throw the car into neutral to slow it down  at which point his  so called friend  and fellow gang member hopped out of the car and left Irizarry  his younger brother and a cousin in the car to fend for themselves   He left me for dead  Irizarry said   I kept praying  asking God not to let me die like this  Days later at the hospital he asked a doctor   When am I going to walk out of this hospital   You re never going to walk again  the doctor told him   Instantly my world was shattered  Irizarry said   There were a lot of nights waking up and hoping that this was a nightmare  only to wake up and see a wheelchair parked next to my bed  When Irizarry finally made it back home from the hospital he experienced a mix of emotions  There was excitement to be finally leaving the hospital  frustration with his disability and fear of more violence  His shooter was a member of a rival gang in the neighborhood  Anything could happen  he thought  This time he d be a sitting duck   What we re confronting with the violently acquired injury  they re going home to where they were shot  said Dr  Michelle Gittler  a physiatrist and expert on violently acquired spinal cord injuries at Schwab   They are going right back to that community where their injuries occurred and that s one of the hardest issues  After the initial shock wore off  Irizarry made immediate plans to change his life  He distanced himself from his old gang  And his family uprooted to a nearby suburb  But the impact of his injury rippled through his family  He could no longer help out financially because he could no longer work  The  400 or so he received each month in Social Security Income did little to help buoy his families expenses  And he could no longer keep his younger siblings in check   My mom  having to see me in this situation and trying not to cry every day  it hurt  Irizarry said   Even though I was the oldest I was her baby  She was there when I first started to walk  and now I d never walk again  But his injury did something no nudging before it could ve done  he was off the streets  He went back to school and began to realize  in part through his rehab work at Schwab  that life was not over  After doing his rehab at the hospital he eventually was hired as a peer mentor with In My Shoes  One of the truest signs that he d moved on  he said  was when he came face to face with someone from the same gang that had shot him  The rival wasn t menacing this go round  He wasn t chasing him or pointing a pistol in his direction  This time  they were on the same team  He was from the neighborhood and was found shot one evening behind Irizarry s father s barbershop  The rumor was that his own gang had turned on him  The man was paralyzed from the waist down and seemed as affected mentally as he was physically  He was anxious and paranoid  He d been holed up in his home and refused to go out in public or take public transportation   He was always worried about who was around  that someone was always going to try to kill him  Irizarry said  But almost every day Irizarry called the guy or they d meet up to talk  Soon  Irizarry coaxed him into riding public transportation and then  back onto the social scene  The two developed a friendship and a bond  Eventually Irizarry landed him a job fixing wheelchairs at Schwab rehab   That other stuff to me was in the past  Irizarry said  noting though that he rarely shares his former gang affiliation   It could still be dangerous in certain neighborhoods  To this day  wounded gang members are rolled into Schwab  their tough exteriors softened by their disabilities  And Irizarry  Harris and the rest of the team initiate them into this new club  Some change their ways  Some don t  Harris and Irizarry say   Some people have been doing it so long it s hard for them to break out of it  Harris said   Some say they want a way out  others say they can t find a way out  But for us  after everything we lost  whatever we were going to get out of it wasn t going to be worth what we ve already lost  Some people have been doing this so long and are afraid of change  They just fall back to what they know  Previously in msnbc s ongoing look at Chicago gun violence

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/rethinking-the-war-drugs, Monday saw two major legal developments in the so called  war on drugs  First  a judge in New York City ruled that the police department s stop and frisk policy violated the Constitution in targeting a disproportionate number of blacks and Hispanics  Then  Attorney General Eric Holder announced the end of mandatory federal prison sentences for low level  non violent drug crimes Changes in these policies will come as a reprieve for the groups that are negatively affected by them the most  In Judge Shira Scheindlin s 198 page ruling on stop and frisk Monday  she noted that 80  of the 4 4 million times the tactic had been used between 2004 and 2012  the suspect was black or Hispanic The city s highest officials have turned a blind eye to the evidence that officers are conducting stops in a racially discriminatory manner  Scheindlin wrote  As for non violent  low level drug crimes  the data has long pointed to a racial bias  In the war on marijuana specifically  black Americans are four times as likely to be arrested for possession  according to a recent report by the ACLU  Nicholas Peart  one of the plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit that challenges the procedure as racially charged  wrote about his multiple experiences of being stopped and frisked in a New York Times op ed piece   These experiences changed the way I felt about the police  After the third incident I worried when police cars drove by  I was afraid I would be stopped and searched or that something worse would happen  I dress better if I go downtown  I don t hang out with friends outside my neighborhood in Harlem as much as I used to  Essentially  I incorporated into my daily life the sense that I might find myself up against a wall or on the ground with an officer s gun at my head  It s appropriate to single out marijuana arrests because they dwarf those of other drugs  According to a report released by the FBI  a marijuana related drug arrest happened every 42 seconds in the United States in 2011  totaling 750 000 arrests for the year  That number decreased by about half in 2012  but the 354 023 marijuana related arrests still trump cocaine s 36 001 and crystal meth s 3 898  Though marijuana is legal in Washington state and Colorado  it is still considered a Schedule I drug by the Justice Department  along with heroin and MDMA  This means that even in states where it is legal  for medical or recreational use  marijuana is subject to seizure by the Drug Enforcement Administration  and its legal users and sellers are subject to arrest  Just two weeks ago  DEA officials raided several medical marijuana dispensaries in Washington state  seizing thousands of dollars worth of the drug  Mandatory minimum sentences for drug related crimes marijuana possession in particular contribute disproportionately to the country s overcrowded prison system  As Eric Holder lamented in a speech to the American Bar Association Monday  these sentences   have had a destabilizing effect on particular communities  largely poor and of color    To counteract this trend  Holder has proposed a way to leave sentencing up to the judge in question s discretion  The disproportionate number of marijuana arrests  and the disproportionate number of black American men being arrested for marijuana possession  comes to head on the streets of New York City  In 2011  NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly issued a memorandum to his officers that prohibited them from arresting people with small amounts of marijuana  unless the drug was in public display  When someone is picked out for a stop and frisk  however  they often have to turn out their pockets  potentially forcing a display concealed marijuana and making them subject to arrest under the law   I would say as much as 40  of these cases stem from illegal searches  illegal stops of our clients  and the mischarging of our clients where clients are charged with the misdemeanor of possessing marijuana in public view where they only actually possessed it in their pocket Scott Levy of the Bronx Defenders told NPR early last year  coming off a 2011 of 50 700 arrests for low level marijuana possession  Given the racially biased numbers of stop and frisk program  it s no surprise that between 2002 and 2010  87  of those arrested for marijuana possession were black or Hispanic  In fact  the ratios are just about equal  In her ruling  Judge Scheindlin didn t dismantle the stop and frist program completely  but she did appoint a monitor to ensure that officers stop racial profiling  Attorney general Holder didn t decriminalize marijuana federally  but his actions will likely result in less incarceration and shorter prison terms for low level drug offenders  Both policy changes are moderate but meaningful steps toward the end of a racially biased and  wildly counterproductive war on drugs  Peart spoke with msnbc s Lawrence O Donnell to discuss

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/my-night-krystal-ball, Tuesday night  as the world watched the election results from home  Krystal Ball and I hung out together for nearly 10 hours  She d been asked to contribute to msnbc s coverage  and I d been asked to contribute to her contributions  Translation  we were on call from 9AM  when we got in for The Cycle to 3AM  when we finally left  The Election Coverage was stocked to the brim with our network s biggest and brightest  with the main table holding our entire prime time lineup  and then some  Which meant there would be no room for us to sit around the studio  and we shouldn t expect a lot of contact from the  control room until right before they needed us  So what did we do  We kicked it  Hard  We were positioned on the 8th floor of 30 Rock  overlooking the rink  Which means we had the best view in the house of Democracy Plaza  Hundreds were gathered just below our windows  watching  hoping  and cheering  Every time a blue state was announced  the cheers were so loud  you could feel them through the walls  The energy was infectious  I found myself sitting at the end of my seat every time Rachel Maddow broke in or interrupted somebody to say she had an announcement  Who would it be   Which state   And why do you insist on telling me that everything is either too early  or too close to call  I noticed I was talking to myself  or throwing fist pumps  or dramatically flopping back into my chair  and when I realized this  I immediately glanced toward Krystal  hoping I hadn t embarrassed myself  I m a newsman  after all  But Krystal was rapt  She was having more fun than I was  In the rush of work  and information overload  and general election raucousness  I d forgotten  Krystal has lived this  She s been a candidate waiting for the votes to roll in  She s enjoyed the kind of high that can be experienced only during the culmination of long  hard work  And she s experienced the pain of that work coming up empty  Out on the ice rink  after NBC officially called a state for Romney or Obama  a couple of people scurried out to the middle of the rink  where a map had been stenciled over the ice  They d cover the state in either red or blue  and scurry off  Not too long ago  I knew the kids scurrying across the ice   they were NBC Pages  friends of mine  Now  thinking about Krystal  and what it must have been like to lose an election   I pictured her holed up in a living room  or conference room  with her advisers coloring in counties as the results came in  I imagined the disappointment  I tasted that hint of defeat creeping onto my palette  And that s when I it hit me  For months   even though I know the election is the biggest event in news   I felt somehow distanced from it  Maybe it s because it s my job  where  huge events  become normal and unspectacular  Maybe it s because I d been overloaded with ads and strategy and facts and figures  Maybe it s because mass consumption of news  and writing and reading about the world s harshest realities anesthetizes you a little more than we d like to admit  But in that moment  I realized just how invested I was in this election  They summoned us in to the studio to do a spot about 10 minutes before Ohio was called  Krystal was all set to talk about what an incredible night it was for women  From Warren to McCaskill  to the ousting of anti abortion candidates  And that s when Rachel told us it was all over  Krystal and I celebrated in a way befitting men and women of journalism  a solemn fist bump  Briefly  I thought Chris Matthews was going to take his shirt off  but no such luck  While Krystal and I were energized by the news  it seemed the rest of the room met it with a sigh of relief   It felt unfair to have to sit through such big news in stiffened silence  so we headed back to our office  with the throngs of voters singing and cheering outside  It was over an hour before our involuntary smiles relaxed  We went about piecing together the rest of the election  which seats we thought would be won and lost  sketching out what she d say when she was finally called back to the studio  Huge day for women  huge day for progressives  huge day for the gay community  huge day for marijuana aficionados  huge day for us  It was nearly three hours before she got on the air  Krystal strolled out and told everyone what an amazing night it was for women  Maybe it wasn t the headline of the evening  but momentous nonetheless  For both of us  ,11/09/12 02:41 PM,marijuana
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ending-the-drug-war-second-term, When Barack Obama sought the presidency four years ago  his to do list was as ambitious as any agenda voters had seen in a long while  As he seeks another term  the president can at least say he s had enormous success in racking up historic accomplishments But what does he do for an encore  Or more accurately  what is it the president can offer the electorate in terms of campaign promises for a second term  beyond simply vowing to protect the gains and progress we ve seen since January 2009 Obviously  immigration policy remains a top Obama priority  along with systemic changes to U S  energy policy  Marc Ambinder  however  reports on another issue of significance to the president  which generally doesn t get as much national attention According to ongoing discussions with Obama aides and associates  if the president wins a second term  he plans to tackle another American war that has so far been successful only in perpetuating more misery  the four decades of The Drug War Don t expect miracles  There is very little the president can do by himself  And pot smokers shouldn t expect the president to come out in favor of legalizing marijuana  But from his days as a state senator in Illinois  Obama has considered the Drug War to be a failure  a conflict that has exacerbated the problem of drug abuse  devastated entire communities  changed policing practices for the worse  and has led to a generation of young children  disproportionately black and minority  to grow up in dislocated homes  or in none at all Not too long ago  policymakers were afraid to touch this issue  fearing that any changes to the  drug war  would necessarily lead to the typical partisan attacks But it s clear that the political landscape has changed as American attitudes have evolved  and elected leaders with reform ideas have far less reason to be afraid of pushback In 2009  for example  Obama s choice to head the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy  Gil Kerlikowske  said the whole concept of a  war on drugs  is misguided  and called for a massive shift in emphasis away from incarceration and towards treatment  And Kerlikowske  despite this progressive perspective  was confirmed easily Ambinder added that  a consensus is emerging among academics  police officers  lawyers  and even some politicians about what not to do    which is to say  rejecting the status quo of the last few decades I realize that whatever Obama wants Republicans must reject with knee jerk vitriol  regardless of merit or common sense  but it s nevertheless good to hear that  if the president does get a second term  reforming ineffective and unproductive drug laws will at least be a top priority  ,07/03/12 10:47 AM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/billboards-battle-over-marijuana-messaging, In the run up to Superbowl XLVIII  there s some trash talking going on and this time it s nowhere near the gridiron  Reform advocates from the Marijuana Policy Project placed five billboards around MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford  N J  promoting the National Football League to ease rules restricting the use of marijuana earlier this week  One billboard reads   Marijuana is less harmful to our bodies than alcohol  Why does the league punish us for making the safer choice  Another compares the 749 824 Marijuana related arrests in 2012 to the 751 203 attendees of the last ten Super Bowls combined  Communications Director for the Marijuana Policy Project  Mason Tvert  explained the billboards in a press release   Most Americans think marijuana should be legal  and laws around the country are beginning to reflect that the NFL needs to catch up with the times  It is no longer necessary or popular to punish adults simply for using marijuana  The billboards coincide with a change org petition asking NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to end  severe penalties for using marijuana  especially in states where marijuana has been made legal for adult or medical use  Following the wide coverage of pro mariuana advertising campaign  former Rep  Patrick Kennedy s anti drug organization Project SAM  Smart Approaches to Marijuana  announced on Wednesday the group s own set of billboards to promote their goal of preventing the establishment of  Big Marijuana  The ads show a football player with the with the words  Motivation  Perseverance  Determination  paired with a marijuana leaf and the words   None of the Above  alongside the images is the message   Marijuana kills your drive  Don t lose in thegame of life  A billboard advertising the belief that marijuana is safer than alcohol or football is pictured alongside highway 495 in Secaucus  New Jersey  Jan  29  2014  Photo by Carlo Allegri Reuters A former Senior Advisor to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and member of the leadership team at Project SAM  Kevin Sabet  told msnbc that his organizations billboards present the message that   For some people marijuana saps their motivation  and that  marijuana and football don t mix  The MPP wasted no time launching a response to Project SAM s counter messaging efforts  On Thursday   just one day after Project SAMs billboards were announced   MPP issued a press release announcing their purchase of an additional two billboards that  spoof  the Project SAM ads comparing alcohol unfavorably to marijuana and criticizing Project SAM with the language   Prohibiting adults from making the safer choice is NOT a smart approach  Another ad features a statement made by Project SAM Chairman Patrick Kennedy during a recent TV appearance   I agree with the president  ALCOHOL is more dangerous  than marijuana  Mason Tvert  from the Marijuana Policy Project defended the new ads  saying   The folks working to keep marijuana illegal appear to have run out of compelling arguments  No matter who wins the battle of the billboards  medical marijuana may be making inroads to the National Football League that go beyond Denver and Seattle  In an appearance last Thursday  NFL Commissioner Goodell said that the league is open to players using medical marijuana  Speaking to the press Goodell reiterated recent comments on players using marijuana  saying   I m not a medical expert  We will obviously follow signs  We will follow medicine and if they determine this could be a proper usage in any context  we will consider that  The comments came just after HBO s Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel reported that some 50 60  of NFL players use marijuana  in many cases to treat pain sustained on the gridiron  HBO s reporting also presented research showing positive effects when mice with brain trauma were treated with marijuana  The New York Times editorial board supported Goodell s openness in a column on Thrusday  presenting evidence that marijuana is  less toxic  than other painkillers  and urging the league to allow players the flexibility to  deal with injuries  as they and their physicians see fit  Twenty states  plus Washington  D C  permit doctors to prescribe marijuana as a medicine  eleven of those states host NFL teams  A CBS poll released on Thursday found that 51  of Americans think marijuana use should be legalized and 62  feel that marijuana laws should be decided by the states  ,01/31/14 02:51 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/darren-wilson-hiding-other-criminal-cases-legal-limbo, As many as 10 criminal cases in which Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson is a witness have been thrown in limbo as Wilson remains in hiding following the Aug  9 shooting death of Michael Brown  On Monday  Wilson missed a preliminary hearing for a 2013 felony drug case  The case involved a 28 year old Christopher Brooks who earlier alleged through his lawyer that he was  roughed up  during the arrest  St  Louis County prosecutors last month asked that the case be sent to a grand jury after they realized that Wilson s testimony was central to the trial  Ed Magee  the spokesman for the St  Louis County prosecutor  told msnbc that the case was originally transferred to the grand jury on Sept  6 and that it had nothing to do with Wilson s failure to appear on Monday  Magee said that following the Brown shooting  all cases in which Wilson was a main witness had been placed on hold and that Brooks  case somehow  slipped through the cracks  and wasn t flagged at the time  During Monday s court hearing a prosecutor told St  Louis County Associate Circuit Judge Mary Bruntrager Schroder that in Wilson s absence the case would instead be taken in front of a grand jury and that it would be presented as early as Wednesday  News began to spread Monday that the case involving Brooks and Darren Wilson might be sent to a grand jury  and questions arose as to whether or not the same grand jury currently hearing evidence in the Brown case would also be hearing evidence in Brooks  case  Magee said the prosecutor s office decided shortly after the hearing to add the case to the hold pile along with the several other cases in which Wilson was involved  rather than pass it on to the grand jury as requested earlier in court   This one sort of slipped through the cracks and it was sent to the grand jury because the  prosecutor  thought they could make the case with the other officers who were at the scene but realized that they can t  Magee said   We decided to put it on the hold pile  We have to wait to see what the grand jury does on the Michael Brown case because obviously that could affect  Wilson s  credibility  Magee said the move is part of the  normal process when there s an investigation ongoing Wilson is the key witness in six cases and a secondary witness in four others  he added  A grand jury has been hearing evidence for weeks in the Brown case  in which police say Wilson shot and killed the unarmed teen after Brown reached for the officer s weapon during a struggle  But a half dozen witnesses refute those claims and say that Wilson shot at Brown as he attempted to flee and that the fatal shots came as Brown attempted to surrender with his hands up  The killing of Brown  who was black  by Wilson  who is white  has set off more than a month of protests and occasional violent clashes with police  Officer Wilson  a six year veteran of the Ferguson Police Department  received a commendation for his role in Brooks  arrest  According to a police report  first obtained by Yahoo News Wilson encountered Brooks and another man allegedly bagging up marijuana for sale while sitting in a car parked in Brooks  grandmother s driveway When the officer approached  Brooks hopped out of the car and refused to hand over the keys so that Wilson could search it   Brooks slapped my hand away  Wilson wrote in the report   Brooks was consistently yelling for his cousin  who was now on the front porch  to help him and asking him to  get me  An alleged physical encounter then ensued and Brooks  grew  increasingly hostile  Wilson said that he called for backup before gaining control  In the report  Wilson wrote that he didn t use his weapon and relied only on  hand control and the positioning of my body weight Weeks after the killing of Brown  Brooks  attorney Nick Zotos told Yahoo News that Wilson forcibly took Brooks  keys after Brooks refused to consent to a search of his vehicle After Brooks and the other man were subdued and placed in Wilson s police car  the officer reportedly got into Brooks  vehicle  where he said he found marijuana and a handful of pills  Officer Wilson later received a commendation at Ferguson City Hall for his role in the arrest  In an interview with MSNBC on Monday  Zotos declined to speak as openly about the nature of the circumstances surrounding Brooks  arrest   He made an arrest and seized some marijuana  Two guys are arrested  The physical nature of the arrest is kind of secondary to my issues  Zotos said   It s more of an interest to whatever picture people want to paint of Wilson  The police report written by Wilson suggests there was a physical altercation  that the arrest was physical in nature  That s what he writes   I m not contending anything  I m representing my client  My client believes that Wilson s conduct was inappropriate  Zotos said that he was against the case being sent to a grand jury because  in doing so  Wilson s testimony would be secret and he would not have to testify under oath   I d rather see the officer show up and be shown and asked questions under oath and be cross examined  Zotos said  Wilson has been in hiding since the shooting  though it has been reported that he has since testified before the grand jury hearing Brown s case  St  Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch originally estimated that the grand jury would return a decision on whether or not to indict Wilson in Brown s death by mid October  But in a move that has outraged some Brown supporters  McCulloch extended the jury s service until Jan  7  saying that he wanted to give jurors ample time to consider the mountain of evidence they are being presented  Protesters have called for the McCulloch to step down and for a special prosecutor to be appointed by Gov  Jay Nixon  They say McCulloch s ability to be fair and objective in prosecuting a police officer is in question because of his close ties to law enforcement  including family members who have been officers or lawyers aligned with them  His father was a police officer who was on duty when he was shot and killed by a black suspect  Protesters have demanded the prosecutor s ouster at city council meetings  marched outside of his office in nearby Clayton and even attempted to shutdown a highway in protest to his refusal to recuse himself  Critics also say that McCulloch is not aggressively pursuing charges in the case and that it s manifesting in the manner in which his office is presenting evidence to the grand jury  Typically a prosecutor will offer jurors a set of recommended charges  In this case  McCulloch has declined to do so  Instead  the grand jury is being presented with all the evidence in pieces and as the prosecutor s office receives it  rather than waiting for the county and federal probes to be completed  as is common practice  Some  including a law professor and attorneys for the family  contend the odd move is calculated  a way to create  cover  in case the grand jury decides not to indict Wilson in the racially charged  controversial shooting  Magee said prosecutors are still in the process of presenting evidence to the grand jury and that they are meeting several times a week  He said there should be no concern that the grand jury

TRAYVON EKOW N  YANKAH NEW YORK TIMES The anger felt by so many African Americans speaks to the simplest of truths  that race and law cannot be cleanly separated  We are tired of hearing that race is a conversation for another day  We are tired of pretending that  reasonable doubt  is not  in every sense of the word  colored  Every step Mr  Martin took toward the end of his too short life was defined by his race  I do not have to believe that Mr  Zimmerman is a hate filled racist to recognize that he would probably not even have noticed Mr  Martin if he had been a casually dressed white teenager  But because Mr  Martin was one of those  punks  who  always get away  as Mr  Zimmerman characterized him in a call to the police  Mr  Zimmerman felt he was justified in following him  After all  a young black man matched the criminal descriptions  not just in local police reports  but in those most firmly lodged in Mr  Zimmerman s imagination  BLACK BOYS DENIED THE RIGHT TO BE YOUNG EUGENE ROBINSON WASHINGTON POST If anyone wonders why African Americans feel so passionately about this case  it s because we know that our 17 year old sons are boys  not men    We know how frightened our sons would be  walking home alone on a rainy night and realizing they were being followed  We know how torn they would be between a child s fear and a child s immature idea of manly behavior    And we know that a skinny boy armed only with candy  no matter how big and bad he tries to seem  does not pose a mortal threat to a healthy adult man who outweighs him by 50 pounds and has had martial arts training  We know that the boy may well have threatened the man s pride but likely not his life    The conversation we need to have is about how black men  even black boys  are denied the right to be young  to be vulnerable  to make mistakes  We need to talk about why  for example  black men are no more likely than white men to smoke marijuana but nearly four times as likely to be arrested for it   and condemned to a dead end cycle of incarceration and unemployment  I call this racism  What do you call it  Trayvon Martin was fighting more than George Zimmerman that night  He was up against prejudices as old as American history  and he never had a chance  THE WHOLE SYSTEM FAILED CHARLES BLOW NEW YORK TIMES As a parent  particularly a parent of black teenage boys  I am left with the question   Now  what do I tell my boys  We used to say not to run in public because that might be seen as suspicious  like they d stolen something  But according to Zimmerman  Martin drew his suspicion at least in part because he was walking too slowly  So what do I tell my boys now  At what precise pace should a black man walk to avoid suspicion  And can they ever stop walking away  or running away  and simply stand their ground  Can they become righteously indignant without being fatally wounded  Is there any place safe enough  or any cargo innocent enough  for a black man in this country  Martin was where he was supposed to be   in a gated community   carrying candy and a canned drink  The whole system failed Martin  What prevents it from failing my children  or yours  I feel that I must tell my boys that  but I can t  It s stuck in my throat  It s an impossibly heartbreaking conversation to have  So  I sit and watch in silence  and occasionally mouth the word   breathe

education and voting rights  to name just two examples  My nearly 13 hour stand against the effort to deny women access to basic health care evolved into a people s filibuster opposing a selfish and out of touch leadership that refuses to listen to real families with real hopes  Texas really is the greatest state in the greatest nation  Texans   and women all over the country   deserve leaders

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/all/hal-rogers-kentucky-sequestration, Harlan  Kentucky   Republican Congressman Hal Rogers brought so many federal dollars home to eastern Kentucky s coal country  he was crowned  Prince of Pork  Now that spigot has been turned off  just when his district might actually need it the most  Competition from natural gas  cheaper coal  and environmental regulations have hastened the demise of the mining industry here  already in decline  More than 6 200 eastern Kentucky miners have been laid off since July 2011  There are now fewer coal jobs here than in 1920  when the great grandfathers of today s miners wielded shovels and pick axes  But sequestration a series of across the board spending cuts that many Tea Party Republicans have come to embrace and other austerity measures have accelerated the economic free fall  Unemployment benefits to laid off miners are shrinking  fewer meals are getting delivered to homebound seniors  and there s less money to help workers retool for new jobs  Beginning Friday  food stamps will be cut by an average of  36 per month for a family of four  A belt of coal on a mountainside in Harlan  KY   Photo by Peter van Agtmael Magnum for MSNBC It s yet another blow to struggling Appalachian mining towns like Harlan  where the mayor estimates that 15  of the town s residents have moved out in the past year  searching for work elsewhere  Unsold guns are piling up in pawnshops  Even the local mortician is feeling the pinch  grieving relatives are downgrading from hardwood coffins to two gauge steel  and ordering five baskets of flowers instead of twenty or thirty   If I don t sell to the coal people  I don t sell  one Harlan businessman explained  Rogers has been one of the few Republicans to slam sequestration as devastating  unworkable  and unrealistic  Unless Congress decides otherwise   109 billion in cuts will continue every year until 2021 a budget that Rogers must implement as chair of the House Appropriations Committee  But many of his Republicans colleagues have embraced the  85 billion in cuts this year as guaranteed spending cuts  It s unlikely that budget negotiations that started this week in Congress will reverse all of them  The incremental nature of sequestration  slow rolling  local  and scattered unevenly nationwide has made the belt tightening hard to measure and easy to dismiss since the cuts took effect in March   The people that I ve talked to seem to be doing well  Missouri Rep  Billy Long said in April   In fact  when I got out in restaurants here in town  people come up to me  They want to see more sequestration  not less  Even some Democrats believe the White House overhyped the cuts when it made dire predictions about their impact  some of which didn t pan out   I think they probably went over the top in terms of saying that the consequences were going to be horrible  The lines in the airports aren t long  the world hasn t changed overnight  said former Pennsylvania Gov  Ed Rendell  But Harlan sees long lines  They are in the unemployment office  filled with out of work miners chasing any rumor of jobs left to be had  A TV in the waiting area explains how federal cuts have chipped away at the safety net most had hoped they would never need   Sequestration What does that mean for you  Your Emergency Unemployment Compensation benefits that begin on or after March 31  2013 must be reduced 10 7  for each week of unemployment through September 2013   Sequestration is a terrible way to do business  I ve said it since day one  It slices the good with the bad  and removes the duty of Congress to ensure vital programs  like Head Start and various grant programs receive adequate support  Rogers told MSNBC   Couple those deep cuts with the rapid loss of coal mining jobs in eastern Kentucky and we re now facing an economic superstorm  Donnie Reeves  an unemployed coal mine worker from Harlan  KY  receives retraining in industrial maintenance so he can find a new job  Photo by Peter van Agtmael Magnum for MSNBC For Donnie Reeves  40  each passing week of unemployment means less security  He lost his mining job in March  just weeks before his wife Tiffanie lost her job as a teaching assistant   After December  it s no more unemployment  no more nothing  he said in August   I would have to work a minimum of three jobs  each 40 hours a week at minimum wage  That s to keep the lights on  No groceries  no gas  said Donnie  who made  70 000 in his best year  Donnie spent the summer retraining for a factory job through an emergency federal program spared this time from sequestration s axe  Tiffanie found a job helping unemployed Kentuckians like her husband find work  But with two teenage kids and their hometown s economy in tatters  the Reeves know that their future may lie outside Harlan  leaving behind a family rooted here for more than 120 years   Tiff  he told her last spring  when they were first considering the idea   we re giving up    For years  Kentucky politicians found funds to cushion the slow death of coal  And no one was better at it than Rogers  chairman of the powerful House appropriations committee  Since 1981  Rogers has requested more than  460 million in earmarks for the fifth district  All across eastern Kentucky  there are tributes to his largesse  Just a few hours east of Harlan  there s the Hal Rogers Appalachian Recovery Center for drug addicts  to the west  the water slides at the Hal Rogers Family Entertainment Center  And in between  the Daniel Boone National Forest  honoring the beloved frontiersman whose name nonetheless got booted off the road now called the  Hal Rogers Parkway  To Rogers s defenders  the generous projects aimed to combat the  Appalachia problem generational poverty  exploitation  and underdevelopment that s kept coal country on the margins of prosperity  poor people living in a resource rich land  according to historian Ron Eller  The unemployment rate in Rogers s fifth district is the highest in Kentucky  hitting 16  in three counties this August  That s in an area where the poverty rate is already 27 5  rising to 34  in families with children under 18   There s no question that federal funding has been vital to progress in southern and eastern Kentucky Rogers told MSNBC  citing projects to expand sewer lines  invest in infrastructure  and combat drug abuse  Just this summer  Rogers was celebrating some of the fruits of his labor  A young member of the Friendship Baptist Church congregation at Sunday services in Cawood  KY   Photo by Peter van Agtmael Magnum for MSNBC At the Harlan Girls and Boys Club in August  he praised Appalachia HIDTA  the anti drug office he created with earmarked money  to spread the word about the ever present dangers of marijuana  Another pet project was in evidence as well Eastern Kentucky PRIDE  an environmental cleanup group run by a former Rogers staffer  Both groups have been the recipients of millions in federal money  thanks to Rogers  He also secured earmarks for the infamous I 66  road to nowhere  which still hasn t been finished  and a  4 million homeland security contract for a company that hired his own son  It s precisely these kinds of projects that drove Tea Partiers to demand a ban on earmarks and more spending cuts when the GOP took over the House in 2010  Lobbying against establishment Republicans like Rogers  Tea Party freshmen pushed Congress to embrace a  2 1 trillion deficit deal in exchange for raising the debt ceiling  The law brought  900 billion in upfront cuts by imposing spending caps for the next decade  It also created a bipartisan  supercommitee  tasked with creating a  1 2 trillion deficit reduction deal by the end of 2011  But the supercommittee failed when Republicans refused to budge on revenue increases that Democrats demanded  triggering sequestration s automatic  across the board cuts  The irony is that the cuts under sequestration  that great fiscal equalizer  are hitting both the best and worst of the spending that Rogers has supported  whether it s pure pork or critical social services  The fifth district s economic woes make it clear that hundreds of millions in specially designated funds haven t been enough to wean this place away from the twin pillars of coal and government aid  That s been deeply frustrating to eastern Kentucky residents who ve seen lawmakers like Rogers bring in huge dollar projects while economic opportunities have evaporated   I m getting the hell out of Harlan County  Ain t nothing here  one jobless miner said  sitting in the town s unemployment office   What pisses me off the politicians  they have millions of dollars pumped through here in the last 50 years  Federal grants for many of Rogers s pet projects haven t been renewed since earmarks died and austerity was reborn  But money has also dried up for Meals on Wheels  which is delivering 500 fewer lunches every month in Harlan County under sequestration  according to one employee  The cuts have squeezed Title I education funding to the local high school  which laid off teachers this summer  Fewer homebound seniors are getting help to pay their bills and do their laundry    view photo essay     Life under austerity       For more than a hundred years  coal anchored families to the   Like other coal state lawmakers  Rogers believes the first priority is to stop Obama s  war on coal  lobbying against regulations like the EPA s new carbon rules for power plants  Though the president isn t likely to budge on his climate regulations  he promised in June to  give special care to people and communities that are unsettled by the transition  to cleaner energy  But so far  little extra help has arrived in eastern Kentucky  Even environmentalists who ve rallied for the end of coal acknowledge that the human cost of the transition has been too high   I find it unconscionable that these areas that have powered our rise to the greatest economy in the world are being left behind  said Matt Wasson  director of programs at Appalachian Voices  Rogers has found some common cause with Democrats by trying to bring the bacon home again at least a slice of it  Together with Kentucky s Democratic governor  Steve Beshear  Rogers backed a  5 2 million emergency federal grant for retraining laid off miners  And he is one of the few Republicans to push back against his own party on sequestration and the GOP s insistence on low spending levels even if the cuts are reversed   I believe that the House has made its choice  sequestration and its unrealistic and ill conceived discretionary cuts must be brought to an end  he said in July after House Republicans could not bring themselves to vote for the very cuts they had originally agreed to make to transportation and housing  scuttling his committee s spending bill  Not all Republicans agree even those representing Kentucky  At an August town hall in Harlan  Sen  Rand Paul hadn t even heard of the  5 2 million retraining program that helped Donnie Reeves   It s not about retraining it s about cutting the deficit  Paul said   We should spend what money comes in  At the event  one resident asked Paul how sequestration would affect his employer  the Center for Independent Living  which uses federal funds to help elderly and disabled residents take care of themselves   Our government is literally littered with waste  Paul replied  Andrew Saylor  who d posed the question  was incredulous   I m in charge of accounting  and we account for every damn thing  he replied  Paul moved onto the next question    Donnie didn t want to accept the money at first   It hurts your pride  Then Tiffanie laid out two years of tax returns   This is what we paid in  she said  showing her husband what he paid in after working 13 hour shifts  He signed up for unemployment within a week   It s a joke  but it helps  he explained  But sequestration would still cut his federal benefits if he didn t find a job by October extra help that s going to end for everyone come January  An exhibit at the Portal 31 Museum devoted to the coal mining industry in Lynch  KY  A series of animatronic figures narrate the history of coal in the region   Photo by Peter van Agtmael Magnum for MSNBC Donnie doesn t romanticize the job he s lost  Working on the mountainside  he and the other miners ran enormous  earth smashing machines the kind that split one coworker in half and took off another s head  They all ragged on each other just to keep their nerves in check   Once you see somebody get killed two or three times  you find the Lord real fast  he said  But Donnie believes he s luckier than some other miners the guys with diabetes  arthritis  and nerve pain who are too old to be retrained  too young for Social Security   Never tell your age never  ever  a career counselor told two jobless 50 somethings in Harlan  Sequestration isn t making that transition easier  Already  it s slashed federal support to Harlan s Workforce Investment Program by 16  That money could have paid for travel  equipment  and tuition for Harlan s unemployed who want to retool for another profession  But it won t be coming back unless Congress decides otherwise  Donnie s no Obama fan  but he doesn t think it s worth cutting what little Washington is doing to help   Say they cut that  retraining  program down  A guy gets laid off today we can help him write a resume but can t do anything else  It s useless  In late September  he saw that investment pay off  After more than six months of searching  he landed a job at a factory doing industrial maintenance  which he trained for over the summer with government assistance  It s three hours away  which means living apart from his family until they move to Georgetown  Kentucky but it s a job  Rogers says he s committed to finding a future for his district  announcing a summit with Gov  Beshear to find new solutions to Appalachia s economic woes a promise that Kentucky politicians have made for decades  But Harlan is still waiting for its own backup plan  Past boarded up stores  pawnshops  and an abandoned tattoo parlor  a new pizza parlor sells alcohol and memories  The walls of Portal are lined with maps of old coal camps and black and white photos of miners  Every night  it plays the same song to close   In the deep dark hills of eastern Kentucky   That s the place where I trace my bloodline   And it s there I read on a hillside

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/all-in/racial-disparities-in-marijuana-arrests-are-g, A sprawling new report from the American Civil Liberties Union argues that the war on cannabis disproportionately affects African Americans  and makes the case for ending arrests for marijuana possession  The group s 185 page study  called  The War on Marijuana in Black and White  finds that black people are 3 73 times more likely to be arrested for possession than whites even though people of both races consume marijuana at roughly the same rate  Furthermore  the racial gap in arrests actually widened between 2001 and 2010  Researchers said racial profiling and other discriminatory law enforcement practices were largely to blame   State and local governments have aggressively enforced marijuana laws selectively against black people and communities  needlessly ensnaring hundreds of thousands of people in the criminal justice system at tremendous human and financial cost  said ACLU Criminal Law Reform Project director Ezekiel Edwards in a statement accompanying the release of the report  A report by one of ACLU s state level affiliates drives home just how selectively those laws are enforced in one of the country s largest cities  A 2012 New York Civil Liberties Union report on NYPD s  stop and frisk  policy found that  in 2011  New York cops stopped and frisked 168 126 black men between the ages of 14 and 24 despite the fact that only 158 406 young black men lived in the city at that time  In other words  Over the course of a single year  the NYPD had stopped and frisked about 106  of the city s young  black  male population  The additional legal scrutiny placed on the black community has wide ranging consequences beyond the criminal justice system  As sociologists Bruce Western and Becky Pettit wrote in their 2010 paper  Incarceration and Social Inequality   PDF  the long term social and economic disadvantages of doing time in prison are  invisible  cumulative  and intergenerational  Just one example  For job seekers  having a criminal record was  found to reduce callbacks from prospective employers by around 50  and this effect was larger for blacks than whites  These results may help to explain why black white wealth inequality has risen dramatically since the 1984  Selective policing of criminal drug laws disproportionately affects African Americans  and especially black men  who are then placed at a great economic disadvantage for the rest of their lives  Their children then inherit that disadvantage  A few states have reacted by relaxing their marijuana laws considerably  In November 2012  Washington and Colorado voters approved referendums which legalized recreational marijuana use  But federal law still prohibits marijuana usage  and the Justice Department has continued to crack down on marijuana dispensaries in places where they are legal under state law  ,06/04/13 04:32 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/new-nj-battle-over-medical-marijuana, Sabina Rose Joana was 15 months old when she lost a battle to Dravet syndrome   Photo by Paula Joana There is a glimmer of hope for families of epileptic children across the country in the form of a marijuana oil  It could mean no more sleepless nights  no more emergency room visits  no more holding your breath while waiting for the next seizure to grip their child s body  But even as state lawmakers across the country pass legislation to allow the use of a marijuana extract to treat epilepsy in children  some families are discovering a new front to the fight  the battle to implement the laws in a timely manner  It s a battle Paula and Phil Joana know too well  The New Jersey couple lost their 15 month old daughter  Sabina Rose Joana  last December to a condition caused by Dravet syndrome  The Joanas were attempting to comply with New Jersey s medical marijuana laws a process that takes months between the required number of doctors to see and paperwork to complete  In order to become a registered patient with the medicinal marijuana program in New Jersey  one must be a resident of the state and must also be diagnosed with a  debilitating medical condition by a New Jersey physician registered with the medicinal marijuana program  Which is where things get complicated  in order to qualify in New Jersey  a patient must have a  bona fide relationship   defined by the State Department of Health as a doctor patient relationship existing for at least a year or for at least four visits with a doctor who is already registered with the program  If a patient s current doctor is not registered in the program  the family must find a new doctor a time consuming issue for children who are running out of time  Children like Sabina  who didn t have months or a year  and died while waiting for the treatment that may have helped her On Thursday  Paula Joana joined Hardball where she explained the struggle to treat her daughter   For pediatrics  you have to get a letter from your pediatrician  then you have to get a letter from a specialist so we got one from her neurologist  Then we had to see a psychiatrist to make sure we weren t exploiting her and her medical marijuana  Joana added   I don t understand anyone who wanted to smoke pot recreationally would go through all those hurdles just to smoke pot  Last November  a bill was put before New Jersey Gov  Chris Christie that would permit patients to receive medicinal marijuana from states with more developed medicine and less regulated programs  But Christie refused to sign it   See  this is what happens  Christie said at a Dec  2  2013 press conference where he infamously joked about  working  the cones  on the George Washington Bridge   Every time you sign one expansion  then the advocates will come back and ask for another one  Here s what the advocates want  They want legalization of marijuana in New Jersey  It will not happen on my watch  ever  I am done expanding the medical marijuana program under any circumstances  So we re done  On that same day  and in the same hour Christie gave those remarks  Sabina Rose took her last breath  READ MORE  The new faces of marijuana  I think the medical marijuana program in New Jersey is extremely broken  Joana said   Kids aren t getting what they need  the dispensaries are held up there s always a problem  Earlier this year  Joana described her attempts to reach out to Christie attempts that never succeeded He has ignored my many attempts to meet with him  Paula  who said she had liked the governor and voted for him twice before  said in an article that appeared on the Huffington Post Everyone  in his office  who answers my calls knows who I am  and they blow me off  My emails are not answered  He can ignore me and my husband but we aren t going away  and he doesn t scare us like he scares everyone who works for him  The battle to implement medicinal marijuana laws are also surfacing across states that have passed legislation on the issue  Sally Schaeffer  whose daughter Lydia had a rare genetic seizure disorder  successfully lobbied for a law in her state of Wisconsin that could help her 7 year old  State lawmakers passed the bill to legalize marijuana oil for children in April  and Gov  Scott Walker wasted no time in signing it into law  But the Schaeffers were told Lydia would not be able to receive the treatment until the fall while the law s implementation was worked out   I kept thinking to myself  we ve just got to buy Lydia some time  we ve just got to buy her some time  Sally told the Milwaukee Wisconsin Journal Sentinal   And I guess we didn t buy enough  Lydia died in her sleep on Mother s Day  less than a month after the bill was signed by Gov  Walker  In her memory  Walker renamed the law  Lydia s Law  Meanwhile  in New Jersey  the Joana family continues to fight for their cause in memory of Sabina Rose  starting The Love Nugget Foundation in order  to advocate for common sense laws to help medical advancements as well as raise funds to assist children with various form of Epilepsy  At the end of the day  they just want to see medical marijuana available to those who need it the most   Chris Christie is not against medical marijuana  Joana told msnbc   There are just so many regulations that he wants on  the law  it makes it virtually impossible  Paula and Phil Joana and their two children  Their 15 month old daughter Sabina Rose passed away in Dec  2013 after losing a battle to Dravet syndrome

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/the-new-faces-marijuana, Two years ago  Charlotte Figi was losing a lifelong battle to epilepsy Her parents were using a hospice program at home because she wasn t eating  had chronic pneumonia  and couldn t swallow water  At the age of five  Charlotte was suffering up to 50 seizures a day  Fast forward to today  Charlotte  now seven  is like any other child  She rides horses  goes to school  and plays with her twin sister and older brother Her parents say she is  99  seizure free  suffering usually one seizure a month which is under control after a few minutes   She can hike a couple of miles a day  Paige Figi  Charlotte s mother  told MSNBC   She can walk  talk  feed herself  has a normal sleep cycle and she has not taken prescription medication in two years  Charlotte s miracle Medicinal marijuana oil   We were using  medicinal marijuana  as end of life comfort measures  Figi explained  But it turned out that those measures saved Charlotte s life  The movement to legalize medicinal marijuana has a face like Charlotte s and it s a young one that s hard to ignore  Lawmakers across the country are pushing legislation to legalize marijuana oil as a treatment for children with epilepsy The marijuana extract is produced in Colorado and is designed to not produce a high  Instead  the strain has increased levels of CBD  a chemical that fights seizures  The organization the Realm of Caring developed the marijuana oil strain now known as Charlotte s Web  which was named after Charlotte Figi the first child to test the oil two years ago On average  the organization says 85  of people taking Charlotte s Web have seen a reduction in seizures  Since the development of Charlotte s Web  many parents have traveled to Colorado to treat their children  since the state law does not have a provision that allows the shipment or sale of marijuana products out of state Others have gone as far as to relocate their families to Colorado for the oil The Realm of Caring says they have 100 patients who have moved to Colorado from 43 other states  and there is a waiting list of more than 2 000 people who are willing to relocate An additional list exists of more than 4 000 Colorado residents who are waiting for the oil Doctors work with the Realm of Caring to determine each patient s dosage based on their weight  and the cost of Charlotte s Web is about 5 cents per milligram  The Figi family s monthly cost for the oil is about  180 a month  Left  Charlotte s medicine   Right  The Stanley brothers  Jon  Jared  Joel  Jesse  and Jordan  the founders of the Realm of Caring and makers of the Charlotte s Web oil  Photo by Paige Figi Currently  there is a rapid movement to legalize medicinal marijuana across the country  four states in March alone  Kentucky  Utah  Alabama  and Georgia  passed legislation to allow the use of the marijuana oil for medical purposes The fight to allow medicinal marijuana now heads to the floor of the North Carolina State Assembly  and lawmakers there are doubling down on their chances of legalizing with two bills up for consideration When the assembly reconvenes next month  it will consider one bill to legalize all forms of medicinal marijuana and another that focuses solely on the cannabis oil for the treatment of epilepsy   There seems to be a sense that something has got to happen  said State Rep  Kelly Alexander  who is sponsoring the bill for medicinal marijuana This is a bipartisan measure to find a way to alleviate the pain and suffering of those with illnesses  Alexander spoke on behalf of his bill when it was introduced to the North Carolina General Assembly last year  but it was placed on an  unfavorable report  and put on hold State Rep  Jonathan Jordan told the High Country Press that he was not likely to support the bill unless he saw evidence of the success of medicinal marijuana  and State Rep  Paul Stam told WRAL in Raleigh   We did it to be done with it so people could move on for the session  Stam claimed lawmakers were being harassed by emails and phone calls in regards to the bill MSNBC reached out to Stam  who declined to comment for this article  But lawmakers who support marijuana legislation could see an advantage at the polls in November  In a recent George Washington University poll  39  of surveyed voters say they would be more likely to vote if there was a proposal on the ballot to legalize marijuana An additional 30  of those surveyed said they would be more likely to vote in the 2014 midterm election under that circumstance  Americans also seem to be more open overall to changing marijuana laws Plans to legalize marijuana show a 73  approval rating while decriminalizing the possession of pot has a 53  approval rating  Charlotte and Paige Figi  Photo by Paige Figi Paige Figi said the opposition in states like North Carolina was based on preconceived notions about the damages of marijuana as a whole   Some states are very conservative and just won t allow cultivation because they can t figure out a way to regulate it  Figi said   There are no negative side effects  absolutely none  THC has shown long term cognitive loss  but that s not in this oil  Recently  the Realm of Caring began cultivating Charlotte s Web in the form of hemp  which can be dispersed to a wider population The organization is continuing its work to expand the legalization of medicinal marijuana to other states  sharing Charlotte s story as a means to give hope to the families of epileptic children   We had a DNR  do not resuscitate  signed  Figi recalled   Nobody thought  Charlotte  had any time left and now she is doing amazingly well  Close video       Hardball with Chris Matthews  5 14 14  8 19 PM ET       The new

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/christie-judge-rules-against-panel-probing-bridgegate, In a blow to the New Jersey legislative committee investigating the George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal  a state judge ruled Wednesday that two central figures involved in the scheme do not have to turn over related documents  Bridget Anne Kelly  Christie s former deputy chief of staff  and Bill Stepien  Christie s former two time campaign manager  fought subpoenas issued by the state panel  Both invoked the Fifth Amendment  insisting that handing over any information to the committee looking into the September 2013 lane closures would violate their rights against self incrimination  State Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson said in her 98 page opinion that the subpoenas were too broad and that Stepien and Kelly could indeed self incriminate themselves if they turn in material  There is an ongoing  parallel federal investigation into the scandal  Close video       Hardball with Chris Matthews  4 9 14  8 13 PM ET       Christie s political bridges falling down       The legislative committee investigating the George Washington Bridge lane closures lost its bid to force two key figures in the scandal to comply with subpoenas for documents  Chris Cillizza and Anna Palmer discuss    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss  It is reasonable for Mr  Stepien and Ms  Kelly to fear that they currently face the hazard of prosecution in the concurrent federal investigation  wrote Jacobson  The decision is likely to be appealed   The committee will consult with its counsel and consider its options  said Democratic state Assemblyman John Wisniewski  who is co chairing the state investigatory panel  He added   The committee felt it was very much in the public interest to seek to compel the production of these documents  but as we ve said before  there s more than one method to gather information in an investigation  and we will consider alternatives  We will continue exploring every avenue to find out what happened with this threat to public safety and abuse of government power  Kelly was fired by Christie in January after e mails were made public showing she sent a now infamous message in August to former Port Authority official David Wildstein  writing  Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee  The message apparently kicked off the lane closures Separate documents showed Stepien calling the mayor of Fort Lee   on the New Jersey side of the bridge   an  idiot and suggest he may have been aware of the plan to close the lanes  The judge s decision was handed down shortly after Christie wound up a friendly town hall in Fairfield  N J  Unlike several previous town halls  there were no hecklers  The only time the scandal over the closure of the George Washington Bridge access lanes came up was when one person asked who was paying for Wildstein s lawyers Christie said he didn t know but was positive it wasn t the state  A newly emboldened Christie has been making himself more available to the media after an internal review   authorized by the governor and reportedly costing state taxpayers more than  1 million   cleared him of any wrongdoing relating the lane closure scandal last September  The internal review also concluded that there was no evidence to support Democratic Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer s claims that members of Christie s administration threatened to withhold Hurricane Sandy funds unless she supported a real estate development project  But so called  Bridgegate  isn t necessarily in Christie s rearview mirror  The state panel said on Tuesday that it will give Team Christie s law firm  Gibson  Dunn   Crutcher  until the end of next week to hand over documents related to their own review before facing a subpoena of their own  Given Jacobson s decision  however  it is not clear if the law firm would have to abide  The internal report  released two weeks ago  cites interviews with 70 people  blames Wildstein and Kelly for the scheme  which was seemingly an act of political retribution  Meanwhile  there are also reports that Wildstein has been meeting with federal investigators conducting their own review  U S  Attorney Paul Fishman s office told msnbc it would not comment on ongoing investigations and multiple requests for comment from Wildstein s lawyer were not returned  Christie   who once led the pack in the nascent race to be the GOP s presidential nominee in 2016   has consistently denied knowing about the lane closure plan  A new Rutgers Eagleton poll released Tuesday showed that Christie s approval ratings  which were in free fall  have stabilized  hovering at 55  Meanwhile  41  disapprove  However  the survey showed the majority   63    said Christie s own internal review was not objective  Just 22  believe Christie s explanation of what happened  The town hall audience at the Winston Churchill Elementary School in Fairfield was receptive to Christie  The governor fielded questions on several subjects  including the state s ballooning pension system  medicinal marijuana  the governor is willing to consider changes to make sure the right form of the drug is medically available for minors  and why he vetoed raising the minimum wage  it was  too much  too soon  Despite the controversies  the governor has kept up with an ambitious national schedule  appearing at conservative events and fundraising for the Republican Governors Association  which he chairs  Next month  Christie will attend a Jewish philanthropy event in New York City alongside Republican mega donor Sheldon Adelson  Last month  the governor came under scrutiny when he was at an event with Adelson in Las Vegas for a Republican Jewish Coalition event  Chrsitie referred to the settlements in the West Bank as  occupied territories  and later apologized privately to Adelson  ,04/09/14 05:41 PM,marijuana

interview with The Cycle s Ari Melber  Attorney Gen  Eric Holder weighed in on charges against NSA leaker Edward Snowden  the legality of marijuana  and his legacy of moving from over incarceration to rehabilitation    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss Ronald Taucher  an Air Force veteran  was back in federal court last week  Unlike his past court appearances  however  when Taucher battled alcohol abuse and risked going to jail  now he was celebrating his graduation  Taucher completed a new program that offers veterans struggling with substance abuse a chance at rehabilitation rather than prison  Along with four other veterans  Taucher stood before magistrate Judge Michael Urbanksi in a Veterans Court in Roanoke  Virginia   It is nice to have a happy occasion in federal court  Judge Urbanksi told the program graduates   We don t see many of those  It is just the second such federal court in the nation  In an interview with msnbc  Taucher credited the court for offering him rehab instead of a jail cell   When you see a judge and he gives you an opportunity  he said   you better take it  The courtroom was filled with friends  family  veterans  advocates  and an unusual observer for a local proceeding   Attorney General Eric Holder   The program that we re here to celebrate today provides a lot for preventing recidivism  reducing relapses  and empowering veterans convicted of certain non violent crimes to join their communities as productive  law abiding members of society  Holder told the court  For decades  criminologists have documented how the incarcerated veteran population is largely a result of ex service members  substance abuse and mental health issues  There are about 140 000 veterans in American jails today  according to the Justice Department  and 60  have substance abuse problems  About 25  were inebriated at the time of the violation that landed them in prison  Experts say many are  self medicating  countering the strains of their service   PTSD  emotional stress  mental fatigue  family disruption   with drugs or alcohol   A 2008 Rand study estimated that 18 5  of returning Iraq and Afghanistan vets screened positive for PTSD or depression  The incarceration rates also reflect broader trends in criminal justice policy  since the federal government  and most states  typically address substance abuse with jail time  not rehabilitation  Courts for veterans For veterans  that approach first began to change a bit in 2006    Robert Russell  a New York state judge  was overseeing mental health treatment for a Vietnam veteran in his Buffalo courtroom  It was a sad and familiar case  The veteran would attend the required sessions  but failed to participate or engage  Judge Russell recalls how the man  strongly built and six feet four inches tall  would slump  defeated  in the courtroom  He avoided eye contact  Nothing was getting through  So Judge Russell asked one of his staff  a Vietnam veteran who served in the 82nd Airborne  to go talk with the man during a recess   Is there something we could do  Judge Russell recalls thinking   How do we motivate him  They returned after twenty minutes  and to Judge Russell  it looked like a different person entered the courtroom   There was a remarkable distinguishing difference in this veteran s disposition  he recalled in an interview with msnbc this week   Standing erect   at what they call  parade rest  which is part of the military culture  your feet slightly apart  hands cupped in the back   and he looked at me  eye to eye  and he said   Judge  I m gonna try harder  The shift made an immediate impact on Judge Russell   I was totally amazed  he said  noting how a few minutes talking with a fellow veteran apparently awakened the man  enabling him to  tap into part of his military culture  and embrace self improvement  Judge Russell recalls asking his staff   What the heck did y all do  The answer was simple   They discussed commonality   where they served in Vietnam   and after they had a discussion about their military service  he recounted   they addressed that they wanted him to get better  Judge Russell began trying to develop a model  based on rehab success in dedicated drug courts  to address the particular challenges facing veterans  He reached out to the local V A  hospital  which provided volunteer veteran mentors for the program  As a start  Judge Russell recalls  he set aside aside one day a week for cases of  veterans suffering from mental health disorders or substance abuse  It worked  After formally beginning in 2008  states around the country launched their own veterans courts  There are over 130 today    On average  they are far more successful than jailing drug offenders   70  of enrolled veterans successfully complete the program  and 75  are not arrested within the following two years  Russell is pleasantly  surprised  that his experiment swiftly become a national model   and he welcomed the interest from the Obama administration   It s tremendous for the federal government to have the understanding of the needs of our veterans  he said   and the attorney general  and for some of my fed colleagues  having the desire to start up courts like this  New Department of Justice policy Holder  who talked about his cousin s Vietnam service when he visited the Virginia court  is advancing more federal veterans courts as part of his  Smart on Crime  reforms   There s a crying need for more of these kind of efforts  he said last week  stressing the special bond with veterans   It was once said that so many owe so much to so few  he said   we owe them in the most profound of ways  Under Holder  official Department of Justice policy now states that veterans get  involved in the criminal justice system with co occurring substance abuse and mental health issues    they risk going to prison because of drugs and strain from their service  basically   The Department encourages Veterans Courts as a rehabilitation model  noting they better serve  veterans struggling with addiction  serious mental illness  and PTSD  problems associated with  higher rates of drug abuse  domestic violence and other criminality  Since Holder took office in 2009  a dedicated Justice department program has advanced training and a national curriculum for Veterans Courts  in coordination with the Veterans Affairs Department  The attorney general is also calling for more federal Veterans Courts like the one in Virginia    In an interview for msnbc s  Presumed Guilty  series last week  Holder stressed that even beyond the improved recidivism rates  he views these reforms as a matter of principle   It s morally the right thing to do  he said  contending that these reforms make the criminal justice system more  fair  and better equipped to  act in proportionate ways  based on the conduct and situation of each defendant  Taucher  the Air Force veteran who graduated from the Veterans Court Holder visited  clearly agreed   Without a doubt  he says   a second chance is what a lot of us need   ,01/29/14 05:30 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/holder-punts-potagain, Attorney General Eric Holder received support from a wide swath of the political spectrum after announcing the Department of Justice s new position on mandatory minimum drug sentencing Monday  But some sensed a lost opportunity for the federal government to clarify its relationship with the twenty states that have legalized medical marijuana  especially Colorado and Washington  where full adult legalization has been in place since voters passed ballot initiatives last November  Holder failed to address marijuana at all in his first major statement on drug policy since his March appearance at the Senate Judiciary committee  when he said that the Obama administration was  still considering  its response to the Washington and Colorado legalization    The attorney general missed an opportunity to address the single most pressing drug reform issue in the country  and that s reforming our cannabis laws  Steve DeAngelo  a marijuana advocate  said to The Huffington Post  There are currently two bills in Congress addressing marijuana reform  H R  499 The Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2013 would do pretty much exactly what the title implies  remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act  Since being introduced into the House in February  The bill was kicked around to no fewer than nine committees and subcommittees until it ended up in the Subcommittee on Crime  Terrorism  Homeland Security  and Investigations  where it has floundered for the past six months  The second bill  H R  1523 The Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2013 is less ambitious  The bill would amend the Controlled Substance Act to make it not apply to anyone  acting in compliance with state laws  relating to marijuana  Three of the bill s 19 sponsors are Republican  lending a bipartisan edge to the legislation that similar bills have lacked  But prospects for the bill don t look much more promising  it has has languished in the same committee as H R  499 since late April  This year alone the Drug Enforcement Agency has raided medical marijuana dispensaries in California  Washington  and Michigan with SWAT teams and military style gear  A report released in June by Americans for Safe Access claims that the DEA has spent more than  200 million on medical marijuana raids since Barack Obama assumed the presidency  California became the first state to legalize medical marijuana in 1996  an opinion poll conducted by the Pew Research Center in April found for the first time that a majority of Americans now support legalizing marijuana  ,08/14/13 01:25 PM,marijuana
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/life-imprisonment-aclu-report, Thousands of people convicted of non violent crimes are serving life sentences  according to a new report by the American Civil Liberties Union  There are currently 3 278 people who have been sentenced to life without parole for crimes as small as selling less than  10 worth of marijuana and shoplifting  The report also found that it will cost nearly  2 billion to keep those inmates incarcerated until their deaths  At a time when state and local governments are desperately trying to reduce their populations of non violent offenders in order to reduce strain on overcrowded facilities and cut spending  these prisoners are a reminder of the much harsher  tough on crime  era of the 1980s and 1990s  As is the case throughout the country and within the federal prison system   the home of two thirds of those prisoners serving life sentences without parole   black prisoners far outnumber white prisoners  A black person is about 20 times more likely than a white person to be sentenced to life without parole in the federal system  the study found  In Lousiana  a full 91 4  of those serving life without parole for nonviolent crimes are black  Life sentences without the possibility of parole are given out for a variety of reasons  but the ACLU s analysis points to a combination of mandatory minimums and three  and four strike rules for crimes regardless of their severity that even judges and corrections officers involved in some of the cases highlighted found too harsh  In one case study in the report  a prisoner named Paul Carter was sentenced to life after being arrested with a bottle cap with trace amounts of heroin so miniscule it could not be weighed by police  In another case  Ronnie Chester was given a life sentence as a  habitual offender  in Louisiana afer he was arrested for possession of stolen tools he sold for  30  Another report released last week by the Urban Institute also pointed to harsh sentencing laws as one of the drivers of prison population growth and a major reason for massive overcrowding at federal Bureau of Prisons facilities  That study recommended a number of ways to reduce prison popluations  including allowing for greater judicial discretion in sentencing and eliminating mandatory minimums  The Department of Justice has made some small strides toward changing the way it deals with non violent drug offenses in the future  Attorney General Eric Holder announced in August that he was recommending new guidelines for dealing with certain drug related crimes  However  these would not apply retroactively to the men and women counted in the ACLU report  Poll  What are better ways than life imprisonment to deal with non violent offenders   ,11/13/13 06:15 PM,marijuana

acknowledging that it was ordered to stop scooping up thousands of Internet communications from Americans with no connection to terrorism   a practice it says was an unintended consequence when it gathered bundles of Internet traffic connected to terror suspects One of the documents that intelligence officials released Wednesday came because a court ordered the National Security Agency to do so  But it s also part of the administration s response to the leaks by analyst turned fugitive Edward Snowden  who revealed that the NSA s spying programs went further and gathered millions more

consternation among colleges  and  shows a plan to rate colleges before the 2015 school year based on measures like tuition  graduation rates  debt and earnings of graduates  and the percentage of

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe-sits-down-radley-balko, Cheye Calvo only intended to be home long enough to grab a bite to eat and walk his dogs  Calvo worked full time at an educational foundation in Washington  DC  but he also had an unusual part time job  he was mayor of the small town of Berwyn Heights  Maryland  In 2004  at age thirty three  he was the youngest elected mayor in the history of Prince George s County  Maryland  Now thirty seven  he lived with his wife  Trinity Tomsic  her mother  Georgia Porter  and their two black labradors  Payton and Chase  Calvo was due back in town later that night for a community meeting  As Calvo took the dogs out for a walk the evening of July 29  2008  his mother in law told him that a package had been delivered a few minutes earlier  He figured it was something he had ordered for his garden   On the walk  I noticed a few black SUVs in the neighborhood  but thought little of it except to wave to the drivers  he would later recall  When Calvo and the dogs returned  he picked up the package  brought it inside  then went upstairs to change for his meeting  The next thing Calvo remembers is the sound of his mother in law screaming  He ran to the window and saw heavily armed men clad in black rushing his front door  Next came the explosion  He d later learn that this was when the police blew open his front door  Then there was gunfire  Then boots stomping the floor  Then more gunfire  Calvo  still in his boxers  screamed   I m upstairs  please don t shoot  He was instructed to walk downstairs with his hands in the air  the muzzles of two guns pointed directly at him  He still didn t know it was the police  He described what happened next at a Cato Institute forum six weeks later   At the bottom of the stairs  they bound my hands  pulled me across the living room  and forced me to kneel on the floor in front of my broken door  I thought it was a home invasion  I was fearful that I was about to be executed  I later asked Calvo what might have happened if he d had a gun in his home for self defense  His answer   I d be dead  In another interview  he would add   The worst thing I could have done was defend my home  Calvo s mother in law was face down on the kitchen floor  the tomato artichoke sauce she was preparing still sitting on the stove  Her first scream came when one of the SWAT officers pointed his gun at her from the other side of the window  The police department would later argue that her scream gave them the authority to enter the home without knocking  announcing themselves  and waiting for someone to let them in  Rather than obeying the SWAT team demands to  get down  as they rushed in  Georgia Porter simply froze with fear  They pried the spoon from her hand  put a gun to her head  and shoved her to the floor  They asked   Where are they  Where are they  She had no idea what they were talking about  She told them to look in the basement  She would later tell the Washington Post   If somebody puts a gun to your head and asks you a question  you better come up with an answer  Then I shut my eyes  Oh  God  I thought they were going to shoot me next  Calvo s dogs Payton and Chase were dead by the time Calvo was escorted to the kitchen  Payton had been shot in the face almost as soon as the police entered the home  One bullet went all the way through him and lodged in a radiator  missing Porter by only a couple of feet  Chase ran  The cops shot him once  from the back  then chased him into the living room and shot him again  Calvo was turned around and put on his knees in front of the door the police had just smashed to pieces  He heard them rummaging through his house  tossing drawers  emptying cabinets  Calvo and Porter were held for four hours  Calvo asked to see a search warrant  He was told it was  en route  The police continued to search the house  At one point  a detective got excited when she found an envelope stuffed with cash  According to Porter  the detective was deflated when she found only  68 inside and noticed that the front of the envelope read   Yard Sale  At one point  Porter overheard a detective call to ask a relative to schedule a veterinary appointment  The sight of the dogs  bodies apparently reminded her that she need to make an appointment for her own pet  Even after they realized they had just mistakenly raided the mayor s house  the officers didn t apologize to Calvo or Porter  Instead  they told Calvo that they were both  parties of interest  and that they should consider themselves lucky they weren t arrested  Calvo in particular  they said  was still under suspicion because when armed men blew open his door  killed his dogs  and pointed their guns at him and his mother in law  he hadn t responded  in a typical manner  Trinity Tomsic came home about an hour later to find a blur of flashing police lights and a crowd gathering on her front lawn  She was told that her husband and mother were fine  Then she was told that her dogs were dead  She broke down in tears  When she was finally able to enter her home  she found her dogs  blood all over her house  The police had walked through the two large pools of blood that collected under Payton and Chase  then tracked it all over the home  Even once the police realized they had made a mistake  they never offered to clean up the blood  to put the house back together  or to fix the front door  As Calvo and Porter were being interrogated  one of Calvo s own police officers saw the lights and stopped to see what was going on  Berwyn Heights officer Amir Johnson knew this was his mayor s house  but had no idea what the commotion was about because the Prince George s County Police Department hadn t bothered to contact the Berwyn Heights police chief  as they were required to do under a memorandum of understanding between the two agencies  Johnson told the Washington Post that an officer at the scene told him   The guy in there is crazy  He says he is the mayor of Berwyn Heights  Johnson replied   That is the mayor of Berwyn Heights  Johnson then called Berwyn Heights police chief Patrick Murphy  Eventually  Murphy was put in touch with the supervising officer  Det  Sgt  David Martini  Murphy recounted the conversation to the Post   Martini tells me that when the SWAT team came to the door  the mayor met them at the door  opened it partially  saw who it was  and then tried to slam the door on them  Murphy recalled   And that at that point  Martini claimed  they had to force entry  the dogs took aggressive stances  and they were shot  If that indeed was what Martini told Murphy  he was either lying or repeating a lie told to him by one of his subordinates  There was never any further mention of Calvo shutting the door on the SWAT team because it never happened  Calvo later had his dogs autopsied the trajectories the bullets took through the dogs  bodies weren t consistent with the SWAT team s story  But the lies  obfuscations  and stonewalling were only beginning  The police department would first claim that they had obtained a no knock warrant for the raid  They then backtracked and blamed Calvo s mother in law  arguing that when her scream blew their cover  they were no longer obligated to knock and announce themselves   This was an interesting theory  given that the knock and announce requirement  by definition  would have required them to blow their own cover  That s the point of the requirement  Maj  Mark Magaw  commander of the Prince George s County narcotics enforcement division  claimed that the SWAT team couldn t have obtained a no knock warrant if they had wanted to  because the state of Maryland doesn t allow them  This too was false  The state had passed a bill allowing for no knock warrants in 2005  It s the sort of law that one would think would have a day to day impact on the drug unit of a police department that conducts several raids each week  Yet the head narcotics unit in Prince George s County was completely ignorant of it  Three years later  Magaw would be promoted to Prince George s County police chief  The affidavit for the search warrant was prepared by Det  Shawn Scarlata  It is incredibly thin  In a few paragraphs  Scarlata relates that he intercepted a FedEx package containing thirty two pounds of marijuana at one of the company s warehouses  The package was addressed to Trinity Tomsic at her home address  A police officer disguised as a delivery man then took the package to Calvo s house  where it was accepted by Georgia Porter  There was also a one paragraph description of Calvo s home  That s the only information in the warrant specific to Calvo and his family  The remainder of the six page affidavit is a cut and paste recitation of Scarlata s training  qualifications  and assumptions he felt he could make based on his experience as a narcotics officer  As Calvo described the warrant in an online chat   It talks about all the stuff a drug trafficker should have in his or her home and then says something like   Although we know that the police have no evidence of these things  they can be inferred from the very nature of the charge  It is circular reasoning that says because we are suspicious of you  there must be evidence of your guilt  On August 7  police arrested a FedEx driver and an accomplice and charged them with various crimes related to drug trafficking  Trinity Tomsic was never supposed to receive that package of marijuana  A drug distributor in Arizona had used her address to get the package into the general Prince George s County area  at which point an accomplice working for the delivery company was supposed to intercept it  The police had found several similar packages  Worse  county police knew the scheme was going on and knew some packages had been delivered to residences unbeknownst to the people who lived in them  The Washington Post reported a couple of months later on cases in which innocent people had been arrested   Defense lawyers who practice in the county said authorities appear to arrest and charge anyone who picks up a package containing marijuana without conducting a further investigation  the Post reported   The more I think about that  the angrier I get  Calvo later told Post columnist Marc Fisher   They knew this scheme was going

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/holder-pushes-criminal-justice-overhaul, When it comes to progressive causes  Attorney General Eric Holder has been quite busy  Over the weekend  for example  he unveiled  a bold effort by his department to eliminate the distinction between same sex and opposite sex married couples in the federal justice system  Yesterday he issued instructions declaring that it is the Justice Department s policy  to recognize lawful same sex marriages as broadly as possible  and  treat all individuals equally regardless of sexual orientation    Holder is fighting against conservative restrictions on voting rights  He s allowing Colorado and the state of Washington to pursue marijuana legalization  He s fighting for sentencing reforms  He s combating  Stand Your Ground  laws    If the Attorney General retires at the end of the year  as is widely rumored  Holder will depart as arguably the most underrated champion of the progressive agenda to serve in his office in recent memory    And as Adam Serwer noted this morning  Holder s not done  Disenfranchisement of the formerly incarcerated is unnecessary  unjust and counterproductive  Attorney General Eric Holder told an audience at the Georgetown University Law Center on Tuesday     At worst  these laws  with their disparate impact on minority communities  echo policies enacted during a deeply troubled period in America s past   a time of post Civil War discrimination  Holder said   And they have their roots in centuries old conceptions of justice that were too often based on exclusion  animus and fear    Holder s remarks were made at a bipartisan criminal justice symposium held by the Leadership Conference for Civil and Human Rights  Good for Holder  This is an important issue that too often gets ignored  largely because we re talking about the loss of voting rights for ex cons with no meaningful political capital    But as Ari Melber explained a few months ago  the number of affected Americans is considerable  When the votes are tallied in Virginia s race for governor on Tuesday  over 300 000 citizens will be missing from the voting rolls   including 20  of the state s black population  The reason is not low turnout or voter ID  but a growing and often invisible barrier to voting that is upending elections around the country    Over 5 million Americans are barred from voting because they have criminal records  according to a report this year from the Sentencing Project    The crackdown on ballot access is so intense  a majority of states actually bar former convicts from voting even after they are released from prison    If voting rights were restored to those former inmates  about 4 3 million more Americans would be able to vote  That is over three times margin of victory in the last House midterm elections  The issue has started to generate attention from policymakers  and the debate doesn t always fall neatly along partisan lines   for example  Sen  Rand Paul  R Ky  to his credit  supports the restoration of voting rights to ex cons    The more leading officials like Holder can keep the conversation advancing forward  the better    ,02/11/14 12:56 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/new-york-age-criminal-responsibility, Now that the federal courts have spoken on  stop and frisk  many people think teens in our community have less to fear from the criminal justice system Unfortunately  it is not that simple  Far worse can happen to a child after being stopped  In his State of the State address Wednesday  New York Gov  Andrew Cuomo said what needed to be said  New York s juvenile justice laws are outdated  Every year  almost 50 000 16  and 17 year olds are prosecuted as adults in New York State  and more than three quarters of these charges are for misdemeanors like shoplifting and marijuana possession  Some 70  of the children arrested are black or Latino  as well as 80  of those incarcerated  As Cuomo reminded us  now is the time for a change  The New York State Legislature needs to Raise the Age of criminal responsibility  and they need to do it this year  Teens are far from perfect  and they certainly are not always innocent  That s part of growing up  A teen s brain develops well into his or her 20s  and as cognitive skills improve  so does impulse control  As a result  teens are often unable to focus on the consequences of their behavior  But there are benefits  too  As their character and personalities change  teens are highly receptive to influence and intervention  Far more than adults  they can unlearn delinquent behavior  respond to interventions  and learn to make responsible choices  Study after study affirms this  So what happens when a child makes a mistake   a serious one  like shoplifting  What happens when a minor is stopped and frisked and found in possession of marijuana  One woman  who is affiliated with the group Families Together  recounted at a press conference how her 16 year old grandson was charged with second degree robbery  a felony charge  for allegedly stealing Chinese food from a delivery car  He was sentenced to 18 months in adult prison where he was sexually assaulted by an older inmate  Though his record is sealed  he is currently being treated for trauma and schizophrenia and may never return to a normal life  Tired of such tragedies  legislators in statehouses across the country have worked to reverse ineffective  destructive and expensive  tough on crime  laws that treat children as adults  Yet despite significant recent reforms in New York s youth criminal justice system  New York is one of only two remaining states  the other is North Carolina  whose laws define the age of criminal responsibility as 16  Elsewhere  everyone from  Right on Crime  conservatives to children s advocates to criminal justice experts agrees that youth who go through the juvenile justice system are less likely to commit crimes when they get out than youth who go through the adult system  From arrest to cell  the experience of being prosecuted as an adult does violence to the life of a child  Parents are not notified of court proceedings or even of the arrest itself  Children can be questioned without parental consent or presence  They are held in adult correctional facilities where they share rooms with real adults  the kind who put them at high risk for both sexual abuse and violence  Perhaps because of this  corrections officers often place children in solitary confinement  trading one kind of violence for another  the documented emotional damage that comes from prolonged isolation  Is it any surprise that compared to their counterparts in juvenile facilities  these children are 36 times more likely to take their own lives  Even after a child is released  the nightmare continues  A child who spent time in the adult system may lose their right to vote  They are often stuck with unsealed criminal records which prevent them from getting work or student loans  prevent them from living in public housing  or prevent their families from housing subsidies  It s not hard to imagine how this has the potential to drive families apart  In the end  what do we have to show for this  tough on crime  approach  Children held in adult facilities are 34  more likely to be arrested again for committing more crimes  This only serves to make our communities   particularly Black and Latino communities   less safe  Children are different from adults as the Supreme Court has concluded three times since 2005  We can no longer sentence children to death  Neither can we throw away the key on teens by imposing life without parole sentences for non homicide offenses  Nor can we forgo judicial discretion and impose mandatory life without parole sentences on child offenders  We should not be allowed to sentence children as adults  either  New York is shamefully out of step with the national consensus on this issue  We look forward to seeing the results of Cuomo s forthcoming commission on juvenile justice  which will hopefully include individuals who were incarcerated as youth  The state legislature should follow his lead and pass a bill to Raise the Age this year  We hope they do so before even more lives are ruined  Benjamin Todd Jealous is the former President and CEO of the NAACP  Rosario

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/why-the-medical-marijuana-industry-opposes, Marijuana legalization advocates won some major victories in the last election  but a new report from Politico is spotlighting the divisions within a still emergent industry  Legal marijuana vending appears to be splitting into two camps  medical and recreational  Though both sides have fought the federal law which still classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 illegal drug  medical marijuana dispensary owners have a financial interest in keeping their selling rights exclusive  As Byron Tau reports in Politico  this has driven some in the medical marijuana industry to fight with authorities against further legalization  Legal in 18 states  medical marijuana has had a big head start on recreational marijuana  which became legal in Washington State and Colorado only last year  and is yet to be fully implemented in either  Since California became the first state to legalize medical marijuana in 1996  the industry has ballooned  This is thanks in part to medical marijuana s virtual monopoly on legal selling rights  which keeps prices high because of scarcity and lack of competition  In Maine  for example  where medical marijuana was legalized in 1999  a proposed measure to legalize the possession of small amounts of pot by sending the issue to statewide referendum failed to pass in the legislature by a handful of votes earlier this year  One of the measure s key opponents was the Medical Marijuana Caregivers of Maine  MMCM   The main objections came from the fact that the bill was not built around Maine s medical marijuana industry  lobbyist for the group Paul McCarrier told Politico   Philosophically  we re not opposed to the decriminalization of marijuana  but the devil is in the details  The bill was not only going to legalize the possession of up to 2 5 ounces  or six plants  of marijuana  it was also going to grant licenses to cultivators  retailers  and laboratories  McCarrier told the Morning Sentinel when the measure was still pending that the bill threatened to put Maine s medical marijuana industry out of business by being preferential to recreational dispensaries over caregivers who give the drug to small groups of patients  Full legalization advocates see the MMCM s objections as purely self serving There are people who are benefiting financially and would prefer to see nothing change that  said Erik Altieri  northeast communications direct for National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws  NORML  As it stands  the U S  marijuana market  legal and illegal  is a  30 billion dollar industry  according to a March study from the Oregon Law Review  If allowed to be farmed professionally  says the study  that  30 billion worth of pot could be manufactured  on the order of  100 million  or something like  20 per pound  which is about one percent of the current amount paid to illicit marijuana growers in the United States Simply put  state revenues from legal pot could be enormous  So could profits to medical marijuana dispensary owners if they can keep other players out of the game  With the legalization of marijuana for recreational use  more dispensaries mean more competition means lower prices  Maine isn t the only state to experience infighting among marijuana advocates  The Cannabis Action Coalition s executive director Steve Zarich opposed Washington State s 2012 ballot measure  And though efforts to stop legalization were unsuccessful in Colorado  existing dispensaries were granted the privilege of turning themselves into recreational shops before others could apply for licenses   It is a necessary but fascinating footnote in history that some of the most active opposition is oddly coming from those who are fellow travelers of the road  shall we say those who enjoy and use marijuana  be it for medical reasons or recreational  director of NORML Allen St  Pierre said in April  But both sides have a common enemy  Federal law still puts anyone who grows  sells  or possesses marijuana in danger of arrest  Though Attorney General Eric Holder said in 2009 that  it will not be a priority to use federal resources to prosecute patients with serious illnesses or their caregivers who are complying with state laws on medical marijuana  the Drug Enforcement Administration  DEA  is still making raids  Just last Wednesday  DEA officials raided several dispensaries in Washington State  NBC News reported  seizing business records and thousands of dollars worth of medical marijuana  ,07/29/13 11:07 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/researchers-more-2000-false-convi, In 1984  two North Carolina girls  age 4 and 6  were molested  They told police their abuser was Sylvester Smith  who was dating the mother of one of the girls  and he went to prison for the crime Twenty years later the victims recanted  saying their grandmother told them to blame Smith  and his conviction was overturned But the person they say who really molested them   their cousin  who was nine at the time   could not be prosecuted because he was under age at the time of the alleged crime He is  however serving a life sentence for another crime he committed in the meantime  murder Smith s case illustrates the fallout from false convictions  He lost roughly 20 years of his life to prison  while the alleged perpetrator was free to commit other crimes Smith s discarded conviction is one of nearly 900 such cases filed in the National Registry of Exonerations  a database of prisoners exonerated in the U S  of serious crimes since 1989  that was made public on Monday  To qualify as an  exoneree  an individual must have been convicted and later relieved of all the legal consequences In compiling the database  researchers became aware of more than 1 100 other cases in which convictions were overturned due to 13 separate police corruption scandals  most of which involved the planting of drugs or guns on innocent defendants  Those exonerations are not included in the registry ExonerationRegistry org is the largest database of its kind ever assembled  according to its creators from the University of Michigan Law School and the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University School of Law  Nonetheless  researchers are not able to say what percentage of convictions in the U S  are false  in part because it can take so long for new evidence to come to light  There are currently about 2 5 million people in prison in the United States The earliest cases in the database date back to 1989  when DNA evidence freed its first two prisoners We can figure that as sort of the modern period in exonerations because DNA was a big game changer  said University of Michigan Law Professor Samuel Gross  one of the registry s creators   It provided a scientific instrument for reviewing cases and providing a different type of evidence about those cases because the technology didn t exist But DNA doesn t actually account for the majority of the exonerations in the database  after an initial wave in the early 1990s  he said DNA is a fairly narrow gauged tool  It only fits particular type of crimes  Gross said  noting that only 37 percent of the people in the database were cleared with the help of DNA evidence In the public mind  exoneration became identified with DNA  Most of these cases   DNA and non DNA   everybody agrees there was a mistake  frequently because the criminal was caught  often because we agree there was no crime at all Gross co authored a report on the database that pulls together statistics on exonerations from January 1989 through February 2012  While the database is constantly updated and new exonerations are being added all the time  the report focuses on the 873 individuals whose cases had been filed before March Gross and his report co author  University of Michigan law school graduate Michael Shaffer  discovered correlations in the types of crimes and reasons for wrongful convictions Fabricated crimes  False convictions in child sex abuse cases were usually due to fabricated crimes sometimes a divorced parent told a child to make up lies about an ex spouse abusing them  or police or a therapist convinced a child to say something that wasn t true Eyewitness mistakes  In adult rape cases  for example  false convictions were typically based on eyewitness mistakes   more often than not  mistakes by white victims falsely identifying black defendants  the report said Misconduct by authorities  For homicides  misconduct by authorities was the second biggest cause of false convictions  just behind false eyewitness accounts Eyewitnesses are crucial to a trial  experts say  and their mistakes  whether intentional or not  can have a huge impact The bulk of the evidence that is presented in trials in human testimony  Almost all of the time  energy  and effort is spent hearing people s statement in what occurred at a different place and a different time  Dan Simon  a professor of law and psychology at USC  said   The bottom line is  people are often inaccurate Asking an eyewitness to identify a suspect from a lineup demonstrates this There s a nice study that shows slight variations in the way the lineup is conducted can result in swings of accuracy from as low as 14 percent to as high as 86 percent  Simon said Confessing to a crime you didn t commitAnother factor in false convictions is what happens in the interrogation room  The report tracks 135 people who falsely confessed to a crime  and went to prison as a result Why would anyone ever admit doing a terrible crime they didn t do  Gross said   The first thing to note is the risk false confessions goes up rapidly when the suspects are either juveniles or mentally handicapped or both In other cases in the database  a comment made to authorities was misinterpreted as a confession  or police pressure led to the false confession How effective are police lineups  Take our test Some people are being interrogated at a time of extreme mental anguish and distress  Gross said There was a very depressing case from Lake County  Illinois  He confessed to raping and murdering his young daughter  8 or 9 years old  and a friend of hers  But consider the circumstances  He was being interrogated by the police  probably for 10 or 20 hours  within a day or two of when his daughter was kidnapped  raped and murdered and then they turned on him Exonerees can be found in all parts of the country  but most were concentrated in Illinois  New York  Texas  and California 93 percent are men  7 percent women Nearly 50 percent are black  38 percent white  11 percent Hispanic and 2 percent Native American or Asian 48 percent had been falsely convicted of homicides  35 percent of sexual assaults  23 percent adult  12 percent child  five percent robberies  five percent other violent crimes  and seven percent drug  white collar and other non violent crimes As a group  they spent more than 10 000 years in prison  an average of more than 11 years each Free from bars  but not from stigmaSmith  the man from North Carolina who was accused of molestation  maintained his innocence all along  He was only freed after one of the victims spoke to the other and decided to come forward in 2004 They said they were more or less encouraged to accuse Mr  Smith  but it took a number of years and a great passage of time  Smith s lawyer  Roy Trest  said   Obviously  he was extremely elated after all the years he had spent in prison Smith asked for a pardon from the governor  but was denied Now 61 and in poor health  he lives with his wife   who he was married to but separated from before he went to prison   in Brunswick County  N C  and has established a friendship with one of the victims who accused him  his lawyer said Not all exonerees who leave prison are able to reintegrate back into society like Smith  despite a court proclaiming them innocent Even if people honestly believe that this person was truly innocent  there is a certain stigma that comes with the mere fact that you were in prison  Simon said You were with bad people  you were antisocial  you had to live in the jungle like societies you often find in prisons Sometimes  families break up when a defendant goes to prison  Finding a job after release can be hard too Often times  the state is really unhelpful  There is no automatic method to get your criminal record expunged  Simon said   And they have huge holes in their results  and often times they lack the skills that would help you get a job  Everyone else was studying while you were stuck in a cell Simon believes the registry will help reform the justice system because it helps experts analyze the causes of false convictions The creators are still adding cases to ExonerationRegistry org  Gross said he hopes exonerees will contact his team if they had their convictions overturned and don t see

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/trayvon-martins-parents-journey-gr, Late last spring  as crowds gathered outside of the civic center in Sanford  Fla  chanting   We want justice  Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton huddled in a backstage dressing room preparing to meet the throngs of people outside  It had been one month since their son  Trayvon Martin  had been killed not far from there by George Zimmerman  a neighborhood watch volunteer who said he shot the unarmed teen in self defense  In the first weeks after the killing  police declined to arrest Zimmerman  citing Florida s controversial Stand Your Ground law which gives wide discretion in the use of deadly force in self defense   Right now  we can t stop  If we stop  the world will stop  Tracy Martin said in an interview that day  moments before the family was to make its first public appeal to the City Commission to take action in the case   We ve got to keep fighting  Zimmerman was arrested two weeks later and charged with second degree murder  He has pleaded not guilty  But the family kept on fighting  Over the last year  they have given dozens of interviews  traveled extensively and aligned themselves with victims of racially charged killings and gun violence from Chicago to London  Now  more than a year after their son s death  the rallies and protests have given way to anticipation of Zimmerman s upcoming trial scheduled to begin in Sanford on June 10  Martin and Fulton will be observers and potential participants  Prosecutors have included both parents on the witness list  It does not guarantee that they will be called but they must be available  That seems likely as the victim s parents they will also have seats in the courtroom for a trial that could last as long as six weeks   This year has been very difficult  Fulton said on msnbc s Politics Nation in late February on the one year anniversary of Martin s death   We ve met a lot of nice people but I don t think it measures up to the loss that we have endured  Martin and Fulton were divorced years ago but since their son s death they have drawn nearer to one another   It s been a sad year  The more we keep his name going  the more we keep his legacy going  the stronger we become as parents of a lost child  In Sanford  Trayvon Martin was raised in Miami but he died in Sanford  an Orlando suburb where his father s girlfriend lived in a gated community  On the evening of Feb  26  2012  he walked to a nearby convenience store and purchased a pack of candy and a canned iced tea  On the way back to his father s girlfriend s house  he encountered Zimmerman who has said he shot Trayvon Martin during a struggle that ensued after he d called 911 to report Martin as  suspicious  Zimmerman trailed the teen as he walked through the neighborhood back to the home he was visiting  Zimmerman and his lawyers say Zimmerman then lost sight of Martin before the teen came up from behind  exchanged a few words with Zimmerman and then attacked him  After the shooting  supporters of the family joined in protests across the country calling for Zimmerman s immediate arrest  saying he profiled Trayvon Martin because he was young  black and wearing a hooded sweatshirt  Others characterized the teenaged victim as a pot smoking thug and accused the  liberal media  of unfairly vilifying Zimmerman before all of the facts had been heard  Mark O Mara  Zimmerman s lead attorney  says that race has nothing to do with the case  As national attention drew to the case  Martin s parents kept it on the front pages of national newspapers and on primetime cable news programs  rarely turning down media requests  They appeared at rallies small and large to keep the memory of their son alive  For Martin  46  and Fulton  47  the death of their son has meant a reunion of sorts  They divorced in 1999  Martin is a truck driver  often on the road for long stretches  And Fulton has worked for the Miami Dade county housing authority for 23 years  She s been on an extended leave since her son s death  Tracy Martin  tall  bearded and with a clean shaven head often appears in public emotionally steady  almost stoic  Fulton more often than not wears the weight of a mother s grief like an unwanted badge  For more than a year she has publicly detailed her loss and almost always seeming on the verge of tears   He had just turned 17 a few days before he was killed  I remember how much he was looking forward to senior picture day  Fulton said in an interview in December   It s still difficult to swallow because Trayvon had his whole life ahead of him  Seventeen years just seems so short to me  but I do thank God for the time that he did give me with him  In Washington  In March  2012  As Martin and Fulton were grappling with their son s death and hoping for an arrest  President Obama stood before a gathering of reporters outside the White House to introduce his nominee to lead the World Bank  It was a rather routine announcement until a reporter shouted out a question that Obama s advisers had been steering him clear of for weeks   Mr  President  can we ask you about this current case in Florida  the reporter asked   Can you comment on the Trayvon Martin case  At the time  the killing and lack of an immediate arrest had already sparked national outrage and protests  Central to the early fervor surrounding the case is the matter of race  Martin was African American  Zimmerman is of white and Hispanic descent  In the Rose Garden  the president glanced down at the lectern and took a long pause before biting his lip and exhaling into the microphone   If I had a son  Obama said   he d look like Trayvon  The president called the killing a  tragedy  and urged America  to do some soul searching  The parents responded almost immediately   The president s personal comments touched us deeply and made us wonder  If his son looked like Trayvon and wore a hoodie  would he be suspicious too  Martin and Fulton said in a statement later that day   Page 2 of 2  Others saw it differently  Newt Gingrich  who was a Republican presidential candidate at the time  called Obama s comments  disgraceful   Is the president suggesting that if it had been a white who had been shot  that would be OK because it didn t look like him  Gingrich asked  Rush Limbaugh told his legion of listeners that the president was using the situation as a  political opportunity  Around the country  signs of discord flourished  The phrase  Long Live Zimmerman  was spray painted on various buildings  including Ohio State University s black cultural center  In one of the more biting  public incidents  someone hacked into an electronic road sign in Michigan and changed the message to   Trayvon a nigger  Zimmerman still had not yet been arrested  And details of Trayvon Martin s school life soon fueled attacks on his character  Martin was serving a 10 day suspension from high school when he was killed  A family spokesperson says Martin was suspended after an empty baggie was found in his book bag that school officials said contained marijuana residue   I refuse to let them assassinate my son s character  Tracy Martin said at the time   The question should not be why was he suspended from school  it should be why did this man kill him in cold blood  On the Road  Last month  Tracy Martin walked up to a small stage at the Sheraton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan and settled in behind a long table with five other black men  The event was part of a three day long conference sponsored by the National Action Network  a civil rights organization founded by the Rev  Al Sharpton  who hosts Politics Nation on msnbc  To Martin s immediate left sat Nathaniel Pendleton  the father of Hadiya Pendleton  the 15 year old Chicago honor student who was shot and killed by alleged gang members in a case of mistaken identity  Her death came one week after she and other members of her school s majorette team participated in the parade for the president s second inaugural  The panel was billed as straight talk with black men on the state of black manhood  Martin leaned in to the microphone propped in front of him   I d like to talk a little bit today about how we can actually start to get over the grieving process of losing someone so near and dear to your heart  Because  he said   it s definitely a long road that we have to travel  Since their son s death  the family has traveled the country meeting with other families of gun violence victims  including the family of Pendleton  Amadou Diallo and some whose names never rose to national prominence  In England they met with the mother of Stephen Lawrence  a black London teenager who was beaten to death in a racist attack there  They ve led anti violence rallies in Florida and New York City and have even launched a political action committee to fight Florida s Stand Your Ground laws  Back at home and preparing for the trial  Martin and Fulton gathered with friends and supporters at a Miami church last Saturday for an event that combined prayer with a call for peace   I say to you  I stand here as a mother  that my heart is hurting  but I know that God will work this out  said a tearful Fulton  It was their last scheduled public appearance before the trial begins Monday   I think that the trial for them is a real sense of closure  Pastor Jamal Bryant  one of a few high profile ministers who ve aided the family spiritually in the wake of Martin s death  told msnbc recently   With all of the rallies and all of the events it s been more than just a year of fighting  it s as if there s been a constant funeral  ,06/04/13 11:58 PM,marijuana

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/holder-snowden-plea-deal, Attorney General Eric Holder addressed the indictment of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell for the first time Thursday and vigorously defended the pursuit of political corruption cases more broadly  In an exclusive interview with msnbc  Holder also said the Justice Department would be open to plea negotiations with Edward Snowden    McDonnell and his wife Maureen were charged in federal court Tuesday for allegedly taking tens of thousands of dollars worth of gifts from a supporter who sought help from the state government  McDonnell has said he is being wrongly accused and his legal team argued that he engaged in  routine politics   The notion that public officials trade their office for their own personal gain  said Holder   is something that s inconsistent with good government  Stressing that he was speaking about corruption in general  Holder added   People who are in these positions have the public trust  they have great benefits that go with them in these positions  and they should be held  I think  to the highest standard  Some of the gifts the McDonnell s accepted included a  6 500 Rolex watch   10 000 worth of Oscar de la Renta clothing and  15 000 for his daughter s wedding expenses   I think the indictment lays out in pretty specific detail our theory of the case   ultimately a jury will decide  Holder said    Holder is a close friend of President Obama and has served as attorney general since 2009  He has devoted a significant part of his career to the Justice Department  where he spent years prosecuting political corruption cases for the public integrity section   We brought cases all the time where public officials received money  got gifts in exchange for official action   that is classic corruption  he said   Those are the kinds of cases that we traditionally bring  Holder spoke in Roanoke  Virginia  where he was visiting a federal veterans  court  part of the Justice Department s focus on prioritizing rehabilitation over prison for certain drug defendants  On the fate of Snowden  the former CIA officer and NSA contractor who leaked tens of thousands of classified documents  Holder said the prospect of amnesty  goes too far   He broke the law  he caused harm to our national security   I think he has to be held accountable for his actions  Holder said  If Snowden s lawyers sought a deal with some accountability  Holder said he would  engage in conversations  as in any plea negotiation   Returning to the US  I think  is the best resolution for the government  the public  and myself  but it s unfortunately not possible in the face of current whistleblower protection laws  which through a failure in law did not cover national security contractors like myself  Snowden said in an online chat Thursday The hundred year old law under which I ve been charged  which was never intended to be used against people working in the public interest  and forbids a public interest defense  This is especially frustrating  because it means there s no chance to have a fair trial  and no way I can come home and make my case to a jury  Snowden was granted temporary amnesty by Russia last summer  Snowden has been charged with theft and two serious charges under the espionage act   unauthorized communication of national defense information  and  willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person  Last month  a federal court in Washington ruled against an N S A  program based partly on Snowden s revelations  but Holder said such rulings do not change Snowden s status   People have really gotten hung up on the idea of whether he s a whistleblower or something else  Holder said   From my perspective  he s a defendant  He s a person that we lodged criminal charges against  I think that s the most apt title  Holder added that the debate Snowden helped spark may be good for the country  despite his actions   I think the dialogue that we are engaged is in fact something that is ultimately going to be productive   it s healthy  Holder said   but that doesn t necessarily excuse that which what he did  Holder declined to address claims by Congressional leaders that Snowden may have worked with a foreign government  citing the ongoing investigation against the former contractor  The Attorney General also addressed Obama s recent comments on marijuana   I think the positions that we re taking   in terms of setting up those eight priorities that would warrant federal intervention   are consistent with what the President said  Holder stated  referencing 2012 guidelines that leaned away from prosecuting private use   Small time small amount marijuana cases are not the kinds of things that deserve to be in the federal system  Holder said   When violence is part of the dissemination of marijuana  he added   those are the kinds of cases that should be in federal system  and those are the changes we ve made  ,01/23/14 05:00 PM,marijuana

Snowden  Wall Street crime  voting rights  and the war on drugs  Their talk  Melber  You heard the president s remarks on marijuana  not only about how it s used by individuals and its risk but also seeming to welcome legalization efforts in states like Colorado  You ve already shifted enforcement policy  Do you have to shift it more to harmonize with his views here  And what did you think of his remarks  Holder  No  I think the positions that we re taking in terms of setting out those eight priorities that would warrant federal intervention are  are consistent with what the what the president said  Small time  small amount  of marijuana cases are not the kinds of things that deserve to be in the federal system  We have the interstate transportation of it where violence is a part of the  the dissemination of marijuana  Those are the kinds of cases that oughta be in the federal system  And those are the changes that we ve made  And as I said  I think those are consistent with what the president said  And the president  of course  was at the Justice Department just last week outlining reforms to the NSA  We have reports of a new government watchdog report that says the bulk collection program was unlawful  it was a subversion of the Patriot Act law  and also not very useful in discovering any terror plots  Is that report  in your view  incorrect  And is there anything more that needs to be done to rein in these programs  Yeah  I ve not seen the report  But I will say that  at least 15 judges on about 35 occasions have said that the  the program itself is legal  Now  that answers only one part of the question  It s legal  It s something  And I agree with that  I  I think the program is in fact legal  But the question is  is the program as useful as it can be  And is it something that  that we ultimately need  And those are the questions that the president has put to me  to the director of national intelligence Jim Clapper  And we re gonna be looking over the next 90 days or so to make determinations about  answer the questions the president said  Just because we can do something should we should we do it  You have mentioned those courts  And there are definitely those decisions  But there s also a D C  court that ruled against the NSA and Judge Bates in the spy court in 2011 saying parts of the program at one point were unconstitutional  Your view  though  is  it s final that is completely legal based on the totality of all those judgments  Yeah  I think that  those other judges  those 15 judges  I think  got it right  I think the modifications that have been made in the program have made it legal to the extent that there were issues that might have been raised before  But again  that only answers one part of the  of the equation  The other question is  simply because we can do it  should we And that s what we re still working on  The president s acknowledged the discussion is partly because of the revelations published and released by Edward Snowden  There have been allegations recently  the suggestion that he may have worked with foreign governments  by the intelligence chairs  Are you aware of any evidence of that  Is that something you re investigating to add to the criminal complaint against Mr  Snowden  Well  this is an ongoing investigation  I don t wanna necessarily get into all of the  all of the details  I will say that  you know  he broke the law  that  he caused harm to our national security   And I think that he has to be held accountable for his actions  Now  I think the dialogue that we are engaged in  the debate that we are engaged in is in fact  something that is  ultimately  I think  gonna be productive  And I think there is  it s healthy  But that doesn t necessarily excuse  I think  that which he did  There are other ways that he might have brought this to the attention of the nation  Have you seen evidence that he worked with a foreign government  Because those are charges coming from senior congressional officials    Well  I  as I said  I don t wanna get into what is an ongoing investigation and say something that might end up in a pre trial motion when we get to that stage  Does the fact that the D C  court did rule against the NSA make him more of whistleblower potentially in the eyes of the law or in your view  I mean  people have really gotten hung up on whether he s a whistleblower or something else  From my perspective  he s  he s a defendant  He s a person that we have lodged criminal charges against  And I think that s the most apt title  Turning to the indictment of Governor McDonnell and the open inquiry in New Jersey looking into allegations against Governor Christie  First of all  McDonnell s attorneys have said that this was  quote  routine political conduct  that there was no real exchange of services  Broadly  what is your view of that argument  And how do you approach these federal investigations into state governors  Well  without talking about the McDonnell case specifically  I  I grew up in the Justice Department in the public integrity section  And we brought cases all the time where public officials received money  exchanged  got gifts in exchange for official action  That is classic corruption  And that is the  those are the kinds of cases that we traditionally bring  We have brought an indictment against Governor McDonnell  It s a case that will ultimately be tried in court  I think the indictment lays out in pretty specific detail our theory of the case  And ultimately  a jury will decide whether we are right or wrong  And then when you look at that idea though  the people say   This is politics as usual  broader than that individual case  And you did work for many years in the public integrity section  Is that offensive  Well  you know  that s something for the American people  I think  to decide  But from my own perspective  the notion that  you know  public officials trade their office for their own personal gain is something that is inconsistent with the notion of good government  And again  I m not talking about the McDonnell case  I m talking about this just  you know  more more generally  People who are in these positions have the public trust  They have great benefits that go with them in these positions  And they should be held  I think  to the highest standard  Looking at voting rights  an area where you have clearly led the Justice Department not only to  patrol and enforce the right to vote but to be somewhat flexible after the Supreme Court decision last year  You shifted resources  You ve said you re gonna make sure people have the right to vote  And now you re working with members of Congress in both parties  Does that Voting Rights Act amendment do what we need  while also avoiding what used to be your purview  which is Justice Department objections  in the voter ID context  which as you said yourself  is so important  I think the statute that has been introduced goes as long way to dealing with  that very  I think  wrongly decided  Shelby case  There are some things that I think need to be looked at though in connection with this  recodification of the Voting Rights Act  Chief among them  I think  is this whole notion of this photo ID requirement  And if we can show that  that photo ID efforts are done inappropriately and for improper reasons  I  I think that oughta be the basis for federal intervention  And so I m a little concerned that that appears at least for now not to be a part of the scheme  So you would like this bill that s being sponsored by Congressmen Sensenbrenner and John Lewis to include Justice Department photo ID objections in its formula for federal supervision  It is certainly something I think we  we d like to talk about and have a consideration made as to whether or not that ought to be included and then  you know  come up with language that would be appropriate  People have to understand that we are not opposed to photo identification in a vacuum  But when it is used in certain ways to disenfranchise particular groups of people  whether by  racial designation  ethnic origin  or for partisan reasons  that  from my perspective  is  is problematic  And so I would like to work with members of Congress to make this bill as strong as we possibly can make it  And so when some Republicans say that voter identification is for election integrity and thus is different than the history of racial discrimination we have seen in this country  they may be of good faith  but you think they re wrong  Yeah  There are some  I think  who are coming that  from a good faith perspective  But I think many are using it for partisan advantage  The reality is that  all the studies show that this whole question of ballot integrity  in person voter fraud  simply does not exist to the extent that would warrant these kinds of measures  We had the commission that the president appointed just yesterday  And they indicated this was not  was not a significant problem  And so I think they have come up with a remedy in search of a problem  And I think it is being used in too many instances to depress the vote of particular groups of people who are not supportive of the party that is advancing these photo ID measures  Now  also in the New Yorker interview  when the president was asked about potential deals or clemency for Edward Snowden which is something some NSA officials have said should be on the table  he said it s not a yes no issue  Does that mean that a deal of some kind could still be possible for Mr  Snowden  Well  he is a person who will  is charged  will be charged with  a variety of crimes  When he has legal representation and if those lawyers wanna talk about a resolution of the case  we would obviously engage in those  in those conversations  But that means it s not  you haven t ruled it out  The notion of clemency  a simple  you know  no harm  no foul  I think that would be going too far  But in the resolution of this matter  with an acceptance of responsibility  you know  the  we would always  you know  engage in those kinds of conversations  We have been talking about your approach to incarceration and smart on crime initiatives  Another criticism that is made of  not only this Justice Department but your predecessor  is that individual Wall Street executive misconduct doesn t often lead to jail time outside of the specifics of insider trading  In addition  as you know  there has been discussion in the economic realm  that some institutions are either too big to indict or too big to really deal with in a criminal context  Now you have been on the job even longer  Those criticisms remain  Your response to them  Are there things that you need from Congress or in our laws so that companies are not too big to indict if they do wrong  Let me make this very clear  There are no institutions that are too big to indict  There are no individuals who are in such high level positions that they cannot be indicted  criminally investigated  And we have brought charges against thousands of people over the course of these last four and a half  almost five years  We have brought significant cases against some of the largest financial institutions in the country  the last of which was the J P  Morgan case  which significantly did not include a resolution of the criminal investigation that is ongoing and could result in charges against either the institution or individuals  who are engaged  who were involved in those activities  And we have ongoing investigations that  I m really not at liberty to talk about but involve significant financial institutions  And the focus of those investigations is not only on the institutions but on individuals as well  So I think  you know  what we are gonna have to do is wait for us to be finished with all of the things that we want to do  and then look and make an assessment of  how well we did and the kinds of charges that we brought  I think it s a little too early at this point  But the record suggested a great deal of money has been clawed back in some cases  and that working with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  sometimes that money goes to victims of financial crimes  But many  as we know  of the completed investigations involved deferred prosecution agreements or deals where people often don t even have to say that there was official wrongdoing  And many say that is an insufficiently punitive or harsh approach to those actors  Is that fair  Well  you know  people say these things without having the ability to look at the files that we have  the  the cases that we could possibly bring  To the extent that we have the ability to bring cases against individuals or institutions  criminal charges   we will bring them  But we have certain responsibilities to only bring those cases that we think we have an ability to prove beyond a reasonable doubt  It doesn t mean we only  that we won t take hard cases and  you know  be prepared to take potentially  you know  losses where we think it is appropriate to bring those charges  But it is not for lack of looking  or lack of aggressiveness  that we have not done all that people think that we should have done  And as I said  I  I think people need to just be a little patient  I know it s been  it s been a while  But we have other things that are in the pipeline  One of the other most controversial legal issues has been the boundaries over the targeted killing or drone program  Are you satisfied with where that debate has landed and the transparency that has been provided  which I believe was more than the administration initially planned on  And do you think Americans have a clear understanding of what the line is and how you advise the president to define who can be targeted and whether individuals who haven t had any due process or any claims proven about their ties to terrorists can still be killed  Well  we  I think we have been pretty transparent  I gave a speech at Northwestern University Law School that laid out some of the legal bases for this kind of action   John Brennan  Brennan gave a speech as well  So I think we have been forthcoming in that regard  And  I think the  the use of those kinds of weapons and  in the numbers of times we ve done it with regard to American citizens has been justified both by the law and by  by circumstance  And so I m   I think I m   I m comfortable with the way in which we have both conducted ourselves and the way in which we have explained it  The president has wanted to have as much transparency as is possible  understanding that a good portion of these operations must be kept secret if they are to be  if they are to be effective  And as you think on your  legacy  however long you are in office  you are one of the longest  ninth longest serving attorney general  Is that right  That is right  I didn t  I did not  okay   LAUGH  All right  Do you think  when you look at the smart on crime initiative and some of the reforms we ve been talking about  do you  and you presiding over  an actual drop in the total number of the prison population for the first time in a generation  is part of your legacy moving from overincarceration to rehabilitation and other approaches to social problems  Yeah  I would hope that one of the things that people look back on and say that we got right  was to do things in a different way  not to be stuck in things that are traditional but perhaps ultimately don t work to break the cycle  not to reflexively say that we were simply tough on crime but as we use the phrase  to be smart on crime  And that necessarily means engaging in prevention activities  rehabilitation activities  re entry activities that ultimately keep the nation safer at a smaller cost  And it  and it s also the morally the right thing to do  to have a system  of  criminal justice system that is perceived as being fair and that acts in proportionate ways  We have  you know  we erred  I think  a little in the the war on drugs in going too far with regard to some of the sentences that  that Congress mandated  And I think we have a moment in time now where Congress as well as those of us in the executive branch think that it s time to pull back just  just a bit  And so I think that  I hope that will be a part of my legacy  Do you feel you are able to do more of that because of the  a change in the politics of fear in this country  Politics of fear  Yeah  the people being afraid of crime so much regardless of the data  that they seek punishment above all other remedy  I think there is a growing recognition in  I think in the American people that different approaches ought to be tried  You know  this mass incarceration happens with a cost   If you look at the way it impacts certain communities and it s  let s be honest about this  communities of color  where young men should be the future of these communities are taken out  labeled  then have inabilities to obtain good employment  to be the kinds of productive citizens that they might be  Now  they  people have to be held accountable for individual decisions that they make  But we need to have proportionate penalties  And the ability for  a recognition that you can make a mistake  rehabilitate yourself  and then come back and be a productive citizen  And those are the kinds of policies that I m trying to advance  that this administration is trying to advance  Mr  Attorney General  I appreciate your time today  Thank you     ,01/28/14 09:50 PM,marijuana
