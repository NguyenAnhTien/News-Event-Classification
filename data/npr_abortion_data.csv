NPR,http://www.npr.org/2014/11/04/361214063/the-republican-partys-remarkable-non-transformation?ft=3&f=,Sometime after the polls close Tuesday night well find out if Republicans managed a spectacular feat The party that lost the last two presidential elections is seeking a comeback adding control of the Senate to control of the House Republicans aim to dominate Congress with a fresh presidential election looming in 2016 It would be in one of the hackneyed phrases of journalism a remarkable transformation Its better described as a nontransformation The GOP has waged this campaign without altering a single one of the major political positions that supposedly doom the party to demographic oblivion Opposition to immigration reform was supposed to permanently lose the growing Latino vote Opposition to abortion rights and gay marriage was supposed to permanently lose the millennial generation Kneejerk opposition to President Obama was supposed to turn off moderate and minority voters Even opposition to Obamacare was expected to be a millstone for the GOP once its benefits became apparent The party has not really changed course Republicans who tried have been chastened So how has the GOP arrived at Election Day with an excellent chance to capture the Senate Partly its that the GOP benefits from quirks of the election system Many Senate seats up for grabs this year are in conservative states Heres how political analyst Amy Walter summarized the GOP approach Were going to win the Senate in red states  and we dont have to make some of these changes  like expanding the party to include minority voters reaching out to younger voters Something more is happening too Without really altering their positions Republicans updated the way they talk about hotbutton issues They seek to minimize their weaknesses before a changing electorate That has left Democrats struggling to highlight Republican vulnerabilities Doorstopping the Front Range Wanting to hear how individual voters are responding to Democratic and Republican appeals we knocked on doors in Colorado The Senate race there is very close Democratic Sen Mark Udall faces a challenge from Republican Cory Gardner currently a member of the House Colorado once a red state has turned purple We saw one reason why in Platteville tiny farm town population 2568 Like so much of the state this rural outpost has a growing Latino population Local resident Lucy Montoya told us that at the Spanishstyle Catholic church We have had such an influx of the Hispanic population that we went from having one English mass to then having a bilingual mass and now we have one mass in English and one mass in Spanish every week The areas Latino community includes Mexican restaurant owner Jose Lozano an immigrant from Mexico now a US citizen at age 38 Asked how he votes he said simply Im a Democrat and added that hes concerned about the Republican candidates past opposition to immigration reform Surely Colorado is also a swing state because of voters like Wayne Pulick We met him when we knocked on a door in Lakewood Colo and discovered a dinner party inside Five friends were sipping wine and enjoying takeout from Alameda Burrito a local place that they highly recommended even though it is attached to a gas station The dinner companions were mostly Democrats but not Pulick Im a registered Republican he told us I used to vote on the basis of who was the best for the job But then two terms of President George W Bush convinced me to be more extreme Like everyone at the table hes a vote for the Democrat Mark Udall this year Republican Repositioning In recent years the GOP did indeed seem too far right for Colorado In 2010 Democrat Michael Bennet won a Colorado Senate race painting the GOP nominee as far too conservative especially on womens reproductive rights One national Republican official told me his party lost Colorado in 2010 even though we had a gorilla on the scale  a national wave of unrest over the Great Recession In 2014 the nation is less discontented but the Republicans still have a thumb on the scale and they dont want to blow it again This time the GOP nominee is Cory Gardner a conservative member of the raucous House of Representatives who has made every effort not to seem excessively conservative or raucous Early in the campaign Gardner supported overthecounter contraceptives a way of advertising that he wasnt opposed to birth control He also disavowed his past support for a proposed personhood amendment to Colorados constitution which would require an embryo to be defined as a human being under the state criminal code with potential consequences for abortion in vitro fertilization and some forms of birth control Though Gardner has supported such measures at both the state and federal levels he publicly turned against such a measure on Colorados 2014 ballot One voter we met was exceedingly doubtful of the sincerity of Gardners reversal If he supported a personhood amendment in the past said Taylor Dybdahl of Lakewood he might do it in the future Hes saying that hes not supporting it now just to get elected Shes 21 a college student and a single woman  the kind of voter Democrats depend on But Gardners shift has clouded the issue When Democrats attacked him on womens rights  following a formula that worked in 2010  they provoked a backlash The Denver Post accused Udall of seeking to frighten voters and endorsed Gardner Most voters we interviewed if they were following the campaign at all were left with an impression of an ugly and negative contest National Trends The Republican operative contended Gardner is running a strong race simply because he hasnt said anything stupid Numerous past GOP candidates have been sunk by sharpedged remarks that prompted voters to focus on their views on social issues Gardner hasnt The Republican operative described Gardner as setting an example When other Senate candidates  Joni Ernst of Iowa or Tom Cotton of Arkansas  have been questioned on hotbutton issues we send them Gardners stuff Other Republican candidates are also minimizing their vulnerabilities In Kentucky Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell remains formally opposed to Obamacare  but knowing that Kentuckys health care exchange has met with much success he publicly declared the state exchange fine In New Hampshire a Republican House candidate Marilinda Garcia typifies the GOP approach to another hotbutton issue gay marriage Some issues she told us in September arent the battle anymore So I think that with time well just see a whole different set of issues In other words courts are rapidly deciding the issue in favor of gay marriage allowing Republicans to remain silent Republicans low profile may be working In Colorado gay marriage was legalized just a few weeks ago Yet when we asked voters about their major issues or concerns not a single one brought up the subject Decided Republicans Uncertain Democrats By minimizing their vulnerabilities Republicans have complicated Democratic efforts to fire up their core voters Democratic voters instead are thinking of President Obama whose popularity has sagged Samy Wahabrebi a Sudanese immigrant and US citizen we met in the Denver suburb of Aurora told us he voted for the president in 2008 but has been disappointed since I was expecting more he said In our Colorado interviews Republicans expressed fewer doubts In Lakewood Sue Berg 82 let us into her living room where she tended to a miniature greyhound while watching Fox News As we walked in television host Bill OReilly was denouncing Harry Reid the Senate Democratic leader A moment later as we began our interview Berg declared I think they should get rid of Reid Does this mean Republicans will win the Senate Not necessarily Democrats retain a powerful getoutthevote operation which gives them hope But if Republicans do prevail without really changing their positions there may be consequences Some Republicans with an eye on the presidential race in 2016 have been eager to reorient their party They want to significantly change GOP positions on issues like immigration The partys failure to keep up with trends in public opinion will be harder to minimize in the brighter light and larger electorate of a presidential year They could try for change after Tuesdays election But that will be hard Most Republicans in Congress will have been elected without really calling for a new course Copyright 2014 NPR,20141104,abortion

will decide who controls the Senate next year In the 21st century a female candidate for Senate may not sound historic But in Iowa it is The state shares a rare distinction with Mississippi It has never elected a woman to the Senate to the House or to be governor Republican state Sen Joni Ernst is trying to change that in her race against Democratic US Rep Bruce Braley  a race in which the role of female voters is central The gender gap has been around for decades Republicans typically do well with men Democrats with women And among women who vote those who are not married are still more likely to vote for Democrats Young singles divorcees and widows are all prime Democratic constituencies Democrats say they appeal to women on both economic and social grounds Women they say would benefit more from a higher minimum wage and other pocketbook issues And they say women are concerned about reproductive rights Democrats accuse Republicans of waging a war on women Professor Rachel Paine Caufield a political scientist at Drake University in Des Moines says Republicans have been responding to that charge and gaining ground Theyve identified this problem And they know that need to appeal to women  Part of that is fielding more women candidates Part of that is reframing some of their messages to women voters she says In Iowa polls show Braley running as many as 14 points ahead of Ernst among women But hes trailing Ernst by even more than that margin among men So the Democrats need women to turn out and vote The week before last Braley got a visit from a very high profile Democratic woman Michelle Obama For a candidate who is said to have a tough time introducing himself to Iowa voters it didnt help that the first lady several times got his name wrong You can request a ballot by mail right here at this event or you can go to vote dot Bruce Bailey dot com Thats vote dot Bruce Bailey dot com Or even better you can  she started eliciting shouts from the audience Braley What did I say Im losing it Im getting old Ernst whos an officer in the Iowa Army National Guard presents herself as a mother soldier leader She has made a strong introduction with the voters largely through her commercials In an ad titled Squeal she narrates My parents taught us to live within our means Its time to force Washington to do the same She also invokes the common experience she shared with other Iowa farm kids castrating hogs Shell come to Washington and cut pork Lets make em squeal the ad ends Then came a commercial showing Ernst riding a motorcycle to a shooting range and firing a pistol she carries in her purse Joni Ernst will take aim at wasteful spending and once she sets her sights on Obamacare Jonis gonna unload the narrator says Drakes Caufield says those images are relaying a central message Im from a mans world This is something particularly in a time in foreign policy women candidates tend to have a harder time appealing to voters on foreign policy issues says Caufield I dont think Joni Ernst has had any problem on that I dont think theres any question that she has presented herself to voters as someone who is tough and capable and willing to fight every bit as hard as any male would be How is it playing with women Last week we invited six Iowa women from across the political spectrum to watch the third and final BraleyErnst televised debate with us In that debate there was much talk about the Personhood Amendment to the Iowa Constitution that Ernst sponsored as a state senator Would declaring a fertilized egg to be a person ban all abortions some contraceptives and in vitro fertilization Braley cited the concerns of OBGYNs that it would do all those things Ernst said shes prolife She could support abortion to save the life of a mother She said she supports access to contraception and she has no objection to in vitro which entails disposing of excess fertilized eggs In the debate Ernst also spoke of going to Washington to fix a dysfunctional government Braley said that all of her solutions scrap things the Department of Education federal student loans the Environmental Protection Agency the federal minimum wage When each was asked to say something admirable about the other Braley said this about Ernst who was deployed in the Iraq War Well I admire the fact that Sen Ernst has served our nation and our state and the Iowa National Guard I think its a terrific attribute My father was a Word War II combat veteran and I have great respect for Sen Ernst for serving our country Ernsts answer And I think Congressman Braley is a great father The reaction from our group Oh God Most found that line to be condescending It turned out that our six viewers all thought Braley did better Loretta Sieman  a former Des Moines councilwoman and registered Republican  sounded disappointed that she couldnt be enthusiastic about the female candidate Ernst struck her as too negative At the end he just talked about what he was going to do She talked about what he didnt do And that drives me crazy she said As a woman we know that we have never had a woman from Iowa so were supposed to be involved for that As a past councilperson I want the right person and I dont care if they wear a skirt or pants Brittany Gaura a sophomore at Iowa State is a Young Republican she hopes to be a veterinarian I asked about the importance of electing a woman to the Senate To me its important to have a woman I think in the Senate and from Iowa I think a lot of women in Iowa have a lot to bring to the table  but its not important to me right now if shes not the right woman Her fellow conservative in the group businesswoman Karen Novak agreed Im looking at whos the most qualified individual I dont care if they wear pants or a skirt it makes no difference I would absolutely love to get a woman in office but only if shes the right one and she has the right qualifications she said Those two Iowa women had described themselves as leaning toward Ernst before the debate Afterward they were leaning a little less in that direction The same was true for Angela Ten Clay who works at an ad agency Braley was very articulate and answered things really well and gave more meat and depth to his conversation And whether I agreed with it or not when someone is concise and clear and strong in what they believe thats really what I look for That they stand up for something and they back it and they dont change their opinion she says I asked our group of Iowa women what they made of the references in the debate to motherhood Ernst describes herself as a mother first We had two decided Braley voters in the group Pat Schneider said Ernsts description of herself didnt impress her When she talks about shes a mother shes a soldier  its like OK but that could be anybody I mean that to me doesnt qualify you to run for Congress Although I do think if we had more women in Congress I think we could probably get a lot more done because women are used to compromising and working together I mean we have to do it every day with our kids our workforce she said In that respect it would be great but I dont think Joni Ernst is the right woman Nicole Peckumn who also supports Braley is not a mother And as she said female voters are a more mixed lot than just moms To me its really about the quality of the candidate and not necessarily about gender Do I want to still be tied with Mississippi for not having a woman go to DC Absolutely no and I think that this will be the year that either in the congressional or Senate race well do it Peckumn said Being a mother is wonderful but there are a lot of people in our society who have opted to not have that be a part of their plan So I think when youre talking about the big scope of America you have to also look at people who are not like you Someday I want to be a mom  But it doesnt really generate a big emotional connection with me or some of my friends who are moms Heres something that all six women agreed on And both Senate candidates in the debate said they agreed on And both state party chairmen whom I interviewed last week in Des Moines said they agreed on Everyone hates the nonstop bumpertobumper airing of campaign commercials typically bashing one candidate or the other Commercials from campaigns national party committees outside groups The revulsion is as universal as it is apparently ineffectual As in many states early voting is well underway Iowa so every day is Election Day And as soon as last weeks televised debate ended the

a controversial scientist a Catholic obstetrician and a wealthy feminist  got together to create a revolutionary little pill the world had never seen beforeThey were sneaky about what they were doing  skirting the law lying to women about the tests they performed and fibbing to the public about their motivationsThey absolutely couldve been imprisoned for some of the work they were doing journalist Jonathan Eig tells Fresh Airs Terry Gross These guys are like guerrilla warriors  theyre always having to figure out ways to do this thing that will attract the least attention  They can never really say theyre testing birth controlEig tells the history in his new book The Birth of the Pill How Four Crusaders Reinvented Sex and Launched a RevolutionThe four people who created this revolution were Margaret Sanger who believed that women could not enjoy sex or freedom until they could control when and whether they got pregnant scientist Gregory Pincus who was fired from Harvard for experimenting with invitro fertilization and bragging about it to the mainstream press John Rock who was a Catholic OBGYN and worked with Pincus to conduct tests of the pill on women and Katharine McCormick who funded much of the researchIn the 50s selling contraception was still officially illegal in many statesBut Sanger and McCormick a feminist who had been active in the suffrage movement wanted women to enjoy sex  without fear of getting pregnantAfter McCormicks husband died McCormick got in touch with SangerAccording to Eig McCormick said Whats the most important thing we could possibly work onSanger said The best thing we could possibly do is work on this pill this miracle tablet  something that would give women the right to control their bodies for the first time And McCormick said Im in Whatever you need Interview HighlightsOn why Eig wanted to write the book I was listening to a rabbis sermon  this was maybe five or six years ago  and he began by saying that the birth control pill may have been the most important invention of the 20th century My immediate reaction was Thats nuts That cant possibly be I can think of six things off the top of my head that seemed more important than that But it stayed with me I kept thinking about itA couple of years went by and I was still thinking about it His case was that it had changed more than just science more than just medicine It had changed human dynamics It had changed the way men and women get along in the world It changed reproduction obviously but it also created all kinds of opportunities for women that werent there before it had spread democracy If it really was the most important invention of the 20th century and maybe he was right why dont I know how we got there I dont know the inventor of the pill I can tell you the inventor of the telephone and the telegraph and the light bulb but I have no idea where the pill came fromOn American Birth Control League founder Margaret Sanger seeking a magical pillSangers story is personal in some respects She had seen her own mother die after having given birth to what she felt like were far too many children and far too great a sexual drive on her fathers part She went to work in the slums of New York City where women were having eight nine 10 children with no idea how to stop it other than having abortions which were often poorly performed and very dangerous So she saw this stuff very up close There had been this backlash against the control of fertility in the late 1800s and early 1900s where it had been made illegal even though the fertility rates had been dropping over the course of the 18th centuryBut by the time you get to Sanger and shes a young woman working in New York City its very hard for women to get any kind of education even about birth control much less birth control products She has this plan to improve education for women But her dream and its really just a dream is that there should be some kind of magical pill  something that would allow women to turn on and off their reproductive systemsOn scientist Gregory Pincus and his controversial work Pincus was fired from Harvard In fact he was denied tenure because he was far too controversial In the 1930s he was not only experimenting with invitro fertilization he was bragging about it to the mainstream press which is something serious scientists werent supposed to doInstead of just publishing his results in medical journals he was taking them to popular magazines and saying This is the brave new world And people were scared of the Brave New World because of the Huxley book but Pincus didnt mind the comparisons He said Someday we will control how babies are born We might not even need men in the process We will be able to control the giving of life through science This scared the hell out of peopleHarvard which had once hailed Pincus research as some of the most important research it had ever done suddenly quit on him cut ties completely and he was unable to find a job anywhere else in the world of academics He ended up working out of a garage for a little while out of a barn for a bit and then founded his own scientific institution on really a wing and a prayer going doortodoor in the community of Worcester Mass knocking on doors asking people to contribute to his scientific foundation So he was a real fringe character at the point that Margaret Sanger and Katharine McCormick found himOn Pincus working with fertility gynecologist John Rock testing injections on unknowing womenTheres a lot of lying in this process of creating the first oral contraceptive Thats what they have to do You can really have a wonderful ethical discussion and debate about whether it was worth it whether they were doing things that were beyond the bounds The laws and the ethics of science were very different in the 1950s than they are today  you didnt have to give informed consent you didnt have to have anybody sign forms giving away their rights telling them about what these experiments are for So in a way we do have women being treated like lab animals so that we may find a form of birth control that frees them Theres a great irony thereOn how they sought Food and Drug Administration approvalThis is the first pill ever created for healthy women to take every day Theres never been anything like this and the idea of seeking FDA approval for something women are going to take every day without studying it for years and years and checking out the longterm side effects this is scary stuff But Pincus also feels like hes racing the clock that if the word gets out about this and the Catholic Church and the federal government realize what theyre doing the opposition will mount and hell have no chance of getting it through In 1955 when theyve really only tested the pill on maybe 60 women for more than say six months or a year Pincus goes to a conference and declares victory He declares that weve invented the pill The media picks up on this and it becomes this huge story  Thousands of women are writing to their doctors and writing directly to Pincus and Rock saying Ive heard about this pill and I need it I need it now  There was this huge outpouring and it had a huge effect on Pincus and on the other scientist working on this because they began to see there was an enormous demand for this and they began to see they had to push harder they had to go fast When you go fast in science youre taking great risks Its one of the great bluffs in scientific history Pincus knows that he has the science Hes not sure that its really ready he hasnt tested it on nearly enough women His partner John Rock is saying Dont you dare announce that were ready to do this yet If you do Im out Hes furious with Pincus But Pincus does it anyway He realizes that theyve got some momentum and they need to keep it going this whole thing could fall apart if too much opposition is raisedOn manufacturing the pillAs a result of all of the publicity the GD Searle pharmaceutical company agreed to manufacture the pill and to apply to the FDA for approval but Pincus and Searle come up with yet another sneaky but brilliant idea They decide Were not going to ask the FDA to approve it as birth control because that will raise a whole bunch of other issues  Lets just ask them to approve it for menstrual disorders  Almost any woman can go into her doctor and say Ive got an irregular cycle Id like to have this new pill And thats exactly what happens The pill has a label on it that says Warning This pill will likely prevent pregnancy And its the greatest advertisement they could ever have  because this is what women wantOn McCormick realizing her accomplishmentOne of the scenes in this book that I love is  Katharine McCormick who is even older than Sanger shes 80 now and the pill is approved its available and she goes into the drugstore with a prescription from her doctor and asks for it This 80yearold woman is going in and asking for a prescription for the birth control pill and obviously she wasnt planning to use it  she just wanted to be able to buy it It meant so much to her to know this was available now to women 60 years too late for her in many ways but she had done it and that was an amazing accomplishment Copyright 2014 NPR,20141016,abortion

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2014/10/06/353515078/supreme-court-to-weigh-facebook-threats-religious-freedom-discrimination?ft=3&f=,The US Supreme Court opens a new term Monday but so far the justices are keeping quiet about whether or when they will tackle the gay marriage question Last week the justices met behind closed doors to discuss pending cases but when they released the list of new cases added to the calendar samesex marriage was nowhere to be seen But that really doesnt mean very much About 2000 cases have piled up over the summer each seeking review on all manner of subjects So when the court met last week to sift through all that there really wasnt enough time for the justices as a group to focus on the samesex marriage cases With a big issue like this and multiple appeals before the court the justices need to decide which cases are the best vehicles as its known in the trade for review Indeed all of the vehicle talk prompted one media wag to comment last week that all of the flossy lawyers each pointing to their own case as the best vehicle sounded more like car salesmen than Supreme Court advocates With seven cases currently before the court the justices will likely pick just one or two to hear They might as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested earlier this fall even wait for more cases Right now the only cases pending before the court are lower court decisions favoring the right of samesex couples to marry But a Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals panel which heard arguments last August in Ohio sounded as if it might go the other way If it does that would provide the kind of traditional conflict the Supreme Court looks to resolve Truth be told with both sides already pressing the court to act most court observers think the justices will want to take the plunge sooner rather than later For now though all is speculation This term will mark the 10th year that John Roberts has served as chief justice Without a doubt the court has grown dramatically more conservative since his appointment But as Brianne Gorod of the Constitutional Accountability Center observes the question is What role has John Roberts played in this movement Is he strategically and deliberately leading the court to the right Kendall asks Or is it as some have suggested the Kennedy Court or even the Alito Court Justice Anthony Kennedy is often referred to as the swing justice and has written many of the courts major 5to4 opinions Justice Samuel Alito is far more conservative than the justice he replaced Sandra Day OConnor and has cast many votes and written major opinions that have shifted the court in a more conservative direction The issues on the docket this term range from race and religion cases to pregnancy discrimination and even to threats on Facebook But once again the court responding to challenges brought by conservatives has chosen to delve into some elections issues that had been thought long settled In a case from Arizona the court could prevent the increasing use of citizen commissions to draw congressional district lines Arizona California and some other states have in one way or another used these commissions to take the redistricting issue out of the hands of selfinterested state legislatures But in Arizona where the independent commission was enacted by referendum the Republicancontrolled Legislature is now challenging the practice as unconstitutional In a case that could dramatically alter the way judicial elections are conducted the court will decide whether states that elect judges can bar judicial candidates from personally soliciting campaign contributions Of the 39 states with judicial elections 30 have such bans The test case is from Florida where the state Supreme Court upheld that states ban on the grounds that allowing judicial candidates to personally solicit campaign contributions would raise questions about their impartiality on the bench Those challenging the ban say it violates their free speech rights Another free speech case involves the question of what constitutes a threat on Facebook The facts are pretty hairy Anthony Elonis was convicted of making threats against his estranged wife and an FBI agent His posts said things like Im not going to rest until your body is a mess soaked in blood and dying from all the little cuts Soon he moved on to suggest that he might make a name for himself with a school shooting Hell hath no fury like a crazy man in a kindergarten class The only question is  which one At that point a female FBI agent paid him a visit which provoked a post in which he said that hed had to control himself not to slit her throat leave her bleeding from her jugular in the arms of her partner At Elonis trial the judge instructed the jurors that to convict they had to conclude that this was not merely exaggeration His Facebook posts needed to be statements that a reasonable person would interpret as a serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily injury Elonis contended that he was just mimicking rap songs  indeed he often linked to songs with his post He argued that he should not be convicted without actual proof that he intended to threaten intimidate or harm The intent standard that Elonis argued for might make it much more difficult to win a conviction for making illegal threats But whatever rule the justices come up with observes University of Virginia law professor Leslie Kendrick it will likely apply not just to Facebook and Twitter but to all forms of communication  including people speaking face to face or publishing in the newspaper In other words says Kendrick when crafting a rule the justices will ask if the standard is going to chill people who engage in speech that is borderline but ultimately protected Protected that is by the First Amendment guarantee of free speech Most court experts seem to believe that Elonis may win because of the culture of todays social media The context of rap music these days suggests that what Elonis put out there really isnt all that unusual for whats going on on Facebook and whats going on in the popular culture says professor William Marshall of the University of North Carolina School of Law After all the current Supreme Court may be viewed as conservative but it has with little or no dissent already upheld a fair amount of fringe speech  whether its crush videos demonstrations at military funerals or the sale of violent video games to kids Not everyone however agrees that the Facebook threat case is in the same category Former Solicitor General Gregory Garre notes that Elonis posts ticked off all the boxes  domestic violence school shootings violence against a federal officer Garre says he wouldnt be surprised if Elonis Facebook posts struck the justices as something very problematic A different part of the First Amendment  the free exercise of religion  is at issue in two cases involving federal statutes One case tests whether retailer Abercrombie  Fitch illegally discriminated against a Muslim woman when she was denied a job because her headscarf conflicted with the companys dress code The other case tests Arkansas refusal to allow a Muslim prisoner to wear a short beard for religious purposes The prisoner sued under a federal law aimed at shoring up prisoners religious rights Interestingly in this case the prisoner has the backing of a wide variety of corrections officials and organizations plus the federal government The federal prison system and 43 states allow beards largely because it is much easier to hide weapons and other contraband in clothes hair and body cavities There is a similar coalition of strange bedfellows in a pregnancy discrimination case before the court Antiabortion and womens rights groups have joined together to urge the court to require employers to treat pregnancy the same way other temporary disabilities are treated on the job In this case a UPS driver asked for light duty carrying less than 20 pounds during the latter part of her pregnancy But the company refused and she lost both her job and her insurance coverage The company contends that it had no animus toward the employee because of her pregnancy her request for light duty just wasnt covered by either the provisions of federal disability law or the union contract She argues that she should have been covered under the 1978 federal law barring discrimination based on pregnancy The case is very important for businesses because pregnancy accommodations cost money But its very important to women too observes Emily Martin of the National Womens Law Center Lots of women with some sort of work limitation arising out of pregnancy face similar issues  especially women in lowwage jobs that are often more physically demanding she says The first case the court hears on Monday is one that amazes former Solicitor General Paul Clement who wants to know How in the world did we go 225 years and not have this issue decided The issue is whether police may make a traffic stop based on a mistaken understanding of the law and then use evidence from a subsequent search to convict the cars occupants of a crime Other controversies to look forward to include cases that involve racial gerrymandering and Medicaid funding and a major housing discrimination case that could make it harder to prove discrimination The court will even be tackling a case about fish  yes fish Its an obstruction of justice case that depending on your point of view involves either the deliberate concealment of illegal fishing or a classic example of prosecutorial overreach More to come on that later Copyright 2014 NPR,20141006,abortion

to the nearest public hospital about four hours away from her remote village in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand Its not a trip she can afford to take often  buses are infrequent the journey is long and the cost of about a dollar roundtrip is not insignificant But she had no choice She was running a temperature and had been bleeding for days The reason an unsafe abortion performed by a village midwife Horos story is not uncommon in India An estimated twothirds of abortions performed are unsafe done illegally at home or by quacks and midwives and the annual death toll is about 4600 Many women end up with lifelong health problems And women in rural India are disproportionately affected And yet abortion has been legal in India since 1971 Thats the irony of the situation says Vinoj Manning the director of the India office of IPAS an international nonprofit organization that works to increase access to safe abortions The Indian public health system has failed to provide any abortion services to poor women in rural areas he says All good health care is concentrated in urban centers  and is not affordable by Indias poor When Seteng Horo a mother of two became pregnant last year she and her husband decided to terminate her pregnancy I dont want more kids she says My husband doesnt either Raising two children was expensive enough she says But they had few options for an abortion Her village Serotoli doesnt even have a public health clinic or hospital and they are too poor to afford private health care Besides Horo had no idea that abortion is legal and that she should only undergo the procedure at a facility certified by the government Horo first went to what is known in these parts as a jhola wala doctor a doctor with a bag Theyre men who travel from village to village with a bagful of medicines But they arent qualified doctors Some are trained in alternative medicine but have little or no understanding of modern medical science Others have no medical training at all They are basically quacks The jhola wala doctor gave her an expensive pill that didnt work Then she went to a daai an elderly woman in her village who serves as both a midwife and traditional healer especially for womens reproductive health A daai is an important figure in Indias villages at once a medicine woman and a confidante and adviser on matters of reproductive health Abortion like all matters related to sex is a taboo Anything about sex and sexuality is stigmatized says Manning We dont even talk about it in our own homes And when it comes to abortion it is even more stigmatized  because a womans primary role is still seen as a child bearer This creates a culture of silence around the topic he says And women prefer to go to a daai knowing she will keep the abortion confidential Horos daai gave her an abdominal massage a commonly used abortion practice in the region The massage usually done with hot oil and plant leaves is intended to destroy the fetus At first I thought it worked says Horo Days later she was feverish and bleeding profusely It was only then that she decided to take the 60mile bus ride to the nearest public hospital But like most public hospitals and health clinics in rural India this one did not have a doctor trained to perform an abortion The hospital referred her to a small clinic nearby in Khunti run by the Family Planning Association of India FPAI a nonprofit organization that provides reproductive health services at little or no cost to the poor As more people have learned about the clinic in the four years since it opened Dr Mahesh has seen the number of patients grow The clinic currently performs an average of 50 abortions every month she says They come from very farflung areas she says There are two other clinics elsewhere in Jharkhand and others around the country But they probably dont reach as many women as they should says the doctor The government of India recognizes the problem and is trying to solve it This year it took steps to train more providers in government hospitals It also launched a media campaign to raise peoples awareness In addition the government is trying to amend the law so that trained nurses can perform abortions and not just certified doctors This will increase access to safe abortion especially in poor and rural communities What theyre trying to do is move abortion from informal backstreet culture to a mainstream one and to bring abortion closer to communities says Manning As for changing the culture of silence around abortion thats will probably take a long time to address he says Those practitioners have another role to play When I met Horo earlier this year at the clinic in Khunti she had come for a second abortion Ill come here again and again if I have to she said But she may no longer need to contemplate ending an unwanted pregnancy Until she came to the clinic Horo had no easy way to obtain birth control pills Now she relies on the clinic for birth control and recently got a contraceptive injection Copyright 2014 NPR,20141006,abortion

Shes wearing a nuns habit Sister Forcades is Spains most famous living nun Shes a medical doctor with a masters degree from Harvard Shes a feminist whos been reprimanded by the Vatican for supporting abortion rights Shes a Benedictine nun in a country where the Catholic Church has historically sided with fascists And shes hugely popular Forcades has emerged as one of the leaders of Europes new left wing At the height of Spains economic crisis she started a new political movement Proces Constituent which calls on the Spanish government to leave the eurozone nationalize all banks and grant freedom to Catalonia  the wealthy northeast region of Spain from which Forcades hails With a frenetic schedule of speaking engagements Forcades was in Spain for just five hours one recent afternoon on her way home from a leftwing political conference in Croatia and before jetting off to teach feminist theology in Germany NPR arranged to meet her at the airport give her a lift and interview her en route to her monastery on the sacred Montserrat mountain north of Barcelona Navigating a hilly switchback road I asked about her lectures in Germany Isnt feminist Catholic theology an oxymoron Thats what I thought as a teenager Forcades exclaims Because many of the messages that still today the Catholic Church gives to the world  in terms of rights of women sexual morality and contraception  conflict directly with the historical achievements of the feminist movement The church is an institution in which patriarchy is rampant All the decisionmaking is linked to something called ordination and ordination is linked to something called gender she says with an ironic smile So its clear that I did not join the church because I thought as an institution its wonderful for a feminist Instead she says she ended up in the clergy as a fluke Born in 1966 to an atheist family in Catalonia Forcades went to medical school in Barcelona and then did her residency at a hospital in Buffalo NY She eventually went on to get a masters degree from Harvard Divinity School and a PhD in public health But in the summer of 1995 she was just looking for a quiet place to study for her US medical board exams Thats how I arrived in July 1995 at what is now my home not with the intention to become a nun but the intention to prepare for my medical boards in the United States she says laughing But she never left Forcades describes her experience of reading the Bible for the first time as a commotion It was something that touched me very deeply  one of those experiences that are impossible to explain she says Two years after arriving at the Sant Benet Monastery in Monserrat she took her vows to become a Benedictine nun Since then she has lived at the same monastery practicing medicine singing and praying at church services several times a day and combining her passion for God with her passion for social justice I was listening yesterday to a speech by Martin Luther King Jr on the Vietnam War Its so impressive I can listen to him forever Because its so to the point and its so respectful and so full of common sense she says You just listen to him and feel Yeah You want to shout like they do in Baptist churches Yeah sister brother yeah Just go for it  Forcades latest crusade is for Catalan independence She has become one of the most prominent faces of the secessionist movement in Catalonia which seeks to break away from Spain and form its own country in Europe I am in favor of the independence of my country because I do believe that for true democracy to be real or possible you need small political units she says offering the example of the US in which many powers are devolved to the state rather than federal level I want to avoid what unfortunately has been so prevalent for the Catalans We complain to our local government the Catalan government and the local government says Yeah you are right but you know what Its Madrids fault OK so we go to Madrid and Madrid says Yes youre right but you know what Its Brussels fault  she says I dont like growing huge empirelike structures that are removed from the people Forcades is a frequent commentator on Spanish TV Thats where a few years ago she voiced her support for abortion rights  on live TV A letter of reprimand swiftly arrived from the Vatican And Forcades wrote back posing a philosophical question to the Vatican in response So lets imagine you have a father and the father has a compatible kidney and you have a child an innocent child who needs the kidney Is the church ready to force the father to give the kidney to save the childs life she says recounting her reply to the Vatican That the right to life of the child takes precedence over the right to selfdetermination to his own body of the father And that was my question I sent to Rome in 2009 She received no reply back So for now Sister Teresa remains very much part of the church  and proud to sometimes disagree with it On a tour of her monastery perched on a mountain over Barcelona with the serrated peaks of Monserrat mountain beside it Forcades points to a special olive tree This is the olive tree that my friends  members of an ecologist group to which I belonged as a teenager  gave me when I did my first vows to become a nun They gave me this little trunk of a tree barely 6 inches tall and we planted it here at the monastery she says wistfully And now its 17 years old As you can see its bearing fruit So is Teresas work Her home region of Catalonia plans to vote this fall on whether to break away from Spain
