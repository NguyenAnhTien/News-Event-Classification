MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/supreme-court-puts-texas-abortion-law-hold, The Supreme Court has temporarily reversed the devastating impact of Texas s restrictive abortion law  blocking a law that earlier this month had closed all but eight legal abortion clinics in the second largest state  The immediate result  a rare victory for abortion rights  is the expected reopening of 13 clinics that closed on October 2  Three members of the court  Antonin Scalia  Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito   said they would have denied the clinics  appeal entirely  Either or both Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy appear to have signed on with the court s liberals  both voted to let an earlier portion of the law to go into effect  which also closed more than a dozen clinics  Close

access  thanks to a Texas law that an appeals court allowed to go into effect on October 2  This is the story of Whole Woman s Health in McAllen  which has struggled to serve    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss Tuesday s action is temporary and doesn t bind the justices  votes if and when they hear the case in full  The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals  which had waved in the law earlier this month  still will have its say  Because the majority votes were not recorded  it is not clear how exactly Roberts and Kennedy voted  but at least one had to have voted with the majority  and it is notable that only three Justices chose to visibly dissent  Kennedy has not voted to strike down an abortion restriction since Planned Parenthood vs  Casey in 1992  when he struck down the part of a Pennsylvania law that required that a husband consent to an abortion During his time on the Supreme Court  Roberts has never struck down an abortion restriction  Of all the hundreds of abortion restrictions passed across the country since 2010  Texas s omnibus abortion law has had the most profound impact  in part because of the state s size  because it was the only law of its kind that was fully allowed to go into effect  and because its sweeping provisions have  combined  closed 80  of the state s clinics  leaving nearly 1 million women of reproductive age at least a 300 mile roundtrip from a clinic  RELATED Texas abortion clinics appeal to Supreme Court The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals had allowed the law to go into effect on Oct  2  despite a district court finding  after a full trial  that the law unduly burdened the constitutional rights of Texas s women  particularly women in the Rio Grande Valley and in El Paso  Experts testified  for example  that the Rio Grande Valley had seen a rise in illegal abortion  The Supreme Court s move also appeared to allow the two clinics that closed in that region   including Whole Woman s Health in McAllen  which had temporarily resumed operations  to reopen   Tonight  our reality in Texas was recognized by SCOTUS and they ruled on the side of Texan women  We are so proud to have led this fight  I tip my hat to the team at the Center for Reproductive Rights  to my wonderful team at Whole Woman s Health and to all of our colleagues who were part of this lawsuit  We did it  Tonight Texan woman got justice the clinic s president and CEO  Amy Hagstrom Miller  said in a statement  Cecile Richards  president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America  said in a statement We re seeing the terrible impact these restrictions have on thousands of Texas women who effectively no longer have access to safe and legal abortion  We re relieved that the court stepped in to stop this  and we hope this dangerous law is ultimately overturned completely  The main provision the Supreme Court addressed Tuesday requires abortion clinics to spend millions of dollars to turn into mini hospitals  it has had the most sweeping impact  Combined with an earlier provision requiring abortion providers have hospital admitting privileges  which the Supreme Court allowed to take effect  Close video       PoliticsNation

facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss The Democratic candidate for governor Wendy Davis  famously filibustered the abortion law in June 2013  surrounded by hundreds of fierce activists  But Texas Gov  Rick Perry subsequently convened another special session to pass it anyway  The law also includes an unconstitutional ban on abortion after 20 weeks  which has not been challenged in court  and restrictions on medication abortion  which the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals  ruling on an Arizona version of the law  said defied medical evidence and was an undue burden on women  Davis  who has been trailing in the polls against Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott  went after her GOP challenger on abortion rights in the final debate of the gubernatorial campaign late last month  Texas has also been ground zero in the fight over access to the ballot box  with a slew of court rulings on its strict voter ID law  An appeals court on Tuesday ruled that the law could go into effect for the upcoming election  Attorneys for the clinics had argued that if the clinics closed while their appeals proceeded  they might never reopen even if the law was ultimately found unconstitutional  because they would lose their licenses and their buildings  If the Supreme Court didn t act  they argued   these clinics will soon have to lay off their staffs and close for good  Women who had appointments at these clinics  which have been providing safe abortion services for years  are being turned away  The handful of abortion providers remaining in Texas do not have the capacity to treat all of these women in the upcoming months  even if the women could travel the distances necessary to reach them  As a result  many women s constitutional rights will be extinguished before the appellate process runs its course  and their lives will be permanently and profoundly altered by the denial of abortion services  The Supreme Court was their last hope  and this time  it came through   This fight against Texas  sham abortion law is not over  said Nancy Northup of the Center for Reproductive Rights   HB2  the law in question  was designed to gut the constitutional protections of Roe v Wade and half of the state s clinics remain closed  We will continue this legal battle until the rights of Texas women are restored  RELATED Supreme Court s new session could bring decisions on huge issues The court has yet to make a broader statement about how far states can go in blocking a woman s path to an abortion  The controlling Supreme Court case  Planned Parenthood v  Casey  in which Justice Anthony Kennedy was the swing vote  said states couldn t put an  undue burden  on women  But in its most recent Texas decision  the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals all but demanded the court re evaluate that test  by essentially giving the state free rein to restrict abortion even without showing proof that the law had a legitimate purpose   In our circuit  we do not balance the wisdom or effectiveness of a law against the burdens the law imposes  wrote George W  Bush appointee Jennifer Elrod in the decision  She added  in a quote that seemed designed to highlight the split in the lower courts that forms a common rationale for the Supreme Court to take a case We agree with Plaintiffs that some circuits have used the balancing test to enjoin abortion regulations  other circuits including ours have not  Six justices on the Supreme Court were unwilling to follow in her footsteps   for now  I don t believe there has ever been as many important stay orders from SCOTUS in one 2 week period  Ever  Abortion  Voting Rights  Elections  Eric Segall  espinsegall  October 14  2014 Tonight s SCOTUS  HB2 ruling is great news for Texas patients  Long road ahead but let s enjoy the win

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/midterms-mean-high-stakes-for-women-voters, For many voters and political observers  the big question in the 2014 midterm election is which party will end up in control of the U S  Senate  The answer will impact presidential nominations  future legislation and greatly influence the remainder of President Obama s term  But real policy changes in this country will happen at the state level  with massive implications for all Americans  and especially American women   Close video         10 29 14  6 03 PM ET       New twist in the  War on Women        Remember the GOP s  war on women  Midterm voters don t seem to  While the message hasn t changed  the claims aren t sticking on 2014 GOP women candidates    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss These elections should not be ignored  for in this country  the fate of women often rests in the hands of state legislatures  Remember the 2010 midterms  I was running for Congress at the time so every detail of that cycle is indelibly stamped on my brain  The economy was terrible  as opposed to merely bad as it is now  The bloom was not yet off  the tea party rose  and candidates were coming up with all sorts of innovative ways to explain just how big the national debt was  if you stacked dollar bills to the moon     Of course we all remember the end result on Election Night  Nancy Pelosi s time as speaker came to an unceremonious end  Republicans moved into governors  mansions across the country and notably  Republicans gained control of an unprecedented number of state legislatures  Michigan  New Hampshire  Iowa  Alabama  North Carolina and more all had legislative chambers flip to GOP control  Republicans picked up more than 675 legislative seats  the largest swing of any party since 1938  Close video         10 29 14  5 54 PM ET       Everyone gets harassed  Women have it worst        New Pew data proves for the first time what Internet users have always known  it s tough to be a young woman on the web    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss But no one could have predicted what would happen next  Virtually all the Republican campaign rhetoric had focused on  out of control spending  and the evil Obama Pelosi monster  But  as it turned out  Republicans had failed to mention a few other agenda items  Once they had control of state legislatures  Republican state leaders immediately set out not just to cut budgets  but also to pass voter suppression laws and to wage an all out  record breaking war on women s rights  If you are wondering where the  war on women  came from  this was it  Voters who thought they were choosing fiscal restraint ended up with legislation on transvaginal probes  In North Carolina  we got the most restrictive abortion bill in the state s history attached to a bill about motorcycle safety  In New Hampshire  family planning funding was cut by more than half and funding for Planned Parenthood was completely eliminated  Personhood became a household word  The initiative to severely limit access to contraception and abortion by defining life as beginning at conception has yet to pass   but has become the extreme new goal for anti choice advocates  RELATED Krystal Ball answers your election questions in a Twitter chat According to the Guttmacher Institute  in 2011  the first year of the new Republican class  the number of abortion restrictions skyrocketed  Eleven hundred anti women bills were introduced in state houses across the country and a record breaking 135 of these provisions were signed into law  Since then  we have had more anti choice bills passed into law then in the entire prior decade  And it all started not because congressional seats changed hands  although the House GOP has certainly caused plenty of trouble  too  but because power shifted in state legislatures across the country  This cycle could easily produce even worse results in terms of state GOP control  According to The Washington Post   Republicans have the opportunity to take control of a record number of state legislative chambers across the country this year  Democrats control 39 chambers while Republicans control 59 and are in position to gain even more  Overall  Governing Magazine finds 11 chambers where Democrats could realistically lose control to Republicans  In Colorado  both the House and the Senate are at risk of flipping  With the Colorado gubernatorial race currently deadlocked  a bad night for Democrats in Colorado could hand complete control of both state bodies and the governor s mansion to Republicans  allowing them to act with no Democratic check whatsoever  The stakes are also high in Iowa where Republicans hold both the House and the governor s mansion  which they look likely to retain  Democrats are defending a slim two seat majority in the Iowa Senate  Kentucky s House could also go Republican  joining the already safe Republican Senate  RELATED Melissa Harris Perry answers your questions on the 2014 midterms The results of these races and more could be devastating for American women whose access to abortion  family planning services  and cancer screenings are already under assault  A 2011 study found that 87  of U S  counties lack an abortion provider and that abortion providers are virtually non existent outside of metro areas  Through laws requiring medically unnecessary procedures  waiting periods  hospital admitting privileges  bans on insurance coverage of abortion  elimination of state funding to Planned Parenthood  and unnecessary regulation targeted simply at forcing the closure of clinics  Republicans have systematically made the right to abortion theoretical rather than a truly accessible one for millions of American women  In 2012  women revolted against these incredible restrictions voting in historic numbers for Obama and creating the largest voting gender gap ever recorded  And Republican candidates of 2014 are presenting themselves as a kinder  gentler sort  Several  including Colorado s Cory Gardner who is running for Senate  have actually touted their support for over the counter birth control access as a way of masking their opposition to the birth control coverage provided by Obamacare  But the party platform hasn t changed  There is absolutely no reason to think that handing more state legislative bodies to Republicans will be any different in 2014 than what we got in 2010  The national groups crafting model legislation to push out to amenable state houses across the country are still well funded and ready to pounce  If the polls hold we could be looking for  and should expect  a massive assault on women s rights  Prepare yourself for a whole new war on women  ,11/02/14 12:15

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/republicans-bite-their-tongues-following-marriage-breakthrough, The U S  Supreme Court today made big news when it cleared the way for marriage equality in several states  Indeed  five states joined the marriage equality club today  and with six more on the way  the number of states that treat same sex couples equally is poised to reach 30    And in response to the news  Republicans  longtime opponents of gay rights who pushed for an anti gay constitutional amendment in the not too distant past  said   very little  Kate Nocera reported this afternoon  As of Monday afternoon  Sen  Mike Lee was the lone GOP member to issue a statement  His home state of Utah was one of the states where a marriage ban was overturned by an appeals court and the state is now moving forward with allowing same sex couples to marry  Lee called the Supreme Court decision to not review the appeals  disappointing    Supreme Court decisions are often met with swift reaction from members on Capitol Hill  filling reporter s inboxes with statements of disappointment or support for whatever the justices have ruled  All the more when the decision impacts a hot button social issue    The muted response from congressional Republicans is telling  It is  indeed  News from the high court  especially on high profile issues like this one  usually generates a flood of press releases  Today  Nocera found one GOP senator weighing in   Mike Lee s home state of Utah was directly affected by this morning s developments   and no one else  On the other side of Capitol Hill  I checked the websites for the House Speaker  House Majority Leader  House Majority Whip  and House Conference Chair  and combined  the four Republican leaders said a grand total of nothing    The same goes for the Republican National Committee  the National Republican Campaign Committee  and the National Republicans Senatorial Committee  all of which published literally zero words on the subject    In fairness  when Congress is out of session  members  offices tend to have less to say on most issues  which is true of both parties  But note that in Democratic circles  both the DNC and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi s office were eager to celebrate today s news from the Supreme Court    A decade ago  Republicans saw marriage equality as a terrific wedge issue  to be exploited as often as possible  In 2014  GOP leaders can t even be bothered to make vague criticisms of court rulings they ostensibly don t like as same sex marriage reaches 60  of the nation    It s against this backdrop that Irin Carmon made a good catch following one of the Sunday shows  If Republicans are so confident in their positions on abortion and contraception  why do they keep shying away from discussing them   or changing the subject to something different altogether  Nowhere was this clearer than in a recent interview by the head of the Republican National Committee    On NBC s  Meet the Press  on Sunday  host Chuck Todd asked RNC Chair Reince Priebus about his agenda  and then followed up with   One of the things in here that you didn t mention  there s a lot of social issues  Why was that  He added   It seems like you re nervous about it  Are social issues working against you guys  Imagine that    Asked specifically about Republican imposed regulations closing most of Texas  abortion clinics  the chairman of the Republican National Committee replied   Well  you obviously have to talk to someone in Texas  and then changed the subject    Irin did some additional fact checking on Priebus  answers yesterday  but the larger takeaway is hard to miss  Clearly  the  culture war  isn t over  at least as far as conservative policymakers are concerned  but GOP officials now see these hot button social issues as an electoral risk in ways they didn t before    No wonder Republicans don t want to talk about marriage today    ,10/06/14 03:34 PM,abortion

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/reproductive-rights-proponents-score-court-victories-texas-louisiana, Since early 2011  state Republican officials have placed an enormous emphasis on restricting women s reproductive rights  and have generally been quite successful  But proponents of abortion rights have had one refuge  the courts    This was evident late Friday in Texas  A federal judge in Austin  Tex  blocked a stringent new rule on Friday that would have forced more than half of the state s remaining abortion clinics to close  the latest in a string of court decisions that have at least temporarily kept abortion clinics across the South from being shuttered    The Texas rule  requiring all abortion clinics to meet the building  equipment and staffing standards of hospital style surgery centers  had been set to take effect on Monday  But in his opinion  Judge Lee Yeakel of the United States District Court in Austin said the mandate placed unjustified obstacles on women s access to abortion without providing significant medical benefits  In the ruling  available online here  the George W  Bush appointee said Texas  rule  is unconstitutional because it imposes an undue burden on the right of women throughout Texas to seek a pre viability abortion    The news out of the Lone Star State coincided with a similar ruling in Louisiana  where a federal judge blocked the state from enforcing a new anti abortion measure on admitting privileges  The law requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges to a hospital within 30 miles of their clinics  A lawsuit by the Center for Reproductive Rights claims that doctors have not had enough time to obtain privileges  and that the law likely would force Louisiana s five clinics to close     Judge John W  deGravelles said the doctors  risk of fines and losing licenses outweighed any injury to the state from keeping the status quo  He noted that the state health secretary said she would not enforce the law against doctors awaiting decisions from hospitals to which they have applied  The judge  an Obama appointee  allowed the measure to take effect  but ruled that while the legal process continues  Louisiana cannot penalize those who break this law    Both rulings come on the heels of related pro choice victories in Alabama  North Dakota  North Carolina  Wisconsin  Arizona and Idaho    The broader question  however  is about how long these victories will stand    MSNBC s Irin Carmon reported over the weekend on the fragility of the legal success stories  Much depends now on the Fifth Circuit  where the three judges that heard the prior provision of Texas law shrugged off the burden on women  but where more recently three different judges allowed the last clinic in Mississippi to stay open under threat of a similar admitting privileges law  saying a state could not delegate constitutional rights to its neighbor  Indeed  Texas had made a similar argument to Mississippi  despite the fact that most of its neighbors  with the exception of New Mexico  were adopting similar laws to close clinics      The decision in Louisiana is a more provisional one  hinging on a technicality  since that state gave clinics only eighty one days to comply with the law and hospitals have no obligation to reply within that timeframe  Watch this space    ,09/02/14 11:25 AM,abortion
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/could-colorado-lose-democrats-the-senate, ELDORADO SPRINGS  Colorado   When Sen  Mark Udall tried to climb Mt  Everest in 1996  60 mile per hour winds on the mountain s north face forced him to turn back The point  the Colorado Democrat said last week as he walked down the road to the Mesa Trailhead near his home here   is to come home alive  It doesn t count if you touch the top of the mountain and you don t make it back The stakes Udall faces now aren t life and death but if he loses his unexpectedly close bid for re election against Republican Rep  Cory Gardner in November  control of the Senate is all but guaranteed to flip to the GOP  Democrats can only lose a net of five seats to retain control of the chamber  with red state races in Arkansas  Alaska  Arkansas and Louisiana all more likely to flip than blue Colorado  a Udall loss could be catastrophic This has always been a tough map from the very beginning  said Udall s fellow Democratic Colorado senator  Michael Bennet  who this year is running the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee   We ve known it was going to be a tough map But Udall s race in what has been an increasingly Democratic state has been creeping closer and closer as the months have worn on  President Obama is becoming more unpopular  The genial  mild mannered Gardner  his hobby  restoring antique furniture  is a contrast with the firebrand conservatives who ran unsuccessfully for Senate and governor in the state in 2010  and national Republicans considered it a coup when they convinced Gardner to jump into the race   It relegated Ken Buck  the erstwhile 2010 Senate nominee who lost to Bennet  to running for the House   A big smile s a nice thing  I think we hall have big smiles  but your record matters  your actions matter  To beat Gardner  Udall has been almost singularly focused on the Republican s support for hard line positions on abortion and contraception  Nearly half of Udall s ads have attacked Gardner for  among other things  supporting a state  personhood  initiative that could criminalize many forms of birth control A big smile s a nice thing  I think we hall have big smiles  but your record matters  your actions matter  Udall told msnbc   His positions would move us backwards Gardner has since reversed his stance on the state personhood measure   But his name is still on a very similar federal law There is no federal personhood bill   they re two different pieces of legsiatlion  And I understand Sen  Udall he wants to run away from the failed economy  Garnder said when asked about the Life at Conception Act  which Personhood USA  which supports such initiatives around the country  says is in fact a federal personhood measure Asked to identify the difference between Colorado s state initiative and the nationwide version  Gardner focused on procedural differences  not policy Again  you re talking about a bill that s at the state level that was at the amendment to the constitution  They re different from a procedural posture they re different language  Gardner s discomfort crystallizes what the race is really about  women  particularly unmarried women who live in Denver and its surrounding suburbs Younger  single voters tend to participate less in midterm elections than in presidential contests  With his focus on reproductive health care  Udall is counting on a turnout boost among young women  Gardner s challenge is convincing those women that they should be focused on other issues  His approach so far is twofold  He s trying to tie Udall to Obama  and he s going after the Udall family for its long history in politics  Mark Udall s father  Mo Udall  was a near legendary Democratic senator from Arizona who made a short lived run for president in 1976 Eighteen years in politics and he s got two cousins who are senators too  Mark Udall s dad even ran for president  a new Gardner ad declares  Udall s two cousins are Democrat Tom Udall of New Mexico and Mike Lee of Utah Udall took umbrage at the ad  demanding it be taken down No way  Gardner said   I m running against a person who has a Wikipedia page for his political dynasty   I m running against a person who has a Wikipedia name a Wikipedia page for his political dynasty that his family runs  Gardner said in an interview Gardner also insists that his rival is much closer to Obama than he tries to claim  during a recent debate  Gardner supporters hooted and laughed when Udall declared Let me tell you  the White House when they look down the front lawn the last person they want to see coming is me  Udall says he has stood up to Obama on a range of issues  including abuses at the CIA and National Security Agency  Still  he is one of the only lawmakers to ever play golf with the president Over the last six months I ve been a thorn in their side  On the NSA  on the VA  Veterans Affairs  on the CIA  they haven t always been happy to take my phone calls over there  Udall said What s not clear at this point  though  is whether Udall or Gardner will be able to break the race out of the pattern it s been stuck in for months  And observers are also raising questions about the governor s race also taking place in the state and how it will affect the Senate contest   Democratic Gov  John Hickenlooper has dropped in polls in recent weeks amid controversies over the death penalty and guns At particular issue  Hickenlooper s reprieve for Nathan Dunlap  who was convicted of killing four people in a shooting rampage at a Chuck E  Cheese where he worked  In an interview with CNN  Hickenlooper suggested that he might grant full clemency to Dunlap an idea that drew a rebuke even from Udall   No  Udall said when asked if he believed Dunlap should be granted clemency Hickenlooper s challenges could affect the makeup of the midterm electorate in Colorado  which is Udall s other critical hurdle  Democrats are quick to insist that their operation in the state is unparalleled  Udall aides say their data is so good that they are targeting not just counties or ZIP codes but individual voters  Nationally  the Democratic turnout operation is called the Bannock Street Project  after the Denver roadway where Bennet had his headquarters in 2010 and won in a strongly Republican year Forty days out we ve got a ground game here that we ve never seen in an off year election  Bennet said of the 2014 effort   Three times better than when I ran Another potential wrench for Democrats  Pot  When Obama won the state by  5 points in 2012  an initiative to legalize marijuana was on the ballot  possibly lifting participation among younger  Democratic leaning voters  There s no comparable measure ballot this time  Udall says that he s trying to help the new marijuana industry get access to banking services  but that s not a major issue in the race  As for the candidates themselves  Both say they ve stayed away No  I haven t  No  No  Gardner insisted when asked if he d consumed any legal marijuana Said Udall   I have not  Poll  Will Democrats hold onto the Senate in November   ,10/02/14 12:03 PM,abortion
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/avoiding-womens-issues-wont-save-the-gop, Karl Rove s super PAC recently presented a poll to top Republican aides telling them that their party is viewed by women as  intolerant   lacking in compassion  and  stuck in the past  They didn t need a poll to tell them that  They should have gotten this message from the 2012 election   not to mention their own widely publicized rebranding efforts last year  But instead of changing the policies that repel women voters across the political spectrum  many Senate candidates have gone into  stealth mode  to avoid talking publicly about their positions on crucial women s health issues  It s a tactic that women see right through   and it won t fix the GOP s fundamental problems with women   Everywhere you look on the Senate battleground map  there are stealth candidates fudging answers to the questions they can t dodge outright  After witnessing the Senate campaigns of Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock burst into flames after they blurted out their true beliefs in 2012  today s Senate candidates were instructed to follow a new strategy  Keep your mouths shut  Everywhere you look on the Senate battleground map  there are stealth candidates fudging answers to the questions they can t dodge outright  even if it makes them look as ridiculous as Scott Brown did when he hid in a diner restroom to avoid talking about the Hobby Lobby birth control decision  It s not like he was unfamiliar with this topic  As a senator  Brown previously voted for the Blunt amendment to allow employers to deny women birth control coverage in their health insurance  But it s dangerous ground as a candidate these days  and Scott Brown knows it  Then there is former Alaska attorney general and Senate candidate Dan Sullivan  who seems happy enough to have anti women s health positions as long as he doesn t have to talk about them  His website states that  life begins at conception  and as attorney general he approved a ballot measure to put anti science views in the Alaska state constitution  There was a time when he seemed loud and proud about these policies  but now he needs women s votes  and suddenly he can t find his voice  When asked whether he supports the federal Life at Conception Act  he gave the lawyerly dodge that he hadn t read the bill   a crafty attempt to create doubt about what had once been his very clearly stated position  Another egregious example comes from Colorado  where Rep  Cory Gardner has never previously hesitated to impose his own political beliefs on the women of Colorado  Gardner has long supported  personhood  measures that are intended to outlaw abortion  and which could interfere with decisions about birth control as well  Many consider the  personhood  movement radical  which is why it should surprise no one that Rep  Gardner  now a Senate candidate  has shifted his position   even though he s still a co sponsor of the federal version of this bill  the Life at Conception Act   This year s crop of candidates acts like they deserve gold stars for learning to keep their opinions to themselves  This  duck and cover  strategy explains why many Senate candidates have gone silent about the Supreme Court s recent Hobby Lobby ruling  which allows businesses that claim a religious objection to discriminate against female employees in health care   There is no need to draw attention to an issue that is so down in the weeds said one GOP strategist  If left unchecked by political reporters  this conspiracy of silence rewards politicians who run from important issues  though hiding in a bathroom didn t do Brown any favors  Birth control in particular is an incredibly important economic issue  especially for the 48 5 million American women who are eligible to get birth control without a copay  For those doing the math  women saved  483 million on birth control over the previous year and picked up 24 million more prescriptions  That kind of money pays a lot of grocery bills and fills a lot of gas tanks  That s the kind of good news politicians should embrace  not hide from  At least Akin was willing to say what he believed  This year s crop of candidates acts like they deserve gold stars for learning to keep their opinions to themselves about issues like abortion  on which 70  of the country disagrees with them  according to a recent poll  To paraphrase a former Republican icon  these stealth candidates might be able to fool some of the women some of the time  but the Republican Party won t be able to rehabilitate itself with women until they actually change their positions that offend most of the women all of the time   Dawn Laguens is the executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund  ,09/05/14 11:34 AM,abortion

feelings until it s too late  And he is reportedly considering a run for President  That s why my letter of the week is to Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker  Dear Governor Walker  It s me  Melissa  Now  before you run for President  you probably need to get re elected as Governor next month  And I know that your opponent  Mary Burke  has you up against the ropes  So I want to talk to you about your new campaign ad   I m pro life  But there s no doubt in my mind the decision of whether or not to end a pregnancy is an agonizing one  That s why I support legislation to increase safety and to provide more information for a woman considering her options  The bill leaves the final decision to a woman and her doctor  Now  reasonable people can disagree on this issue  Our priority is to protect the health and safety of all Wisconsin citizens  Well that sounds just so gosh darn reasonable  You reasonably believe that the choice to terminate a pregnancy should be between a woman and her doctor and nobody else  There s a problem with all this reasonableness though  You  And what you really think  You  governor  don t want the choice to be between a woman and her doctor  You oppose abortion  All of it  You are on the record as being quote  100 percent pro life  That s not a throwaway line  That s a designation from the anti abortion group Pro Life Wisconsin  And it s hard to win Pro Life Wisconsin s political endorsement  You had to say you believe in no abortions  under any circumstances   not early in a pregnancy  not late in a pregnancy  not for rape or incest  not to protect the health or even the life of the pregnant woman  not for financial reasons  not because the woman thinks it s in her own best interest to terminate  As a state representative in 1999  you wrote a bill that would outlaw the University of Wisconsin Madison medical school from  teaching medical students  how to perform abortions  You wrote another bill in 2001 that would allow pharmacists to refuse to fill prescriptions that conflict with their beliefs  So even if a  woman and her doctor  had decided emergency contraception was the right call  a pharmacist could deny her that care  You are so pro life that you used to oppose the death penalty   until that became politically untenable  And then there s the law you signed just last year   the one you are defending in that new TV ad   that would require doctors performing termination services to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles  Governor  it is difficult bordering on impossible to obtain those privileges because abortion is so safe already that doctors performing them don t bring in enough patients to a hospital to warrant admitting privileges  This law is being challenged in the courts   but if allowed to go into effect  it would close down at least one of your state s four abortion clinics  It would greatly reduce the number of abortions performed at another  It would severely restrict women s access to legal reproductive care  And you hide this behind the seemingly good intention of protecting women  You want to make abortion safer  governor  Make it easier to access  That way  women can terminate a pregnancy early on  under the care of a doctor  rather than waiting until late in the pregnancy  when the risk of complications is higher  You re pro life   so surely you want to prevent abortion  The way to do that is simple  just help women prevent unplanned pregnancies  Make sure they have access to affordable birth control and to affordable  nearby  qualified doctors  If you were doing that  I might believe you that your goal is to protect the health and safety of all Wisconsin citizens  But you have done the exact opposite  Your budget eliminated state funding for Planned Parenthood clinics  It was sold as a way to prevent taxpayer dollars from funding abortions  But what really happened is that five clinics run by Planned Parenthood  all in rural areas  have shut down as a direct result of losing state funding  Not one of those clinics performed abortions  They provided other  crucial  affordable health care for women  screenings for breast and cervical cancer   and birth control   and STD testing and treatment   and health exams  And you shut them down  You say you care about women s health and safety  But come on  governor  don t hide your anti abortion ideal  When someone asks who opposes reproductive freedom   raise your hand  Let that anti choice flag fly because the people of Wisconsin have a right to know the real you this time around

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/faulty-memory-trips-scott-brown-again, A New Hampshire Public Radio reporter asked former Sen  Scott Brown  R  this week about a controversial bill he co sponsored while serving in his other home state of Massachusetts  it would have imposed a 24 hour abortion waiting period  What s more  Brown s bill would have required women to review information about fetal development before terminating an unwanted pregnancy    The Republican candidate apparently can t remember the proposal he used to support   I m not familiar with the specific bill that you re referring to  Brown said in response to a question from Knoy about the Women s Right To Know Act   I m not sure if it s wrong  but I ve voted on probably 8 000 bills give or take in my lifetime  That may be true  though the question wasn t about a bill he voted on  it was in reference to a bill he co sponsored  This requires a very different level of commitment  beyond casting a vote on an unfamiliar piece of legislation  Asked if he thought his bill sounds like  a good idea  Brown dodged and said   I m not familiar with what you re referring to    Benjy Sarlin added that the Massachusetts bill  which did not pass  shouldn t be too obscure to the Republican candidate   Brown s support for the so called  Women s Right To Know  bill was used against him repeatedly during his 2010 and 2012 U S  Senate campaigns in a nearby state    Of course  it s certainly possible that Brown s just forgetful  Maybe he doesn t remember endorsing the legislation  Perhaps he no longer recalls being asked about the legislation during two of his statewide campaigns over the last four years    But if so  is it safe to say Brown s memory is just really bad  Consider recent history    In May  for example  Brown blasted Sen  Jeanne Shaheen  D N H  for having raised the debt ceiling and preventing U S  default  He apparently forgot that he d voted for the exact same measures at the exact same time  making his criticism appear pretty foolish  even for him    Soon after  Brown suggested New Hampshire residents who gained health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act might be  grandfathered in  so they don t lose their insurance  He apparently forgot that isn t his actual position on health care policy  so it fell to an aide to remind the former senator that he disagrees with what he said    In August  Brown condemned  in state tuition for illegals  apparently forgetting that he d already voted for legislation to make undocumented immigrants eligible for in state tuition rates in his previous home state    Sure  some politicians are going to have better memories than others  but Brown s forgetfulness is starting to look pretty bad    ,09/24/14 04:45 PM,abortion

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/races-are-tight-gop-looks-seize-control-the-senate, On Tuesday  millions of Americans will head to the polls to vote in the most costly midterm elections ever  Here s what you need to know  Late in the game polling is predicting a strong night for the GOP on Tuesday  as the party appears poised to regain control of the Senate and make gains in the House of Representatives  But many races remain extremely tight  and candidates of both parties are on a last minute campaign blitz as they aim to mobilize the vote and swing races in their direction    view infographic     Interactive  2014 Senate landscape   To secure control of the upper chamber  Republicans need to pick up six seats seven if Kansas  wild card independent wins and chooses to caucus with the Democrats as he s hinted he might  Three states currently held by Democrats   Montana  West Virginia and South Dakota   are likely to be pickups for the GOP  leaving three or four more seats the party needs to win control   The fate of the Senate will be decided by close races in these states  Alaska  Arkansas  Louisiana  Colorado  Georgia  Iowa  New Hampshire  Kentucky  Kansas and North Carolina  In Kentucky polls suggest incumbent Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has pulled ahead of Alison Lundergan Grimes  the young Democrat championed by the Clintons  In a recent NBC Marist survey McConnell leads Grimes by nine points among likely voters  50  to 41  A win for McConnell  a 30 year Senate veteran  would position him to become Senate majority leader next year if his party does as well as expected  Related  McConnell campaign event proves sleepy  underwhelming  In Arkansas  Republican Tom Cotton is leading Democrat incumbent Sen  Mark Pryor  The gap has been closing  An NBC News Wall Street Journal poll late last month showed Cotton leading by just two points  a month earlier  he lead by five  Still  it s an upward climb for the Democrat whose president is hugely unpopular just 34  of Arkansas voters say they approve of the job Obama is doing  Cotton has hit Pryor hard  both over his vote for Obamacare and in general on the president s unpopular agenda  In Iowa  the Des Moines Register s final poll of the election saw Republican Joni Ernst polling seven points ahead of Democrat Bruce Braley  even as Braley and other Democrats argue that the poll is inaccurate Neither side believes that  Democrat Sen  Tom Harkin said at a rally for Braley   I just don t buy the poll because we haven t had an open seat in 40 years  Ernst s folksy  Sarah Palin esque demeanor has captured many voters in the Democratic leaning state  while Braley has struggled to recover from a handful of gaffes  particularly his condescending remark that the state s senior Sen  Chuck Grassley was just  a farmer from Iowa without a law degree  Related  Iowa Democrats  The polls are wrong In Louisiana  incumbent Democrat Sen  Mary Landrieu has been running behind  but this race is likely to go to a run off if none of the three candidates earn a majority on Tuesday  Landrieu has been dragged down by President Obama s low popularity ratings in the state  and Landrieu has sought to ally herself to a more popular Democrat  Hillary Clinton  In Georgia  Democrat Michelle Nunn is in a tight race with Republican David Perdue  This race may also end up in run off if neither candidate earns 50  of the vote  since Libertarian Amanda Swafford is likely to pick up a small share for herself  Perdue  a millionaire businessman  has been criticized for his support of outsourcing jobs overseas  while Nunn  like other red state Democrats  has been hit as a  rubber stamp  to Obama  Related  Democratic hopes run high in Georgia s toss up Senate race In Alaska polling is historically unreliable  but incumbent Democrat Sen  Mark Begich and Republican Dan Sullivan are dueling in an undeniably tight race  According to a RealClearPolitics average of all the polls taken  Sullivan is in the lead  Still  it may be weeks until we know  In 2008  it took two weeks for ballots many of them absentee to be counted Sullivan has painted himself as a conservative family man and has hit Begich for his connection to Washington s Democratic elite  the economy  and Obamacare  Begich has hit Sullivan for his opposition to abortion and championed his mastery of local issues  In Colorado  the state where President Obama accepted his party s nomination for president six years ago  incumbent Democratic Sen  Mark Udall is struggling to hold his seat in one of the country s tightest races  Most surveys have shown Republican Rep  Cory Gardner polling a few points ahead of Udall  Women s issues have dominated Colorado s race  with Udall betting big on Gardner s opposition to abortion would help produce a large enough margin among women voters for Udall to eke out a win  In New Hampshire Democrats are counting on incumbent Sen  Jeanne Shaheen to hold off Republican Scott Brown Shaheen has portrayed Brown  a former Massachusetts senator  as a carpetbagger  while Brown has attacked her as being a vote for Obama s policies  In Kansas  Independent Greg Orman has been running even with or ahead of Republican Pat Roberts  a surprising turn of events in one of the nation s reddest states  Orman hasn t said which party he ll caucus with if he wins and has suggested he could switch back and forth between parties  In North Carolina  Sen  Kay Hagan has been polling just slightly ahead of Republican Thom Tillis for weeks  she ll need a strong turnout from her base to hold her seat if early voting is up significantly in the state  with 1 1 million ballots already cast  she may be in luck  Tillis  the state House speaker  has been hit hard over his opposition to abortion rights and the hard right direction of the state legislature  while Hagan has been on the defensive for her vote for Obamacare and the general state of the economy  Close video

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gop-governors-miss-out-2014-conservative-wave, Four years after a Republican wave brought in GOP governors in 10 states where Democrats had previously held power  many of those who won office thanks largely to a backlash against President Obama are in danger this time  With upsets for Democrats in these races within reach  this could be one bright spot in a year that is threatening to be terrible for the party  RELATED Ohio Governor Kasich says Obamacare is here to stay  backtracks While some  like Republican John Kasich in Ohio  are likely to survive the challenge   a victory that could bolster talk of a presidential bid   the many tight races featuring Republican incumbents can be seen as part of a course correction in states that have supported Obama in both 2008 and 2012   Governors  races are separate from federal races in that they re not as defined by natural partisan inclination Kyle Kondik  managing editor of Larry Sabato s Crystal Ball  an election analysis blog  told mnsbc Republicans in Democratic leaning states like Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania  won in 2010  which probably is a worse environment for Democrats than this year ism  Konik said   They all took over from two term Democrats  all those states were probably ready for a change  and they ve all had their problems in office  Here are the GOP governors facing the toughest races this year  as well as one who has managed to dodge most of the problems his colleagues face  Tom Corbett  Pennsylvania Voters seemed almost immediately to regret their decision to elect Tom Corbett  who has been deeply unpopular for nearly his entire term and is currently trailing his opponent  Tom Wolf  by more than 15 points in most polls  Even a last ditch attempt by Corbett to improve his standing by accepting money to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act   which he and a number of other GOP governors had initially rejected   isn t likely to save him  Corbett s term has been plagued with public outrage over shortfalls in the state s education budget  Philadelphia s schools have struggled to open two years in a row thanks to massive funding problems  and concerns over how his office handled the investigation into molestation at Penn State while he was attorney general  He could be the first Pennsylvania governor to lose re election since it became legal to run for a second term in in 1974  Rick Scott  Florida Scott  who narrowly won in 2010 despite the overwhelming Republican wave that year  has been unpopular for much of his time in office  And his recent behavior in debates with Charlie Crist  the former Republican governor now challenging Scott as a Democrat  has made matters far worse  Scott admitted at a debate Tuesday that his attorney general once postponed an execution in order to attend a political fundraiser  This startling statement followed another debate last week when Scott refused to go on stage because Crist had a small electric fan at his podium  Scott  a multimillionare former hospital executive who spent  75 million of his own money to win in 2010  is now tied with Crist at 44    a number that suggests voters are trying to decide which candidate they dislike less rather than picking someone they actually support  RELATED Hate your candidates this year  You re not alone Scott Walker  Wisconsin Walker  once widely seen as a potentially formidable GOP presidential contender in 2016  is now fighting for his political life back home   Political observers agree that he has to beat challenger Mary Burke  who has been essentially tied with Walker in the polls since April  or his national political future is over  A recent Marquette Law School poll showed Walker and Burke in a dead tie at 47  poll director Charles Franklin said   The race at this point will likely be decided by turnout rather than either candidate swaying the handful of undecided voters in the state  Walker has been a polarizing figure since he won in 2010  he has signed legislation restricting abortion access and voting rights and has rolled back environmental protections  But his biggest vulnerability is on his job creation  Burke is making sure that Walker s promise to create 250 000 new jobs in his first term is coming back to haunt him  So far  the state has added less than half that number  but Walker insists his record is strong  After stripping public sector unions of their right to bargain collectively in 2011  Walker survived a recall election and has so far remained untouched by two separate criminal investigations  Six of his former aides and associates were convicted in one investigation  and the second is currently on hold after a judge s order  Walker s presidential ambitions  Kondik told msnbc  will live or die on what happens on Nov  4  and other potential candidates like fellow Wisconsinite Rep  Paul Ryan are already angling to take his place in line   Part of the reason his name has sort of faded is that his close race meant he had to focus closer to home  Kondik said of Walker  Close video       Hardball with Chris Matthews  10 21 14  7 28

workers  rights  signed legislation allowing unelected emergency managers to make decisions about city finances  made changes to education funding and enacted restrictions on abortion  He s still selling himself as a pragmatist this time  but his record has weighed him down against his Democratic challenger  former Rep  Mark Schauer  Schauer has gotten traction with his argument that economic gains in the state have been limited to the wealthy  Many Michigan residents are still hurting  Schauer says  with residents of Detroit struggling to access basic services like running water  Still Kondik says Snyder is likely to pull off a victory here  in part because Schauer has not been as dynamic an opponent as Burke has been in Wisconsin  Paul LePage  Maine   LePage  the surprise winner in a multi candidate field in 2010  is widely disliked in Maine  But he may win re election thanks to the many of the same political quirks that elected him four years ago  LePage s hard line  bombastic social conservatism is out of step with many Maine voters  whose libertarian leanings have produced a long line of more moderate statewide leaders  LePage has a long history of insulting constituents  legislators and members of the press  He also once compared the IRS to the Gestapo  told members of the NAACP to kiss his butt  and suggested he would tell President Obama to go to hell  He s also opposed expanding Medicaid  slashed environmental protections and attacked public schools  Why is someone like LePage still a contender  He narrowly defeated Independent candidate Eliot Cutler in 2010  and Cutler is running again this year along with Democratic Rep  Mike Michaud  Polls show Michaud running ahead of LePage  but support for Cutler is drawing Democrats away from Michaud  Without Cutler  Michaud would have a comfortable lead overall  LePage could indeed win himself another four years and have more opportunities to hurl offensive insults at state legislators as he did at state Sen  Troy Jackson  whom LePage said  claims to be for the people but he s the first one to give it to the people without providing Vaseline  John Kasich  Ohio  One blue state Republican governor who has managed to do what others have not is John Kasich  He started his term with a Wisconsin style anti union bill  but since then has tempered his approach to governing  He now seems to be coasting to re election  and could earn a dark horse spot in the presidential primary field  Oddly enough  Kasich is benefiting from a voter revolt earlier in his term  his anti union measure was overturned by public referendum in 2011 in a landslide  which means voters in Ohio never experienced the change Kasich was seeking  RELATED The best campaign zingers of 2014 Selling himself as a moderate this year  and without a strong challenger  Kasich hasn t had to defend his more moderate pitch  And the Democratic candidate  Ed FitzGerald  has proven so weak Kasich has risked angering conservatives for taking federal Medicaid money because he knows he can win without them  For Kasich  unlike his 2010 compatriots Walker and Snyder  establishing conservative credentials in 2011 turned out to be less important than having popularity to burn in 2014  Poll  Will the GOP take control of the Senate in 2014    ,10/23/14 03:52 PM,abortion

of policies and it has also been reflected in policies that are socially conservative such as choice and gun rights  The current political climate and the broad push around a more conservative agenda has roiled cross aisle alliances and even sparked some infighting within the Democratic Party  of which Gov  Jay Nixon is a member   At the moment it has been reflected in the tension within the Democratic Party  In order to be a successful statewide candidate in Missouri you have to be a moderate conservative  Jones said   You couldn t be an all out liberal  You have to do well enough in the

that failure to dance  has generated considerable consternation within Nixon s urban constituents  many of whom have criticized his handling of issues that impact the state s minority residents It has vexed Gov  Nixon and hampered efforts for the party to fight back against aggressive Republican efforts on many important issues including education funding  the expansion of gun rights and abortion law  analysts say  Thursday s success by Republicans and the failures of Democrats to put up a fight are Nixon s  failures alone  Chappelle Nadal said The governor does not communicate well with the Republican Party nor the Democrat Party  This is like the third time in the history of Missouri that the governor has been overridden so much  Chappelle Nadal said   He kind of sits in his office and is protected by his handlers but he doesn t communicate with his legislative body  For days after Michael Brown s killing  as thousands took to the streets to protest and parts of Ferguson burned  the governor remained mum on the incident and maintained a relatively normal schedule  Days into the protest  he even found time to attend the state fair  Related Portrait of a protester in Ferguson  Missouri But Brown s killing has drawn national attention to Ferguson and to the broader plight of African Americans who are often profiled and targeted by police  sometimes with deadly results  The Department of Justice  which is conducting a parallel investigation into the killing  has announced that it would also be launching a civil rights investigation into the entire Ferguson Police Department  While African Americans represent about 70  of the city s residents  the police force and most of the city s public institutions are run and employed by whites  Of the 53 officers  only three are black  During Thursday s legislative session  in her first address to fellow legislators since Brown s Aug  9 killing  Chappelle Nadal blasted Nixon  calling him a  coward  and saying that  You ve done nothing for black people   Many of my colleagues in the Senate  conservative members  feel that what happened to my constituents in Ferguson was wrong  the senator  whose district includes parts of Ferguson  told msnbc   They don t support any of the militarized  tactical operations used against them or the behavior of the governor or his ineptness in approaching the situation  The events in the streets of Ferguson and in the halls of the Capital in recent weeks have aligned Missouri with other states that critics have described as politically and socially repressive  Think Florida  where headlines are often filled with bizarre crimes  political chicanery and in recent years  the killings of unarmed black men  In just nine months in 2012 the shooting deaths of two unarmed black teenagers sparked national outcry over the value and treatment of black youth  In February 2012  Trayvon Martin  17  was shot and killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford  Florida  In November of that same year Jordan Davis  also 17  was shot by a customer at a Jacksonville gas station after an argument over loud music  At the same time  Florida was in a state of upheaval over strict new voting laws including limits on early voting and restrictions on registering new voters  Both were seen as attempts by Florida republicans to suppress the black and minority vote  In the wake of Brown s killing  the protests and the violent response from police in which innocent protestors were hit with rubber bullets and tear gas  questions about the treatment of African American young men has again been raised  And more broadly  the militarized response from local law enforcement has brought to light a number of other troubling questions   What has changed is a much clearer link between political policy and political ideology  E  Terrence Jones The federal government has given nearly  1 billion a year to police departments in grants and equipment  Some of that includes military surplus items like armored and bomb proof vehicles designed to absorb roadside bombs in theaters of war like Iraq and Afghanistan  But they have also shown up as part of the emergency response apparatus of local law enforcement  the likes seen in Ferguson during the height of clashes between the police and protesters last month  The federal government has little oversight on how the weapons or funding is used by local law enforcement  The events in Missouri have led Congress to probe  police militarization  Missouri Sen  Clair McCaskill  a Democrat  who has condemned the heavy handed police response in her state  has led the hearings  Back in Missouri  Chappelle Nadal has emerged as one of Gov  Nixon s harshest critics  Her voice is among the loudest of a growing chorus of lawmakers who have ramped up their criticisms of Nixon  saying that among other failings  Nixon has failed to rally and grow Democratic ranks in the Legislature in the face of mounting Republican pressure that has marked the state with black eye after political black eye  Chappelle Nadal said since she was first elected to the Legislature in 2005  the number of Democrats in both the House and Senate have fallen  She said there are about 50 Democrats currently in the House  down from about 74 when she first took office  And in the last couple years  the number of Democrats in the Senate had fallen to 9 from 11  She says Nixon s unwillingness to effectively lead has bordered on the obscene  setting the stage for this week s Republican steam rolling  The expanded gun rights legislation could allow teachers to could bring their guns to schools and more residents to openly carry their weapons in public places  including cities and towns that bar open carry  And the age that residents can become concealed carry permit holders was dropped from 21 to 19  Pro choice and women s advocates say the abortion bill sets the clock back on women s rights  As for why it s happening  Jones said it s not that the politics of the state have changed much  but that over time the influence of political ideology on actual policy has gotten stronger  Close video       The Last

issues that continue to burden the state Earlier this year after a string of botched executions in other states  the U S  Supreme Court temporarily halted executions in Missouri amid appeals that the state disclose information about the cocktail of drugs used in killing prisoners and details about the often unregulated pharmacies from which the drugs are obtained  Across the country  the condemned and their lawyers are filing appeals that have risen to the highest courts  as a scarcity of lethal injection drugs from federally regulated pharmacies has states turning to the shadowy world of compounding pharmacies  which fall under the purview of states rather than the Federal Drug Administration   All death penalty states now use lethal injection  States including Louisiana  Missouri  Oklahoma  and Texas have turned to compounding pharmacies  The relationships between the states and the pharmacies have been shrouded in secrecy  and corrections departments have gone to great lengths to protect the identities of their drug suppliers  In some states  as is the case in Missouri  the pharmacies are legally shielded from public disclosure and are extended the privilege of anonymity afforded members of the official execution team  This week  the state executed its eighth inmate of the year Amid a rising clamor to halt executions as the death drugs are further scrutinized  Gov  Jay Nixon refused to stay the execution of the inmate  double murderer Earl Ringo Jr  despite pleas from Ringo s attorney that the drugs used in the execution could cause Ringo to suffer   I would submit  talking in neutral terms  that my first point is not that anything has changed that much over time  Jones said   What has changed is a much clearer link between political policy and political ideology  Chappelle Nadal  who during protests in Ferguson carried a large cutout of Nixon s face with the acronym   M I A Again  scrawled across his forehead  said the Missouri s mess has lumped her great state in dubious company   This is a purple state so of course we re going to have a lot of pro life and gun rights measures similar to Texas or Alabama  she said   When it comes to keeping

the after lunch billing or just today s speech  but the crowd was more unresponsive during his speech  his ninth appearance at the nine year old Summit  He earned just five moments of applause during his address  whereas Cruz s speech was punctuated by regular applause  hoots  and hollers  Santorum had social conservatives behind him in a big way in 2012  so his reception may signal a decline of his social conservatives  support of the former senator  The Louisiana governor didn t initially rile up the crowd  but his jokes  family stories  and comfortable  off the cuff delivery gained momentum as he spoke  By the end of the speech  he had the audience laughing and excited   If you like your religious liberty  you can keep your religious liberty  Jindal joked to crowd guffaws

with a new book in February  just as 2016 campaigning cycle kicks off in earnest  Cruz who won last year s straw poll two weeks after his 21 hour Senate floor faux filibuster against Obamacare reminded attendees of the one year anniversary of that all night talk a thon  His address was based loosely around Psalm 30 and predicted a kind of salvation from the Obama presidency   In 2017  with a Republican president in office  we re going to sign legislation repealing every word of Obamacare  he said   Joy cometh in the morning  He pitched himself as values driven Republican with a plan to  turn this country around   There are people in Washington who say Republicans to win have to abandon values  he said   Our values are who we are  Our values are why we re here  Cruz skipped the podium and teleprompter other attendees used  walking around the stage and feeding off the crowd s approval   His easy demeanor gave the speech a campaign feel that was particularly obvious when he suggested a day long debate with the likely 2016 Democratic frontrunner  Hillary Clinton  over the Supreme Court s Hobby Lobby ruling  The court ruled in that case that closely held companies with religious objections to birth control could refuse to abide by the mandate under Obamacare to provide it to employees   Me  I ll stand with the nuns  Cruz said  referring the Little Sisters of the Poor  who are suing the government over the contraception mandate  Unlike Cruz s easy comfort  Paul appeared a bit less at home  standing behind a podium and reading from the teleprompter  and speaking quickly  Paul whose libertarian views don t always sync with those of Christian conservatives   said his policies were key to preserving family values   What American needs is not a politician with more promises  what America really needs is a revival  Paul said  earning his first cheers of the speech  He went on to argue that that the revival depends on fusing freedom and virtue together   Liberty is exactly essential to virtue  he said  Paul championed his anti abortion stance  he was introduced to the crowd by a video montage of his own pro life remarks interspersed with sonograms of babies in the womb   I m one who will march for life and who will stand up in defense of life as long as I m privileged to hold office  Paul told the crowd  Paul s strongest applause came when he brought up was his failed legislative attempt to stop foreign aid from reaching countries that persecute Christians   Let s stop this madness  he said  Santorum s speech focused largely on mobilizing activists Quit being scared and start being activists and making things happen  Santorum said  in one well received line He encouraged the attendees to fight in the upcoming November election in particular   The chance of us picking up seats in 2016 are pretty close to zero  We  need to  go all out this time for the people that we know that are going to be with us  go all out  he said  All three senators criticized Obama repeatedly  Paul was particularly vocal  calling the president an  autocrat  who acts  like a king  Santorum said the president was  in Disneyland  and a  descendant of the French revolution  Jindal argued that the American dream was founded in the kind of values the Summit champions  The Obama administration  he argued  is trying to  redefine the American dream  he said  saying that the president s version sounds like  envy and redistribution  blaming people for being successful  more government spending and managing the slow decline of America  Political strategists  think the key to a strong America is economic strength and our democratic system of governing  he said   Here s what I believe  As America s culture goes  so goes America  Not    It s the Economy  Stupid  rather    It s the Culture  Stupid  Huckabee s  when the phone rings  speech hit all the hot topics  When the phone rang over Benghazi   Nobody answered  At Health and Human Services over Obamacare   Nobody s there  At the National Security Association   They re the only one who answers  Huckabee joked  He also called for social conservative voters to mobilize  a kind of get out the evangelicals call to action  saying there are 80 million evangelicals in the country  with just half registered voters  and just half of them voting in presidential elections  and another halving just 10 million who vote in midterm elections   What would happen if instead of half of those voters being registered  75  of them were  What would happen if instead of half of them voting  75  of them voted  If 10  more evangelicals had voted in the last election  we would have a different president than we do now  Huckabee said  The senators and others at the summit spoke repeatedly of Christian persecution  at times portraying religious conservatives as persecuted victims who need to fight back  Describing the persecution of Nigerian girls kidnapped by the extremist group Boko Haram  and a Sudanese woman who was persecuted for being Christian  Cruz said   This is not something abstract and theoretical  this is something each of us have lived  All three earned standing ovations  though

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/exclusive-hobby-lobby-owner-speaks, CEDARVILLE  Ohio  Steve Green  president of the Hobby Lobby craft store chain whose objections to offering coverage for some forms of contraception led to a landmark Supreme Court ruling last summer  responded for the first time to questions about his company s investments in pharmaceutical corporations that produce contraception and abortion drugs  RELATED Notre Dame appeals to Supreme Court on birth control case Those investments drew charges of hypocrisy after the company went to the high court to opt out of covering four forms of contraception on its insurance plan Green also discussed the evidence  or lack thereof  that contraception interferes with a fertilized egg   That is several steps removed  Green told msnbc on Thursday when approached at a conference on religious liberty at Cedarville University  referring to revelations reported in Mother Jones in April that Hobby Lobby s 401 k  plan invested in corporations that produce contraception and abortion drugs   Whether they do or not  invest in these drugs and devices  I couldn t confirm or deny it  I don t know if it s even true  Of course  the other question I would ask is  do those companies also provide a lot of life saving products that our employees are dependent on  I don t know that either  But we ve not made any changes  The Supreme Court ruled in Hobby Lobby s favor in June  saying the company and others whose owners had sincerely held religious beliefs did not have to comply with Affordable Care Act requirements to cover some forms of contraception on insurance plans  believing they were equivalent to abortion  While the case was still pending before the court  Mother Jones  Molly Redden reported that the company s 401 k  employee retirement plan  to which the company makes matching contributions   held more than  73 million in mutual funds with investments in companies that produce emergency contraceptive pills  intrauterine devices  and drugs commonly used in abortions    Several legal experts told msnbc at the time that those revelations  which came too late to be part of the factual record before the court  raised  questions about the sincerity of their religious opposition to having insurance companies provide those same drugs  and  should significantly weaken Hobby Lobby s claim that the contraception mandate imposes a substantial burden  The company had declined requests for comment    The Obama administration argued before the Supreme Court that coverage for emergency contraceptives Plan B and ella  as well as the IUD was essentially  several degrees removed  from actual providing those items to employees  Hobby Lobby  the administration argued  was only paying into an insurance plan which female employees could then use according to their individual consciences  Justice Samuel Alito  writing for the majority  flatly rejected that argument  Another point of controversy in the Hobby Lobby case was whether the drugs and devices objected to by the Greens even do what they were alleged to do  which is prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus  That did make into the record   There is no scienti c evidence that emergency contraceptives available in the United States and approved by the FDA affect an existing pregnancy  wrote a coalition of medical professionals in an amicus brief   None  therefore  is properly classified as an abortifacient   It is possible that a copper IUD inserted after unprotected sex can block implantation  which the Greens  if not the vast majority of medical professionals  consider tantamount to abortion  Close video       All In with Chris Hayes  7 29 14  8 34 PM ET       Satanists seek a religious exemption       Hobby Lobby won a religious exemption from a birth control rule  now The Satanic Temple wants a religious exemption from anti abortion informed consent laws  Elaborate  well played joke  Or legitimate legal case    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss Asked about that amicus brief  as well as GOP Senator and likely 2016 presidential contender Rand Paul s recent comments declaring that Plan B  is taking birth control  and not having a supposed early abortion  Green said   We just take what the FDA said  And it indicated that it can  And so I don t know that I would take Rand Paul s word over what we see from the FDA  In the face of broadening scientific consensus that Plan B does not interfere with a fertilized egg  the manufacturer of the drug  Teva  has repeatedly asked the FDA to change the label to that effect  according to a New York Times investigation in 2012   I think there s a lot of people that question that  And they can have their opinion  Green said of Paul s statements  Asked if additional evidence about how these forms of contraception work make a difference  Green said   I think we would have to reconsider it  I don t know with as much studies that have been out there that that can be known clearly    Later  in a keynote interview with radio host John Stonestreet   Green said   We have no desire or intent to impose our religion on any of our employees We want to not be forced to become an abortion provider by freely providing products that take life  Green spoke with msnbc briefly following a breakout session on integrating business and religion  during which a moderator said he would refuse to allow questions from the audience about the Supreme Court case  In that session  Green responded to an audience question via index card about whether the company was hypocritical for working with vendors from China  given its human rights abuses   We do have a process  We have an office in Hong Kong  They have a checklist for vendors to do the best we can to determine  There is no guarantee  Green said  Another audience question expressed concern that  the government is becoming less and less tolerant of Christianity  Green replied  in part   If an authority asks us to violate what God has told us to do  we have to understand that we re first responsible to God    Cedarville University  host of the two day Religious Freedom Summit  describes itself as a  Christ centered  Baptist institution  It chose not to follow the path set by Hobby Lobby and did not sue over the Obama administration s  accommodation  for religiously

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/north-carolina-senate-seat-may-be-price-gop-success, RALEIGH  North Carolina  For Republicans in North Carolina  the last two years have been a golden age  When Pat McCrory was elected governor here in 2012  the GOP assumed total control of state government for the first time in more than a century  They put it to use quickly  enacting a series of tax cuts  blocking the Affordable Care Act s Medicaid expansion  passing new anti abortion laws  and imposing an array of new restrictions on voting   When my grandmother was alive  she wouldn t have let a Republican in the house  David Goodson  69  a Charlotte area Republican voter recalled   Things really changed in a positive direction  But the GOP s sweeping gains could come with a steep political price  the chance to unseat Democratic Senator Kay Hagan in November  Hagan  who is facing a challenge from Republican state House Speaker Thom Tillis  has proven surprisingly resilient in a difficult Democratic year and political observers of all stripes say it has a lot to do with the state government s swerve to the right  The National Republican Senatorial Committee announced on Monday it would spend another  6 million on television advertising in the campaign s final three weeks to back up  3 million already in place for Tillis  The GOP ad buy will go up against 9 1 million worth of ad time the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee booked from August through November  North Carolina  which went narrowly for President Obama in 2008 and then narrowly for Mitt Romney in 2012  is a true swing state whose demographics are trending blue  As a result  the state government s right turn has produced a backlash for Hagan to exploit Since McCrory isn t on the ballot this year and the state legislature s Republican majority is insulated from serious threats thanks to gerrymandering  there s nowhere for that Democratic energy to go except the Senate race  Tillis  like most Republican candidates this year  has been running on a promise to forcefully push back against Obama  In two recent debates  he used his opening and closing statements to tie Hagan s voting record to the White House Recently Tillis has shifted the race to national security issues  arguing that Obama has offered weak responses to ISIS and Ebola and that Hagan bears part of the blame   I m determined to make it clear that the president last week said all of his policies  every single one of them  are on the ballot in November  Tillis told reporters   I m determined to make it clear that people know that Senator Hagan has voted with Obama 96  of the time  RELATED National security fears dominate North Carolina debate Hagan  however  has managed to open up a small lead in recent polls by hammering Tillis just as relentlessly for his work in the state Legislature   He s gutted education  killed an equal pay bill  made college more expensive  and said no to health care for 500 000 North Carolinians  And folks  he is campaigning on a promise to take that destructive agenda to Washington  Hagan said in a debate  Hagan has frequently derided Tillis as  divisive  trying to draw a line between partisan trench warfare in Washington and in Raleigh even though she is the Washington incumbent in the race  Besides attacking Tillis over right leaning legislation  her campaign has seized on remarks he made in 2012 in which he contrasted North Carolina s growing black and Hispanic electorate with the state s  traditional population  of voters  In May  Tillis walked back a comment he d made saying Republicans need to  divide and conquer the people who are on assistance  He professed empathy for people who receive disability assistance while criticizing those who  choose to get into a condition that makes them dependent on the government  Obama is not popular in North Carolina  nor is Hagan particularly well liked by voters  The most recent survey by NBC News Marist  for example  found just 42  of likely voters had a favorable impression of Hagan versus 48  who had an unfavorable one   dangerous numbers for any incumbent  But the state legislature s unpopularity has dragged Tillis even lower  36  favorable versus 47  unfavorable  He trailed by four points in their election match up  Dean Debnam  founder of the Democratic leaning Public Policy Polling and a prominent donor to state progressive causes  attributed the long decline in Tillis  standing to his connection to the legislature  One PPP poll last month pegged the General Assembly s approval rating at 19     It s added something like 30 points to his negatives while Hagan s numbers have barely moved at all  Debnam said  Republicans agree the state based attacks are the prime source of damage   She painted Tillis as a tea partier  drove up his negatives with swing voters and all of a sudden  voters  have a Hobson s choice  Carter Wrenn  a longtime Republican strategist in the state  told msnbc   If they had a Republican they liked  they d probably fall right in place  While Hagan has tried to use the state government to scare swing voters away from Tillis  it s been equally important in riling up Democrats in a state where turnout plummeted from 2008 to 2010  The various bills passed by the Legislature have given Democrats an opportunity to activate Obama s voting coalition of minorities  women  young voters  and urban professionals without any mention of the president himself  Women protested outside both debates trying to draw attention to new abortion measures in the state  which included a series of regulations on clinics that Republicans attached to a motorcycle safety bill at the last minute  African American voters are upset with a new voting law that s among the most restrictive in the country  as are college activists who won t be allowed to use their campus ID to vote under the new law   The Democrats care way more about the legislature than they do about the Senate race  John Hood  president of the conservative John Locke Foundation  told msnbc   Sure  they re trying to re elect Kay Hagan  but the major reason is that they want to beat Thom Tillis as opposed to being greatly enamored with Hagan or frankly caring whether Democrats have 50 seats or 49  Thousands have attended ongoing  Moral Monday  protests against the GOP s agenda  The movement  led by state NAACP president Rev  William Barber  has protested a range of GOP imposed policies  from education cuts to taxes to voting laws  Ronie Bellamy  on break from his restaurant job in downtown Wlimington  told msnbc he was fired up after attending a local Moral Monday protest and had recently registered to vote  He plans to support Hagan   The things that Tillis did   they re cutting everything  he said  Bellamy and other Wilmington residents said they were particularly upset with the legislature s decision to end a tax credit designed to attract film studios  some of which have produced television shows and movies in the city  Hagan raised the issue in the debates  accusing Tillis of sending the jobs to other states  Eremaine Murphy  an African American retiree  chimed in from a bench nearby about the voting restrictions It s crazy  she said   Republicans  Murphy added  are  just trying to hold on  The voting law may motivate Democrats to get to the polls  but activists also fear it will disproportionately affect minorities and young voters who tend to vote for Democrats After a Supreme Court decision blocking a lower court s hold on the law last week  voters now face a new ban on same day voter registration and out of precinct provisional votes  Hagan closed the debate on Thursday by reminding voters they had only one day before the new deadline to register  There s still plenty of room for Tillis to close the gap  but the relentlessly negative campaign from both sides has introduced an element of unpredictability  And a significant number of voters in polls  around 5  on average  are leaning towards libertarian candidate Sean Haugh  who appeared in Thursday s debate but has barely spent any money campaigning  Voters like Indian Trail resident John Crider  74  say disgust with both major candidates has pushed them to consider their options  Crider normally votes Republican  but he and his wife Phyllis  71  told msnbc they were strongly considering Haugh  Mr  Crider is no fan of Obama or Hagan  but the education cuts in particular had left them both disillusioned with Tillis as well   I can t stand either one  Mr  Crider said   Their campaigns are pathetic  Mrs  Crider added  A major question for the final stretch is whether voters who are now telling pollsters they ll support Haugh get cold feet and ultimately back one of the two major candidates rather than cast a protest vote    In the meantime  Republicans are holding out hope that discontent with Obama will carry the day when voters make their final gut

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/walker-burke-stay-local-final-wisconsin-governors-debate, No one landed a decisive blow in Friday night s debate between Wisconsin Gov  Scott Walker and Democratic challenger Mary Burke  And while an early malfunction by the timer offered an opening for a Florida style meltdown over technology  the candidates opted to spend their final debate of the 2014 campaign focused on jobs and the state economy  RELATED Is a Scott Walker presidential run doomed if he loses governorship  Instead of labor rights  minimum wage increases  higher education  reproductive rights  shadowy campaign donations  the environment  or any of the other hot button issues that have divided the state since Walker took office in 2010  the debate panelists zoomed in on economic questions that affect the lives of millions of Wisconsinites but gave nothing to observers looking for clues about the election s national implications  Both Walker and Burke kept close to their talking points on economic issues  with Walker pointing out recent  positive jobs and unemployment numbers  and Burke on Walker s failure to make it halfway to his goal of creating 250 000 jobs during his first term  And while Walker appeared more at ease while delivering answers smoothly and personalizing his anecdotes  his attacks were weak  The most he could muster was to criticize lackluster job growth under former Gov  Jim Doyle  under whom Burke served as Commerce Secretary  Walker  Burke responded   would rather be running against  Doyle  but the hair alone should tell you we re two very different people  RELATED Wisconsin Gov  Scott Walker  Minimum wage has no  purpose  Walker and Burke have been locked in the tightest contest of 2014  with the campaigns fighting over a handful of independent and undecided voters in the highly polarized state  Neither candidate has found a way to hold onto any meaningful lead  the state s most reliable poll has shown them within the margin of error for much of the year The most recent poll has Burke and Walker completely even at 47  with Burke ahead 45 44 among independents  a jump from trailing Walker 54 40 just two weeks ago  The question of whether to change the state s notoriously lax drunk driving laws is a huge one for state voters in this election  but it s not one that sheds any light on what sort of candidate Walker would be if he runs for the Republican nomination in 2016  Close video       The Ed Show  10 13 14  5 37 PM ET       Scott Walker stumbles in debate       Gov  Scott Walker refuses to talk about what s on everyone s minds  increasing jobs and the minimum wage during a gubernatorial debate  Ed Schultz  Katrina Vanden Heuvel and Ruth Conniff discuss    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss There is no shortage of topics that could have been fodder for the candidates  Walker is already trying to minimize fallout related to several controversial positions  On Oct  7  his campaign released an ad that appeared designed to make voters think he believes women should be able to make choices about abortion with their doctor when he has long supported banning the procedure without exceptions  Walker has avoided saying whether he has changed his mind since 2012  And on Tuesday  Walker told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel s editorial board that he didn t believe the minimum wage  serves a purpose  Sixty one percent of likely voters in the state support raising the minimum wage  and only 35  oppose an increase  None of the panelists at Friday s debate asked about either question  Burke has also had to overcome potentially damaging issues in recent weeks  She fired a campaign consultant after it was reported that he had plagiarized himself while writing portions of her jobs report  the centerpiece of her campaign  While Burke continues to stand by the substance of the plan  the plagiarism conversation appeared to hurt her in the polls  when she began October trailing Walker by five points  RELATED Women could decide Scott Walker race for governor in Wisconsin Speaking about it Friday  Burke reiterated that she fired the person responsible and said the fact that the ideas were being reused was a plus Great economic plans are about great ideas  Burke said   The more they are used elsewhere and proven successful  the more it makes sense to use them  Milwaukee  the state s biggest city and home to most of the state s non white residents  was the focus of many of the night s questions  from the fact that African American men see an unemployment rate of over 50  to worries that the Milwaukee Bucks will move to another city  But it will also be the epicenter of potential problems on Election Day  After multiple appeals and reversals  the state s controversial and restrictive voter ID law will not be in effect on Nov  4  ,10/17/14 10:11 PM,abortion

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gop-goes-the-offensive-woo-women-voters, As the midterms creep closer  the GOP is aggressively campaigning to win women s votes  The GOP has struggled to shake  war on women  criticisms for years  in their 2012 autopsy report  they concluded they needed to better combat Democrats  narrative  be more inclusive  and recruit more women  This week  Republicans launched four different efforts to convince women they ve achieved those goals   even as polls and data show mixed results at best  signaling just how important the female voter has become in their midterm strategy  On Thursday  Republican National Committee co chair Sharon Day published a column on BlogHer  arguing that Democrats are objectifying women when they appeal to them on issues like abortion and attacking Cosmopolitan magazine for writing about reproductive rights in their election coverage  while refusing to endorse candidates that weren t pro choice   We don t need Cosmo to do the same thing the Democrat political operatives do and stereotype women as a voting bloc that doesn t care about the economy  national debt  immigration  or foreign policy  Day wrote   I was also disappointed when Cosmo said they won t endorse any candidate who doesn t meet their litmus test on abortion  Again  they are perpetuating the stereotype that women only care about a narrow set of  women s issues  and have only one opinion on them  RNC chairman Kirsten Kukowski said of these initiatives in an email late Thursday that party sought to  correct the record  on the Democrats   campaign to mislead voters  She added that the party was also working on a lot of get out the vote efforts with women We ve been making a concerted effort all cycle  she said  Day s column came on the heels of a web video  Women of the GOP  posted Wednesday  The RNC produced video flashes soft focus images of female Republican candidates up for election this November set to motivational music  overlaid with words like  empowerment  and  motivate   This year  Republican women are taking back the future  the female narrator says in the spot  The GOP does have a number of high profile female candidates on the ballot this November Iowa s Joni Ernst and Oregon s Monica Wehby for instance but they re far behind the Democratic party when it comes to recruiting  running  and electing women to office  The GOP trails far behind Democrats with the number of women they elect to state legislatures and Congress  In November  two times as many women will be on the ballot as Democrats than Republicans  according to Rutger s Center for Women in Politics  Related  Gender gap damages GOP  Where are all the Republican women   They re losing women voters and they can t lose women voters by the percentages they re losing them and win elections  EMILY s List president Stephanie Schriock told msnbc   Now they re realizing it  She said the GOP is appealing to women  even though they haven t changed their policies  Earlier this week  two Republican candidates fought back against criticism that they re anti women  in bold  direct to camera ads  the kind usually reserved for addressing big scandals  In Wisconsin  Republican Gov  Scott Walker is fending off a challenge from a female candidate  Mary Burke  and under fire for abortion legislation namely a 2013 bill that s currently held up in courts to restrict abortion providers and require women to get an ultrasound before getting an abortion  His short ad   Decision  portrays him to be distinctly softer on the issue  arguing that his legislation simply gives women more information and protects her safety  but leaves the final decision to  a woman and her doctor  It s pretty different from the 2010 remarks EMILY s List used in a recent media blitz  where Walker tells reporters he d like to outlaw abortion completely  even in cases of rape  incest  and when it threatens the mother s life  A Marquette University Law School poll released last week saw that Walker s fears of alienating women are founded  Walker s up 28 points with men  but Burke leads with women by 14 points  In New Hampshire  Scott Brown who is similarly struggling with women came out with a similar ad  pushing back on Democratic incumbent Sen  Jeanne Shaheen s ad  which said Brown pushed for legislation that would  forced  women considering an abortion to look at color photos of developing fetuses   Brown insisted in a press conference the bill didn t force women to look at anything though it did actually require doctors to give patients considering abortion color photos of developing fetuses arguing that they could throw these materials out   I want you to know the facts  I m pro choice  I support continued funding for Planned Parenthood  and I believe women should have contraception  Brown said in his response spot   Sen  Shaheen has resorted to a smear campaign to distract voters from her record  The ad largely dodges the accusations  but Brown s ad like Walker s signal just how damaging the campaigns feel these criticisms will be for the midterms  EMILY s List spokesman Marcy Stech noted that the ads looked familiar  in 2012  Akin apologized with a similar ad  EMILY s List has since reduced their own ad parodying the Republicans  latest attempt at outreach     ,10/09/14 05:57 PM,abortion
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-9-most-memorable-campaign-ads-2014, With just over two weeks before the midterm elections   and the fight for control of the Senate still very much up in the air   candidates and outside groups have been cranking out ads  Red state Democrats are trying to put distance between themselves and  President Obama  who remains deeply unpopular among large swaths of voters  Several Republicans  meanwhile  are trying to capitalize on the recent Ebola crisis and the rise of ISIS   often using scare tactics to do so  They re also trying to dispel some of the more unsavory parts of the GOP s reputation  including the Democratic charge that conservatives are waging a  war on women  This election cycle has been filled with a range of ads   funny  bizarre  nasty  and everything in between  From wrangling alligators to Cliven Bundy cameo  here s a look at the most talked about campaign spots of this cycle  We want to hear from you  For the next piece in our series  we re rounding up the worst fear mongering moments of the 2014 election cycle  Leave a comment on this post to submit your suggestions   Make  em squeal  Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst  who is in a heated race in Iowa against Democrat Bruce Braley  was propelled into the national spotlight earlier this spring with this ad  In it  Ernst makes the argument that she s uniquely qualified to cut spending in Washington   I grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm  so when I get to Washington  I ll know how to cut pork  says Ernst  smiling as video footage of pigs is played   Washington s full of big spenders  Let s make  em squeal  Ernst declares    Get those gaters  Rob Manness  a Tea Party candidate trying to oust Democrat Sen  Mary Landrieu in Louisiana  is also going with an animal theme  arguing his experience with alligators makes him tough enough to take on DC politicians   Here in Louisiana  you learn to be tough  he says in an ad first released in May   One moment of weakness and the alligators could eat you alive  The ad features plenty of reptiles roaming around and repeated sound bytes of an alligator chomp  It finishes with Manness taping one of the reptile s mouth shut and him declaring  Louisiana needs a senator that s going to stand up to the career politicians and the alligators    Going too far  Democratic candidate for Texas governor Wendy Davis came under scrutiny for a controversial attack ad that came out last month depicting an empty wheelchair   an eye popping reference to her Republican opponent  Greg Abbott  who has been in a wheelchair since 1984 after an accident that left him a paraplegic  The spot accuses Abbott of siding against accident victims during his time as Texas attorney general despite being awarded  10 million after his own accident  Davis has insisted the ad was not a personal attack on Abbott     Electile dysfunction  This ad cost J D  Winteregg s job teaching  at a Christian college  but it did win him some big laughs  Winteregg  who unsuccessfully took on House Speaker John Boehner in Ohio s GOP primary  charged Boehner suffers from  electile dysfunction  in a spot styled after commercials for drugs like Cialis   Your electile dysfunction  It could be a question of blood flow  Sometimes when a politician has been in D C  too long  it goes to his head and he just can t seem to get the job done  says the narrator  who later adds   If you have a Boehner lasting more than 23 years  seek immediate medical attention  Boehner is expected to sail to victory against Democratic challenger Tom Poetter    Channeling Willie Horton A new campaign ad from the National Republican Congressional Committee is drawing comparisons to the infamous  Willie Horton  spot that wreaked havoc in 1988 on Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis  The NRCC ad takes aim at Democratic Nebraska House candidate Brad Ashford  who is a tight race against Republican Rep  Lee Terry  The spot criticizes Ashford for backing a state law that cuts prison sentences for time served  It features Nikko Jennings  a convicted felon who killed four people over 10 days after being released from jail in 2013  In 1988  the GOP similarly tied Dukakis to felon Willie Horton  who raped a woman  beat her boyfriend and stole a car while on a weekend furlough from jail in Massachusetts  Democrats immediately criticized the latest NRCC ad as race baiting    A Cliven Bundy cameo This could be the strangest ad of the season  Refresher  Bundy  a Nevada rancher became a cause celebre among Tea Party supporters this year after insisting his cattle should be allowed to graze for free on federal land  He later came under fire for a series of racist remarks  including a suggestion that blacks were  better off  as slaves  Now  Bundy appears in a new ad supporting Kamau Bakari  a longshot independent candidate for Congress in Nevada  Bakari and  Bundy expound on seemingly random  thoughts about race and then challenge Attorney General Eric Holder to sit down with them to discuss the issue further  At one point  Bundy   dressed in over the top cowboy gear   says to Bakari  an African American   I know that black folks have had a hard time with  uh  slavery  and you know the government was in on it  At one point  Bakari calls Bundy a  brave white man  decries political correctness and says he feels  ashamed when I hear black folks whining about  white folks this  white folks that  always begging    Gunning for a win Democratic Senate candidate in Kentucky  Alison Lundergan Grimes  is seen skeet shooting in an ad that first aired in September in an attempt to distance herself from President Obama  In the ad  Lundergan Grimes says her opponent  Republican leader Mitch McConnell   wants you to think I m Barack Obama  and insists she differs from the commander of chief on a number of issues  including guns  coal and the EPA  A photo of McConnell is then shown of McConnell carrying a musket on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference  Grimes takes a jab at McConnell  saying  And Mitch  that s not how you hold a gun    Time for a coffee break Michigan Republican Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land spends a good chunk of her ad  titled  Really  in silence as she tries to hit back her Democratic opponent Gary Peter s charge that she s part of what Demcrats call the Republican  war on women   Lynn turns to the camera and says  Congressman Gary Peters and his buddies want you to believe I m waging a war on women  Really  Think about that for a moment  Then 12 seconds of silence goes by as Land drinks coffee  shakes her head and glances at her watch  In June  GOP pollster Frank Luntz called it the worst ad of the election cycle  arguing it was devoid of substance  Democrats have hammered Land over her opposition to abortion rights and the Paycheck Fairness Act    The politics of fear New Mexico Republican Senate candidate Allen Weh  who is running against Democratic Sen  Tom Udall  was criticized after he released a campaign ad called  Restore Leadership  that features a still image of American journalist James Foley s ISIS executioner  The ad came out less than a week after Foley s family asked the public not to view or pass along the video and juxtaposes Obama playing golf with the recent crises in Ukraine and the Middle East  Udall s campaign called the ad  reprehensible  for using Foley s death for personal gain in a campaign ad  Several Republican candidates have since come out with ads featuring ISIS to portray their Democratic opponents as soft on terror    Poll  Which ad stuck with you   ,10/20/14 04:57 PM,abortion

campaign as a potential 2016 contender  but the political momentum he gained after he dismantled public sector union rights in 2011 and survived a 2012 recall attempt has waned  Instead  he has struggled to maintain even a small lead against Burke  Wisconsin voters are also still confused about the state of a new voter ID law which Walker signed  the Supreme Court has put the law on hold until after the election  but that confusion could hurt turnout among traditionally Democratic voters  Burke  a former commerce secretary and executive at Trek Bicycle who currently serves on the

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ernst-attempts-flip-flop-flip-personhood, In 2014  many conservative Republicans are perfectly comfortable opposing reproductive rights in general  but as we discussed last week   personhood  has become something of a third rail  Given recent developments  it s understandable   personhood measures wouldn t just ban all abortions  they d also block common forms of birth control    And Republicans clearly realize that opposing birth control in the 21st century  when the party is already struggling with the gender gap  isn t a credible option    With that in mind  longtime personhood champions  including Colorado s Cory Gardner  Kentucky s Rand Paul  and North Carolina s Thom Tillis  have all begun to hedge on the radical proposal  Laura Bassett reports  however  that one personhood supporter is choosing a different course  Iowa Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst said she would support a federal bill that gives legal personhood rights to fetuses from the moment of fertilization  effectively wiping out legal abortion in the United States    Ernst voted for a fetal personhood amendment in the Iowa State legislature in 2013  and she told the Sioux City Journal editorial board on Wednesday that she also would support a federal personhood measure if she were elected to the U S  Senate     I will continue to stand by that  I am a pro life candidate  and this has been shaped by my religious beliefs through the years  she said   So I support that  If the Huffington Post piece is correct  it s certainly a provocative move for the right wing Senate candidate  Ernst is in one of the nation s most competitive and closely watched U S  Senate campaigns  and for her to endorse federal legislation that would ban access to common forms of birth control  as well as eliminating all abortion rights  is an usual tactic three weeks before the election    Indeed  it also raises curious questions about Ernst s ideology  The Iowa Republican believes a federal minimum wage law is  ridiculous  but a federal personhood law is the sort of thing she can support    But there s another lingering concern that s worth keeping in mind  does Ernst fully understand the policy she s endorsed    Politicians flip flop all the time  but on personhood  Ernst is apparently trying to execute the rarely seen flip flop flip    First  just last year  Ernst endorsed personhood in the Iowa state Senate    Second  Ernst backed off her support for personhood    Third  Ernst seemed confused about what personhood is    And now Ernst is back to supporting personhood again  this time at the federal level    I imagine Ernst backers might suggest the Republican candidate is just confused   she often flubs the details on public policy   and she wouldn t actually try to pass a personhood policy in the U S  Senate  but with 19 days until Election Day  the she doesn t know what she s talking about defense may not be the GOP s best bet    ,10/16/14 04:59 PM,abortion
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/crist-scott-turn-party-stars-nasty-race-hits-home-stretch, ORLANDO  Fla    With just one day until voters in Florida cast their ballots in what could be the most expensive and tightest gubernatorial race in the country  Republican Gov  Rick Scott and Republican turned Independent turned Democratic former Gov  Charlie Crist are relying on major political star power in the hopes of increasing their chances of winning the Sunshine State s highest office   We need your youth  we need your energy  President Bill Clinton Crist  after making stops in the Democratic heavy counties of Miami Dade  Palm Beach and Broward  rounded out Monday at a rally at the University of Central Florida alongside former President Bill Clinton  Scott  meanwhile  campaigned with Louisiana Gov  Bobby Jindal and Texas Gov  Rick Perry  making stops in Clearwater  Lakeland  The Villages  Plant City and Orlando Over the weekend  Scott appeared with popular former Gov  Jeb Bush while Crist campaigned with Vice President Joe Biden  Biden  Bush  Perry and Jindal are all considered potential 2016 GOP presidential candidates  and battleground Florida  of course  will be critical to the fortunes of any serious presidential candidate for the foreseeable future    view photo essay     Voters  young and old  take to polls       Across the country  young and old will join together to elect leaders in a process enshrined by our Founding Fathers     At the rally  Crist and Clinton stood in front of a giant American flag in the school s auditorium  and behind a podium with a sign that said  Charlie Crist  The people s governor  Clinton began by thanking Crist for  running and going up against this amazing money machine that s against them  referring to Scott s nearly 2 to 1 fundraising advantage  He added   You cannot leave anybody home  At this campus there are still people who could vote in this election who want to build their futures in Florida   We need your youth  we need your energy  Clinton was just in Florida last month   attending an event for Crist in Tampa and another one for congressional candidate Gwen Graham in Tallahassee   We see the GOP going further and further to the right  I don t blame Crist for switching parties  I don t see him as a flip flopper  I see him as someone whose views have evolved  Michael Krysinski Democratic Sen  Bill Nelson also made a surprise appearance at the rally  criticizing Scott on a slew of initiatives including cuts to education and climate change  Nelson quoted Scott infamously saying earlier this year that he didn t know if climate change is man made  arguing  I m not a scientist  Nelson hit back to applause   Your senator is not a scientist but I can sure learn and study  Nelson  added   You have seen what has happened in the last four years and it has not been good  Before Clinton  Crist spoke for about two minutes  joking  I won t give a long speech because I know who you came to hear  He encouraged students to vote if they want equal pay  a raise in the minimum wage and a woman s right to choose   Go get five more  votes   tomorrow   because if we vote  we win  Polls have continually shown Crist and Scott in a dead heat  A Quinnipiac University survey released Monday echoed that pattern with Crist garnering 42  compared to Scott s 41  well within the poll s margin of error  Libertarian candidate Adrian Wyllie raked in a decent 7  and is taking away votes from both candidates  With the race neck and neck  the key to victory will be which candidate can turn out the most votes on Election Day   which may well be driven by which of these unpopular politicians is disliked the least  Both Crist and Scott have suffered from low favorability ratings   below 50    throughout the election cycle  Scott has tried to paint Crist as a political opportunist  and a flip flopper   pointing to his time as a Republican governor  then as an independent during his failed Senate bid in 2010  and finally his decision to run as a Democrat to try to win back the governorship  PHOTO ESSAY Election Day 2014 is here  America votes on the future of the Senate But the incumbent has baggage of his own that Crist   who was elected governor in 2006   is trying to capitalize on  The Democrat has repeatedly attacked Scott s time as head of hospital chain Columbia HCA  which was hit with a  1 7 billion fine for Medicare fraud  Scott also come under fire   largely from the left   for a host of conservative initiatives  such as pushing for drug testing of welfare recipients and pushing an austere budget that included big cuts to education spending in addition to slashing about 12 000 public sector jobs  The race has taken several nasty turns  with the two candidates trading jabs over their personal wealth  Crist has highlighted Scott s repeated use of the 5th Amendment when his hospital chain was found guilty of fraud  and Scott has called Crist a lackey of President Obama  Television ad spending has surpassed the  100 million mark  including a recent  13 million directly from Gov  Scott s own personal fortune  At times  the campaign has become downright silly   with a recent debate being infamously held up over whether or not a fan at Crist s podium was against the rules  Several national issues have sparked fierce debate between the two candidates  That includes the minimum wage  Crist wants to increase it to  10 10  Scott doesn t  medical marijuana  Scott is against a state amendment that would allow it  while Crist supports the legislation  and abortion  Scott is against abortion and has backed additional restrictions to reproductive rights  while Crist says he s against any additional restrictions  Crist has been trying to make inroads with minority  gay and young voters   many of whom tend to vote Democratic  That was apparent during his election eve rally at the UCF campus on Monday  where students lined up hours to gain entry  Whether or not Crist s last minute push will work remains to be seen  Several students expressed disillusionment with the political infighting between Crist and Scott at the rally and said they were more interested in seeing the former president than the man running for governor   I m more here to see Bill Clinton  said 21 year old senior Jon Walker  who said he was voting for Wylie  Of the party switching Crist  he said   I don t trust that he s going to have solid Democratic views  Gabriela Wolk  a 20 year old junior who identified herself as an independent  said   Both Scott and Crist are not overly appealing candidates   It s picking the lesser of two evils  Others  like 25 year old senior Michael Krysinski  dismissed Crist s party switching as no big deal   We see the GOP going further and further to the right  I don t blame Crist for switching parties  I don t see him as a flip flopper  I see him as someone whose views have evolved  said Krysinski  who already cast a ballot for Crist in early voting  In terms of minority outreach  over the weekend  Biden appeared at an event at Florida International University that focused on Hispanic voters  and went as far as to suggest the demographic could decide the race  Scott is also trying to woo Hispanic voters  In Hialeah  Scott appeared with Bush and Hispanic politicians speaking in both English and Spanish   to make his case  Early voting in Florida ended on Sunday  and about three million votes have already been cast  That includes 1 3 million ballots cast by Republicans and 1 2 million by Democrats  Kevin Wagner  a political science professor at Florida Atlantic University  said because this gubernatorial race has been so ugly and divisive  whoever wins may actually feel like a loser   It s going to be

boyfriend to pull over during the hour long drive so she could vomit  She cried when she saw the protesters outside the squat  tan building that is home to Whole Woman s Health  She didn t want to walk past them for what turned out to be the first day in a year that the clinic would be providing abortions  So she called the clinic before coming in  and a young woman in an orange  Stand with Texas  shirt came to help her through  By the time A  spoke to msnbc  on the condition of anonymity as she waited for her appointment  her mood had improved  A 20 year old college student wearing braces and a pink rayon blouse  she curled up with her legs under her in the waiting room  leaning on her boyfriend s shoulder and giggling over a shared whisper  A  only vaguely knew of the state law that had closed the clinic and threatened to do again next week  pending an appeals court ruling  A reporter explained  Texas lawmakers had required doctors to get admitting privileges at local

reopened clinic  A  had an idea of how lucky she had been with timing  if not in other ways  The birth control pills she and her boyfriend had bought at a pharmacy in Mexico   minutes from McAllen  where much of A s family lives   hadn t worked  A  is uninsured in a state that has refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act  and she has never had sex education  The morning after pill had no effect  And A  says she doesn t want kids   not now  she said in Spanish  or ever  A  also knew women bought ulcer medication at Mexican pharmacies to induce miscarriage   I was never going to take it  she said   I was afraid  because I heard that many women had died taking it  The Rio Grande Valley once had two legal abortion clinics  but Texas s far reaching anti abortion bill had forced both to close  Without those two locations  the nearest clinic was in 250 miles away in San Antonio  a fact A  and her boyfriend knew well because they had planned to travel there that week   a nearly  2 000 trip they couldn t afford and had planned to put on credit cards  They decided they wanted to fly back and forth in one day so as to miss less class time  because A  dreams of being a professor  A friend was going to drive from Austin to give them a ride to the clinic  It hurt A  that she couldn t tell family members in San Antonio  whom she rarely gets to see  that she would be

in rural parts of Texas  including the Rio Grande Valley where A  lives  had been violated by the law that closed the clinics  An appeals court is likely to overturn that decision within a week or so  but for now  the lawmakers had not gotten their way   and A  was glad   The truth is  I have no words for them  A  said of the legislators   They did an injustice to me  Texas legislators and Governor Rick Perry have claimed that they seek to protect women s health through both the admitting privileges law and one that threatens to close even more clinics by mandating that abortions only be provided in hospital like ambulatory surgical centers  But at the trial earlier this month over the law  an attorney for Whole Woman s Health and several other clinics pointed out that  over the past decade  the clinics collectively performed over 30 000 abortion procedures  During that time only two patients out of that 30 000 had to be transferred from one of the clinics to a hospital  In Texas  the mortality rate from a woman carrying a pregnancy to term is 100 times that of the mortality rate from abortion  a wider disparity than the national average  the lawyer argued  A  said she knew what it was like in Mexico  where abortion is illegal   There are illegal clinics that do it  Many women die because they don t have all of the apparatuses  or proper sterilization  she said   That s why I was afraid  that my life might be in danger  But then she read online about exactly what a surgical abortion would entail  She even read reviews of Whole Woman s Health from when it had been open previously   They said the people here were very nice  A  recalled  That made her feel better  She continued   I m old enough to decide for myself  This is my body  This is my life  She said it

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/why-california-both-liberal-utopia-and-tech-boom-central, California has been having a pretty good year  Parts of the nation s most populous state have long functioned as progressive havens  but the past few years in particular have pushed a progressive influence across the state as a whole  Under Democratic Gov  Jerry Brown and the current state legislature   which is controlled  in both chambers  by a Democratic supermajority   California this week became the first state in the nation to enact a ban on plastic grocery bags  citing environmental concerns  The state s other recent progressive accomplishments include a 2013 law hiking the minimum wage from  8 to  10 by 2016 expanded access to abortion providers stronger legal protections for temporary workers  an unprecedented new gun control regulation  and a ban on the use of  gay panic  defenses to get reduced jail time  California s left leaning governance has led conservatives across the country to bemoan the state s supposed lack of economic freedom  The conservative business group ALEC  American Legislative Exchange Council  listed Calfornia as  47 out of 50 on its most recent annual economic outlook ranking  citing  among other things  high income taxes and employee compensation costs  Similarly  the libertarian leaning Mercatus Center identifies California as the second worst state in the country when it comes to economic freedom  New York came in dead last   There have been some pretty important accomplishments on the workers  side  Maurice Emsellem of the National Employment Law Project Yet while other parts of the country are still mired deep in the fallout of the Great Recession  the Golden State has been setting the pace for economic growth and job creation  In fact  a recent Business Insider analysis found California to have the second fastest growing economy in the United States  outstripped only by Colorado  Another analysis by the left leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research determined that California led the entire country in the rate of its employment growth between 2013 and 2014  ending that time period with nearly 3  higher employment than it had going in   It s been a pretty remarkable couple of years  said Maurice Emsellem of the National Employment Law Project  NELP   There s plenty that still needs to be done  but there have been some pretty important accomplishments on the workers  side  That has something to do with Gov  Brown and the composition of the legislature  but it also has something to do with all the organizing that s been going on in California for a number of years  The minimum wage hike and temporary worker bill were just part of a suite of legislation aimed at lifting standards for low wage workers  Other laws included new healthy and safety regulations  protections against retaliation for immigrant workers  and a law preventing government employers from asking job applicants about their criminal records during the early stages of hiring  Emsellem said these laws would hopefully ensure the fruits of recovery and economic growth are more widely shared across the state  Right now  California ranks as one of the most unequal states in the country in terms of income   What all these reforms are doing is trying to make sure that everybody s participating in the improvements that are finally taking place in the economy  he said   These issues of inequality are holding the economy back if not everybody can participate  University of California  Berkeley economist Enrico Moretti was skeptical that the reforms would do much good in the long run  The recent economic growth  he said   has mostly occurred independent of state politics  you might say despite state politics   The main engine of this recovery is the tech sector in the Bay Area  Berkeley economist Enrico Moretti  The main engine of this recovery is the tech sector in the Bay Area  said Moretti   The recovery s very uneven across the state  There are parts of the state where essentially there are still in recession  especially in the central part of the state  But while the state s left leaning politics might have little to do with its modest economic boom  it doesn t appear to be holding it back much either  And some economic observers are a little more bullish about California s prospects for spreading prosperity beyond the Bay A recent City National Bank report found that the state s Inland Empire region in  posted the third highest growth rate of all Californian metropolitan areas  in the second quarter of 2014  California isn t just trying to make strides in worker protections  The state has also led for years when it comes to environmental regulations  In 2006  Republican Gov  Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the state s Global Warming Solutions Act  which among other provisions requires California to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020  The Environmental Protection Agency cited that law favorably when it unveiled its recent proposal to cut power plant emissions across the United States   California does a lot  probably more than anyone else  said Kathryn Zyla  managing director of the Georgetown Climate Center at Georgetown University s law school  The Global Warming Solutions Act  she said  was intended to act as  an umbrella policy under which the state has a lot of other goals to achieve those reductions  Since that bill s passage  California has passed a slate of other reforms aimed at improving energy efficiency and boosting its renewable energy infrastructure  Last October  Gov  Brown partnered with seven other U S  governors to encourage the manufacture of 3 3 million  zero emission  electric vehicles by 2025  The state has also aimed to encourage adaptation in part through a Climate Adaption Strategy mandated by Gov  Schwarzenegger in 2009  Although Republican leadership has often said that state mandated mitigation and adaptation measures tend to kill jobs and hikes energy bills  Zyla said California s experience suggests otherwise   California has had energy policy for decades  and there s been quite a bit of analysis on what those policies have done to the economy  she said   They ve generally been pretty positive  Case in point  A report PDF  from UC Berkeley making the case that energy efficiency measures had actually saved California households  56 billion over three decades  Those savings  according to the report  created 1 5 million jobs in the state   They ve put in place many of these policies that many people fear would have a damaging effect on the economy  and they ve show their economy will still grow over time  said Zyla  ,10/04/14 10:49 AM,abortion

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/reproductive-rights-are-the-ballot, There has been no Todd Akin in this election cycle   that is  there are no  gaffes  that have elucidated an extreme position in a particularly meme friendly way the way the infamous  legitimate rape  comment did   only those same extreme positions cast in soothingly moderate language  But that doesn t mean that women s reproductive rights aren t on the ballot across the country anyway  both implicitly and explicitly  Here s a guide  Ballot measures  Both Colorado and North Dakota have Personhood amendments   granting fertilized eggs  embryos and fetuses full citizenship rights   on the ballot in one form or another  As long as Roe v  Wade is the law of the land  a Personhood amendment can t ban abortion  but there is no current constitutional protection for in vitro fertilization processes or  for that matter  the IUD and the morning after pill  which Personhood proponents believe to be abortion  among other contraceptives  It s Personhood s third time on the ballot in Colorado  and it s gotten savvier about its wording with Amendment 67  The question on the ballot is about  protecting pregnant women and unborn children by defining  person  and  child  in the Colorado criminal code and the Colorado wrongful death act to include unborn human beings  Left unsaid  That pregnant women themselves could be prosecuted for endangering an embryo or fetus  or even for a suspect miscarriage  In North Dakota  voters will vote on amending the constitution to include  the inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and protected  Just what  at any stage of development  means has been hotly debated  Some critics contend that in addition to intending to ban abortion  it would also override advanced directives for end of life care  forcing the dying to stay on life support against their wishes  Polling conducted in late October found 45  of voters opposed the measure  with 16  undecided  Related  New War on Women Coming  Tennessee s ballot measure sounds more obscure but is likely more immediately consequential  It seeks to override a 2000 Tennessee Supreme Court decision that read a strong privacy protection in the state constitution  safeguarding against abortion restrictions the legislature has long clamored to pass  There is some more confusing wording here  The amendment stipulates that the constitution doesn t require  the funding of an abortion  but Tennessee already has no Medicaid funded abortions except in cases of rape and incest  It also mentions  circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest or when necessary to save the life of the mother    but what it is actually saying is that these exceptions  popular with voters  won t necessarily be included in any future law  Abortion opponents  ads have focused on Tennessee as an  abortion destination  and  abortion tourism  because Tennessee puts fewer burdens on women seeking abortions than other states   notably neighboring Mississippi  where there is only one clinic left  The recent polling on the amendment indicates that it s too close to call  Control of the U S  Senate  If  as polls suggest  Republicans have a good night on Tuesday  it won t mean too much for actual legislation in the short term  given that Obama has a veto pen for two more years  But it could have a sweeping impact on the federal courts  whose judges are confirmed by the Senate  These judges are usually the ones interpreting the hundreds of abortion restrictions passed by state legislatures   the judges who oversee Texas  for example  have said the state can do basically anything to stand in an abortion patient s way  including shutting down dozens of clinics    PHOTO ESSAY Election Day 2014 is here  America votes on the future of the Senate University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey Stone estimates that as many 90 judicial appointments will open up in the next two years   If the Republicans control the Senate  he wrote   you can be sure that many fewer Obama nominees will be confirmed  and that those who do win confirmation will be much less progressive than the judges this White House has managed to appoint in its first six years  Control of state legislatures  In 2010  Republicans capturing total control of state legislatures helped usher in a record number of restrictions on abortion  A few more closely divided states are still within Republican sights for Tuesday  Kentucky  Iowa  and New Hampshire

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/6-anti-woman-policies-scott-walker, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker spent this week trying to convince women voters that he isn t as extreme on reproductive rights as his record shows  Between a misleading ad about new restrictions on abortion and dodging questions about his anti choice position even in cases of rape or incest  Walker is clearly trying to redefine his stance on women s health as he enters the final weeks of his campaign against Democrat Mary Burke  Close video       The Ed Show  10 9 14  5 37 PM ET       Workers file complaint against Walker

Jennifer Epps Addison discuss    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss But Walker s dismal record on policies that affect women goes beyond just abortion  From the time the Republican governor was first elected in 2010  the aspiring 2016 candidate has championed ideas that have dire consequences for the state s female residents  young and old alike  From budget cuts to education to harsh voter ID laws  here are six policies Scott Walker has supported that have hurt Wisconsin women  Cut reproductive health access  Walker signed a 2013 law that would require women seeking abortions to get ultrasounds and require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where they perform the procedure  The law has been blocked by a judge while a challenge works its way through the courts  But Walker s budget policies have forced even reproductive health clinics that don t provide abortions to close  Five have shuttered under Walker  whose 2011 2013 budget cut more than  1 million in funding for Planned Parenthood clinics  Walker also tried unsuccessfully to repeal the state s contraceptive equity law in 2011  which requires insurance companies to cover birth control  Refused to raise the minimum wage  Women are far more likely to hold low wage jobs than men  nationwide  women make up two thirds of the 20 million low wage workers  in industries like home health care  child care  fast food service  and retail  On Thursday  a new report on the state of workers in Wisconsin found that one in four workers in the state is living in poverty  That works out to approximately 700 000 people earning less than a living wage  which federal standards set at  11 36 an hour  And Wisconsin women are more than twice as likely to hold a job that pays less than  10 10 an hour than men  But on October 7  the Walker administration shot down a complaint from a group of workers trying to increase the minimum wage from  7 25  An official from the state s Department of Workforce Development said Tuesday   The department has determined that there is no reasonable cause to believe that the wages paid to the complainants are not a living wage  in part because some people in poverty receive public assistance  A spokeswoman for the governor said Tuesday that Walker is focused on creating jobs that pay more than the minimum wage rather than raising wages for existing jobs  Walker promised in 2010 to create 250 000 private sector jobs  a promise he has fallen far short of fulfilling  Approximately the same number of women in the state hold low wage jobs  according to a report by the Wisconsin Budget Project  Repealed equal pay  The year before Scott Walker was elected  the state legislature passed a law that made it easier for victims of wage discrimination to take their cases to court  In 2012  with Walker s hard line conservative Republican allies in control of the state government  the law was repealed  Women in Wisconsin earn 75 cents for every dollar a man makes  according to the Wisconsin Institute for Women s Health  two cents less than the national average  Supports drug tests for aid seekers   My belief is that we shouldn t be paying for them to sit on the couch  watching TV or playing Xbox  Governor Walker said in September  This proposal isn t so much an item on the Walker wish list as it is a way to polish his  tough on the poor  credentials in his quest for the Republican Presidential nomination  Federal law prohibits drug testing for people seeking food stamps  which means the idea is unlikely to become law  Food assistance recipients are hardly idle  nearly half of all food stamp benefits go to children  and some 40  live in a household where at least one person is working  According to a Pew Research Center survey  women are twice as likely as men to rely on food stamps at some point in their lives  which means drug tests for food aid would be an intrusive and costly extra step for parents trying to feed hungry children  While Walker said he would be willing to challenge the government over his proposal  he has not taken steps to make his vision of drug tests for the unemployed and hungry a reality  Voter ID laws affect women  A federal court ruled that a controversial and extremely restrictive voter ID law will be in effect for the 2014 election  a move that is almost certain to create chaos at the ballot box on November 4  Data shows that women are more likely than men to lack the kind of identification needed to meet new voting requirements  Obtaining proper ID can require costly documents  and women are more likely than men to be poor  Women are also more likely to have to deal with name changes in the wake of marriages and divorces  and make up a greater proportion of the millions of elderly Americans without ID  In Wisconsin specifically  research conducted by the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee found that 59  of Hispanic women  49  of African American women  and 17  of white women were without a valid driver s license in 2002  Anti Union policies are anti woman polices  Walker grabbed national attention in 2011 when he championed a bill that gutted public sector union rights  It s a move that inspired massive protests and an attempted recall  and one that jumpstarted his national ambitions  Teaching  nursing  and social work are all public sector fields that are overwhelmingly female  and women account for more than half of all public sector union members  Walker s most famous act as governor was to slash union membership and cut labor protections for thousands of working women in the state  ,10/09/14 06:59 PM,abortion

in the governor s office  Video and transcript after the jump  RACHEL MADDOW  Wendy Davis is now running for governor of Texas  against Republican Greg Abbott  Her new book is called  Forgetting To Be Afraid  It s out today  and Senator Davis joins us here tonight for her first cable news interview since its release  Senator Davis  thanks so much for being here  WENDY DAVIS  Thank you for having me  Rachel  MADDOW  So it has been almost two decades since Texas had a Democratic governor and national liberals and Democrats like to talk about Texas turning blue at some point  how do you feel about your chances  and is Texas changing  DAVIS  I feel very good about my chances  and I think it s because there are people all over our state that feel that their values have not been reflected in what s been going on in the failed leadership that we ve seen in the last decade or so  And we have built an energy and an enthusiasm on the ground that s like nothing I ve ever seen in our state  MADDOW  Why are Texas civic participation rates so low  I mean not just among Democratic leaning demographic groups  but really  across the board in Texas  people don t participate very much in their democracy  DAVIS  It s the lowest in the country  and I attribute it to a couple of things  One  we haven t had a really hotly  general contested  race in Texas since Anne Richards lost in 1994 and we also aren t in play in presidential elections  And so over time  when you are not having general election conversations with your electorate  you re not developing an understanding and a buy in  and a tuning in to civic electoral politics and the civic engagement that comes as a consequence of doing that  When I decided to run for governor  that was part of my goal  Making sure that we drove a conversation for people to see what our values are and to really consider  are they being reflected in the leadership that we ve had  Or is it time  as we look forward to the future of our state  is it time for us to enter that 21st century future path  Is it time for change  MADDOW  In terms of the eyes of the nation being on Texas  part of the reason that Democrats have been excited about the prospect of organizing Texas  and honestly  excited about the prospects of your campaign  whether or not you ultimately win in November  Is the idea that by organizing Texas  in particular you can reach that huge population of Latino voters in Texas that not only doesn t vote very much for Texas  doesn t vote very much compared to other Latinos populations in abutting states  What s the relationship between the Democratic Party and Latino voters in Texas  Should national Democrats be hanging their hats on that  DAVIS  Well  it s disengagement across the board  It s not just Hispanic voters  It s African American voters and Anglo voters as well as well that we see that we see great disengagement in  African Americans and Hispanic voters  the majority  vote for Democratic candidates  And therefore for Democrats  it s very important to try to create engagement in those groups  But it really cuts across all populations  And making sure that you re having conversations with people  face to face  door to door  about what is going in governance  For example  all the women who have been impacted by the 2011 budget cuts that closed over 65 family planning and well women care clinics in our state  all of the women that have been impacted by that know the impact  But they don t know that it happened because political decisions makers made it happen  MADDOW  Right  DAVIS  And that s why these conversations are so important  MADDOW  On the issue of reproductive rights  obviously your filibuster on the anti abortion bill in 2013 was a huge political moment in the state and across the country  Why did you save your personal stories about your own experience with abortion for now  I guess  not to disclose during that hotly contested campaign then  why now before your election and why did you do it in the form of a book  DAVIS  That night  and as I explained in my book  I thought about bringing my personal story forwards as I was reading Carol s story  And I reflected quickly that that probably wasn t the right thing to do  I didn t want to make that day be about me  I wanted it to be about the thousands of women and their spouses or partners who supported them who had wanted so desperately for their voices to be heard  This book is my personal story it s not a political story  And as I reflected on writing about how I became who I am and why it is that I fight for the things that I fight for  I wanted to put it all out there and to be real  And I wanted and hoped and hope that for young  single  struggling moms who are looking for a path forward  I hope they ll find something inspiring in what I was able to achieve through education  I hope that women and the men who love them who may be facing very difficult decisions like the one that my former husband and I faced with our daughter  Tate Elise  I hope that they ll find some comfort in knowing what we went through and how we handled it  These stories are important  I think  for people who are looking for comfort  looking for inspiration  and that s what I hope to achieve through this book  MADDOW  There have been conservative critics of yours who have responded to this by saying they doubt your story  The National Review said these revelations about your experience with abortion are convenient and unverifiable  Essentially saying that you re making it up for political effect  Do you   if you don t want to respond to that  you have every right to just not  but if   do you care to respond  DAVIS  What I would respond  My family would give anything for this not to be a true story in our lives  We would give anything for that  MADDOW  Texas State Senator Wendy Davis  The new book is called  Forgetting To Be Afraid  It s on sale right now and it s very good  I think it s an important contribution not only to understanding you but to where we are right now  Thank you for being here  DAVIS  Thank you  Rachel  ,09/10/14 03:23 AM,abortion

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/six-burning-questions-election-night, After two years and billions in campaign spending  the midterm elections are finally upon us  Republicans are the betting favorites to win the Senate based on polling and early returns in key states  but Democrats still have a narrow path to protecting their majority  The election will put a number of theories to the test about the GOP s strength  the Democrats  organization  and where national politics is heading as we move into the 2016 presidential election cycle  Here are six questions we re eager to see answered on Tuesday night  Is this a wave election  Democrats are almost certain to lose Senate seats this year and Republicans are hoping the election turns into a  wave  year  in which voters around the country turn decisively against one party  There s been an unusually high number of these dramatic elections recently  2006 and 2008 were Democratic waves while 2010 was a historic GOP wave that washed away many of those earlier Democratic gains    view photo essay     Election Day 2014 is here  America votes on the future of the Senate       Voters all across the country will be voting on every seat in the House  several governorships and most significantly   control of the U S  Senate    In each of those races  the writing was pretty much on the wall by this point  This year  it s not so clear  A major reason Republicans are poised to make gains is because Democrats are defending a large number of seats in red states that they won in the 2008 wave  Republicans could take the Senate simply by winning six of seven Democratic held seats in states Obama lost in 2012  West Virginia  Montana  South Dakota  Alaska  Arkansas  Louisiana  and North Carolina  and holding off Democratic challenges in red states Kentucky and Georgia and an independent challenger in Kansas  Republicans are also threatening Democratic held seats in swing seats Colorado  Iowa  and New Hampshire  Republicans are clear favorites to win a majority  but many of these races are still in play and several are legitimate tossups  That means there s a wide range of possible outcomes  from Republicans running the table to Democrats narrowly holding onto the Senate  If GOP candidates sweep the red states and win in places like Colorado and New Hampshire the party can claim pretty credibly that their gains were a lot more than just a friendly map  On the flipside  if Democrats score unlikely wins in conservative states like Kansas and Georgia  things will look a lot more complicated  Will we know who controls the Senate on election night  Are you sick of the election  Can t wait to get it all over with on Tuesday  Too bad  we re probably just getting started  Two competitive Senate races  Louisiana and Georgia  have laws that require a runoff between the top two vote getters if no candidate breaks 50  on November 4th  Thanks to weaker also rans in each race  it s more likely than not that both contests go another round  which would be December 6 for Louisiana and January 6 for Georgia  The latest NBC News Marist polls  released on Sunday  give Republican David Perdue a 48 44 lead over Democrat Michelle Nunn in Georgia and Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu 44  of the state s open primary vote versus 36  for Republican Bill Cassidy and 15  for Rob Maness  another Republican  Landrieu trails by 5 points in a hypothetical runoff against either candidate  This means Republicans probably have to win a clear majority on Tuesday even without those two states for us to know the outcome  Making things even worse  Alaska s race between Democratic Senator Mark Begich and Republican Dan Sullivan  where polling has been very weird  doesn t start counting votes until 1 AM ET and could take days to finish  Extra innings may be the likeliest scenario at this point  Are there cracks in the Obama coalition  Broadly speaking  strategists in both parties have tried to manage expectations about what the 2014 elections mean for 2016  Turnout tends to be higher in presidential years  Republicans face a much tougher Senate map  and the Obama era coalition of young voters  single women  and minorities still pose significant problems for Republican presidential candidates    PHOTO ESSAY Issues that matter to new voters in North Carolina There are some races  however  where a loss would make Democrats sweat more than others  The most prominent is Colorado  a blue trending state where Democrats have dominated elections over the last decade thanks to strong performances with women and the state s growing Latino population  This year  however  Democratic Senator Mark Udall is facing an intense challenge from Republican Congressman Cory Gardner  who has managed to close the gender gap in a number of polls despite constant Democratic attacks painting him as an extremist on abortion  Latino groups are supporting Udall over Gardner  who has been cagey about his immigration position  but there are concerns that the combination of Gardner s nonthreatening tone and Obama s disappointing decision to delay executive action on deportations could blunt their impact on the race  If Gardner wins  it would not only send a signal that Colorado is still a swing state in 2016  but that Republicans may be better positioned to chip away at voting blocs that have favored Democrats in recent years than many political observers expected heading into this year  Can Democrats expand the electorate  Democrats have invested millions of dollars in a state of the art turnout operation designed to make the midterm electorate  which tends to skew older and white  look more like a presidential year in key states  Will it work  The early vote suggest Democrats are turning out a significant chunk of voters who sat out 2010 in states like North Carolina and Georgia  with the biggest gains among African Americans  but it might not be enough to overcome a strong GOP performance and Colorado is looking less promising  In Alaska  Democratic Senator Mark Begich has presided over an unprecedented outreach program aimed at organizing isolated pockets of voters  Polling generally favors his opponent Dan Sullivan  but it s all over the map and some surveys show incredibly high percentages of voters say they ve been contacted by Begich s campaign  Which polling universe is the one we live in  One more thing about that wave business  Part of the confusion over where we stand is that national polling has been exceptionally weird heading into the final stretch  A number of polls give Republicans a big lead on the  generic ballot  in which voters are asked which party they would prefer controls Congress next year  CBS News pegged the GOP lead among likely voters at 50 42 this week  an ABC News Washington Post poll put it at 50 44  and an Associated Press Gfk survey earlier this month gave Republicans a 40 32 advantage  But a number of polls over the exact same period indicate an essentially tied race  On Sunday  NBC News Marist gave Republicans a 1 point advantage at 46 45  USA Today released one last week putting them up 43 42  Fox News released another with Democrats winning 45 44  and CNN also gave Democrats 1 point lead at 47 46  There don t seem to be a lot of pollsters splitting the difference  The national numbers don t necessarily tell us much about the outcome in the individual states  where both sides have spent millions of dollars in advertising and millions more on turnout operations and voter interest is likely to run higher  Nonetheless  the difference between  1 Democrats and   8 Republicans is historically the difference between an okay night for the GOP and the kind of numbers one would expect from an epic wave year  We won t know until Tuesday whether either   or neither   of these two polling universes is ours    view photo essay     Looking back at Obama on election nights past       Take a look back at one of history s most gifted political campaigners    Will the elections affect the 2016 presidential field  Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker could be a top tier Republican presidential candidate if he wins his race against Democrat Mary Burke on Tuesday  If he loses  however  he could go the way of previous rising stars like former Virginia Senator George Allen  who s surprise loss in 2006 killed any presidential ambitions he might have had  Kentucky Senator Rand Paul  who is openly considering a presidential run  is not on the ballot this  but his state s legislative elections have enormous implications for his political future  however  Under Kentucky law  candidates are not allowed to run for two offices simultaneously  meaning that in order to run for president he would have to give up his seat in the Senate  Republicans are eager to change the law to accommodate him  but Democrats control the state house of representatives and aren t having it  The GOP has been trying for years to flip the chamber and Paul is doing his part  but if they come up short the senator will have a hard decision to make about whether he wants to abandon his influential perch in Washington for a difficult presidential bid  Then there s Hillary Clinton on the Democratic side  She and former President Bill Clinton have barnstormed the country on behalf of Democratic candidates  including in their former home state of Arkansas  They ve banked plenty of goodwill from Democrats for their efforts  but will the family brand be strong enough to actually make a difference anywhere  Poll

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/rand-paul-vs-rand-paul-personhood, There s one  culture war  issue that seems to cause anxiety for many Republican politicians  Opposing reproductive rights in general and wanting to overturn Roe v  Wade is usually pretty easy for GOP candidates  but support for  personhood  has become something of a third rail  Given recent developments  it s understandable   personhood measures wouldn t just ban all abortions  they d also block common forms of birth control    And Republicans clearly realize that opposing birth control in the 21st century  when the party is already struggling with the gender gap  isn t a credible option    As a result  we see far right Senate hopefuls like Cory Gardner  R Colo  Joni Ernst  R Iowa  Thom Tillis  R N C  and other ardent personhood supporters suddenly scramble to distance themselves from their previous position  Each of them assume the key to joining the Senate is backing away from an extremist policy like this one    But let s not forget that there s already an enthusiastic personhood supporter in the Senate   Ryan Lizza reports on one of Sen  Rand Paul s  R Ky  most controversial proposals  In recent Profile of Senator Rand Paul  Dr  John Downing  the Senator s friend and former medical partner  expressed his worries about Paul s sponsorship of the Life at Conception Act also known as the personhood law  The bill would ban abortion and grant the unborn all the legal protections of the Fourteenth Amendment  beginning at  the moment of fertilization    To Downing  who is an ardent Paul supporter  this seemed like political madness  Downing said that he believed Paul s personhood law would make some common forms of birth control illegal  and thus doom Paul s Presidential hopes   He s going to lose half or more of women immediately once they find out what that would do to birth control  Downing told me  Part of the Kentucky Republican s pitch is that he can be a national GOP leader by appealing to young people with his message of limited government  On the other hand  Rand Paul introduced   and has fought aggressively in support of   federal legislation that treats a fertilized egg as a full fledged human being with constitutional rights  which in turn would prohibit any form of birth control  IUDs  emergency contraception  etc  that prevents that egg from implanting in a uterine wall    One assumes many younger voters  most notably women  might have a problem with that  especially coming from a candidate whose raison d etre is ostensibly opposition to  big government    All of which brings us to last week  when Rand Paul seemed to hedge on his own legislative commitment    American Bridge posted this item last Tuesday  Paul was asked today in South Carolina about his position on the morning after pill  and he affirmed his support for it  Which is all good and well  except that he brags about introducing personhood legislation that could make it illegal  He s consistently been one of the most extreme politicians in Washington when it comes to women s issues  Just check out this video that he recently scrubbed from his YouTube account    Now Rand Paul thinks he can lie his way to the middle and twist himself into a candidate with broad appeal  It seems every week  you wake up and Rand Paul is selling a new version of Rand Paul  Lizza s report  which noted that religious right activists were not at all pleased with the senator s position  added   Paul  having spent the last few years convincing pro life activists that he firmly believes that the state should protect fertilized eggs the same way it protects all Americans  now simply shrugs at pro life concerns over emergency contraception    All of which is made worse when one considers how many other issues Rand Paul has changed his mind about  shrugging at other positions he also used to hold dear    ,10/09/14 12:52 PM,abortion

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/womens-equality-party-pushes-womens-rights-the-ballot, New York might soon be home to the first political party dedicated to women s rights  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo  lieutenant governor candidate Kathy Hochul  and former NYC City Council Speaker Christine Quinn have become the faces of the recently launched Women s Equality Party  whose primary goal is passage of the Women s Equality Act in New York state  The group launched in July  and their immediate goal is to get 50 000 votes on election day in November  If the group succeeds in meeting that threshold  it will be recognized as an official party by the state of New York  Their next objective will be lobbying for passage of the Women s Equality Act in the state legislature in January  Former New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn has been a key leader in the push for the Women s Equality Party   Quinn   who ran for mayor in 2013  but lost the Democratic nomination to Bill de Blasio  has largely stayed out of the public spotlight since the 2013 election  but has been making more of a public political push since the launch of WEP     We deserve full equality for women now  And come January  we re going to get it  Christine Quinn  Women s Equality Party In an interview  Quinn told msnbc that the party was launched in response to the state legislature s failure to pass the 10 point Women s Equality Act  The 10 points included items such as equal pay  ending workplace sexual harassment  strengthening human trafficking laws  and others  Governor Cuomo first introduced the bill in 2013  and while the bill passed in the state assembly in both 2013 and 2014  it failed to pass in the state senate both times  In particular  one of the ten points which dealt with strengthening abortion rights in the state became a sticking point for some legislators in the state senate who refused to support the bill if the abortion related language was in it  The point is described on WEP s website as  apply the full standards of Roe v  Wade in New York  and Quinn described it as  codifying Roe v  Wade   The bill isn t moving  The people  particularly male elected officials  have had the audacity to tell us  we ll give you nine out of the 10 things you want  but not all 10  When have they ever said that to a male official  It just doesn t happen  Quinn said So we decided we wanted to take it to the election arena   Our focus is electing and supporting the election of people who are going to pass the Women s Equality Act  We want to raise  in this election  front and center the issue of women s equality  and the issue of choice and abortion  said Quinn  The group then plans to re introduce the bill when the state legislature gets back into session in January  In New York  candidates can run on multiple ballot lines  Governor Cuomo  who is up for re election against Republican Rob Astorino  will appear on four ballot lines on November 4  Democrat  Working Families Party  Independence Party  and the Women s Equality Party  Astorino will also appear on three ballot lines  Republican  Conservative  and Stop Common Core    Also on the Women s Equality Party ballot line is Democratic lieutenant governor candidate Kathy Hochul  Beyond getting voters to choose the Women s Equality Party at the voting booths in November  the group is also pressing candidates running for New York state legislature to take a pledge that they will support all 10 points of the Women s Equality Act when in office  On their website  WEP is listing all the candidates who have taken the pledge so far  and encouraging voters to vote for those candidates taking the pledge   and to vote against those who have not pledged their support  Quinn told msnbc that the women s equality pledge has been sent to every state senate or assembly candidate  and names of those who sign are being posted on their website  But  she added   I m sorry to say we have yet to get a single Republican who has taken the pledge yet   The key thing is  when we get back in session in January  it s about full equality  It s not about   we ll give you this now  and give you the rest later  that doesn t happen  Quinn said   We deserve full equality for women now  And come January  we re going to get it  said Quinn  ,10/09/14 09:42 AM,abortion
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/new-challenge-alabama-law-puts-pregnant-teens-trial, The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Alabama to block what appears to be the nation s most restrictive law targeting teenagers who seek an abortion  That law  which took effect in July  opens the door to the district attorney calling witnesses in a teenager s life to weigh in on whether she is fit to decide to have an abortion   and includes the appointment of an attorney for the fetus  Alabama has had a law on the books since 1987 requiring that at least one parent consent before a minor gets an abortion  The Supreme Court has upheld such laws as long as there is a process in place for teens to go to court instead and argue their case before the judge  known as judicial bypass  Anti abortion legislators have been trying to find a way to make that judicial bypass more difficult  The law requires that the district attorney be notified each time a teen is trying to get a judicial bypass for an abortion  whose task is to not only to   protect the rights of the minor mother  but also to protect the state s public policy to protect unborn life  according to the Alabama law s text  According to the ACLU s court filing  the law gives both the district attorney and the fetus s appointed lawyer the power to subpoena any witness  whether that be the minor s teacher  her employer her aunt  or her boyfriend  to testify against the minor at the bypass hearing  As the suit points out  this would vastly undo the confidentiality that is supposed to be a part of these proceedings  The law also allows the other parties to delay the hearing  which could potentially mean missing the gestational age cutoff for an abortion   Some minors who participate in a judicial bypass process that breaches their confidentiality will be abused  thrown out of their homes  or prevented from having an abortion  Other minors will be deterred from seeking a bypass  and will resort to illegal and unsafe abortions  or will be forced to seek parental consent even if it is not safe to do so  the ACLU said in its filing  The attorneys also noted that most minors choose on their own to notify their parents about an abortion  but that  when a minor does not involve a parent in her decision to terminate her pregnancy  she generally has compelling reasons  including the fear of physical violence  of being forced to leave home  of being disowned  or of being forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term  ,10/01/14 05:47 PM,abortion
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/political-establishment-taking-notice-latino-vote, As this election season started  Voto Latino and other Hispanic voter advocacy groups promised that our votes would matter on Nov  4  Pollsters discounted us  pundits who are not familiar with our civic engagement campaigns pooh poohed us  Now  days before Tuesday s election  the political establishment is sitting up and taking notice  even in states that are not usually considered important states for the Latino vote   The Latino vote is here  growing and promising to decide key elections for years to come  In Georgia  the Latino share of the eligible electorate is greater than the difference in polling points between the two top U S  Senate candidates  The same is true in Kansas  North Carolina and Iowa  Can we talk Colorado  where the Hispanic vote makes up 15 4  of the eligible electorate and is poised to decide the outcome in a major U S  Senate race and House seat  Yes  the Latino vote is here  growing and promising to decide key elections for years to come  The impact will be more isolated on Tuesday  not because Latinos have decided to sit out the election  but because most of the tightly competitive races for U S  Senate  House and governorships are in states and gerrymandered House districts where Hispanic voters may not have enough numbers to influence the outcomes  Still  even in states where politicians pay little attention to the relatively small number of Latino voters in their areas  some candidates have taken a spill when confronted with an important issue like immigration reform  In Kentucky  where only 2  of eligible voters are Hispanic  Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes ran a campaign ad using the objectionable phrase   illegal aliens  and stated her approval of the ad  because I ve never supported amnesty or benefits for illegal immigrants and I never will  After progressives called the ad  offensive  and  hurtful  Grimes changed her rhetoric  using  undocumented  instead of  illegal  immigrants  She also expressed support for a path to citizenship and immigration reform  and blamed the incumbent  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell  for opposing the Senate s 2013 bipartisan immigration bill  It s a different story in Kansas  where Latinos make up 6  of eligible voters and stand to make a difference in the U S  Senate race between Republican incumbent Sen  Pat Roberts and independent challenger Greg Orman  Roberts opposed the Senate immigration bill that died in the House but Orman supports the contours of the reform measure  Also  it is now clear that  regardless of the outcome in the U S  Senate race in Georgia  neither political party will ignore the Latino vote in 2016  During the last decade  the Latino vote has grown from 34 000 to 92 000 this year and makes up 1 8  of the Georgia electorate  according to Pew Research  While the percentage of the electorate is small  Latinos are poised to make a difference in the race  which remains tied  Tuesday s balloting will offer guideposts on how the Latino community has readied to flex its political muscle in the presidential election in 2016  1  Latinos are 11  of the national electorate and growing  For the first time ever  the Latino electorate has reached 11  of all eligible voters in 2014  according to Pew Research  The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund  NALEO  projects that Latinos will cast 7 8 million ballots this year  a 1 2 million increase over the last mid term election in 2010  2  Don t count us out until we re counted  The traditional Election Day exit polling tends to undercount Latino voter participation  but Latino Decisions  well practiced in the art of gauging Latino voters  preferences  will offer results from its own polling on Wednesday morning  3  Don t assume Latinos will sit out the election  While political watchers are predicting Latinos are less likely to vote on Tuesday compared to the presidential election two years ago  voting usually drops in non presidential election years across all segments of the electorate  This year  voters  frustration with government is a common thread  4  Positions matter more than Spanish lessons  In Colorado  Republicans have reached out to the Latino vote more aggressively than in past elections to overcome anti immigration reform positions  The extra push is more than about running Spanish language television ads  In a first for a Colorado race for Congress  6th District candidates debated in Spanish before a live Spanish language television audience  But most Latino voters are U S  born and remember how candidates addressed   or ignored   their issues in English  Keep an eye on the Latino vote to see whether candidates  Spanish language appeals softened their anti immigration reform positions  5  Tuesday is not just about control of Congress  Tight gubernatorial races in Florida  Colorado and Connecticut could be decided by the Latino vote  Colorado voters will decide a measure that could restrict access to abortion and birth control services  an issue that has Latino voters split in national polling  In Nevada  Democrat Lucy Flores is running a strong campaign for Lt  Gov  and a win would place her at the state Capitol with Nevada s first Hispanic governor  Brian Sandoval  a Republican  ,11/03/14

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/wild-card-south-dakota-senate-race-gordon-howie, RAPID CITY  South Dakota   Gordon Howie s Senate campaign has just one staffer  18 Twitter followers and less money raised than his rivals have spent in a single week on ads  He boasts about having once spent the night in a Wal Mart parking lot  sleeping in his campaign s RV  then buying breakfast for his whole campaign the next morning  The price tag   7 04  But in an unexpectedly tight and volatile Senate race with the three leading candidates polling within single digits of one another and a ton of money flooding the state the unapologetically Christian conservative could help to spoil the race for Republican frontrunner Mike Rounds  A former state GOP senator running as an Independent  Howie has mostly polled in the low single digits  But earlier this month  Public Policy Polling found him as high as 12   pushing his support to the point where it provides a real threat to Rounds  the left leaning firm said  Howie  who founded a local tea party group  believes that he is the only  true conservative choice  in the race  blasting Rounds for being a squish on taxes and abortion  Dogged by an ongoing scandal over an immigrant visa program  Rounds drew a 51  unfavorable rating in a new poll one conducted by a GOP firm  to boot and Howie s campaign could be an alternative for disillusioned conservative voters  Howie  65  doesn t have much establishment support  Though he s fiercely anti abortion  National Right to Life has already endorsed Rounds  A press release promoted the endorsement from one former GOP state senator but said  other high ranking Republicans  will only support him anonymously for fear of retribution from establishment Republicans   Private assurances of support continue to come in  Howie explained  But any votes that Howie takes away from Rounds could also help empower even more liberal alternatives  Democrat Rick Weiland and former GOP senator turned Independent Larry Pressler  both of whom have come within 3 to 4 points of Rounds in recent polls  suddenly prompting Democrats  Republicans  and outside groups to dump millions into a race that was once considered a lock for Rounds  the former GOP governor  When asked about the prospect that he might spoil the race for conservatives  Howie simply replied   Duty belongs to us  results belong to God  Close video       The Ed Show  10 13 14  5 00 PM ET       Exclusive look at South Dakota senate race       South Dakota Senate race heats up as new controversy surrounds the GOP

said  if you love me  keep my commandments  His lone campaign staffer  Nick Reid  runs a specialty coffee roasting company upstairs   There s something going on  something stirring  said Howie  reflecting on the recent turbulence in the race  Howie believes that God has called on him to run and vows to fight the  secular interests  bound to attack him from both parties  I believe that God calls us to serve Him in a variety ways  many of which are not always comfortable  he said when he declared his candidacy  His first priority in the Senate   Overturn Roe vs  Wade  he said  vowing to use the bully pulpit to help fuel the battle in the courts   The strategy has to begin with someone who assumes the microphone I don t see anyone taking the lead role in that cause  In the statehouse  Howie sponsored a bill that would ban almost all abortions with exceptions for rape and incest  but only in cases reported to authorities with DNA evidence and the alleged perpetrators  identities in cases of incest  He knocks Rounds at every opportunity for vetoing a similar bill in 2004  And he believes churches should be able to participate fully in politics  calling rules restricting their involvement the product of  a fictitious separate between church and state  God  will bless or curse this nation according to the course Christians take in politics  Howie said in one campaign video  Howie s media presence has also raised eyebrows in the past  He hosts a conservative blog  The Right Side  where one regular contributor warned in 2012 that if liberals took control   Gay sex will prosper  racial blending will surge  a food stamp mentality will flourish  and harassed women will be prominent in the consumer driven workforce  The comments have since been removed from the post   There are certain things you don t tolerate  explained Howie  who said the comments about interracial relationships don t reflect his views  But Howie believes that more voters will start flocking to him once they finally realize who he is   They haven t had real look at me yet  but they re about to get that  he said  With only between  50 000 and  60 000 raised so far  according to Reid  the Howie campaign s reach so far has been limited  He has run some TV spots in the eastern part of the state  but hasn t been able to afford ad buys in the west  he doesn t have any radio spots  either  A post on his campaign website   Former President Endorses Howie Tax Plan  turned out to be a video of Howie posing with a statue of Calvin Coolidge  Still  as the race heats up  with national attention and more money pouring in  Howie could gain more exposure at the candidate forums and other public events that he dutifully attends throughout the state  Like Weiland and Pressler  Howie has assailed Rounds for the EB 5 immigration scandal that has dominated the headlines for months  A former Rounds cabinet member had been under investigation for misuse of funds from the visa program for foreign investors  then was found dead of a self inflicted gunshot wound last year  The issue has continued to loom over his campaign   Unlike my opponent  I would never sell citizenship  Howie said in a video that also poked fun at Sen  Rand Paul for his hasty exit when pro immigrant activists showed up at his table  Howie took the poll showing a surge of support for Pressler as a good sign that voters will eventually turn to him   People across South Dakota are saying that leaders of both parties have failed us  Howie said in a new ad  He continued   Which leaves the question  who represents your values  Pressler on the left  or Howie on the right  Far from spoiling the race  Howie genuinely believes that he could win it in a massive upset  He pointed to David Brat s surprise victory over Eric Cantor as a promising sign  illustrating the news on his website with a cross and orange sunbeams   If voters in South Dakota are true to form and vote their conservative values  he said   I think we win by a landslide  Poll  Will the GOP take over   ,10/14/14 08:13 AM,abortion

remains unpopular in many of states  They are seizing on a range of issues to sink their Democratic opponents  including Obamacare  which ironically  is working better than many expected  the rise of

Mark Begich is in trouble  with a recent wave of polls showing Republican candidate Dan Sullivan pulling into a lead  Begich has been trying to distance himself from President Obama in this red state  especially on issues like gun control and Obama s handling of the terrorist group known as ISIS  Committing a bad blunder  Begich last month was forced to pulled a controversial television ad accusing Sullivan  a former state attorney general  as being soft on crime  Democrats have been hitting Sullivan over residency claims and his stance on women s issues including his support for overturning Roe vs  Wade and the Supreme Court s Hobby Lobby ruling  which allowed some companies to opt out of providing free contraception to their employees on religious grounds  Arkansas  Incumbent Democratic Sen  Mark Pryor may be this year s most vulnerable incumbent  Recent polling shows his opponent  Republican Rep  Tom Cotton  a decorated Army vet and Harvard grad  up by two to five points  Pryor has been trying to woo women voters  going after Cotton for voting against both equal pay legislation and reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act  Cotton is trying to tie Pryor to the president  using the slogan on the campaign trail   a vote for Mark Pryor is a vote for Barack Obama  Cotton has always been popular in the state that Mitt Romney easily won in 2012 by 24 points  Colorado  One term incumbent Democratic Sen  Mark Udall is in a tough race against GOP Rep  Cory Gardner after narrowly leading Gardner for months  Two new  non partisan polls show Udall trailing   a Qunnipiac University poll puts Gardner up by 8 points while a USA Today Suffolk University survey shows a slimmer Gardner lead  The latest surveys are the first time Udall has been behind since July  Udall is stressing his support for abortion rights and contraception in order to woo young single women who often don t vote in midterm elections  He s gone after Gardner for his support for  personhood  legislation  which could restrict access to certain types of birth control  Republicans in term have repeatedly attacked Udall for voting for Obamacare  Georgia  Republican David Perdue and Democrat Michelle Nunn daughter of former  Sen  Sam Nunn are in a tight race for retiring GOP Sen  Saxby Chambliss  seat  Nunn polled well at the start of the election cycle but has since fallen behind and is narrowly trailed Perdue  Like Louisiana  if no candidate gets 50  of the vote  there would be a Jan  6 runoff election  Libertarian Party candidate Amanda Swafford has also been picking up about 5

for her  Iowa  Democrats are in real danger of losing a seat long held by Sen  Tom Harkin  who is retiring  The race has been close throughout the election cycle  but a recent Des Moines Register poll

out of the competition last month  leaving  incumbent Republican Sen  Pat Roberts trying to secure a fourth term against independent candidate Greg Orman  Surveys show Orman holding a slight lead against Roberts who narrowly  beat out Tea Party challenger Milton Wolf in the state s GOP primary  Orman  however  has said he isn t sure which party he s going to caucus with  Kentucky  In one of the most watched races this year  Republican Sen  Mitch McConnell is fending off a challenge from Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes  McConnell  the Senate minority leader  has picked up steam recently with new polls showing him running ahead of Grimes  The latest WKYT Herald Leader Bluegrass poll shows McConnell with a four point lead  Both McConnell and Lundergan Grimes have had major political powerhouses campaign for them  including Romney for McConnell and  Clinton for Grimes  This race has been particularly negative with attack ads flying left and right  Grimes recently released an ad criticizing McConnell for missing hundreds of Senate Committee meetings and has painted him as a D C  insider and someone who is perpetuating the so called  War on Women  McConnell has gone after Grimes  trying to argue she s for Obama s policies to help the coal industry  Louisiana  It s not looking great for incumbent Democratic Sen  Mary Landrieu  who is being challenges for a fourth term by Republican Rep  Bill Cassidy and Tea Party candidate Rob Maness  While polls have consistently showed Landrieu with a lead  she s not near the 50  threshold required by the state to avoid a runoff election between the top two candidates  A new CNN ORC poll shows the Democrat with 43  of the vote compared to Cassidy s 40  and Maness  9  In a hypothetical run off race  however  Cassidy would beat Landrieu 50  to 47  The likely Dec  6 runoff is expected to be brutal  especially if the outcome will determine which party controls the Senate  Republicans have aired ads skewering Landrieu s support for Obamacare  Landrieu  meanwhile  is trying to distance herself from Obama s energy and healthcare policies  Michigan  Democratic Rep  Gary Peters and former Republican secretary of state Terri Lynn Land are battling it out for retiring Democratic Sen  Carl Levin s seat  Recent polls have Peters regaining a lead on his challenger  with the latest EPIC MRA survey showing Peters up by 9 points  Democrats are trying to paint Land  a former secretary of state  as someone with little national experience but who was against the auto industry bailout  But she did get help from former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney  who stumped alongside her in the Wolverine State this week  New Hampshire  The Senate race in New Hampshire is getting heated  with a New England College poll released Thursday  showing Democratic Sen  Jeanne Shaheen in a statistical dead heat with Republican challenger Scott Brown  But polling in this race has been erratic  Just two weeks ago  the same pollster showed Shaheen winning by 11 points  Brown  a former Massachusetts senator defeated in 2012 by Elizabeth Warren  has been trying to tie Shaheen to Obama s positions on healthcare  immigration and foreign policy as the president remains unpopular in the state  Shaheen  in turn  has accused Brown of being a carpetbagger and has called him a protector of big oil companies  North Carolina  Incumbent Democratic Sen  Kay Hagan is trying to hold on in this conservative leaning state  Recent polling suggests Hagan holding a small but consistent lead against her Republican rival  House Speaker Tom Tillis  A new CNN ORC survey shows Hagan ahead by three points  She has repeatedly criticized Tillis on cuts to education spending  his support for a constitutional personhood amendment and for pushing a photo voter ID law in his state  In recent weeks  Tillis has launched attack ads on Hagan  accusing her of being mum on ISIS and missing meetings of the Senate Armed Services Committee  of which she is a member  Libertarian candidate Sean Haugh  a pizza delivery man  could shake up the race  He has been consistently taking 5 or 6 points  and strategists believe he could

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/excerpt-wendy-davis-forgetting-be-afraid, INTRODUCTION  I was given a thorn in my flesh  a messenger of Satan  to torment me  Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me  But he said to me   My grace is sufficient for you  for my power is made perfect in weakness  Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses  so that Christ s power may rest on me  That is why  for Christ s sake  I delight in weaknesses  in insults  in hardships  in persecutions  in difficulties  For when I am weak  then I am strong 2 Corinthians 12 7 10 When I was a young girl  we moved quite a bit  crisscrossing the country twice before we settled in Texas for good when I was ten  Mostly we moved to follow my father where his job took him  it took us  too but wherever we lived  we tried to spend as much time as we could with my grandparents  We never had a lot  but what we had was what mattered most  family  My mother s parents still lived in the panhandle of Texas in the small town of Muleshoe  My grandfather  Nealy Stovall  made his living for most of his life as a tenant farmer  and when he was in his mid sixties  he suffered a massive stroke  From that moment forward  he lived the rest of his life in a nursing home  He was partially paralyzed  and as a result he had a very difficult time forming words  When my mom and my siblings and I would pile into my mom s old Volkswagen hatchback to visit him in Muleshoe  we would pick him up at the nursing home and take him to be with us in his real home for the weekend  the home he had shared with my grandmother  On several of those occasions  my grandfather would beckon me into the kitchen and I would sit with him at their old Formica table the kind with the silver band that goes all the way around  He would bring out a piece of paper  point very determinedly at it  and I knew my task he wanted to  dictate  a letter to me so he could communicate with a friend  As you can imagine  him sitting there in his wheelchair and me with my skinny legs stuck to the plastic chairs in their kitchen on a hot summer day it was a lot of hard work  Those hours with a pencil and paper  decoding and deciphering the words he was trying to say  were slow and difficult and challenging  not just for him but for me as well  Nothing could have been more important than the task he d entrusted me with  So much was riding on my getting it right  so much depended on both of us working hard to do what needed to be done  Watching him struggle made me even more determined  If my grandfather had the fortitude to try to speak despite the broken pathways in his brain well  then I could certainly do my part  Invariably on those occasions  he would start crying  which meant that I would start crying  too  It s a very hard lesson for a ten year old to witness the despair on her grandfather s face  One of my favorite photos of the two of us was taken on one of those bittersweet weekends  He s in his wheelchair with his right arm in the gray sling he always wore after his stroke  and I m leaning in to him on the edge of his chair with my little arm around his big shoulder  I m smiling  and he is  too  if only just with his eyes  Of all the memories that have stuck with me  and formed me  and made me who I am  the ones from spending time with my grandfather are among my most cherished  because the experience drove home such a powerful point to me  the importance of having a voice  how painful it is to lose it  and how important it is to speak up for those who can t speak for themselves  and to be true to what they would say if they could  I couldn t possibly have known then that years later I would be leading a historic nearly thirteen hour filibuster in the Texas state senate to defeat an anti abortion bill  giving voice to thousands and thousands of women pleading to preserve their access to lifesaving health care and reproductive rights  As much as was written about that day the sneakers I wore  the battle over the rules of order  the dramatic closing of the capitol building in Austin that night because it was filled to capacity with people in opposition to SB 5 and as much as I will add to that account later in this book  the true power of that day transcended anything I could have expected  June 25  2013  was an awakening  It was an awakening that went beyond reproductive rights  It was an awakening for a group of citizens  all over the state of Texas  and all across the country  who understood that night that when people do stand up and when they do cry out  they can be heard and they can make a difference  And even though that bill passed just a few days later when a second special session was called  people were empowered by what they had been able to accomplish that day  They saw that we cannot continue to cede our values simply because we may not win every time we speak out  It was also an awakening for me  As I was finishing my third hour on the floor  I began to read another letter aloud one of thousands and thousands of letters that had poured into my office via e mail from women all across Texas who wanted to share their deeply personal testimony in the hopes of stopping the bill  This particular letter  from a woman named Carole  described how she learned twenty weeks into her pregnancy that the precious little girl she was carrying was dying in her womb of a rare and fatal prenatal condition  and it shared the unfathomable decision she and her husband then faced  wait and deliver their daughter as a stillborn  or take measures to terminate the pregnancy in order to spare themselves the agony of waiting for nature to run its inevitable  but unendurable  course  It was a heartbreaking letter  so raw and honest and painfully sad that I could barely get through the reading of it  Each paragraph and detail of Carole s tragic story and her eloquent plea to consider the emotional well being of parents facing such devastating choices and losses as well as the humanity of the unborn baby  undid me  and I had to stop several times to wipe my eyes and to regain my composure  And each time I did  I felt something deep inside me loosen  Giving voice to the human stories behind the bill we were fighting had emboldened and empowered me to push on through all those hours on the senate floor  it had made me realize fully how the passage or failure of that bill would affect the lives of women and their families all across our great state  But reading Carole s letter touched me profoundly and connected me to the moment  and to the issue  in a way I see now I hadn t expected and that I had  whether consciously or unconsciously  tried to ignore  It made me understand why I was there and how all the paths in my life had led me to be in that place  at that exact moment in time  to fight that particular fight  Giving voice to the truths of so many women made me see that I needed to give voice to my own truths  the truths that had made me who I am and had brought me to stand there that day  and not yield until my job was done  I had a story to tell  too  A story I had never told before  And it was finally time to tell it  Excerpted from  Forgetting to Be Afraid  by Wendy Davis  reprinted with permission from Blue Rider Press  a member of Penguin Group  USA

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/what-you-need-know-about-the-texas-abortion-case-scotus, On Tuesday night  the Supreme Court issued a temporary order in the case against a sweeping Texas abortion law  from which three conservative justices dissented  The immediate practical effect has been to open the door for 13 clinics that closed on October 3 to reopen  It s been a long  twisting path here  and it s not over yet  Here s what s happened  why it matters  and what comes next  What is Texas s omnibus abortion law  Known in the legislature as HB2  the law was famously passed despite the 11 hour filibuster by State Senator Wendy Davis  now running for governor against Attorney General Greg Abbott  who is now tasked with defending the law in court  It includes several parts  A requirement that all abortion providers have admitting privileges to hospitals  one forcing doctors to use an outdated protocol for medication induced abortion that narrows the window in which it can be used  an unconstitutional ban on abortion after 20 weeks that hasn t been challenged in court  and a requirement that abortions only be performed in ambulatory surgical centers  which cost millions of dollars to build  Though Texas claims these restrictions will make women safer  reputable medical experts  including the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  say they make women less safe  by making legal abortion less accessible or forcing women to have the procedure later  raising the risks  Is that even legal  So far  it depends which judge you ask  Under Planned Parenthood v  Casey  the controlling abortion precedent from 1992  a state can t create an undue burden  which has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion  before viability  Whether what Texas has done is an undue burden is very much an open question before the courts  Texas s law has been challenged two separate times  The first time  in Planned Parenthood v  Abbott a district court judge found in October 2013 that the admitting privileges and medication induced abortion provisions to be mostly unconstitutional  because they put an  undue burden  on women  The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals promptly overruled the district judge  and when the Supreme Court refused to issue the same kind of stay it did this week  the law went to effect  As everyone predicted  hospitals rejected the abortion providers  applications on largely political grounds  and the cumulative effect was for 20 clinics to close   Some of the clinics closed before the law went into effect  anticipating being unable to comply  In the second round of litigation Whole Woman s Health v  Lakey several clinics challenged the ambulatory surgical center requirements  which were slated to go into effect on September 1  2014  Two clinics in underserved areas of South Texas   in El Paso and McAllen  on the western and eastern parts of the border with Mexico  respectively   challenged the admitting privileges provision as applied to them  At the eleventh hour  the same district court judge  Lee Yeakel  sided with the clinics  and the McAllen clinic reopened  Texas asked the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to step in and prevent the district court s order from being enforced while it appealed  and they got their wish on October 2  The McAllen clinic closed  as did 13 other clinics that could not comply with the ambulatory surgical center requirements  That left only eight clinics open in Texas and nearly a million women of reproductive age a 300 mile round trip from a clinic  What did the Supreme Court just do  The last hope was for the clinics to appeal to the Supreme Court to undo the Fifth Circuit s move and restore the district court s decision  They got their wish  for now  That was excellent news for the 13 clinics that have only been closed for two weeks   any more and they might not have been able to reopen  said Stephanie Toti  an attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights who litigated the case   It s a very hopeful sign  Toti added   We re thrilled that the Supreme Court lifted the stay and that as a result access to critical reproductive health care will be restored to regions of the state where it had been unavailable  We think it signals that although the Supreme Court has in recent years allowed the states some latitude in regulating abortion  Texas has just gone way too far  Have other states passed laws like Texas s  Yes  The ones with the most potential impact are in states near Texas that have passed admitting privileges requirements  Louisiana  which was just challenged by clinics there  Mississippi  where a court decision blocking that law is the only thing keeping the last clinic open  Alabama  where a district court judge blocked the law as unconstitutional  but an appeal awaits  and Oklahoma  which has been challenged in the state court system  If the Supreme Court eventually signs off on such laws and they all go into effect  abortion access in the entire region will be decimated  Wisconsin s admitting privileges law is also being challenged in federal court  What happens next in the case  The Fifth Circuit will have yet another go at it  Three different judges will be assigned to deliberate on the merits  Toti told msnbc that a briefing schedule has been set to complete on December 8  and that she expects the appeals court judges to hear oral argument by the end of the year or beginning of January  Depending on when the decision comes down   and based on past experience  the law is expected to be found constitutional  even without a real medical basis   the loser is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court   The Fifth Circuit already denied a request in the first round of litigation to rehear the case en banc  with all of its judges  and there s no reason to expect it would have a different answer in the second round   They have deemed this case to be expedited  said Toti of the appeals court   So I expect we ll have a decision by the first quarter of the next year I think it s very likely that this case will be headed to the Supreme Court on the merits  Depending on how long the appeals process takes in the Fifth Circuit  it could be heard this term or next  What will the Supreme Court consider  The Supreme Court hasn t taken a major abortion case since 2007  but given the split in appeals court decisions and the real world impact of the laws  it is expected to weigh in on whether states need a good reason to shut dozens of abortion clinics  Justice Stephen Breyer said as much in his dissent from the order allowing the first round of laws to go into effect  As usual  it all comes down to Justice Kennedy   The question with Kennedy is whether he will stand by Casey as it was written  said Priscilla Smith  director of the Program of the Study for Reproductive Justice at Yale Law School   Under Casey  regulations that were designed to make it difficult for a woman to obtain an abortion are unconstitutional  Unnecessary regulations that do nothing to improve women s health but instead are designed to close down clinics fit that bill  Tuesday s order isn t definitive proof that Kennedy agrees  but it s more reason for optimism than anything that s come before  ,10/15/14 06:53

 Walker predicted he would grow the state by 250 000 new jobs   and while he didn t quite meet that goal  most of those who supported him Tuesday said that economic conditions in Wisconsin are better

of Wisconsin  Walker has dodged questions about any 2016 aspirations  but during this campaign he was quieter about some of his more extreme social positions than he was in 2010 or 2012   which could

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/2016-starts-now, DES MOINES  Iowa  The starting pistol on the next election was fired even before the polls closed  as potential 2016 GOP presidential hopefuls began to spin the results in their favor and take shots at Hillary Clinton  the likely Democratic nominee  Inside the victory party here for Iowa Senator elect Joni Ernst  the buzz had already started about the role Ernst will play as a likely kingmaker in the state s critical presidential caucus Some even said she might make a short list of GOP vice presidential picks  Kentucky Republican Sen  Rand Paul started a Facebook album called HillarysLosers  featuring photos of the defeated Democratic candidates whom Clinton had endorsed  Rick Santorum  who won the 2012 Iowa caucuses and has hinted he may run again  tweeted his congratulations to a series of victorious Republicans  including Ernst  calling her win  historical both for IA   our country  The results were a shock  Republicans were expected to win big  but not this big  Here s how it sets the stage for 2016  Hillary Clinton  Republicans will try to paint the losses of candidates endorsed by the former secretary of state as evidence that voters rejected the Clinton brand  Paul s anti Clinton hashtag immediately went viral  earning endorsements from some prominent GOPers  That will be especially true in Arkansas  Clinton s home turf  where Sen  Mark Pryor lost by a whopping 17 percentage points with 95  of the vote counted  You didnt think it could get worse than your book tour  It did  Courtesy of the U S  voters  https t co kGAZVFq7ze pic twitter com zABFStFM67  Senator Rand Paul  SenRandPaul  November 5  2014 There s little evidence to show that voters care about endorsements  but it s a useful line of attack for Republicans  They pushed this narrative with gusto after a single congressional race in May  where Clinton endorsed a friend who lost  so the shellacking of dozens of Democrats across the country will only supercharge the attacks  Some people around Clinton have long thought that Republican control of the Senate could be a benefit by giving her a clear villain to run against  and by making it easier for her to distance herself from White House   If people thought we were fired up for her before  then look out  said one longtime supporter Tuesday night  That s especially true if Republicans overreach  perhaps by trying to impeach the president  But the losses are far larger than expected  and are likely to rattle team Clinton as much as every other Democrat  If they don t lead to a recalibration of whatever strategy is emerging  it will certainly lead to anxious calls for action from Clinton s large network of advisors and friends  PHOTO ESSAY A look back at America s reigning political power couple Some have already been urging behind the scenes for an expedited presidential announcement  both to give Clinton plenty of time to build up her infrastructure and as a psychic salve for Democrats  Bill s alumni network will gather in Little Rock  Arkansas this month for a 10th Anniversary retrospective of his presidential library  but they will almost certainly look forward to the next Clinton enterprise as well  And more than 400 large donors to the pro Clinton super PAC Ready for Hillary are meeting at the end of the month in New York City with longtime Clinton strategists  There are rumors Clinton herself will stop by the meeting  but either way it will likely serve as the first unofficial strategy session of some of her biggest and most involved donors  Elizabeth Warren Democrats  After big losses  parties tend to turn on themselves with infighting that can mushroom into full fledged civil war  This happened to Republicans after 2008  giving rise to the Tea Party the next year  Some liberals are already saying Democrats lost this year because they were too moderate  and a restive progressive base that has harbored doubts about Clinton may only get more aggressive  That s especially true if Clinton moves to the center  as her husband did after Republicans won big in the 1994 midterm  Erica Sagrans  who runs the draft committee Ready for Warren  said many Democrats lost because Democrats didn t run as true progressives   This shows that when there are candidates chosen by Democratic Party insiders that strategy doesn t work very well  Voters see through it  she told msnbc  nodding to Clinton   I got a text from a Ready for Warren volunteers saying   Maybe last night s results were enough for Warren to say  screw it  I m in  she added  The problem remains that liberals don t have an obvious candidate to carry their banner   unless Warren suddenly decides to seriously consider the race    view photo essay     Rising stars for 2016       The stage is already being set for a major battle in 2016    Martin O Malley Tuesday s results were a major setback for the Maryland governor  The hardest working Democrat in the potential 2016 field hasn t been able to break through and had a rough night Tuesday when Republican Larry Hogan smoked Anthony Brown  O Malley s lieutenant governor and hand picked successor  It was an absolutely stunning upset  The state is as blue as it gets  voting for Obama by a 26 point margin in both 2008 and 2012   except for the fact that O Malley s approval rating has slipped to low the 40s  Brown ran on continuing O Malley s policies  so his defeat will be read as a rejection of the governor  who can t afford a big loss  Chris Christie It was a banner night for the chairman of the Republican Governors Association  Governors were supposed to be a bright spot for Democrats on election night  but instead are some of the party s most heartbreaking losses  In addition to Maryland  Republicans picked up key wins in blue states like Massachusetts  Maine and Illinois  And the GOP won the two marquee gubernatorial races of the cycle  Florida and Wisconsin  Christie will be sure to take credit for these wins  Scott Walker  Two terms  three wins  The Wisconsin governor survived another tough challenge and is now even more battled hardened and has even more wins to his name in the purple state  His 2011 confrontation with public employee unions and victory in a recall election made him a conservative rock star  Now he gets to have a second term to flesh out his resume  Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee  Santorum tried to associate himself with some wins Tuesday night  but social conservatives have faced a headwind in the party for several years and can claim few victories tonight  Top tier Republicans like Cory Gardner and Joni Ernst moved away from hardline anti abortion stances  while the party as a whole steered entirely clear of same sex marriage  Many Republicans know they ll need to find another way to expand their support beyond a shrinking white  socially conservative base  John Kasich  The Ohio governor and dark horse 2016 candidate ran up huge margins in his reelection bid  He faced a weak Democrat who essentially stopped campaigning after a scandal   but the fact that he doubled his opponent in the key swing state looks good on his resume  Joni Ernst  She s gone from a one term state senator to a rock star and gatekeeper in the country s most important presidential state  Ernst is already being talked about as a likely vice presidential contender  and no matter what will play a major role in 2016  Rand Paul and Ted Cruz Despite their differences  the two conservative senators will both now be tested in new ways as they gain the majority in the Senate  How they conduct themselves could determine how well they do in 2016  Cruz in particular has relished his outsider role as rabble rouser  now that he ll be in the majority  the focus will turn to whether the tea party firebrand can legislate  Mitt Romney  How did Republicans win so big in 2014 and lose two years earlier  That s a question they will likely ask the former presidential nominee if he   or former vice presidential running mate Rep  Paul Ryan   decides to try again  The presidential election has been quietly churning for months  Ready for Hillary  the pro Clinton super PAC

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/udall-rallies-latinos-leaders-fear-its-too-little-too-late, DENVER  Colo  Latino voters saved Colorado Democrats in a tough year before and now Senator Mark Udall is counting on them to do the same again in his race against Republican Cory Gardner  Some leaders in the community  however  are worried that the effort is too little  too late  after a campaign that has largely focused on reproductive rights  On Monday  the incumbent kicked off his final day of campaigning at Metropolitan State University  where dozens of supporters waved  Latinos Con Udall  signs and chanted the candidate s name   It s amazing how he goes around saying he s bipartisan  He doesn t have a bipartisan bone in his body  Val Vigil  former Colorado lawmaker  We are all Americans  Udall said   Todos somos Americanos  The main topic for the speakers  which included a DREAMer student  former senator and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar  Illinois Congressman Luis Gutierrez  and Senator Michael Bennet  was immigration reform   Let s make tomorrow a statement that this state and this country is going to move forward and embrace all of its citizens  Udall said  Here they had a clear case to make to Latino voters concerned about the issue  Udall supported the Senate s bipartisan immigration bill while House Republicans killed it  then voted to deport DREAMers  Gardner stuck to the standard conservative line on immigration for years before tacking to the center more recently  but he s still avoided taking a decisive stance on the issue  How could you possibly reward the GOP with a victory after that    view photo essay     Months of labor and billions of dollars behind Election Day 2014       Elections just keep getting bigger  louder  and more expensive  This one was no exception     They don t want to have anything like immigration reform  they don t want the DREAMers to be able to achieve their dreams and that s really what s at stake in this election  Salazar said  The question among some of Udall s supporters there  however  was whether Latino voters in the state had actually heard that message  Val Vigil  who joined Udall at the rally  used to serve in the state legislature with Gardner  When Vigil introduced DREAM Act legislation that would grant in state tuition to undocumented students  Gardner took the other side  warning that it would  reward illegal behavior  in one hearing   He opposed it every step of the way  Vigil said   It s amazing how he goes around saying he s bipartisan  He doesn t have a bipartisan bone in his body  As both campaigns agree  immigration is hardly the only issue on Latino voters  minds  Vigil is worried  however  that voters hadn t seen this part of Gardner s record highlighted enough  Since his days in the legislature  the congressman has carefully adjusted his tone on immigration  rejecting the Senate s immigration bill but promising to lead the charge for a still unidentified alternative that satisfied all sides   I don t think Udall s called him out on his record and he should  Vigil said   We re doing it on the ground  but not in media  Bennet  now the leader of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee  knows how important Hispanic support is to the party  He won 80  of the Latino vote in his upset 2010 victory over Ken Buck  who was dragged down by his hardline stance on immigration enforcement  Bennet s performance was so impressive that the Democrats  massive turnout apparatus this year is named the Bannock Street project  after the Denver street that hosted his campaign offices that year   The contrast is so stark between the two candidates   I think the people here understand there s an enormous difference  Sen  Michael Bennet  D CO  Asked about complaints from supporters like Vigil that immigration had gotten comparatively short shrift this year  Bennet suggested that Gardner s opposition to immigration reform was so well known that Democrats hardly needed ads to repeat the message   The contrast is so stark between the two candidates on the issue of immigration reform   I think the people here understand there s an enormous difference  Bennet told msnbc   You may be right that it hasn t been litigated that much  but the distinction could not be clearer  In a memo  Udall campaign manager Adam Dunstone told reporters on Monday that the race was a  dead heat  but that they expected their ground game to pull it out in part because of what they believe is a strong performance with Latino voters According to our modeling  Latinos already make up the same share of the electorate that they did in 2010   and their percentage of the electorate will continue to grow  Dunstone wrote   When all is said and done  Latinos will make up an even larger share of the electorate than they did in 2010  A spokesman for Udall s campaign  Chris Harris  also pushed back against the idea they had ceded ground with Latinos to Gardner  noting that Udall had gone after his opponent on immigration in debates  broke with Obama in opposing a delay to executive action  and offered dozens of interviews to Spanish media  Like Bennet  Harris said immigration was left out of ads primarily because voters  know he s a huge ally for immigrants  allowing them to focus on other topics like veterans care and education instead  The ground warriors getting out the Latino vote this year are less confident that s the case  Patty Kupfer  managing director of America s Voice  who has spent months leading an ambitious street by street program to turn out Latinos  told msnbc that she d heard the Udall campaign s explanation for its lack of immigration focused ads  Based on what she d seen  however  Latino voters were not automatically ready to assume Gardner is anti immigrant  especially while the congressman bills himself as an ally of Latinos  PHOTO ESSAY Voters  young and old  take to polls  The fact that there are people out there who don t really know what Gardner stands for on immigration is a problem  Kupfer said   The whole strategy of the Gardner campaign has been to cover up his record and to use nice talk around immigrants and Latinos  The Udall campaign has not stepped up to counter that  This year they have additional hurdles to overcome as well  President Obama s approval ratings with Latinos have flagged in some recent surveys after he backtracked on a pledge to enact deportation reforms by the end of the summer  Activists are worried it could depress turnout or create mixed messages as Latino groups simultaneously attack Republicans for killing reform and Obama for delaying executive actions   The whole strategy of the Gardner campaign has been to cover up his record and to use nice talk around immigrants and Latinos  Patty Kupfer  managing director of America s Voice Udall told reporters he was  disappointed  with Obama s decision on Monday and Gutierrez  in  read my lips  fashion  promised the White House would follow through while enunciating every word   The  President  Will  Issue  Executive  Orders  Before  Christmas  Gutierrez said   Millions of people will be affected by those executive orders  Kupfer s and Vigil s complaints cut to a broader source of tension between Udall and Democrats  The campaign has focused intensely on painting Gardner as extreme on abortion and reproductive rights  convinced that it s the silver bullet that will turn women away from the GOP and convince voters of all stripes that he s from his party s extreme wing   As Election Day grew closer and polls showed Gardner taking a lead thanks to a surprisingly strong performance with women  that strategy started to come in for criticism  In one debate  moderator Lynn Bartels noted that Udall had been dubbed  Mark Uterus  for his relentless focus on abortion  Things reached a boiling point at a Udall event on Monday  where a prominent Democratic donor heckled him mid speech for his focus on women s issues  PHOTO ESSAY Election Day 2014 is here  America votes on the future of the Senate  That s not the only thing you stand for  Jesus Christ  the donor  Leo Beserra  said according to The Guardian  Gardner s voting record places him solidly in his party s conservative wing  but unlike more wild eyed candidates like Buck and former Congressman Tom Tancredo  the constantly beaming congressman doesn t look the part  This alone may go a long way to explaining both Kupfer s complaints about Latino voters and Udall s struggles with women   If voters like you  it s hard to convince them otherwise  I think they like Cory  Katy Atkinson  Colorado Republican consultant  If voters like you  it s hard to convince them otherwise  Katy Atkinson  a Colorado Republican consultant  told msnbc   I think they like Cory  With the end in sight  the always upbeat Gardner s energy levels hit Robin Williams esque levels as he rallied volunteers at their Greenwood Village campaign office on Monday   We have always said Colorado will be the tip of the spear  the fulcrum of power  the opportunity to change this direction around  Gardner said  firing out the words so quickly it was almost hard to follow him  His ads describe him as  a new kind of Republican  At the campaign office  volunteers distributed mailers omitting his party entirely and touting his work with Democrats like Congressman Gary Peters and his break with Republicans on key votes  like reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act  For every issue  it seems he s picked at least one symbolic vote to give himself some plausible separation from his party  On immigration  he recently broke with the House GOP to oppose a bill that would deport DREAMers despite voting last year for an amendment that would defund the program that grants them temporary protection from removal  On abortion  he disavowed his past support for a state  personhood  measure that would ban abortion and even some birth control  but has insisted that his backing for a federal version is only a general declaration of support for life   Look  Coloradans aren t red  Coloradans aren t blue  but they are crystal clear  Gardner told msnbc   They want Washington to get the job done and get the heck out of the way  The difference between the two camp s mood is stark  Democrats are nervous about a loss and Republicans are giddy at the possibility of a win after ten years of Democratic dominance  Despite the pre emptive blame game for a Udall defeat  the final polls show the race competitive and early vote returns  the state casts its ballots by mail  are consistent with a close race  ,11/03/14 06:44 PM,abortion

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/conservative-cause-the-gops-worst-nightmare, DENVER   There is one word that has defined the Colorado Senate race and it s a word that Republican Rep  Cory Gardner and other GOP candidates across the country are tired of hearing  The word is  Personhood  RELATED Moderator grills Cory Gardner on personhood For months  local reporters have been asking Gardner  who is challenging Democratic Sen  Mark Udall  to explain his contradictory and opaque positions on a Colorado Personhood measure Gardner once supported and a federal bill he still does  Such measures would extend legal protection to fertilized eggs and are intended to ban all abortion as well as common in vitro fertilization processes and some forms of birth control  including the IUD and emergency contraception  Those reporters have yet to get a straight answer from Gardner  or one that even makes sense  The national Personhood movement  which has its headquarters here in Denver  was once a fringe concept  further marginalized even by abortion opponents  But its impact can be felt everywhere  from Senate campaigns to bills in Congress to the Supreme Court s Hobby Lobby decision   which rested on Personhood s understanding of birth control   and to ballot initiatives here and in North Dakota  Democrats hope that warning voters about Personhood and focusing on relentless messaging on abortion and contraception will draw out female voters  as it has before in Colorado and did in the 2012 presidential race  It still might  But for now  the so called Personhood issue isn t a clear win for either candidate  In fact  the only people who seem to have incontrovertibly won so far are right here in Denver  That would be the Personhood proponents themselves  who are dominating midterm election politics not only in Colorado  but in key races in North Carolina  Iowa and Wisconsin  Jennifer Mason  photographed at her office overlooking Denver  is the communications director for Personhood USA   Photo by Benjamin Rasmussen for MSNBC In only six years  the Personhood movement has utterly changed the contours of the debate over reproductive rights  In a way  even as they lose again and again  they ve already won  Gardner  who is 40 and was elected to the House in the 2010 Republican wave  once collected signatures for a Personhood ballot measure in the state  Now he tries hard to pretend it doesn t exist  In fact  Gardner has repudiated his past support for two state Personhood amendments  which lost overwhelmingly in 2008 and 2010  But he s still backing a federal version  called the Life at Conception Act  That s why he struggles to explain his position on the matter   There is no such thing as a federal Personhood bill  Gardner said on a September 28  Except the people directly involved say there is  In the same television interview  Gardner insisted he wasn t anti contraception I do not support legislation that would ban birth control  That would be crazy  he said  Yet Personhood would indeed threaten some forms of contraception   the ones Personhood supporters insist  despite evidence and medical definitions  are actually abortion  because of the unproven claim that they will interfere with a fertilized egg s implantation  RELATED Supreme Court s new session could bring decisions on huge issues Host Eli Stokols pressed Gardner further on the Life at Conception Act   Do you really think that just telling me it s not a Personhood bill makes it  not one   Does saying that make it true Gardner never really answered  By the October 15 debate between Gardner and Udall  reporters were fed up   You continue to deny that the federal Life Begins At Conception Act  which you sponsor  is a Personhood bill to ban abortion  and we are not going to debate that here because it s a fact  Your co sponsors say so  your opponents say so  and independent fact checkers say so  co moderator and local NBC reporter Kyle Clark said   So let s instead talk about what this entire episode may say about your judgment more broadly  It would seem that a charitable interpretation would be that you have a difficult time admitting when you re wrong  and a less charitable interpretation is that you re not telling us the truth  Which is it   Again  I do not support the Personhood amendment  Gardner replied   The bill that you re referring to is simply a statement that I support life   Why does no one else think that  Smith persisted   That s what we re getting at   Again  I have answered this question multiple times  Gardner said  accusing Udall of focusing on the issue too much   The people of Colorado deserve more than a single issue  Gardner said  Keith Mason is the founder of Personhood USA  which he runs with his wife Jennifer  Photo by Benjamin Rasmussen for MSNBC To be clear  that  single issue  would in fact be a set of issues   reproductive rights   that are on the political stage largely because of record numbers of abortion restrictions introduced by state level and national Republicans  and because of lawsuits like Hobby Lobby and its brethren  cheered on by all major Republicans  that undermine contraceptive access  So far  Gardner s outright obfuscation   you could call it  metaphysical nihilism  but  lying  might be simpler   has worked  He has an edge over Udall in many polls and in a recent survey  Gardner has narrowed Udall s advantage with women  from 13 to 7 Udall has been repeatedly asked if he has gone too far in attacking Gardner on reproductive rights Someone had nicknamed him  Mark Uterus  implying his interest was somehow prurient  But whether you agree with him or not  Udall s answers have been straightforward about his positions   even on more politically unpopular later abortions  On October 2  The Denver Post  the state s largest newspaper  editorialized against Amendment 67  the third incarnation of Personhood as an amendment to the Colorado constitution  calling it  radical  and saying it would endanger birth control as well as abortion  Yet a week later  it endorsed Cory Gardner  who supports federal Personhood  anyway  The paper claimed  in defiance of any evidence or claim even made by Gardner s own campaign   that contrary to Udall s tedious refrain  Gardner s election would pose no threat to abortion rights  The word Personhood did not appear in the endorsement  Jennifer Mason  who is 31 and the volunteer communications director   her husband  she said  is paid   is a friendly interview  She just isn t a particularly forthcoming one The Personhood USA headquarters in Denver does not look like the seat of a revolution  It doesn t even look like an organized campaign office  On a recent Saturday  less than a month before Colorado voters will be asked to vote on Amendment 67  the unremarkable office suite was nearly empty  There were no listed official campaign events  The only people at the office were Jennifer and Keith Mason  their four children  five  counting Mason s 20 week old fetus  which she does  and a staffer  Drew Hymer  who glared at an msnbc reporter in the elevator   Not a friendly interview  he warned  RELATED Obama problematic for Udall in Colorado How many paid staffers does Personhood USA have   I m not sure  Not many  Definitely not compared to Planned Parenthood  What about the impact their ideology would have on freezing embryos  which infertility specialists say is vital to both success and a woman s health  but which many Personhood proponents consider murder because embryos might not survive the process   I am not personally against the embryos  they haven t done anything wrong  Mason added   This is another one of those side issues that Planned Parenthood likes to focus on  There s no way that Amendment 67 could stop scientists in laboratories or moms and dads who want to conceive from using IVF  That s not what fertility experts say   On a daily basis  I would be a risk of being a criminal  if the amendment passed  Ruben Alvero  Chief and Professor  Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Colorado  had said at a press conference the day before  What forms of what the vast majority of people understand to be birth control would be banned under Personhood   Planned Parenthood says generally that all contraception will be outlawed and that is not a true statement  Mason said serenely   When I hear that contraception will be outlawed  immediately that comes to mind is  oh  women won t have anything to keep them from getting pregnant  What about the daily hormonal birth control pill  The same one Gardner has proposed making available over the counter  hoping to defuse with women voters the charge that he opposes contraception  Mason hesitated   Well  I have to be honest and say that there are many available  so I can t say with certainty which ones would be affected  Pressed again  she said   If it s found to cause an abortion  then possibly  The ones that have definitely found to cause abortions   those would definitely be affected  The IUD definitely  Here is what Mason is unequivocal about  The double dealing of Cory Gardner   In previous years of the Personhood amendment  he has collected signatures  to get it on the ballot  He decided to flip flop  she said   It didn t seem to become an issue for Cory Gardner until he set his sights on higher office  Asked if she really saw no difference between Udall and Gardner on abortion  even with Gardner s backing off Personhood  Mason shrugged  In 2010  Personhood helped elect Colorado Democrat Michael Bennet Senator  galvanizing female voters to turn out against the ballot measure and the Republican Senate candidate who had once supported it  Another Personhood amendment was defeated in 2011 in Mississippi  arguably the most conservative state in the union  RELATED Exclusive  Hobby Lobby owner speaks Even as Personhood has roiled political candidates across the country and exposed fissures within the anti abortion movement about how far to go and how fast  Personhood proponents are generally uninterested in politics  No one who understands the Supreme Court takes the group s legal strategy seriously   A flier for Personhood s Ohio offshoot responded to the objection from anti abortion strategists that Personhood could actually hurt the cause by strengthening Roe v  Wade as follows   Their argument is perfectly reasonable IF there is no God  Members of the movement disapprove of incremental policies like those that have shut down dozens of abortion clinics in Texas and other states  which have been arguably more effective at standing in the way of women who want abortions than anything else so far  What Personhood USA wants is culture change  Specifically  they want a culture where fertilized eggs are paramount  without exceptions  and anyone who stands in their way   including the woman carrying an embryo or fetus   is subject to the criminal code  Elena Salisbury  24  a Denver campaign organizer against Amendment 67  hangs signs before a press conference at Planned Parenthood  Photo by Benjamin Rasmussen for MSNBC They aren t

called out by parts of their base for not going far enough   far enough being Personhood  Evangelical Protestants being drawn into the previously Catholic terrain of the contraception wars are working from the Personhood playbook  and growing its coalition  The Supreme Court decision in Hobby Lobby  which refused to question Personhood s unscientific claims in allowing religious owners of companies to opt out of covering contraception for their employees  was the biggest public relations coup yet for Personhood s worldview    Even Republicans who have at one point embraced Personhood and are now denying or deflecting their stances   as Wisconsin Gov  Scott Walker and Iowa Republican Senatorial candidate Joni Ernst have  are still operating on Personhood s terrain  Nor is Mason bothered by the sometimes fierce battles fought among anti abortion factions on how Personhood is spoiling everything   It s important to note that they do agree on the goals  she said of her fellow abortion opponents   In fact  even before we got involved  Personhood has long been considered the end game for the pro life movement  She s right about that too  Personhood has never been so visible as a concept  and yet so strangely invisible as a movement  This year  the Colorado amendment has been rebranded around the tragic story of a woman  Heather Surovik  whose eight month old fetus  whom she had named Brady  was killed in an accident caused by a drunk driver  There was no murder charge for Brady  In response to Surovik s case  the legislature passed a law stiffening the penalties in cases like hers   but specifically exempting any procedure to which the woman provided consent  like an abortion  Personhood USA and Surovik opposed that law  Post cards and book marks sit on a table at the

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/how-latinos-are-transforming-american-politics, With America s Latino electorate projected to potentially double by 2030  Democratic and Republican strategists alike are grappling with what America s changing demographics mean for their party s future  In the last year  congressional Republican leaders flirted with passing immigration reform to improve their standing with Latinos only to back away after meeting fierce resistance from their base  On the other side  Democrats are still struggling with how far they re willing to go to on the issue  President Obama recently outraged Latino groups by delaying a promised overhaul of deportation procedures amid complaints from Democrats in conservative states that dramatic action could drag down their campaigns  Few people have studied this phenomenon as closely as political scientist Matt Barreto  who co founded the influential polling firm Latino Decisions with fellow academic Gary Segura  In a new book Latino America  How America s Most Dynamic Population is Poised to Transform the Politics of the Nation  the two combine census data  opinion surveys and focus groups to recount the prodigious rise of the Latino electorate and predict the ways their influence will be felt decades into the future Barreto spoke to msnbc on Tuesday about their findings  msnbc  Based on your polling  you write   Latinos are significantly to the left of non Hispanic whites on virtually every issue of policy  especially on economic issues  Many conservative critics of immigration reform have cited the same data to argue there s no political upside to passing it  Can the GOP win Latino voters even if they get immigration out of the way  Barreto  I think absolutely  yes  What we lay out there I think has a very important keyword in it  which is  on policy  When it comes to public policy  Latinos do expect an active and efficient federal government to be involved  They do not have any knee jerk sort of reaction to  big government  or the idea that taxes are  too high  at all  But that s on the policy side  Where Republicans have hope and opportunity is in the old fashioned face to face politics  Latinos as individuals still tend to be more conservative and that s in terms of how Latinos view their personal lives  how they view their religious lives  and how they view issues of family values  There are opportunities there for Republicans to start those discussions  That s what George W  Bush  who won an estimated 39  of the Latino vote in 2004  did well  It wasn t always harping on policy  He d talk about his religion and how it was important and about family values  and he would also talk about respect for immigrants  things that just made him seem like a nice  compassionate conservative  That s the part that resonates with Latinos  Republicans aren t going to win 70  of Latinos  but they re not destined to win 20  or 25  On that note  your book quotes Ronald Reagan s famous quip that  Hispanics are Republicans  they just don t know it yet  You say that Latinos  faith and personal values give the GOP an opening  but your research also indicates that Latino voters  while slightly more conservative than white voters on topics like abortion  don t place much political weight on religious issues  What s going on there  I d say two things  First  Latinos are not as socially conservative as people think they are or as they used to be 30 years ago  The Latino community is itself evolving on many of these social issues and they re much more open minded on issues of same sex marriage  abortion  the death penalty  all sorts of issues where they re often painted as having a strong Catholic faith  Are they more conservative on those issues than the 25  of the vote Romney won  Yes  so there is some truth to it  But what we found when we asked about these issues is Latinos tell us that when they evaluate politics today  they do not evaluate it through the lens of their religion  They re privately religious with very high rates of church attendance and personal faith  and they report that they try to live their day to day life through a moral and religious lens  But when it comes to politics  they check those at the door  That s something that white evangelicals  for example  don t do   they enter the polling place with the religious identity on  That doesn t mean Latinos will always operate through that lens  If we had asked the same questions in 2004 we might have found more Latinos saying religion was important to how they evaluate politics  but it was a different time  We can t stress enough how much the divisive politics of immigration has led Latinos to shed more of these conservative aspects of their identity  If you re thinking   My religious faith and family values issues are important to me  I d like to see politicians who embody those  then you look at those politicians and what you hear from them is how much they hate immigrants   it s a gateway litmus test for Latinos  Then Latinos push down those religious issues as political issues  It s a conundrum  Republicans need to get back very strongly to the George W  Bush compassionate conservative approach  and we think they can get into the high 30s with Latinos  It may take time  they may nominate someone like a Jeb Bush  and he may hit only the low 30s  But if they continue to nominate candidates who are moderate to good on immigration  we think that Latinos  personal family values and religious values issues could start to creep back into the picture  What s the single biggest myth or misconception about Latino voters  I would say the largest myth or misconception is that Latinos are apathetic and don t care about politics  It s easy for some strategists to make this argument when they look at voter turnout rates in the Rio Grande Valley or the Latino electorate in a place like North Carolina  which has not emerged as quickly per its population  We think that s completely misguided  When we do surveys and interviews we find that Latinos are very interested  they re very informed  they re very knowledgeable about politics today  but they re also savvy consumers  The parties have to reach out to Latinos and mobilize them  The question in Latinos  minds is  Do the parties care about us  Do they want our vote  Every time we ask in national surveys  Latinos always come in third place in polls that ask whether any campaign called you  asked for your vote  sent you mail  or otherwise contacted you  White and black voters are always on top  It s a two way street  we shouldn t just ask Latinos why aren t you voting  we should ask campaigns why aren t you mobilizing Latinos at the same rates as other communities  A number of Latino activists have argued that President Obama is alienating Latino voters by reneging on a promise to reform deportation procedures before the election  Is there a danger of Democrats losing Latino voters even if Republicans keep moving right on immigration  or do Latinos just have no place to go  I think that s the most important question that the political parties and strategists need to be grappling with  What happens to Latino voters if the Democratic Party seems to be ignoring Latinos at times  then coming back to them at other times  and the Republican Party continues to push them away  What we suggest is that it s going to be mostly felt by rates of civic incorporation  So whether you measure it by rates of voter registration  turnout  campaign donations  willingness to volunteer  you ll probably see a plateau or even a decline in Latino interest in politics if one party is perceived as ignoring Latinos and the other party is perceived as being hostile  We don t expect that they ll move to the GOP in large numbers  because the Republicans have not been good on this  But if the Democrats continue to be perceived as ignoring Latinos  it does continue to leave the door open to Republicans  If a Jeb Bush surfaces or a Marco Rubio who finally gets his policy straight on immigration or someone we don t even know yet  perhaps  New Mexico Gov  Susana Martinez or someone who hasn t emerged  that door is still open  It may only be open a crack  but it s still open  If Democrats are smart  just speaking as a strategist  they will close that door  What will determine the role immigration plays in future elections  If immigration reform passes and if it passes in a very partisan way where there s virtually no Republican support  then you start to create this legacy  just like you did with African Americans  in which Democrats are identified as pro civil rights and Republican are identified as anti civil rights  That would be a very bad outcome for the Republican Party  which is why they need to be part of the solution  As long as they hold the House they can prevent it from going through  but if there s some scenario  whether 2016 or whenever  where Democrats get unified control of government again and are able to pass reform  they could get 100  of the credit and Republicans would get 100  of the blame  That s Republicans  worst possible scenario  because then you move from losing 70  to 80  to 85  of the Latino vote just like with African Americans  This immigration issue could also go away  It could virtually fall off the map if reform passes  Then people might be focused on education reform or housing reform or whatever the next issue might be  Probably education would be next  and that s actually a good issue for Republicans  Latinos are very split on school choice  they want money for private schools  and they support a lot of principles President Obama also supports about rewarding teachers and schools based on performance  We think there are big opportunities there  You write in your book   The demography is relentless   live births contribute more to population growth among Latinos now than immigration does and over 93  of Latinos under age 18 are citizens of the United States  How much of the coming demographic shift in the electorate is dependent on policy   for example  whether Congress creates a path to citizenship or expands legal immigration levels   and how much of it is due to existing factors already  baked into the demographic cake  so to speak  Right now  we ve crossed the path where the population growth of Latinos is being driven more from US births among either immigrants or US born Latinos  If there is policy change and more people are able to naturalize or if there is just advocacy outreach and the people who are currently eligible to naturalize do so   there are a lot of people who are legal residents who could become citizens with money and effort   that would only quicken or heighten the demographic changes that are coming  But it s happening regardless of immigration  The extent to which Republicans can defuse it is the extent to which they can do sincere and good faith outreach to the Latino community   This interview has been edited for length and clarity  ,09/25/14 07:11 AM,abortion

United Auto Workers union into hostile territory for the labor movement almost overnight  At around the same time  he also signed into law tough restrictions on abortion and the Emergency Manager bill that paved the way for the state s takeover of Detroit  While Snyder maintains a reputation as a moderate Republican in many circles  those moves incensed Michigan progressives and the national labor movement   Based upon the polls  I would be very surprised to see Schauer win the election  Michael Heaney  a political sociologist at the University of Michigan The ensuing race was probably a little tougher than Snyder had been hoping  Over the summer  a string of polls suggested that Schauer was  in the words of one local press outlet   breathing down the governor s neck  In mid September  the governor responded by adjusting his campaign message to better reflect voter wariness regarding the state of Michigan s economy  Once described as  the comeback state  in Snyder campaign literature  Michigan became  on the road to recovery  Schauer  meanwhile  hammered away at the incumbent by saying Snyder s policies were mainly intended to  work for the wealthy and big corporations  He stoked the fervor of unions by talking about Snyder s right to work laws  and told msnbc that he would end Michigan s Emergency Manager system Yet even with organized labor s support  Schauer has been unable to overcome the incumbent governor s cash advantage  The bigger issue confronting Schauer has been one that Democrats across the country have struggled with this election cycle  The enthusiasm gap between the parties  Partisan Republicans are simply more motivated to go out and vote this year  said Heaney   It s just a simple story of Republicans being angry with the state of the political situation  he said  Although Snyder s politics are to the right of the typical Michigan voter s  he doesn t necessarily inspire the same outrage among Michigan Democrats that politically active Republicans nationwide feel toward President Obama  That may in part be because a majority of Michigan voters are feeling fairly optimistic about the condition of the state s economy  A poll from earlier this month showed that 51  of voters believed the state was  on the right track  That s barely a majority  but it s also a 10 year high according to pollsters  At 7 2  Michigan s unemployment rate remains above the national average  but it has been declining steadily since the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis and auto industry collapse  Some of the biggest news outlets in the state have lined up behind Snyder  largely as a result of the state s economic performance  The editorial board of the Detroit Free Press described its own endorsement as a  close call  but ultimately sided with the sitting governor  citing their belief in his ability to  build on the state s germinal economic momentum   The Free Press also endorsed Snyder in 2010  RELATED  Republicans pull TV ads in Michigan worth more than  850 000  Governor Snyder has all of the momentum going into Election Day  Newspapers across the state have endorsed the Governor due to his positive message of nearly 300 000 new private sector jobs  the lowest unemployment rate in six years  an increased investment in education  and the creation of the bipartisan coalition for Detroit s Grand Bargain  said Emily Benavides  the communications director for the Snyder campaign  in an emailed statement   Michigan is on the Road to Recovery and Governor Snyder is leading the way  Cathy Bacile Cunningham of the Schauer campaign  meanwhile  said via email that the Democratic challenger had the moment and was  firing on all cylinders   We are confident that when all the votes are counted on Election Day  Mark will have won a hard fought victory  she said  UPDATE  This article has been updated to reflect the fact that not at all recent polls suggest a Snyder victory and that the Free Press has endorsed

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/ronan-farrow-daily/vatican-document-gays-draws-cautious-mixed-response, A new document from the Vatican stating that gay people  have gifts and qualities to offer to the Christian community drew mixed responses from some Catholics in the U S  on Monday  Liberal Catholic leaders hailed the statement as a significant step to a more inclusive environment for gays and lesbians  while conservatives sought to downplay it as less of an overture and more of an ongoing move towards a more progressive church  However  some experts say the new statement  which asks Catholics whether gays and lesbians should be welcomed into the church  aligns with the pope s views and they caution that the statement is not yet complete  The document was issued during a formal meeting of church leaders  or synod  which will continue throughout the rest of the week  The church is not expected to issue a final document until next week  RELATED  Vatican asks   Can we accept gays  The document seems to align with Pope Francis  focus on outreach   he has made it a point in the past to speak the role of women in society  abortion  and issues affecting the poor Seven in ten U S  Catholics believe that Francis represents a major change in direction for the church  according to a Pew Poll released in March of this year After today s meeting  conservative Catholics don t seem to agree  but they may appreciate the Francis  efforts to make the church a more welcoming and merciful place   What the synod is trying to do is   to let these people know that the church is place of welcome not place of judgment  Dr  John Grabowski  associate professor of moral theology at The Catholic University of America Dr  John Grabowski  associate professor of moral theology at The Catholic University of America  warns that the document released today is merely a provisional text   We don t even yet have a definitive English translation  and some people are reading a little too much into it with some of the reactions I ve seen out there  He finds that  some people have certain expectations about Pope Francis and they try to fit things that happen into these expectations  Overall  Grabowski emphasizes the  more pastoral tone making the church a welcoming place for everyone  a place of hospitality for everyone very much in keeping with the pope s ministry and message  Asked if he viewed this declaration as a monumental shift in doctrine  he sees no evidence of one   But when the pope says there s a moral teaching of love and mercy  I think you re seeing impact of that here in the tone  We need to have a posture where everyone knows that they re welcome and invited  Inclusion  according to Grabowski  is the primary aim of this document   What the synod is trying to do is take people who have felt excluded because of the church s teaching  because of same sex orientation or divorce  he said  and  to let these people know that the church is place of welcome not place of judgment   There will be blowback both positive and negative  Grabowski notes   but generally among people who aren t really reading carefully  People who are  dialed in  will recognize that this is unsurprising  Professor William Mattison  associate dean for undergraduate studies at The Catholic University of America  agrees with his colleague   The document is not any bombshell or any significant departure with regard to same sex marriage or change  he said  Mattison does  however  point out that the  change in emphasis on recognizing the ways that Catholics need to reach out to gay people and to people in difficult situations  recognize the goodness that s there  While issues like homosexuality and divorce are ubiquitous in the West  Mattison said that this synod has actually placed equal weight on topics like polygamy  inter religious marriage between Christians and Muslims  and the difficulties Christians face due to migration   The conversation on the floor was actually broad  so it s interesting that the document focused on those things  he said   There s sloppiness in the document  It s just a working draft  Professor William Mattison  associate dean for undergraduate studies at The Catholic University of America Mattison echoes Grabowski s theme of mercy  He views this document as  emblematic of Pope Francis  theme on mercy of God and mercy that we re called to have toward each other However  he warns of the dangers of releasing an unfinished document so quickly   There s sloppiness in the document  It s just a working draft  Close video

Meanwhile  some left leaning Catholics are quick to hail the shift in Pope Francis s approach  Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good released a statement today directly referring to the  shift in

promises to be just the start for her   We re taking the Iowa way all the way to Washington  she said after her victory  Ernst  who will become the first woman to represent Iowa in the Senate beat out Braley by decisively winning the men s vote by a 16 point margin   56  to 40    and staying competitive for the women s vote  which split 49  for Braley to 48  for Ernst  according to the NBC News exit poll in the state She will take the seat Democrat Sen  Tom Harkin had held for three decades  Democrats painted Ernst as a  the next Sarah Palin  but the intended insult appears to have captured the magic of Ernst  Despite Ernst s staunch opposition to issues that typically appeal to women  like hiking the minimum wage and reproductive rights  Braley was never able to fully capitalize on the women s vote and the Republican enjoyed a boost as her male critics tripped up in their attacks  Harkin called her  really attractive  and likened her to Taylor Swift in the final days before the election  while Braley ran an ad painting her as a  chick  in an early ad that was denounced as sexist  Related With Joni Ernst win  a star is born in Iowa Arkansas   Tom Cotton Republican Tom Cotton  37  defeated Democrat Senator Mark Pryor on Thursday after slamming the two term senator repeatedly on Obamacare  he promises to repeal  and national security  complaining that the country was  defenseless  on its Southern border and that the Islamic State is working with the Mexican drug cartels  something U S  officials unilaterally refuted  Cotton made his political debut while still in the Army in 2006  when he penned a letter calling for the prosecution and imprisonment of two New York Times reporters who broke a story about how the government tracks the financing behind terrorists  The letter earned him the affection of the right wing  five years later  he secured establishment support when he ran to replace a retiring Democrat in Arkansas  4th district  Just a year into his first term he announced he d challenge Pryor  The Republican s 19 months in Congress earned him solid conservative credentials  The Club for Growth PAC   Cotton s earliest national supporter and a big fundraiser for him   gave him a 92  scorecard while the Heritage Foundation gave him 82  Many of his most austere votes went against how the rest of the Arkansas delegation voted  like when he voted against Sandy disaster relief    I don t think Arkansas needs to bail out the Northeast    and the farm bill  despite the fact that he represented 33 rural counties at the time  Related The 5 biggest GOP whoppers this election cycle Colorado   Cory Gardner Republican Rep  Cory Gardner defeated Democrat Sen  Mark Udall on Tuesday  according to NBC News projections  suggesting nationwide that the state might not be the minority driven Democratic stronghold they thought it was turning into  Gardner capitalized on voters  discontent with the president and refused to be caricatured as a hardcore conservative  though his voting record placed him clearly on his party s right flank  A fifth generation Coloradan  Gardner got his start in agriculture  his family owns a farm equipment dealership  and was elected to the House of Representatives in 2005  in 2007  he was appointed minority whip  A fiscal conservative  Gardner wants to cut taxes and has agreed to Grover Norquist s pledge to never hike taxes to help mitigate climate change  a social conservative  he opposes emergency contraception and co sponsored a federal Personhood act  though he later disavowed it in Colorado  The race turned reproductive rights into a top issue  with Udall hitting Gardner relentlessly over his opposition to abortion  while the Republican fought back with ads saying birth control should be available over the counter  The Democrat won women  but lost men  Christians  and older voters  who were Gardner s base in Tuesday s win  West Virginia   Shelley Moore Capito The six term West Virginia Republican representative sailed to a victory on Tuesday  defeating Democrat Natalie Tennant  She will be the first women ever elected to the U S  Senate from the state   and the first Republican

who has clashed with the tea party over cuts to federal programs and on social issues  has said Roe v  Wade shouldn t be overturned  though she has voted to ban abortions after 20 weeks  North Carolina   Thom Tillis Republican Thom Tillis defeated Democrat Sen  Kay Hagan on Tuesday night by just two points  after relentlessly tying the incumbent Democrat to the president  As the Republican Speaker of the North Carolina House  Tillis  record looks like a list of GOP talking points  he passed deep budget cuts that gutted education funding  a strict anti abortion law  and rejected the federal Medicaid expansion that deprived thousands of insurance  He reduced unemployment benefits and passed a voter ID law critics say will disenfranchise many in the 2016 election  South Dakota   Mike Rounds Republican Mike Rounds won 51 6  of the vote in a four way race on Tuesday  outperforming expectations just a month after political commenters speculated that Democrat Rick Weiland or Independent Larry Pressler might pose a credible threat in the red state that sometimes lean blue thanks to a historic reliance on farm aid  Rounds  luck improved when he began painting the race as a referendum on the president s policies   A vote for any one of my opponents is a vote for President Obama s failed policies  Rounds said on the trail  The former governor ran his first attack ads of his career during the race  tying his opponents to Obama  Photo essay Voters  young and old  take to polls Rounds served as the governor of the state from 2003 to 2011 after jumping into that race as an outspent underdog  His campaign for Senate earned endorsements of everyone from the Tea Party Express to 2012 nominee former Gov  Mitt Romney  While governor  Rounds signed legislation put an abortion ban except in cases of rape  incest  and saving the mother s life on the ballot  voters shot it down   You challenge the president  Rounds said after his win   You send the message to the president saying   We ll work with you  Mr  President  but your policies are not working in the vast part of South Dakota or the rest of the country  Montana   Steve Daines Republican Rep  Steve Daines snagged another Democrat held seat in the Senate on Tuesday night  winning easily against his opponent Democratic state Rep  Amanda Curtis  For Democrats  Montana a state the president lost in

I thought about Abe Lincoln  Udall told supporters in his concession speech   You know his famous story about the boy who stubbed his toe and he said it hurts too much to laugh  but he s too old to

find common solutions  an altogether uncommon notion in Washington  Close video         11 5 14  12 21 AM ET       Gardner   The people of Colorado sent a message        Following his important victory against incumbent Colorado Senator Mark Udall  GOP candidate Cory Gardner speaks to supporters    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss Udall s contest against Congressman Cory Gardner  who held a narrow average lead in the final round of polling  was one of the most closely watched in the country by national party leaders  Unlike most of Senate states up for grabs in 2014  which tend to lean right  Democrats have dominated Colorado politics in recent years  The party won every major statewide race since 2004 thanks to strong performances with women and Latino voters  two groups critical to President Obama s 2008 and 2012 victories  A Republican victory in a state whose diversity personifies the Obama coalition suggests that Democrats  losses this year were about more than just a poor map  Based on Democrats  recent performances  the state was assumed to be a relative long shot for Republicans heading into 2014  The presumptive Republican nominee  Ken Buck  had already lost once to Democratic Senator Michael Bennett in 2010 despite historic gains for Republicans nationally  Gardner entered the race late after previously announcing he would stay in the House  prompting Buck to drop out and run for his now open seat  Seeking to run up the score with women  Udall attacked Gardner relentlessly on reproductive rights issues  His campaign and Democratic allies spent millions targeting Gardner s backing for a state personhood initiative  which would ban abortion and some forms of birth control  Unlike Buck  however  Gardner refused to be easily caricatured as a hardcore conservative even as his voting record placed him clearly on his party s right flank  He responded by disavowing his support for the state initiative  but refused to back away from his vote for a federal version  claiming   despite fact checkers  insistence to the contrary   that it was merely a symbolic pro life measure  He ran ads saying he wanted birth control pills available over the counter to further cover his left flank  As Election Day grew near  Gardner s strategy started to yield dividends  Polls showed him closing the gap with women against a candidate whose entire campaign was based on widening it  The Denver Post  not known for its conservative bent  lent him a surprising endorsement and decried Udall s  obnoxious one issue campaign   I did vote for him   But  I don t think it was a positive campaign and that was upsetting  Jody West  Udall supporter  I did vote for him  Jody West  a Denver Udall supporter  told msnbc   But  I don t think it was a positive campaign and that was upsetting  With Gardner holding a small lead in polls heading into Tuesday s final vote  Democrats had already begun to publicly question whether Udall had erred by staking his campaign so strongly on one issue  Udall took 52  of women s vote but just 39  of men  according to the NBC News exit poll Gardner s victory Tuesday was built on strong support among traditionally more conservative groups  including 83  of white evangelicals  59  of white men and 56  of voters age 65 and older  In this state with a strong independent streak  Gardner captured half   50    of those who consider themselves political independents  This is a significant shift from 2008  when Udall won 55  of independents  Another shift was among Latino voters   Udall won 63  of the Latino vote in 2008  but only about half of that group s vote today per exit polls  National issues were also on Coloradans  minds tonight  A 81  majority of voters told the NBC exit poll that party control of the U S  Senate was a very important consideration in their vote  And among this group  Gardner captured 51  to Udall s 46    Latino activists at a rally with Udall on Monday criticized the campaign for not running ads on immigration  an issue where Gardner was trying to present himself as a moderate as well  Bennett won 80  of the Latino vote in his 2010 victory over Buck  who had presided over a major immigration crackdown as Weld County District Attorney  and immigration reform advocates were eager for another strong performance to punish House Republicans for killing reform this year  RELATED Udall rallies Latinos  but leaders fear it s too little too late  We always thought this election would come down to how many Latino voters turned out  Patty Kupfer  managing director of pro reform group America s Voice  told msnbc on Monday   It doesn t look like the Udall campaign was run  as if  that s what the election is going to come down to  Gardner opposed in state tuition for DREAMers in the state legislature and rejected the bipartisan Senate immigration reform bill  but he hinted during the campaign he would support some form of earned path to legal status for undocumented immigrants while staying slippery on the details  The Udall campaign ran Spanish language ads but none on immigration  arguing Latino voters already knew the difference between the

Hickenlooper for delaying the execution of convicted murdered Nathan Dunlap  The Democratic incumbent pushed back by highlighting the state s economic growth during his term  The unemployment rate had dropped from 9  to 4 7  in October  well below the national number  Whether Colorado s results are a temporary blip or the start of a trend  expect both sides to weight them heavily as they plan their

dozen sitting governors and senators being tossed from office by fed up voters  But it s just as easy to imagine that most or all the incumbents up for re election will narrowly hang on to their jobs  despite record levels of disillusionment and disgust with America s gridlocked government  During the primaries  several incumbent  establishment GOP senators were able to beat back surprising challenges from tea party backed candidates  That included Sens  Pat Roberts of Kansas  Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  Thad Cochran of Mississippi  John Cornyn of Texas  Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  INTERACTIVE  2014 Senate landscape In the House of Representatives  the biggest incumbent to get the boot in the primaries was House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia  who succumbed to tea party challenger Dave Brat in one of the most surprising elections in recent memory  On the Democratic side  Rep  John Tierney of Massachusetts lost to challenger Seth Moulton and Hawaii Gov  Neil Abercrombie s 40 year political career came to an end after losing to State Sen  David Ige  But  overall  incumbents  relative success in the primaries doesn t mean they re safe in November  Looking ahead to the general election  several incumbents   both Democratic and Republican   are in real danger  We received input from the msnbc com community on which of these races you are paying particularly close attention to  Here s a look at the most talked about incumbents who could be out of a job come next year  We want to hear from you  For the next article in this series  tell us  Which independent and third party candidates do you think could spoil election results this year  Kansas Sen  Pat Roberts  The Republican senator from Kansas has been in trouble for quite some time  narrowly beating out tea party challenger Milton Wolf in the state s GOP primary  This Senate race has thrown a wrench into both parties  plans  Democratic candidate Chad Taylor dropped out of the competition in September  leaving Roberts  the incumbent  trying to secure a fourth term against independent candidate Greg Orman  What makes the race even more of a wild card is that Orman hasn t said which party he would caucus with in the Senate  Roberts has tried to pain Orman as a liberal in disguise in this red state  Orman  meanwhile  has tried to pitch himself as an independent voice that is much needed on Capitol Hill  According to a new NBC Marist poll  Orman is leading Roberts by 1 point  Earlier this month  however  Orman led by 10 points  Alaska Sen  Mark Begich   The Democratic senator from Alaska  elected in 2008 after beating veteran Republican Sen  Ted Stevens  is in the hot seat himself  Begich faces a stiff challenge from Republican Dan Sullivan in a state President Obama lost by 14 points to Mitt Romney in 2012  Sullivan is trying to tie Begich to Obama  who is unpopular in the state  Begich  meanwhile  is trying to distance himself from the president  even going as far to recently say he s  not relevant  Begich has gone after Sullivan  who served as the state s natural resources commissioner  for not being an Alaska native  The RealClearPolitics average of polling data surrounding the race shows Republican challenger Dan Sullivan up by 4 2 points    Pennsylvania Gov  Tom Corbett   It s looking likely that the Republican Pennsylvania governor who was first elected in 2010  will lose to Democratic businessman Tom Wolf  Corbett has been under intense scrutiny over several issues  including his response to the Penn State sex abuse scandal  cuts to education and a sputtering economy that he inherited  North Carolina Sen  Kay Hagan  A new NBC News Marist survey released Sunday shows the Democratic incumbent senator tied with her GOP opponent  state House Speaker Thom Tillis  with 43  each  Hagan had a 4 point lead earlier this month  While Hagan has been trying to distance herself from Obama  who remains unpopular in the state  Tillis has gone after Hagan on a slew of issues  including her attendance record at Armed Services Committee hearings  He has also accused her of not doing enough in the Senate to combat the terrorist group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria  Louisiana Sen Mary Landrieu  The incumbent Louisiana senator is being challenged for a fourth term by Republican Rep  Bill Cassidy and tea party favorite Rob Maness  While polls have consistently showed Landrieu with a lead against Cassidy  she s not near the 50  threshold required by the state to avoid a runoff election on Dec  6 between the top two candidates  Right now  the GOP vote is being divided by Cassidy and Maness  But if Landrieu is forced into a runoff between just her and Cassidy  polls show the sitting senator could lose  Republicans have aired ads skewering Landrieu s support for Obamacare  Landrieu  meanwhile  is trying to distance herself from Obama s energy and health care policies  Arkansas Sen Mark Pryor   A new NBC News Marist survey showed the Arkansas incumbent Democratic senator  elected in 2003  with 43  support among likely voters  compared to GOP challenger Tom Cotton with 45   within the poll s margin of error  Pryor has been trying to distance himself from Obama  who remains unpopular in this red state where Obama lost to Mitt Romney in 2012 by a 24 point margin  Florida Gov  Rick Scott  Several polls have shown the Florida Republican governor deadlocked with Republican turned Democrat Charlie Crist  The two are not very popular in the Sunshine State and voter turnout is expected to be the tipping factor in this race  Crist  a former Florida governor  has tried to paint Scott as an out of touch businessman  while Scott has attempted to brand Crist as an untrustworthy flip flopper  The two have fought fiercely over several issues  including the economy  immigration  medical marijuana and state executions  New Hampshire Sen  Jeanne Shaheen  Republican Scott Brown  a former Massachusetts senator  hopes to unseat Democratic incumbent Sen  Jeanne Shaheen in this race in New Hampshire  Brown has trailed consistently throughout the campaign  but recent surveys indicate he is closing the gap  Brown  defeated in Massachusetts in 2012 by Elizabeth Warren  has been trying to tie Shaheen to Obama s positions on health care  immigration and foreign policy as the president remains unpopular in the state  Shaheen  in turn  has accused Brown of being a carpetbagger and has called him a protector of big oil companies  Colorado Sen  Mark Udall   According to a new NBC News Marist poll  Udall is in serious danger of losing his Senate seat  His Republican challenger  Cory Gardner  has a 1 point lead among likely voters in Colorado  according to the survey  In September  Udall had a 6 point lead  Udall has stressed his support for abortion rights and contraception in hopes of winning over young  single women who often don t vote in midterm elections  He has gone after Gardner s past support for  personhood  legislation  which would restrict access to certain types of birth control  Republicans  meanwhile  have tried to tie Udall to Obama  who is unpopular in the state  Gardner has repeatedly attacked Udall for voting for Obamacare  Wisconsin Gov  Scott Walker   Recent polls have shown Republican incumbent Gov  Scott Walker and Democratic challenger Mary Burke in a dead heat  The stakes are high  especially for Walker  who survived a recall election in 2012 and is considered a potential 2016 presidential candidate  Walker and Burke  a businesswoman and former Wisconsin commerce secretary  both played it safe during their final debate Friday  sticking to state and local issues and shying away from more controversial ones   like collective bargaining power  the minimum wage and reproductive rights   that have fiercely divided the electorate  Additional sitting governors in the danger zone include

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/attacks-abortion-voting-follow-similar-paths, The laws sound innocuous  even boring  Requiring photo identification to vote  or hospital credentials to perform an abortion  Changing building requirements for clinics  or schedules for elections  But seen together  state measures that have swept the nation in recent years restricting access to voting and to abortion could represent some of the keenest successes of the conservative movement and the Republican Party  The bulk of these restrictions have been passed since Republicans took control of a slew of state legislatures in 2010  Voter ID laws were passed in states like Texas  North Carolina  and Wisconsin  along with cuts to early voting in several more  Medically unnecessary restrictions have also been placed on abortion clinics in all three of those states  and similar laws threaten to close clinics in Louisiana  Alabama and Oklahoma  Many of the laws intentionally push the legal envelope  and are now wending their way through the federal courts  Texas has been ground zero for both crusades In 2011  the state passed the nation s strictest voter ID law  dubbed a  poll tax  by Attorney General Eric Holder  which is currently being challenged in federal court  In recent years the state has also passed restrictions on voter registration drives  Texas is also the living laboratory for the right s attempt to end legal abortion It is the only state where a federal appeals court has allowed about half of the state s clinics to close  Doctors thanks to opposition to abortion at local hospitals were unable to comply with the requirement that they have admitting privileges there  But the striking parallels go well beyond the Lone Star State  On both abortion and voting  key progressive achievements thought to have been decisively settled decades ago during an era of relative liberal supremacy are now under threat   These are two of the most significant movements to roll back rights going on in the country right now  said Wendy Weiser  director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice  Combined  she said  efforts to restrict voting and abortion rights  go contrary to the general trajectory of American legal history  of rights expanding and I think that should be alarming to people  The 1965 Voting Rights Act  VRA  appeared to settle the question of access to the ballot for good  But the law was badly weakened by the Supreme Court last year in Shelby County v  Holder  a ruling that smoothed the path for a sequence of restrictive state voting measures including Texas s   to advance in its wake   A woman s right to end her pregnancy until fetal viability was asserted by the Supreme Court in Roe v  Wade in 1973  But the court subsequently watered down the right with later decisions that have left lower court judges with relatively free rein    Strategically  the campaigns around each issue have been similar  too  In both cases  conservatives have largely taken a piecemeal approach  patiently chipping away at their targets instead of going for everything at once  Having neutered a key piece of the VRA last year in Shelby  they re now looking to narrow the law s most important remaining provision  In the Texas voter ID trial  lawyers for the state have explicitly argued that the VRA should cover only intentional discrimination  not actions that have the effect of discriminating a change that would make the law all but useless   Similarly  by forcing clinics and doctors out of business rather than trying to ban abortion outright futile under the Roe decision they re gradually making it harder and harder for women  especially those who are poor and live in rural areas  to get an abortion   It s a  death by 1000 cuts  strategy  said Heather Gerken  a professor at Yale Law School   For both of these rights  you re not allowed to ban it  So in each instance you re just making it harder than it would be otherwise  Then there are the justifications given to support these restrictive laws  Both the anti voting and anti abortion campaigns use reasonable sounding but bogus rationales to obscure their real aims  Supporters of voter ID laws frame their efforts as designed to prevent voter fraud  even though expert studies make clear that in person voter impersonation the only kind of fraud that an ID requirement prevents is virtually nonexistent  And abortion opponents claim they re motivated by the threat to women s health posed by sub standard clinics despite the fact that abortion is already an extremely safe procedure  and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists say laws shutting down clinics make women less safe  not more   In both cases  said Weiser   the public argument hasn t been direct and on honest terms about what s really at stake  That sleight of hand doesn t just muddy the public debate and invent a public crisis  it also puts the courts in a difficult position  Generally speaking  said Gerken  judges defer to legislators about the motive behind a law   As long as there could be a reasonable explanation for it  then you re allowed to do it  she said   The trouble with  restrictions on  voting and abortion is that there is almost always an unreasonable explanation for it  Gerken continued   And that puts the courts in this bind  Even the legal standard by which these laws are being judged is often similar  with their challengers pointing to their impact on low income people and people of color  The current test for whether an abortion restriction is constitutional is if it places an  undue burden  on women which can be in the eye of the beholder  In the recent Texas abortion clinic case  a demographer and sociologist testified to the particular burdens on low income women  particularly Latina women  who would have to travel at least 250 miles for an abortion if the law were to go into effect  In Texas s voter ID trial  meanwhile  the plaintiffs have put on witnesses who are experts on travel times and on calculating economic costs  in an effort to show that having to obtain an ID as an unreasonable burden the issue on which the case will likely turn  Some courts are even applying legal theories developed to bar racial discrimination a doctrine now under threat  of course to abortion cases  To keep Mississippi s last abortion clinic open  the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently drew on a 1938 Supreme Court decision against a Jim Crow era policy  which said Missouri couldn t bar an African American man from attending a whites only law school  just because he could theoretically go to another state  In 2012  Mississippi had passed an admitting privileges requirement the clinic was unable to comply with  but argued women could just go out of state for an abortion  The Fifth Circuit said the state could not delegate the constitutional rights of its citizens to another state  as Missouri had tried to do to black residents in 1938  Less explicitly  in striking down Alabama s admitting privileges law in August  district court Judge Myron Thompson focused on the violence  including bombings and murder  that Alabama abortion providers have been subject to over the decades  Yale law professor Reva Siegel argues that Thompson was implicitly evoking decades of Southern aggression against African Americans who attempted to vote  which eventually helped give rise to the Voting Rights Act   I think that the judges that are trying to resolve constitutional rights in the south around questions of abortion are putting them in the context of protection of race equality in the south  said Siegel   You could say these judges are evoking the nation s memory  of the kinds of intimidation leveled at individuals exercising their constitutional rights  One thing is clear from the comparison  Neither of these onslaughts happen in a vacuum these are deliberate and premeditated strategies  They begin with model legislation from groups like American United for Life  or with dubious scholarship from leading supporters of voting restrictions  then get adopted by enthusiastic legislators in each state  When they end up in court  they re taken up by advocates skilled at employing far reaching legal claims aimed at further shifting the terrain in a conservative direction   Rather than thinking that these are just inevitable outcomes that happen naturally  it was a strategy that somebody employed  said Weiser   If people understand that  they might be better able to push back against it if they disagree with it  ,09/22/14 08:30 AM,abortion
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/5th-circuit-decision-close-majority-texas-abortion-clinics, The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals Thursday allowed Texas to begin enforcing tough new abortion restrictions that will effectively close all but eight abortion facilities in the nation s second largest state  Unless the Supreme Court steps in  the law is poised to have the most devastating impact on abortion access of any such restriction across the country  Under the law s force  which will close 13 clinics  one out of six Texan women seeking an abortion will now live more than 150 miles from the nearest clinic  A lower court judge had previously ruled on August 28 that the law was unconstitutional  because it  would operate for a significant number of women in Texas just as drastically as a complete ban on abortion  But in Thursday s ruling  the three judge panel in New Orleans said the law would not impose an  undue burden  staying the district court decision as the state appeals  In the past year  about half of Texas s clinics that provide abortion have already closed  since a separate portion of the law was allowed to go into effect by the Fifth Circuit and then the Supreme Court  The provision at issue in the most recent ruling requires all abortions to take place in ambulatory surgical centers  or expensive mini hospitals that cost over  1 million to construct   Today s ruling has gutted Texas women s constitutional rights and access to critical reproductive health care and stands to make safe  legal abortion essentially disappear overnight  Nancy Northup  president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights George W  Bush appointee Judge Jennifer Elrod  writing for the Fifth Circuit  wrote that the district court judge had overreached because in our circuit  we do not balance the wisdom or effectiveness of a law against the burdens the law imposes  She conceded We do not doubt that women in poverty face greater difficulties  But Elrod argued the court was required to find that a  large fraction  of women would be affected by the law  even as she noted that the number of affected women in rural Texas was 900 000  In a partial dissent  Obama appointee Stephen A  Higginson pointed out that the existing clinics would now have to increase by at least fourfold the number of abortions they perform annually   Today s ruling has gutted Texas women s constitutional rights and access to critical reproductive health care and stands to make safe  legal abortion essentially disappear overnight  said Nancy Northup president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights  which represented clinics against the law  Lauren Bean  spokeswoman for the Texas Attorney General s Office  said in a statement   This decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the Texas Legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women  District court judge Lee Yeakel  had also allowed two clinics that had closed under the earlier provision  requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at local hospitals  That part of the decision was also blocked by the appeals court  and one clinic that reopened because of Yeakel s decision  Whole Woman s Health in McAllen  Texas  will close again    The law in question was famously filibustered by Wendy Davis in June 2013  but Texas Gov  Rick Perry subsequently convened another special session to pass it anyway  It also includes an unconstitutional ban on abortion after 20 weeks  which has not been challenged in court  and restrictions on medication abortion  which the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals  ruling on an Arizona version of the law  said defied medical evidence and was an undue burden on women  All eight of the clinics that can comply with the ambulatory surgical requirements are in major cities  leaving rural women with few options  and none south of San Antonio  In recent months  Planned Parenthood has announced new ambulatory surgical centers in Dallas and San Antonio  The Texas abortion law s most anodyne sounding regulations are also the most sweeping in impact  and they are echoed by laws in states across the country  most of which have been blocked by courts from taking effect  Many red state hospitals  including in Texas and Mississippi  have refused admitting privileges to abortion providers  making them unable to comply  Ambulatory surgical centers are prohibitively expensive to construct  though Planned Parenthood has been able to gather the resources to build two more in Texas  Neither clinic regulation is considered necessary by major medical organizations like the American Medical Association  which argues that they actually make women less safe by making legal abortion more inaccessible  The admitting privilege requirement has already halved Texas s abortion clinics  In May 2013  Texas had 41 facilities that provided abortion  By November 2013  there were 22  though the number has since fluctuated slightly based on individual doctors  statuses  The decision from the most conservative court in the country does not come as a surprise  only its timing does  When Yeakel issued his ruling in favor of the clinics on the Friday before Labor Day weekend  many observers expected an immediate reversal from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals  But there was a surprise twist  Texas s attorneys waited until the last minute to file its appeal brief  irritating the judges  who put off their ruling until after an oral argument  That was good news to the abortion patients in the Rio Grande Valley  who suddenly had a several week window without having to travel hundreds of miles  At that argument on September 12  Judge Jerry Smith chided Texas for filing its motion at the last minute   I m a little bit perplexed by the way that that was handled by the state  It may appear that I m just trying to give you a hard time  but I think it really goes to the seriousness of the state s claim of irreparable harm  But things looked bleak for the clinics once the argument was underway   We have to look for evidence that women face an undue burden  Just the decrease in the number of clinics doesn t tell us that women face an undue burden  does it  said Judge Jennifer Elrod  a George W  Bush appointee  in oral argument  The attorney for the clinics  Stephanie Toti pointed to a patient advocate in the Rio Grande Valley  Lucy Felix  who testified at trial that  the obstacles caused by the closure of the two clinics in the Rio Grande Valley were substantial for the women who lived there   Well  did she say that women were actually not getting abortions  Elrod persisted   I think she said she talked to different providers  and to some women  and that there were obstacles   Did she give evidence that they were undue burdens that kept the person from getting an abortion  Toti said Felix had  in fact  testified that she has  personally observed an increase in the number of women turning to illegal  self induced abortion because of an inability to reach the legal abortion clinics    ,10/02/14 06:44 PM,abortion

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/whats-the-matter-kansas-ask-the-guy-who-wrote-the-book, All eyes are on Kansas heading into election night  as the longtime Republican stronghold is host to several surprisingly competitive races that could determine both control of the Senate and the direction of the state  On the Senate side  longtime incumbent Republican Sen  Pat Roberts is trailing in polls to center left independent Greg Orman after barely surviving a challenge from the tea party  In the governor s race  Sam Brownback is fighting off a challenge from Democrat Paul Davis and a revolt from moderate Republicans after his plan to slash taxes sparked a budget crisis  Thomas Frank traced the political fault lines of the Sunflower State in his popular 2004 book   What s The Matter With Kansas  How Conservatives Won the Heart of America  which posited that Republicans had won over white working class voters by channeling their rage over closing factories and declining wages into hot button social issues like abortion  gay marriage  and immigration  To win them back  he argued  Democrats needed to champion economic populism from the left rather than tack to the center  The book s thesis was controversial at the time and remains so to this day  but the debates Frank described over the role of populism in the party  the way cultural issues shape elections  and whether Democrats can make inroads in otherwise conservative states are as relevant as ever in 2014  Its title has also endured as a political catchphrase  and the last month has seen an explosion of articles with headlines like  This Is What s The Matter With Kansas   Nothing s The Matter With Kansas  and  What s The Mater With Sam Brownback  Frank talked to msnbc on Sunday about how his book s ideas have aged and what to make of the latest dramatic developments in Kansas  The following interview has been edited slightly for length and clarity  Benjy Sarlin  Well  at the very least  your book has inspired a lot of headlines recently  Frank  It just comes up again and again and again  it s kind of weird  I didn t make the title up  you know  it came from a famous essay from the 1890s  I don t know if the phrase became an oft repeated phrase or not  but the original essay was published in 1896 and reprinted all over the country  It was a phrase that has staying power  I guess  Right now Gov  Brownback is facing a serious challenge from a Democratic opponent  Paul Davis  after his tax cuts led to a major budget deficit  And Pat Roberts faced a revolt from the tea party and now faces a serious centrist challenger to his left  How should we understand these two races  Brownback is a classic example of what I m talking about in the book  His entire career was about the culture wars and that s all anyone knew about him when he ran for governor  Then he gets in and puts into effect a state level version of the George Bush wrecking crew you have in D C    he s going to starve the government  he s going to deregulate  he s going to start a kind of border war with the states around Kansas to lure business away  he s going to defund certain agencies  It s been a disaster for the people who live there and they re very angry about it  It turns out people don t like that aspect of conservatism  I wouldn t count him out yet  The Democratic candidate has had a lead for most of the year  but Brownback has something up his sleeves  What about Roberts  That s your classic story of moderates versus conservatives  He was always a moderate senator  and then he got a challenge from the tea party and swung so far to the right  I think that guy would have beaten him if it hadn t been for his really spectacular self destruction over those X rays But even with that it was still a close race  There s another problem  which is the residency issue  This is a really common issue in Great Plains states  where they send the guy to Washington and they just never come back  We re living in a time where there is a lot of outrage out there  a lot of anger out there  In most places in the country it s being focused on President Obama  fairly or unfairly  For whatever reason with Pat Roberts it s focused on him  Do you see the seeds of a future Democratic revival in Kansas based on what s going on now  I think in both cases the Democrat or the alternative candidate are ahead in the polls because the Republican is so hated  so I m not sure if it s a model  You get back to this problem of fatalism  I don t think it s much of a strategy for the party to just wait for the other side to screw up  The central thesis of your book was that white working class voters in Kansas voted against their economic interests on issues like taxes and regulations because they had been fired up by populist cultural issues like abortion  How do you think it s held up since then  It s gotten in some ways worse  It s also mutated in some ways  The white working class vote has migrated very steadily to Republicans  Things reversed themselves a little bit in 2008  which kind of makes sense because it was an economic catastrophe and there was sort of a residual reversion to the Democrats  Obama was also obviously the man for the moment  But by and large  the phenomenon goes on  These days Republicans are much more likely to argue that Democrats are using the same social issues you described in your book  like abortion  gay marriage  and immigration  to distract from the state of the economy rather than the other way around  What do you make of the way Democrats have embraced these fights in the decade since your book  It is funny  isn t it  It is amusing the way the two parties reflect and mimic each other  but that s exactly what s going on  This doesn t mean Republicans talk about economic issues in a straightforward or honest way  but it is true that Democrats  when faced with an economic critique  will always run to the culture wars  They do it to Republicans but they also do it to people like me who criticize them from the left  Eric Holder is a perfectly example  He fails to prosecute basically any bankers for any reason  with very few exceptions  but when you criticize him it s  No  no  no  Democrats are doing great on these culture war issues  They always want to reduce the debate to that because that s where they have the sharpest contrast with Republicans  while their difference on economic issues is just not as great  After winning the 2008 and 2012 elections  Democrats are talking about a bright demographic future led by minority voters  young people  urban professionals  and single women  You ve written that you re skeptical that they can keep winning without addressing the white working class voters you wrote your book on  Why is that  I think they can keep winning and they will keep winning  The problem is that it s fatalism  If you just assume you re going to win these voters without doing anything  you re not going to do anything and you re just going to be sitting on your butt waiting for them to come your way  The thing about the conservative movement is that they don t do that  They re very dynamic  and they re always trying to persuade new people to sign up for their movement  White working class voters have very little business voting for the Republican Party and they ve won these people over since Nixon  If they re able to do that  what makes us think they won t be able to win over these other groups over time  They re certainly going to try  There are also a lot of places where what Democrats are doing is just a losing strategy  The starkest example right now is West Virginia  It wasn t long ago this was one of the most Democratic states in America  This is serious union country and they went for Dukakis in 1988  but it s just been moving further and further to the right  The Democrats don t seem to have anything in their arsenal that can shift it back the other direction  There are other mostly white states like Iowa and New Hampshire that have been trending bluer in that period  though  I haven t really studied Iowa  Obama seemed to be good on farm issues in 2008  But there are plenty of places where the old calculus still seems to work  Democrats are talking about income inequality more than ever  Do you think they re moving toward the kind of populism you envisioned in 2004 or is this current incarnation still different  They basically rolled out my kind of populism in the last election against Mitt Romney with devastating effect  Obama also did it very well in 2008  which was in the middle of a global financial crisis brought on by Bush administration policies to appease Wall Street  so it came very naturally then  The problem is Obama hasn t governed that way  There are so many ways in which he s just done different favors for Wall Street  When I talk to my liberal friends  their attitude is he can t do anything because Congress won t let him  Well  he is the president  lots of things are up to his discretion  and there are lots of things he could do that would be popular  Some are obvious  Go after Wall Street bankers  just do it  go get these guys  Another is to start enforcing antitrust laws  You talk to tea party people or disaffected  disgruntled working class voters of any race  they are furious about the big banks getting bigger  they are furious about their phone company and the lousy service you get  and you can just go down the list of monopolies permitted  Poll  Will Democrats hold onto the Senate in November   ,10/06/14 01:41

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/conservatives-condemn-ruth-bader-ginsburgs-abortion-comments, Here are some people who are not about to hop on the notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg meme party train Conservatives condemning the senior Supreme Court Justice in the minority for speaking candidly about a Texas law that has already shuttered nearly half of the state s abortion clinics  A handful have called on her to recuse herself should the court consider the law  which has already had by far the most devastating impact of all the recent crop of state level abortion restrictions    In an interview with The New Republic published earlier this week  Ginsburg discussed the impact overturning Roe v  Wade would have saying   Women who can t pay are the only women who would be affected  if some states could ban abortion  Her interviewer  Jeffrey Rosen  responded   So how can advocates make sure that poor women s access to reproductive choice is protected  Can legislatures be trusted or is it necessary for courts to remain vigilant  Ginsburg replied   How could you trust legislatures in view of the restrictions states are imposing  Think of the Texas legislation that would put most clinics out of business She added   The courts can t be trusted either  and listed a number of previous Supreme Court decisions  including one in which she fiercely dissented   In fact  since an appeals court and a majority on the Supreme Court allowed parts of the law to go into effect while it is being challenged   the requirement that abortion providers gain admitting privileges at local hospitals   nearly half of Texas s abortion clinics have already closed Pending another decision expected any day now  all but six may soon close under a separate requirement that clinics turn into mini hospitals  Expert testimony in the trials over the law has shown that its burden disproportionately falls on low income women  who were the people Rosen asked about  So while Ginsburg s description of the Texas law was arguably descriptive  it was also a statement of fact  Still  the right immediately seized on Ginsburg s comments  In a post headlined   Did RBG Disqualify Herself From Texas Abortion Case Josh Blackman  a law professor at South Texas College of Law and an influential blogger  wrote it seems that Justice Ginsburg has made up her mind about this law  It is not a health measure  but a law to put clinics out of business   The American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have both explicitly said the law is not a  health measure  in the sense of keeping women safer  they have stated that it does the opposite   What about the fact that Justice Antonin Scalia frequently makes incendiary comments in the press about issues that may come before the court   What makes this comment so problematic is that she referred to a specific law that is currently before the 5th Circuit  and will be appealed to SCOTUS one way or the other  Blackman wrote   Scalia and Ginsburg have talked about abortion and the death penalty ad nauseum for decades  but it was always framed in terms of the issues they discussed in their dissents not specific cases that may come before the Court  The criticism has continued to spread   This comment by a justice on a specific law would seem the very stuff of which recusal obligations are made  wrote Ed Whelan at The National Review  He also wrote   I don t see how anyone could read Ginsburg s two sentences as reflecting anything other than a very negative opinion of the Texas law and as thus leading a reasonable observer to question her impartiality Casey Mattox  senior counsel with the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom  jumped in too  as did Priests for Life  which is currently suing the Obama administration over signing a contraceptive coverage opt out form   Supreme Court justices are not supposed to announce how they will rule on a case before they even hear oral arguments  It s a question of basic integrity and common sense  said Fr Frank Pavone  National Director of Priests for Life   Justice Ginsburg has already announced to the world how she would vote on a key question regarding Texas s abortion law that s now in federal court  That s wrong and she should remove herself from any decision on that law  Amanda Frost  a law professor at American University  told Legal Times that Ginsburg should have erred on the side of caution and avoided making any statements about legislation at issue in a pending case  but that ultimately her comment didn t meet the threshold for recusing herself from the case  because it was a statement of fact  What actual suspense would there be in the world over how Justice Ginsburg would vote if the Texas law came before the Court  She has spent decades on the bench robustly defending reproductive freedom  and the Texas law is one of several similar ones that would shut down dozens of safe and legal clinics across the country  Unlike in the recent McCullen v  Coakley case  in which Ginsburg voted with a unanimous court to strike down Massachusetts  abortion clinic buffer zone  there are no other competing rights like the First Amendment at stake   On the other hand  the preliminary decision on the Texas law was 5 4  If defenders of Texas s abortion law somehow manage to work the refs and disqualify the vote of court s most celebrated women s rights advocate  their chances are that much better    ,10/01/14 01:41 PM,abortion
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/spanish-conservatives-reverse-course-abortion-restrictions, In 2011  with Spain s economy struggling badly  conservatives offered a dramatically different course for the country  including some of the toughest abortion restrictions on the continent  When they won  the conservatives saw it as a mandate for their agenda    That didn t quite work out as planned  Spain s government withdrew a bill that would have imposed some of Europe s strictest curbs on abortion  bowing to popular sentiment and dissent within the ruling conservative Popular Party    The decision Tuesday by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on one of the most divisive social issues in this largely Roman Catholic country prompted sharp protests from some of his party s core supporters  His justice minister  the bill s chief advocate  resigned  Polls in Spain showed opposition to the anti abortion plan at about four to one  Faced with overwhelming popular sentiment  Rajoy will now pursue modest expansion of the country s parental consent laws for minors seeking abortions    Except  some political dynamics being universal  the conservatives  base isn t at all satisfied with the prime minister s scaled back agenda    Ed Kilgore summarized the larger context nicely  A political party with close ties to religious conservatives wins a national election thanks to unhappiness with the ruling center left party s economic and financial performance  Challenged to redeem its platform promising a major reversal of landmark laws making abortion generally legal  the conservative party promulgates a law banning the procedure  with exceptions for rape  incest  and threats to the physical and mental health of the mother  Protests appear and spread as women object to the turning back of the clock  Public opinion surveys show 70 to 80 percent opposition to the new law    And finally  the conservative party s prime minister relents  puts off implementation of the abortion ban on grounds that it would be reversed at the next change of party control  and instead proposes a face saving measure providing for parental approval of abortions by minors  Anti choicers and religious officials are very  very displeased and the governing party could be heading toward disarray  Ed s point  of course  is to highlight the lessons of Spain as they could apply to the United States  Most notably  the Spanish abortion controversy could send a warning signal to Republicans in 2016   the public may not be satisfied with the nation s direction or the state of the status quo  but that s not necessarily an endorsement of the opposition party s agenda    I think that s right  though we don t have to look to the near future for a parallel   the recent past works just fine  In late 2010  Americans were in a sour mood about a tepid economic recovery  Congress was unpopular  and President Obama s support had waned  Republicans rode an enormous wave to electoral gains nationwide  including control of the U S  House    GOP leaders saw this as proof that the public was on board with a scorched earth  right wing agenda  The 2010 election results  Republicans assumed  had less to do with Americans  discontent in the wake of an economic crash  and more to do with the mainstream s love of conservative ideas and the GOP s no compromise governing vision    It s funny what politicians can believe about their own propaganda    The difference  of course  is that Spain s conservatives  fearing a backlash  are changing course  American conservatives  confident that redistricting and Democratic apathy will shield them from voters  will  are content to stay the course indefinitely    ,09/24/14 10:53 AM,abortion

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gop-chairs-abortion-flub, If Republicans are so confident in their positions on abortion and contraception  why do they keep shying away from discussing them   or changing the subject to something different altogether  Nowhere was this clearer than in a recent interview by the head of the Republican National Committee    On NBC s  Meet the Press  on Sunday  host Chuck Todd asked RNC Chair Reince Priebus about his agenda  and then followed up with   One of the things in here that you didn t mention  there s a lot of social issues  Why was that  He added   It seems like you re nervous about it Are social issues working against you guys  Then Todd got even more pointed  bringing up the recent court decision allowing a Texas abortion law to go into effect  closing 13 more of that state s clinics   You don t like a lot of regulation on businesses  except if the business is a abortion clinic  Todd said  Priebus replied   Well  you obviously have to talk to someone in Texas  But the fact of the matter is that we believe that any woman that s faced with an unplanned pregnancy deserves compassion  respect  counseling  whatever it is that we can offer to be   Todd cut in   But 80  of those clinics are gone  It s something that they have to drive 200 or 300 miles for that compassion  That s when Priebus either veered wildly off topic or outright misrepresented the law  depending on how you read it   No  look  listen Chuck  The issue for us is only one thing  he said   And that s whether you ought to use taxpayer money to fund abortion  This is a complete non sequitur  It has nothing to do with the Texas law  which requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges at local hospitals  convert their buildings to mini hospitals  and use a less safe protocol for emergency contraception  as well as banning abortion after 20 weeks  As for taxpayer funding for abortion  it has been barred under the federal Hyde Amendment since 1976  except for in cases of rape and incest  Some states provide their own Medicaid funding for the procedure  but Texas follows the Hyde standard  The law in question did nothing to change that  It is also completely inaccurate to say that for Republicans  either nationally or in the states   the issue for us is only one thing  Is that why the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives has since 2011 passed a bill defunding Planned Parenthood s contraceptive funding on the grounds that it also provides abortions  without federal funds  and a federal ban on abortions after 20 weeks   Is that why the Republican takeovers of statehouses across the country meant more abortion restrictions in three years than in the entire previous decade  the vast majority of which had nothing to with undoing what tangential public funding is still left  Priebus didn t comment on that  ,10/06/14 11:23 AM,abortion

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/whats-next-texas-women-the-supreme-court, This is what s certain  A single appeals court has devastated abortion access in Texas  the nation s second most populous state  With the decision on Thursday allowing Texas to enforce its omnibus abortion law in full  a total of 80  of clinics providing the procedure have closed  That leaves only eight standing and 900 000 women of reproductive age living more than 150 miles from a clinic    This is unprecedented  and has to be understood as a difference in kind  and not just in degree  said Nancy Northup  head of the Center for Reproductive Rights  which represented abortion clinics before the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals  For supporters of abortion rights  there s ultimately only one place left to turn   the Supreme Court  The clinics  attorneys acknowledged as much to reporters Friday  saying an appeal  ultimately to the highest court  was assured  Close video       msnbc Originals  10 3 14  2 15 PM ET       For women in the Rio Grande Valley  a window of hope closes       Overnight  nearly a million women in Texas were left without legal abortion access  thanks to a Texas law that an appeals court allowed to go into effect on October 2  This is the story of Whole Woman s Health in McAllen  which has struggled to serve    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss That s where the certainty ends  The central question  Will Justice Anthony Kennedy  the court s ultimate swing vote  decide Texas has gone too far in violating women s constitutional rights And if what has happened in Texas isn t an  undue burden  on women s ability to obtain an abortion   the relevant legal standard   what is  It was Kennedy who co wrote the decision protecting a woman s right to have an abortion  but allowing states to regulate the procedure unless those regulations posed an  undue burden  Ironically  that decision  Planned Parenthood v  Casey  opens with  liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt  But the 22 years since that decision have been full of legal and legislative  doubt  about how far states can go in restricting abortion  Texas  along with other states across the country  has eagerly stepped into the breach   enacting regulations on clinics allegedly to protect women s health but which experts call medically unnecessary  In Thursday s ruling  the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals didn t just enable a set of unprecedented restrictions   it all but dared the Supreme Court to step in   In our circuit  we do not balance the wisdom or effectiveness of a law against the burdens the law imposes  wrote George W  Bush appointee Jennifer Elrod in the decision  She added  in a quote that seemed designed to highlight the split in the lower courts that forms a common rationale for the Supreme Court to take a case   We agree with Plaintiffs that some circuits have used the balancing test to enjoin abortion regulations  other circuits including ours have not  Ian Millhiser  justice editor at Think Progress  argued that with these words   Elrod sent a blood red howler to the Supreme Court telling them to  TAKE THIS CASE   He took the move as proof that Elrod and her fellow anti abortion judge  Jerry Smith   are very confident the Supreme Court will take their side if the justices agree to to hear this case   If Elrod is right  and Justice Anthony Kennedy would provide a fifth vote in favor of upholding the Texas law the ultimate impact would be decimating abortion access across the country Courts have already blocked similar laws in Alabama  Wisconsin  and Mississippi  with challenges in Louisiana and Oklahoma awaiting replies  For millions of women living in those states and the ones that might copy them  it would amount to a ban on abortion in all but name  Many court watchers are pessimistic about Kennedy s abortion votes   as Drexel University law professor David S  Cohen has pointed out  since Casey the Justice has never met an abortion restriction he didn t like  But not everyone agrees with Elrod s read of the field  Close video       All In with Chris Hayes  10 3 14  8 26 PM ET       13 Texas abortion clinics close overnight       More than half of Texas  remaining abortion clinics were forced to close overnight  Chris Hayes discusses what could be the biggest Supreme Court case on abortion rights in more than 20 years    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss  I think it s very unclear where he s going to come out against this  said Priscilla Smith  a senior fellow at Yale Law School who argued the last major Supreme Court abortion case   Kennedy voted against abortion rights in that case  with a vengeance   I think he cares about the bottom line  Can women actually get abortions  Smith said   I think he s going to want to see the proof and want to know whether it s going to make it safer or whether it s a specious requirement  Time will tell whether Elrod is correctly predicting Kennedy s vote  but she wasn t off in claiming the 5th Circuit had gone its own way   The decision is a radical departure in part because it refused to even consider whether Texas had legitimate medical or public health evidence on its side   Perhaps that s because the entire medical establishment says it doesn t In December  Judge Richard Posner took a different view when he wrote for the Seventh Circuit about a similar Wisconsin law   The feebler the medical grounds  the likelier the burden  even if slight  to be  undue  in the sense of disproportionate or gratuitous  He found the medical grounds to be feeble indeed  By contrast  as Jennifer Dalven of the ACLU s Reproductive Freedom Project pointed out  the 5th Circuit in the Texas case set up the following standard for evaluating an abortion law If you can say it with a straight face  is basically what they say  without looking behind it at all  that s good enough for us  That s quite shocking as a legal matter  and it s devastating in terms of its toll on real women and families  Using the 5th Circuit standard  Smith said  a state could  require that every abortion take place in a castle made of gold  without anyone calling it unreasonable  She added The 5th Circuit is acting like a very activist court  in an attempt to take all the teeth out of Casey  The court also shrugged off the burden on women as not significant enough  despite the fact that nearly a million women will be affected    One must wonder at this point what would count as a substantial obstacle in the court s eyes  said Stephanie Toti  an attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights    The practical impact of all of these legal standards is that  barring an emergency stay from the Supreme Court   one it declined to give in an earlier round of challenges to this law   many clinics are likely to permanently close even if the high court eventually finds the 5th Circuit was wrong and tells them they can reopen  Licenses expire  as do leases  Litigation is expensive enough  That may mean Texas will get its wish of standing in the way of women who seek abortions no matter what the Court decides  There is another point of clarity  said Northup   It is going to be a showdown we haven t seen in decades  ,10/03/14 06:35 PM,abortion
MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/supreme-courts-new-session-could-bring-decisions-huge-issues, The Supreme Court term began Monday with a bang   not with what it did  but what it didn t do  In refusing to take appeals  the court paved the way for marriage equality in at least five more states  While the court may still take another marriage related appeal  it already has plenty of other potentially explosive cases on its docket  In the 10th year of the Roberts court  issues up for grabs include racial discrimination in housing and political line drawing  the rights of a prisoner to grow a beard and a retail employee to wear a hijab  the contours of workers  rights  and the power of the police  among others  A major question mark  Whether the court will take a case that could strip healthcare subsidies away from millions of Americans  Here s what we already know  RACIAL JUSTICE Last term  the court narrowly missed a chance to undermine the Fair Housing Act  the chief weapon for fighting housing discrimination  when the case taken by the court was settled  The highest court still seems eager to take a whack at the idea that  if an action has disparate impact on people of color  it violates the law  or whether plaintiffs have to show intentional discrimination  which is a very high bar to clear  In Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v  The Inclusive Communities Project  Inc the state has explicitly asked the court to address these questions  The case concerns whether low income housing vouchers were disproportionately allocated to majority minority districts  Few are optimistic about its outcome  POLITICAL POWERTwo cases out of Alabama Alabama Democratic Conference v  Alabama and Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v  Alabama will test how far Republican racial gerrymandering can go Alabama Democrats and the Black Caucus argue that the state s 2012 GOP led redistricting plan packed African Americans into as few state legislative districts as possible  limiting their influence in the legislature by ensuring they d always be in the minority  Democrats say this violates the Voting Rights Act  but Republicans counter that it s essentially what the Voting Rights Act requires  Here s why this matters  It s very common for Republicans  especially in the South  to do these partisan gerrymanders that paradoxically weaken minority political power by creating a few districts with huge majorities of minority voters  meaning white conservatives have the rest of the map largely to themselves  If Democrats win   which would be a surprise to most observers   it would make it harder to do that  Another case with big implications for the ability to stop partisan gerrymandering is Arizona State Legislature v  Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission  In 2000  Arizona voters passed a constitutional amendment establishing an independent commission to do redistricting  taking it out of the hands of legislators  State Republicans  represented by conservative super lawyer Paul Clement  argue that the U S  Constitution bars cutting lawmakers out of the process  If the Supreme Court agrees  California s much praised independent commission would also likely be in jeopardy  and it would be harder for other states to set up similar commissions unless legislators signed off  Florida is one of 39 states that bar judicial candidates from personally asking for campaign contributions  In Williams Yulee v  The Florida Bar  that law is being challenged by a former candidate for county judge  who claims it violates the First Amendment s free speech protections  If the law is struck down  it would make it harder to insulate judicial races from the influence of money in politics  And it would expand even further the Supreme Court s embrace of the  money is speech  principle  see Citizens United and McCutcheon  VOTING RIGHTSFour major Voting Rights Act cases either already have  or could soon  come before the Supreme Court  Voter ID laws in Texas and Wisconsin  a sweeping voting law in North Carolina that includes a voter ID requirement  and Ohio s cuts to early voting  So far the court has only issued a narrow order saying the Ohio cuts can go into effect for the midterms  and it could take the same limited approach in the other three cases before the election  But it s very possible that either this year or next  it could rule much more broadly in one of these cases  with big implications for access to the ballot going forward  Such a ruling would likely clarify whether  and in what circumstances  the post Shelby Voting Rights Act can be used to stop voter ID requirements and other restrictions that disproportionately impact minorities  Essentially  just how deliberate does the evidence of racial discrimination need to be  POLICE POWERSIf a police officer stops you  searches you  and arrests you based on a faulty understanding of the law  was the search still valid  That s the question behind Heien v  North Carolina  which could broaden Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure  Nicholas Heien was stopped for a broken taillight  and a search of his car uncovered cocaine  But the state s law only requires  a stop lamp  so the question is whether Heien should have been arrested based on what Heien s lawyers argue was an illegitimate reason  WORKERS  RIGHTSOvertime  last minute scheduling  and what counts as  on the clock  work are all live issues in American labor relations right now  Pretty soon  the Supreme Court is going to have its say on the latter  In Integrity Staffing Solutions v  Busk  it will rule on whether Amazon warehouse employees are on the clock   and therefore entitled to wages   for the 25 minutes or so each day that they stand in line for security checks  The Obama administration s Labor Department has had to fend off more than its fair share of legal challenges over the past few years  but Perez v  Mortgage Bankers Association could have implications extending across all federal agencies  At issue is whether regulatory departments need to issue notice for a public comment period not just when they change a regulation  but when they change their interpretation of a regulation  If it s the latter  it could soon become harder for the executive branch to exercise regulatory discretion  Another question before the court is this  When a worker is promised retiree health care benefits in a union contract  can that worker reasonably assume the benefits will keep coming in for the rest of  her life  What if she outlives the duration of the contract itself  Is her former employer still on the hook to provide those benefits  even if the contract expired long ago  In M G Polymers USA  LLC v  Tackett the court will have to decide whether retiree benefits must continue indefinitely  regardless of whether or not that s explicitly spelled out in the contract  REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTSAfter UPS employee Peggy Young got pregnant  she asked for  light duty  something already available for injured and disabled employees  Instead  she was put on extended unpaid leave and lost her medical coverage  But two lower courts claimed that didn t violate the Pregnancy Discrimination Act  The court will hear Young v  United Parcel Service on Dec  3  After a win for Hobby Lobby  is filling out a form opting out of contraceptive coverage a burden on religion On Friday  the University of Notre Dame asked the Supreme Court to take its case against the opt out form  one of dozens filed by nonprofit accommodations dissatisfied with the Obama administration s existing religious accommodation to covering birth control on insurance plans  The court may also soon have the chance to weigh in on how far states can go in burdening women who seek abortions  Last week  an appeals court decision resulted in a total of 80  of Texas  abortion clinics closing  and a petition to the Supreme Court is expected at some point  RELIGIOUS RIGHTSThe court will take up the question of religious freedom for prison inmates in Holt v  Hobbs  Gregory Holt  who is serving a life sentence in an Arkansas prison  is suing to be allowed to grow a half inch beard as an expression of his Muslim faith  The state argues its quarter inch limit is needed to keep the prison safe  The justices must decide whether that rule imposes  a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution  as the 2000 Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Person Act states  Samantha Elauf was 17 when she applied for a job at Abercromie   Fitch in Tulsa  Oklahoma  She was turned down  because she wore a black hijab that managers believe violated the company s  look policy  In Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v Abercrombie  Fitch  the court will decide whether Abercrombie is liable for discriminating against Elauf if she didn t explicitly tell them she wore a hijab for religious reasons   She didn t know it was against their policy  What s at stake is how high of a bar courts can set for people who claim they have been discriminated by employers  The conservative Alliance Defending Freedom is representing Pastor Clyde Reed and Good News Community Church against the Town of Gilbert  Arizona  which says that the town s policy on signage discriminates against churches  The appeals court said that since the rule applies to everyone equally  it isn t discrimination  OBAMACAREThis is the most uncertain  yet most clearly consequential  issue the court could take on  At stake  The Obamacare subsidies that have helped millions of Americans afford health insurance  Conservative activists have brought cases claiming that the insurance subsidies available through the federal exchange are illegal because of the wording of the law  which refers to exchanges established by the State Thirty six states declined to set up their own exchanges  The federal circuit ruled against the administration  but the case is being reheard by the full panel of judges  which is expected to reverse it  If so  it will deprive the case of the circuit split that is common grounds for the Supreme Court to take the case  since the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the argument  It remains to be seen whether the Roberts court has the appetite to take away insurance from millions of Americans just two or so years after it upheld the law  Of course  the second part of that 2012 decision upholding Obamacare s constitutionality also opened the door for millions of Americans to be denied Medicaid coverage  depending on what state they live in  Additional reporting by Zachary Roth and Meredith Clark  CORRECTION An earlier version of this post mistakenly referred to the Alliance Defending Freedom as the Alliance Against Freedom  ,10/06/14 06:46 PM,abortion

meeting  while an encouraging sign that the issue is at least prominently featured on the justices  radar  does not mean that they will be taking up any of those five lawsuits  Nevertheless  many on both sides of the debate believe the high court will soon consider and decide once and for all whether gay and lesbian couples have a constitutional right to wed  Here s why  1  Pressure is building from both sides of the debate In a somewhat unusual move  the plaintiffs in all five marriage equality cases have joined the defendants in asking for Supreme Court review  Typically  it s just the losing side of a lawsuit that will appeal  Were the justices to deny cert to all of the cases now before them  marriage equality would be legal throughout the 4th  7th  and 10th Circuits  adding 11 states where gay and lesbian couples can legally wed  But that wasn t enough for these same sex couples  By pushing for Supreme Court review  the plaintiffs are showing that they re confident enough that the justices will not only uphold the lower court s ruling  but also legalize marriage equality throughout the nation  A number of others have also filed  friend of the court  briefs urging the justices to take up a case  Earlier this month  32 states on both sides of the marriage equality divide asked the high court to declare who s right  Shortly after  a group of churches opposed to marriage equality   including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops  the National Association of Evangelicals  the Ethics   Religious Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention  and the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod   filed a joint amicus brief as well  asking the justices to settle the issue nationwide  Given this mounting pressure  it seems unlikely the Supreme Court would refuse to hear a case  2  Sheer momentum Since the Supreme Court struck down a key portion of the federal Defense of Marriage Act  DOMA  last year and cleared the way for the U S  government to begin recognizing same sex nuptials  there has been an unprecedented wave of legal triumphs for the marriage equality movement  Out of 81 cases pending in 32 states  gay and lesbian couples have prevailed 40 times and lost only twice in both state and federal court  No ban has yet survived at the appellate level since DOMA  leaving the high court without a  circuit split  to resolve  But many legal experts believe the justices would still take up a case on the grounds that marriage equality is a matter of public importance   one of the criteria for granting cert  3  Ginsburg has outright said so In a July interview with the Associated Press  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the Supreme Court wouldn t  duck  the issue of marriage equality   If a case is properly before the court  they will take it  said the 81 year old  adding that she expects the matter to be decided by June 2016  if not a year earlier  Ginsburg has in the past advocated for  judicial restraint  criticizing the landmark Roe v  Wade decision for going too far  That ruling  which guaranteed a woman s right to choose to have an abortion during the first two trimesters  gave opponents ammunition to say that national policy was being set by  unelected old men  said Ginsburg during a 2013 address at the University of Chicago Law School  Some speculated that the remarks had implications for upcoming marriage equality cases   one  the DOMA suit  and the other  a challenge to California s now defunct ban known as Proposition 8  And perhaps Ginsburg will still want to be cautious about issuing a sweeping same sex marriage ruling  But the 16 months since her Chicago speech has profoundly changed the marriage equality movement  see section 2   Sheer momentum  and perhaps transformed the legal landscape in such a way where  judicial restraint  is no longer necessary or even possible  4    so has Reinhardt The latest appeals court to weigh marriage equality has been here before  In 2012  the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found Prop 8 unconstitutional in that it  serves no purpose  and has no effect  other than to lessen the status and human dignity of gays and lesbians in California  Little seems to have changed in the mind of Judge Stephen R  Reinhardt  who authored the Prop 8 ruling and served on a three judge panel earlier this month that pummeled arguments in defense of same sex marriage bans  Amid the blows  Reinhardt also offered up his best bet on who may have the last word regarding marriage equality   I think you re going to have an opportunity to find out what Justice Kennedy really thinks  he said  referring to the justice s DOMA opinion  That ruling affirmed both states rights  and the basic dignity of gays and lesbians   two concepts seemingly at odds when it comes to same sex marriage bans  If Reinhardt s prediction proves accurate  it ll be Kennedy who ll soon clear up the confusion  5  SCOTUS has already gotten involved Many were upset last month when the Supreme Court blocked a ruling that legalized marriage equality in Virginia  hours before it was slated to take effect  The move was hardly a surprise   twice this year  the justices had already halted marriage equality from going forward  both times in Utah  As frustrating as the decision was for same sex couples  however  legal analysts saw a silver lining    This makes it even more clear that the Supreme Court has to take up this issue  and is going to take up this issue  said James Esseks  director of the ACLU Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender Project  last month to msnbc   It doesn t work for the court to say   No these rulings don t apply yet  and for the court to not take up the issue  The argument goes like this   If the Supreme Court had no intention of hearing the case  and in turn  allowing same sex marriages to go forward in Virginia  as well as in the other states that make up the 4th Circuit  why issue the stay  Why would the justices bother blocking gay and lesbian couples from marrying now  only to let them marry anyway in a matter of months  Answer  they wouldn t  By denying same sex couples marriage rights in Virginia and Utah  the Supreme Court may have been positioning itself to grant those rights later on across the nation  This story was originally published on September 11  2014  Poll  Will

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/melissa-harris-perry/dear-john-kasich-im-pro-life-doesnt-explain-rape-gag-rule, If you have not cast your vote early then you have two more days  Two days to gather information  Weighing the relevant facts to make informed decisions  To make those decisions we depend on candidates explaining their positions and decisions  But in this midterm election there is one candidate who has been trying to hide some information and trying to distract with irrelevant bits of information  That less than forthcoming incumbent is getting my letter this week  Dear Gov  John Kasich  It s me  Melissa  I couldn t help but notice when last month the negotiations for a public debate between yourself and challenger Ed FitzGerald fell apart  That was the first time in nearly three decades that Ohio voters did not get a chance to hear a debate between the candidates for the state s highest office  Close video       Melissa Harris Perry  11 2 14  11 42 AM ET       Ohio governor avoids questions on bill restricting reproductive rights       Melissa Harris Perry s open letter goes out to Ohio Governor John Kasich  who she says has been  less than forthcoming  about why he signed a bill into law that denies women information about their reproductive choices    facebook twitter embed like save share group discuss Your campaign spokeswoman said you would be  seeking other  additional avenues  to discuss your accomplishments  and  answer whatever direct  tough questions people may have  Well  you were asked one of those  direct  tough questions  last week at an endorsement interview with the Cleveland Plain Dealer by your opponent  Mr  FitzGerald   Why was it important to have a piece of legislation that literally imposed a gag rule on rape crisis counselors  Okay  Governor Kasich  There s your direct question  Whatcha got   Would you like to answer that  Governor Do you have a question  Just to be clear  Governor  that was you  not answering  but ignoring the question of someone sitting next to you  I mean  actually pretending the question did not happen  And it s not a trivial question  either  In fact  it s one I bet many Ohio voters would like to hear you answer  That legislation Mr  Fitzgerald referenced is the budget bill you signed into law last June  A budget bill that included some of the country s most stringent and regressive restrictions on women s ability to exercise their reproductive rights  And some of the worst of those restrictions that are about information  Like the new provision that says funding for services for pregnant women can only go to an entity that  is not involved in or associated with any abortion activities  including providing abortion counseling or referrals to abortion clinics  performing abortion related medical procedures  or engaging in pro abortion advertising  That provision is likely to strip public funding from Planned Parenthood  in the state  Even though no public funds are ever used for abortion  this law means that there may soon be no public funding for critical services like cancer screenings either just because Planned Parenthood provides information about abortion  And it also means that rape crisis centers are legally barred from providing women with information about abortion   or they are liable to lose all state funding  And that is just the beginning isn t it Governor  because the bill also has a provision  requiring a doctor search  for the presence of a fetal heartbeat    and then  inform the pregnant woman in writing that the unborn human individual the pregnant woman is carrying has a fetal heartbeat  And  inform the pregnant woman  of the statistical probability of bringing the unborn human individual possessing a detectable fetal heartbeat to term  So  Governor  you signed into law provisions that restrict the information women need to make decisions while requiring they receive medically unnecessary information after they have already made a decision  But for all your meddling in the kind of information that women can get or must get  you do not seem to think your constituents need any information from you about why you made the choice to support that bill  Before the bill came to your desk last year  you responded to a question about the provisions  saying   I ll examine the language  keeping in mind that I m pro life  And after you signed the bill  you made no mention of those provisions  and didn t take questions from reporters  Then last week when you were asked  in person  to justify your signature on that bill   to explain why it is good public policy to deny women information about their reproductive choices  You didn t   I think everyone here knows that I m pro life  What we ve focused on  and I ve always focused on  is the issue of life  Pre natal  post natal  early childhood  sleep for babies  truing to drive down infant mortality  Let s focus on the life issue   At the end of the day  I m going to do what I think is a pro life  uh  you know  looking  being in a position of being pro life  Governor  that is not acceptable  Perhaps you should spend less time worried about the medical information the people of Ohio receive from their doctors and more time focused on providing them the political information they need to make an informed decision about your bid for re election    Sincerely Melissa ,11/03/14 01:15 PM,abortion

MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/when-senate-candidates-struggle-the-basics, The political world spends a fair amount of time considering the role of low information voters in an election  But what happens when the line between low information voters and candidates is blurred    Iowa is home to one of the nation s most competitive U S  Senate races  and last night  the major party candidates   Rep  Bruce Braley  D  and state Sen  Joni Ernst  R    faced off in a lively televised debate  The Des Moines Register reported on some of the highlights   Ernst s  low point was  stubbornly pushing the claim that Obamacare cut Medicare benefits  an argument repeatedly debunked by nonpartisan fact checkers  and her confusion on a question about current  job killing  regulations  where she cited cap and trade  which is not law   Kedron Bardwell  an associate professor of political science at Simpson College in Indianola  said     Dennis Goldford  a Drake University political scientist  said Ernst is  an excellent performer   She looks right at the camera  She seems to radiate a certain kind of confidence  he said    But Ernst didn t often say anything of substance  Goldford said  It ultimately comes down to whether or not it matters when candidates for statewide office have no idea what they re talking about    On climate change  for example  the far right Iowan said   I don t know the science behind climate change  I can t say one way or another what is the direct impact  whether it s man made or not    On Social Security  which Ernst wants to privatize out of existence  the Republican said   Within 20 years  the system will be broke  which isn t even close to resembling reality    On federal regulations  Ernst blamed a federal  cap and trade  law for undermining job creation  despite the fact that there is no federal  cap and trade  law    On contraception  Ernst was asked about her efforts to pass a state law that would have banned in vitro fertilization and forms of birth control  She responded  by way of a defense  that her bill didn t pass  which hardly counts as a persuasive retort    On the minimum wage  Ernst still doesn t seem to understand that the federal minimum is a floor and that states are free to approve higher levels if they choose    When a U S  Senate candidate is this confused about basic issues so close to Election Day  it s tempting to think the candidate must be on the verge of a humiliating defeat  Except in Iowa  the evidence points in the opposite direction    A Des Moines Register poll released over the weekend found Ernst leading Braley by six points  44  to 38    Ernst  perhaps more than any other statewide candidate in 2014  comes from the Akin Angle Mourdock O Donnell wing of the Republican Party  representing an often bizarre combination of discredited conspiracy theories and fringe policy ideas    The difference is  the voting mainstream was viscerally uncomfortable with Akin  Angle  Mourdock  and O Donnell  all of whom lost  Ernst  meanwhile  appears shockingly well positioned to actually win a seat in the United State Senate    And given the candidate s stated positions  that s pretty remarkable  Ernst has endorsed banning abortions and many forms of birth control  privatizing Social Security  and impeaching President Obama  She s argued that Saddam Hussein really did have weapons of mass destruction and people on Medicaid  have no personal responsibility for their health  She s dismissed the very existence of a federal minimum wage as  ridiculous  and credits the Koch brothers for the strength of her candidacy  She s dabbled in nullification radicalism and has endorsed enough conspiracy theories to qualify her as the head of a Glenn Beck fan club    But in Iowa  Ernst  seems to radiate a certain kind of confidence  The election   and the future of the Senate   may come down to whether or not it matters if that confidence is warranted    ,09/29/14 09:23 AM,abortion
