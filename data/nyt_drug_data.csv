NYT,http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/a-surprise-and-a-reversal-on-edible-marijuana/,Colorado legalized the growing selling smoking and eating of recreational marijuana more than 10 months ago but it still hasnt resolved some major questions about how this new market is supposed to workThe Associated Press reported on Monday that the state Health Department was proposing to ban nearly all forms of edible marijuana to make it easier to keep children from overdosing The proposal was one of several ideas presented to a statesponsored working group considering safety regulations for the marijuana industryBut health officials quickly backed away from the plan after the AP article appeared As the Denver Post reported edibles account for nearly half of the states cannabis business Forcing all those soda and candymakers out of business or underground would be a headspinning retreat for Colorados worldleading legalization experimentIt would also seem to clearly violate the Constitutional amendment overwhelmingly approved by Colorado voters to make marijuana in its many forms legal and to regulate it like alcoholAs The Post also makes clear it is proving difficult to come up with simple surefire rules about the size look potency and potential risk of edibles Everyone seems to agree that regulation is desirable but how is that supposed to happen By airbrushing warnings on individual gummy candies By making all marijuana chocolates a telltale shade of gray Its easy to see why some health officials thought the simplest thing to do with edibles would be to just get rid of themThe problem is that its too late for that There seems little chance that Colorado will impose what Twitter jokesters have been calling Maureens Law after the Times oped columnist Maureen Dowd who had a bad night in a Denver hotel after eating marijuanainfused candyBesides for all the concern opponents have not much evidence to show that edible marijuana is a publichealth crisisHalloween is nearly here Parents in Colorado and the other legalization state Washington have been hearing warnings about adulterated candies and stoned trickortreaters Next month we will know how much of that the fear was justified,2014-10-21T15:50:24Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/education/edlife/just-say-no-yes-or-maybe.html,Ever since smoking pot became ubiquitous among American teenagers in the 1960s parents have struggled with how to talk to their children about it and how to protect them from its negative effectsNow in an era of broader acceptance  two states Washington and Colorado have legalized recreational use of marijuana for ages 21 and up and 23 states have approved its medical use all while marijuana remains illegal under federal law  teenagers are clearly getting conflicting widely disparate messagesThe War on Drugs and Just Say No campaigns of the 1980s provided a national moral mandate and a singular template for parents All drugs are bad But many parents today believe that the reductionist catchphrase oversimplifies the complex landscape of the nations drug useToday according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse 18 to 25yearolds are the biggest abusers of opioid pain relievers ADHD stimulants and antianxiety drugs Prescription drugs account for more overdose deaths among this age group than all illegal drugs combined Alcohol remains the No 1 health hazard and daterape drug on college campuses And a new generation of pensize odorless vaporizers with USB ports for easy recharging allows students to get high virtually anywhere even at schoolWith these realities in mind more parents seem to be accepting the probability that their teenagers will selfmedicate at some point and they see pot as having more manageable risks than other substances Rather than adhere to a just say no theology they are embracing a nuanced harmreduction approach They are even in some cases revealing their own use to help create a dialogue with their childrenHonesty about drug use is encouraged by Dr Donald A Misch medical director at the University of Colorado Boulder who oversees the health of nearly 30000 students on a campus long considered marijuanafriendly During an orientation session in August for parents entitled Stress Risk Taking AlcoholDrugs and Parents as Partners What Every CU Parent Should Know Dr Misch responded to a fathers question about whether to tell his son about his own prior usage What you should say depends on your family he advised As a general rule I believe in being honestDr Misch who delivered the lecture 13 times to reach as many parents as possible assured them that smoking a joint every once in a while posed minimal health risk but he also warned with a series of statistics projected on overhead screens that marijuana can cause eating and sleeping problems productivity problems various cognitive difficulties as well as motor vehicle accidents psychosis and addictionWhen you are high or acutely intoxicated with marijuana you dont make good memories he said adding with some levity Every time your kid goes to class high you arent getting your moneys worthTo help parents guide their children away from risky behaviors Dr Misch urged parents to stay in touch with their children especially just before the weekend and encouraged them to use the universitys online handbook that guides them through what to say how not to react and how best to leverage parental power which remains strong even after children have settled in on campusEven though your son or daughter might not acknowledge it you still matter he said If a student gets in trouble for using marijuana on campus we can put them on probation we can throw them out of housing but what college students consistently report is that the worst thing we can do to them the absolute death penalty is call youTodays parenting approaches to marijuana use range from zero tolerance to reluctant acceptance to outright permission Here a look at these perspectivesSHARING A JOINTToni and Barry Fox of Salida Colo never hid the fact that they smoked marijuana from Cheyenne Mr Foxs daughter from a previous marriage But during her teenage years they made it clear she wasnt allowed to use any intoxicants Were adults our brains are developed Ms Fox 42 recalled explaining to her She was a teenager so we had zero tolerance for any substance that would alter her brain developmentWhen Cheyenne got caught smoking a cigarette at school at 16 and had to call home to tell her parents her father reacted swiftly and firmly I lost my car for six months said Cheyenne now 22 and a recent graduate of Metropolitan State University of Denver That was the most depressing day of my whole lifeMr Fox told Cheyenne that if she was interested in trying marijuana once she turned 18 he would assist her at home under his supervision She was So on the afternoon of her birthday he honored his promise The first time I ever smoked she said my dad rolled a joint and handed it to me and told me Go in the backyard and dont go anywhere Ill make you nachos in an hour  The next day her parents helped her secure a card to access medical marijuanaMs Foxs biggest fear for Cheyenne was something happening to her alcoholbased like being a victim of an assault at a partyI grew up in Minnesota where alcohol was readily available to teenagers she said I didnt know a female growing up who didnt have some sexual incident related to intoxication As a youth Ms Fox dealt with the pain of her fathers suicide with alcohol and harder drugs before discovering marijuana She believes so strongly in marijuanas palliative power that in 2010 she opened a medical marijuana dispensary in Denver which she converted to a recreational dispensary this year Cheyenne who earned a degree in marketing works at a new second locationNow when we smoke marijuana together says the mom we talk businessSMOKE BUT SAFELYMark Klein 52 a software entrepreneur from Los Altos Calif acknowledged to his children that he smokes pot when they reached high school When my oldest son asked I wanted to be honest said Mr Klein who has two sons  a college sophomore and a recent graduate  and twin 18yearold daughters both freshmenAfter trying pot in high school Mr Klein sampled it again while in his early 30s and started using it about once a month Rather than insist that his children avoid marijuana altogether he talked to them about using it safely urging them to call him for a ride home rather than drive while high or accept a ride from a stoned friend and not to indulge in edibles Its way too easy to keep eating a fivedose cookie when the effects dont show up for 45 minutes he said He also drew distinctions between his occasional use and people who smoke pot every day and lose track of their goalsI told them Dont let marijuana be a big part of your life Keep your eyes on your objectives  Mr Klein says he knows that some of his children have tried marijuana and despite his own use he isnt thrilled about it My desire is that they dont use drugs dont use alcohol and dont have sex but they are teenagers and human beings and so thats probably not going to happenTOKE TALKSAfter being caught smoking a bong in the family sunroom as teenagers Arian Creque and her stepbrother Michael cowered while their mother who opposes anyone in her family using recreational marijuana yelled at them But a couple of nights later when Michael went back to the room to smoke a joint after work his father surprised him by sauntering up and producing a small metal pipeI was just floored said Mr Creque now 22 We sat out there for an hour and a half and we had a blast We talked about everything from when I started and how much I did to what was going on in schoolAs for his father he didnt love that his teenagers were smoking pot In a recent conversation in their home in Littleton Colo after a 36hour shift at his longtime tech job he recalled telling them about his own use a single toke several times a week to relax after work or help him fall asleep and sharing stories of his experiences to help them understand moderation He also encouraged them to avoid parties where a large number of people get intoxicated I used to tell the kids that if you get over eight or nine people somebodys going to get drunk somebodys going to punch somebody somebody is going to throw up in the yard he said When it comes to kicking back with friends you want to keep it smallAdded his son He was trying to teach me some good life lessons and keep me safe The younger Mr Creque who earned an associate degree in 2012 in business and works at a car dealership said he smokes several times a day and dabs using a heated nail to extract an intense fume from the resin I use marijuana a little too much he acknowledgedHis stepsister now 21 is working toward a bachelors online at the University of Colorado Denver For her getting high is an antidote to what she describes as nearconstant anxiety My whole thing is my future  whats coming next I finished my homework but whats coming next She sleeps between shifts at the hotel where she works 50 hours a week and otherwise lives in her parents basement When I smoke she said Im more in the presentPOLICING THE PADLast year Lisa Fields a 53yearold single working mother from Los Angeles County discovered that her teenage son had been smoking pot Fearing it could lead him down a harmful path she took a scorchedearth approach to making sure he wouldnt do it againAfter he went to sleep Ms Fields looked through his backpack and found two enormous joints professional looking and rolled with a filter You could definitely tell they were from a dispensary she said She stayed up all night reading on the Partnership for DrugFree Kids website about how to stay calm what to say to her son and what other steps she could take to keep him cleanIn the morning she confronted him and warned he could not carry an illegal substance to school or keep it in her house putting her at risk After school she took him to a park  a place where he had room to breathe and express himself  and began asking questions Next she tore apart the house finding not only more marijuana and a glass pipe but also hashish He told me he knew kids who actually smoked it in school using vapor pens that resemble ink pens Ms Fields saidTo make concealing things impossible she removed his bedroom door and took all the drawers out of his dresser stacking his clothes in open binsHe had to start from ground zero with trust she said She ordered him to research and write a paper on how marijuana affects adolescent brain development she took him for urine and blood tests  I also wanted to scare him she admitted  and then to his favorite burrito joint where he revealed how hard it had been to make friends in a new schoolSmoking dope had allowed him to fit in I could have weed at my house he said and people want to come over  something Ms Fields confirmed when she found over 1200 in credit card charges for takeout foodMs Fields who acknowledges having used marijuana on occasion as an adult says she had previously supported its legalization but after seeing how easily her son a minor could gain access to drugs sold legally to someone else she has reconsideredWhen people voted to legalize marijuana they didnt consider how it changes how children feel about drugs she said They think its all OK and its natural It gives them a different perspective on the drugZERO TOLERANCEA week before starting college at Loyola UniversityMaryland in September Debbie McBrides 18yearold son Connor had a request Mom he asked can I have a couple of friends over You dont have to get the beer Well get itMs McBride could hardly believe her son would even ask such a question given her zero tolerance for drugs and alcohol What was he thinking He said Im going to college in a week Ms McBride 51 who works for a portfolio manager and teaches youth at a Morristown NJ church began talking to her two sons about the dangers of drugs when they were in middle school On the refrigerator she hung an article about research on marijuanas effects I have this part highlighted she said reading aloud  The brain undergoes active development until about age 21 She says that the national debate over legalization  polls show slightly more than half of Americans favoring it  and the tacit acceptance of teenage drinking in their suburban community have made it more difficult for her children to accept her message about illicit use of substancesShe and Connor arrived at many graduation parties to find kegs in the backyard If drinking is tolerated he wanted to know why not pot And my answer to that is alcohol itself is not illegal Its the age that is illegal Marijuana is illegal for even meIts really hard to teach your kids the lesson that marijuana is bad for you when its legalized in other states she said She is fairly certain her boys would never dare smoke pot If she caught them they probably think I would take them to the police,2014-11-02T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/education/edlife/this-is-your-brain-on-drugs-marijuana-adults-teens.html,The gray matter of the nucleus accumbens the walnutshaped pleasure center of the brain was glowing like a flame showing a notable increase in density It could mean that theres some sort of drug learning taking place speculated Jodi Gilman at her computer screen at the Massachusetts General HospitalHarvard Center for Addiction Medicine Was the brain adapting to marijuana exposure rewiring the reward system to demand the drugDr Gilman was reviewing a composite scan of the brains of 20 pot smokers ages 18 to 25 What she and fellow researchers at Harvard and Northwestern University found within those scans surprised them Even in the seven participants who smoked only once or twice a week there was evidence of structural differences in two significant regions of the brain The more the subjects smoked the greater the differencesModerate marijuana use by healthy adults seems to pose little risk and there are potential medical benefits including easing nausea and pain But it has long been known that with the brain developing into the mid20s young people who smoke early and often are more likely to have learning and mental health problems Now researchers suggest existing studies are no longer sufficient Much of whats known is based on studies conducted years ago with much less powerful potMarijuana samples seized by the federal Drug Enforcement Agency show the concentration of THC the drugs psychoactive compound rising from a mean of 375 percent in 1995 to 13 percent in 2013 Potency seesaws depending on the strain and form Fresh Baked which sells recreational marijuana in Boulder Colo offers Green Crack with a THC content of about 21 percent and Phnom Penh with about 8 percent The level in a concentrate called Bubble Hash is about 70 percent cartridges for vaporizers much like ecigarettes range from 15 to 30 percent THCHighTHC marijuana is associated with paranoia and psychosis according to a June article in The New England Journal of Medicine We have seen very very significant increases in emergency room admissions associated with marijuana use that cant be accounted for solely on basis of changes in prevalence rates said Nora D Volkow director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and a coauthor of the THC study It can only be explained by the fact that current marijuana has higher potency associated with much greater risk for adverse effects Emergency room visits related to marijuana have nearly doubled from 66000 in 2004 to 129000 in 2011 according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services AdministrationHigher potency may also accelerate addiction You dont have to work so hard to get high said Alan J Budney a researcher and professor at Dartmouths medical school As you make it easier to get high it makes a person more vulnerable to addiction Among adults the rate is one of 11 for teenagers one of sixConcerns over increasing potency and rising usage among the young is giving new urgency to researchFor the HarvardNorthwestern study published in the April issue of The Journal of Neuroscience the team scanned the brains of 40 young adults most from Bostonarea colleges Half were nonusers half reported smoking for one to six years and showed no signs of dependence Besides the seven light smokers nine used three to five days a week and four used on average daily All smokers showed abnormalities in the shape density and volume of the nucleus accumbens which is at the core of motivation the core of pleasure and pain and every decision that you make explained Dr Hans Breiter a coauthor of the study and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwesterns medical schoolSimilar changes affected the amygdala which is fundamental in processing emotions memories and fear responsesWhat is already known is that in casual users THC can disrupt focus working memory decision making and motivation for about 24 hours The fact that we can see these structural effects in the brain could indicate that the effects of THC are longer lasting than we previously thought said Dr Gilman an instructor in psychology at Harvards medical schoolThe study was preliminary and small and attempts to replicate it are underway Meanwhile Dr Gilman is trying to figure out how the findings relate to brain function and behaviorOne day in September she was assessing Emma a student who said her smoking  almost every day  didnt interfere with school work or other obligations For 100 to go toward studyabroad plans Emma politely plowed through nearly three hours of tests on cognitive functions that are or might be affected by THC like the ability to delay gratification would it be better to have 30 tonight or 45 in 15 days and motivation a choice between computer games the harder one offering a bigger payoff For memory Emma listened to lists of words repeating back those she recalled Next came risk Would she bungee jump Eat highcholesterol food These kids tend to be risk takers particularly with their own health and safety Dr Gilman saidA final test Did Emma crave a joint Her response somewhatDr Gilman is concerned about pots impact on the college population This is when they are making some major life decisions she said choosing a major making longlasting friendshipsDr Volkow noted another problem Partying on a Saturday night may hinder studying for a test or writing a paper due on Monday Maybe you wont have the motivation to study because theres no reward no incentive she saidEvidence of longterm effects is also building A study released in 2012 showed that teenagers who were found to be dependent on pot before age 18 and who continued using it into adulthood lost an average of eight IQ points by age 38 And last year at Northwestern Dr Breiter and colleagues also saw changes in the nucleus accumbens among adults in their early 20s who had smoked daily for three years but had stopped for at least two yearsThey had impaired working memories as well Working memory is key for learning Dr Breiter said If I were to design a substance that is bad for college students it would be

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/us/new-scrutiny-on-sweets-with-ascent-of-marijuana-in-colorado.html,DENVER   As Halloween approached the Denver Police Department and a marijuanastore owner teamed up to film a public service video that could exist only in this weird new world of legalized potMarijuana they cautioned parents of trickortreaters does not always look like marijuana More and more these days it can mimic Sour Patch Kids Jolly Ranchers and gummy bears and the police urged parents to doublecheck their childrens Halloween haul for any suspiciouslooking candies that might be infused with marijuanaTheres really no way to tell the difference Patrick Johnson the owner of Urban Dispensary says in the video He added Its best just to toss that stuff into the trashTo some marijuana advocates the warning belongs with shadowy urban legends about poisoned chocolates and candy bars spiked with razor blades There have not been any reported cases of marijuanalaced treats being passed out on Halloween here and edible marijuana comes in drab packages that look nothing like regular candy Still the Halloween message underscored a growing concern among parents groups and regulators that the abundant new varieties of legal edible marijuana just look too much like regular foodSince recreational marijuana sales began here in January edible pot has become a top seller at dispensaries across Colorado a sweet and tasty way for wary firsttimers to sample marijuana or for people to get high without coughing and reeking of smoke But a spate of accidental ingestions by children and adults and two deaths tied to edibles this year have prompted widespread calls to clamp down on the edible corner of the marijuana marketWhile some companies are making mandarinflavored sodas and rich darkchocolate bars infused with the drug advocates for tighter marijuana regulation say that others are simply coating brightly colored bulk candy and childfriendly breakfast cereals with cannabis oil and selling it at a huge markup And critics argue that even seasoned marijuana consumers are getting sick or losing control after eating marijuana snacks that proved far more potent than they had realized A single candy bar or soda could be packed with enough THC  the major psychoactive chemical in marijuana  to serve 10 peopleUnder new rules approved by state regulators some potent candies that once contained 100milligram doses of THC are being pared back to 10 milligrams a serving the amount that has been designated as a discrete dose And starting next February more edibles will come in childproof packages and will be wrapped up in plastic and foil sheets similar to those that encase prescription pillsBut some officials think the new rules do not go far enoughThis month Colorados public health department went so far as to recommend a ban on almost all forms of edible marijuana from brownies to cookies and chewy candies saying their proliferation was confusing consumers and baiting children who could not tell the difference The proposal has not gained much traction but it showed the deep divisions between marijuana makers and public health officials who are now sparring over how to package edibles whether they need clearer labels and markings and exactly how strictly they should be regulatedJulie Dooley and a business partner started making marijuanainfused treats years before voters in Colorado and Washington State became the first to make marijuana legal for adult recreational users It helped ease their health problems and worked for women with anxiety problems These users wanted to consume discreetly around their children so baking with cannabisrich butter seemed like an ideal choice Today Ms Dooleys company Julies Baked Goods sells granola granola bars sunflower seeds and chocolates infused with cannabis to more than 30 dispensaries around the stateMs Dooley said she was aghast at the proposal to ban her granola and said it appeared illegal under Amendment 64 the voterapproved measure that enshrined marijuana legalization in Colorados Constitution But it also showed that regulators did not understand the industry she saidThey clearly did not consider why we created edibles in the first place she said We believe wholeheartedly that this is a medicineShe and other marijuanabusiness owners said the fear surrounding edibles had outstripped reality During the first half of the year emergencyroom doctors at Childrens Hospital Colorado raised alarms after treating nine children who had accidentally eaten marijuana  more than the entire number of such cases in 2013 Since the end of May the hospital has had five additional cases of children sickened by eating marijuanaTheres no crisis theres no emergency Ms Dooley said The fear is so huge right nowBut officials with Colorados poisoncontrol center say that calls about young children exposed to marijuana had risen from 11 in 2010 to 26 last year after recreational marijuana was legalized but before retail sales began Adults too have been fooled In August seven people attending Denvers county fair said they accidentally ate marijuanalaced chocolates from a vendor at the fairs inaugural Pot Pavilion who had assured them the candies were marijuanafreeWe cannot tell which is infused and which is not said Gina Carbone a founding member of Smart Colorado which advocates tighter controls to keep marijuana away from childrenOne Colorado company has begun wooing worried parents with 15 marijuanatesting kits that use a THCsensitive solution to quickly determine whether an innocuouslooking cookie or candy is packing a hidden punchAnd some advocates say edibles should have a mark or stamp that identifies them unmistakably as marijuana the same way the Hersheys brand is stamped right on a chocolate bar or how MM candies and Jelly Belly jelly beans are each airbrushed with an insigniaBut makers of edibles have resisted the idea saying it would cost tens of thousands of dollars to buy the necessary equipment raising the price of edibles and potentially driving more customers out of the stores and back onto the black market And there are practical problems they say How do you put a unique stamp on a soft toffee chew or a package of granola And some makers say that branding a chocolate bar as MARIJUANA might actually have perverse effects making it more attractive to curious childrenLindsay Topping the marketing director of Dixie Elixirs and Edibles a Denverbased maker of marijuanainfused drinks and candies said the company was already preparing a new line of childresistant packages But ultimately she said the safety of an edible depended largely on the customerI cant control how a parent stores this she said Its out of my

High Times centerfold on your wall acquire a few Grateful Dead concert tapes tiedye a Tshirt and you could plausibly reinvent yourself as a hippieHigh Times turns 40 this year and with marijuana laws loosening in America its easy to forget how radical an outrider of the counterculture this magazine was Its editors were and are brave subversive and funny Theyve tended to take nothing seriously except for one crucial thing the way so many lives have been destroyed by an inept and misguided war on drugsTo celebrate the magazines anniversary we have High Times A 40Year History of the Worlds Most Infamous Magazine a coffee table book for low sticky coffee tables Its a lot of fun this volume packed with toasted social history and stoner wit But it also bangs home again and again a righteous moral pointIts a point that Michael Kennedy the magazines longtime general counsel puts this way in his introduction At High Times we will never forget what was done in the name of law enforcement to our scarred arrestees and those who still rot in prison for daring to try to enjoy themselves peacefully and harmlesslyHigh Times was founded in 1974 by Tom Forade a crusading journalist who was among the first to use pie tossing as a form of protest At a 1970 hearing he memorably plastered a cottagecheese pie upon of a member of the Commission on Obscenity and PornographyIn his foreword to this book Tommy Chong of the urstoner comedy team Cheech  Chong underscores what the magazines debut meant We always knew that there were other stoners out there but until High Times magazine came along no publication had devoted everything to the weedFun fact Mr Chong has appeared on the magazines cover eight times more than any other humanAfter starting High Times Mr Forade ran the Underground Press Syndicate later called the Alternative Press Syndicate He was also a fairly serious pot smuggler according to Dan Skye a longtime High Times editorMr Forades sideline may explain his magazines early focus on news you can use trafficking division High Times headlines included Best Smuggling Ships A Consumers Guide to Scales and my favorite How to Fly LowMr Forade committed suicide in New York in 1978 when he was just 33 By this time though High Times was an obvious success Circulation numbers are hard to come by but Mr Skye cites an article saying that

Danko writes the word homegrown went from a term of derision to one of praise You began to see headlines like Light Intensity How Much Is Enough and How to Grow 10Pound Monster PlantsThere were dark times In 1989 the Drug Enforcement Administration raided the shops of many retailers that advertised in the magazine and seized customer listsIn 2004 High Times briefly and disastrously tried to drop marijuana coverage and become a literary magazine under a new publisher and editors who included John Buffalo Mailer Norman Mailers son After a few months of this dire experiment a headline read The Buds Are BackThese days High Times is riding like a prom queen on a Mustang convertible during a homecoming parade Americas increasing embrace of legalized marijuana An editorial in The New York Times recently called on the federal government to repeal the ban on marijuana The magazine began hosting its Cannabis Cup awards in 1988 This years Cannabis Cup in Denver was attended by some 37000 peopleThis book circles repeatedly around to the subjects of race and class The war on drugs was always really a war on marijuana Mr Kennedy suggests because it was easier for cops Criminals dealing drugs like heroin and cocaine he writes would actually shoot backThus the war on drugs was waged mostly on hippies and slackers and the underprivileged We were dirty and disposable Mr Kennedy writes and tens of millions of us were incarcerated for having funIts probably time to confess a personal debt to High Times Im not a pot smoker Weed often makes me paranoid and in the evenings Id rather sip from a kylix of cold gin Once or twice a year at a party though standing in someones backyard Ill take a hit or two of a joint thats going around just so I dont feel like a dweebOne of these occasions turned out to be just before I learned Id have to take a urine test to be hired by The New York Times I was terrified and later outraged that a tiny indiscretion if thats the correct word might prevent me from getting a job I badly wantedSo I purchased my firstever issue of High Times This was 1999 I scanned the rainbow assortment of ads and I phoned for a mailorder shipment of detox tea with which I powerflushed my kidneys for a miserable weekWould I have passed the urine test anyway Almost certainly Was not doing the cleanse a risk worth taking Definitely not It was a moronic close call that gave me increased sympathy for people who had their lives upended for little good purpose butterflies of a thousand species each broken on the same wheelSo thank you High Times for fighting

NYT,http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/when-the-message-on-marijuana-is-still-just-say-no/,As I wrote last month marijuana and its use has changed The laws around it are in flux As of now marijuana for medical usage is legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia two of those states Colorado and Washington have legalized recreational use as well for people 21 and over The stuff itself usually green leafy and intended for smoking is increasingly available in a form that I have also written about before It may be a drug but it can look like candy  So how I asked do we talk about the maybelegalforsomepeopleinsomecontextsbutnotforyou drug that can now be munched smoked or sipped As Julie Scelfo described in A Familys Truth About Marijuana Depends on the Family parents are finding different answers to this question up to and including smoking with teenagers and helping teens 18 and over to secure marijuana legally with medical marijuana cards A parent who is or has been a user of marijuana may see it differently than a parent who has not Just as some parents have always preferred to take a more lenient stance on alcohol use or even the law than others some parents will be similarly lenient regarding marijuanaBut there remain excellent reasons for taking the classic 80s JustSayNo approach to marijuana use in teenagers While the legalization of marijuana for adults or for medical use in some states contributes to a perception that it is safe for all its effects on developing brains are less clear Recent research has found a correlation between regular marijuana use at younger ages and impaired neural connectivity executive function and memory and poor grades and school performance although the question of causation is particularly murky in this area Teens who are already struggling with brain function or school performance may be more likely to embrace marijuana use Colorados Dont Be a Lab Rat campaign tackles the lack of clarity head on asking Whos going to risk their brains to find out once and for all what marijuana really doesBeyond the possible neural changes marijuana use can have big consequences in a teens life Its still illegal in every state for teenagers to use marijuana Many high school sports and organized activities take a strict notolerance view of marijuana and alcohol Students who even attend a party where the drug is used may find themselves off the team or out of the band College sports teams including those at the University of Colorado Boulder often take a similar approachIf your teenager isnt a joiner he may be a traveler A marijuana conviction even a minor one can mean no visa to countries from Canada to China Marijuana use even without a conviction can end job prospects with the military police and fire departments or the Federal Bureau of Investigation and disqualify a student from government internships Many jobs and even colleges and graduate schools take past drug use or evidence of it through perhaps social media seriously Your teenager or any proponent of legalization can argue that those limits are shortsighted and should change but for now those are the facts The choice to use marijuana now can limit later life choicesThis conversation is also a different one for parents of minority children Statistically white teenagers can hope that police and other authorities will look the other way when it comes to marijuana use black teenagers in particular often cannot Blacks are routinely singled out for marijuana arrests Minorities are more likely to suffer any possible consequences for its use and it use can become a pretext for more and harsher police scrutiny of a teenAll that said Childrens Hospital Colorado reminds parents to have conversations not lectures Children make choices all the time that wouldnt be our choices for them and families regroup and move forward Listen to your childs perspective make sure youre having an ongoing conversation around marijuana ask questions and above all make sure your child knows that if he feels unsafe at any moment he can call As the laws around marijuana use change and with them the ways we consider drug use in the larger culture that conversation with teenagers will change as well Parents will also find themselves talking about the ways different families approach marijuana use you might not share a pipe with your son his best friends father may feel differently Well face new conversations with each other about whats appropriate Few of us would ask a fellow parent not to drink a beer in the presence of our children we may feel differently about that pipe and differently still about a serving of THClaced chocolate medical or recreational Like the conversations were having with our kids this one

legalize sales of recreational marijuana to adults residents of Oregon Alaska and Washington DC will vote next week on ballot measures patterned on those of the two pioneers People on both sides of the issue say these initiatives could determine whether there will be a national tide of legalizationA changing political landscape has weakened antimarijuana efforts As the libertarian movement in the Republican Party has gained force with leaders like Senator Rand Paul Republican of Kentucky supporting decriminalization of marijuana and others going even further an anchor of the conservative opposition to legalization has erodedAnd Democrats have found that supporting legalization  once an invitation to be labeled soft on crime  no longer carries the risk it once did as public discussion of prison overcrowding and law enforcement budgets has reframed the issueNational groups that have long advocated legalization have provided labor and money along with help from a legal marijuana industry that did not exist in 2012 The old antidrug coalition has struggled to find traction and money Supporters of legalization have outdone opponents fundraising here in Oregon by more than 25 to 1 and in Alaska by about 9 to 1The support coalition is definitely broader and the opposition has splintered said Corey Cook an associate professor of politics at the University of San Francisco who follows the marijuana debateThe contrast between the pro and antilegalization forces was apparent on a recent day in Oregon In downtown Portland scruffy hipsters with clipboards buttonholed passersby registering voters and urging them to vote yes on Measure 91 while political consultants put the final touches on a 2 million ad barrageNearby opponents organized one of their major events in Keizer a suburb of Salem the state capital Titled Marijuana and Our Youth the session included two hours of PowerPoints and passionate denunciations of the drug But no one even mentioned Measure 91 Audience participants and organizers many of them from governmentfunded nonprofit groups involved in drug treatment services were afraid of violating laws that ban politicking with public moneyOpponents were by their own admission late in forming a united organization and their campaign had only about 10000 for advertising with spots running on two Portland radio stations starting last weekendTheyve done a pretty good job of shutting everybody up said Joshua K Marquis the district attorney in Clatsop County and an opponent of legalization referring to the pro91 forcesThe prolegalization campaigns in Oregon and Alaska are financed largely by national organizations In Alaska 84 percent of the 867000 raised by legalization proponents at Yes on Ballot Measure 2 has come from the Marijuana Policy Project a group based in Washington DC with an advisory board that includes actors musicians and politicians including Gary Johnson the Libertarian Party candidate for president in 2012 Opponents to legalization in Alaska have raised only 97000In Oregon the Drug Policy Alliance based in New York and backed by the billionaire investor George Soros has led the charge contributing at least 780000 this year according to state records making up about 35 percent of the cash raised by the main committee supporting legalizationMarijuanarelated businesses or investors in Colorado Washington and California have contributed at least 60000 Contributors included OpenVAPE a company based in Denver that sells products for consuming concentrates like hash oil Privateer Holdings a marijuana investment firm in Seattle and Vicente Sederberg which calls itself The Marijuana Law FirmThere has been some wellfunded opposition to legalization especially in Florida where voters will decide whether to become the first state in the South to allow marijuana for certain medical uses There Sheldon G Adelson a casino executive from Las Vegas has contributed 5 million to opponents of medical marijuana about 86 percent of the total raised by the main committee fighting the legislationBut in Oregon there has been no sugar daddy as Mr Marquis the county prosecutor put it Opponents have raised only about 179000Initiative 71 in Washington DC would allow residents to possess up to two ounces of marijuana for personal use and grow up to six cannabis plants at home Measure 91 in Oregon would allow possession by adults of up to eight ounces of marijuana and four plantsBallot Measure 2 in Alaska would allow adult possession of one ounce and six plantsSupporters of legalization in Oregon and Alaska said that money was crucial to overcoming what they say was years of incorrect information and distortion by law enforcement and antidrug groups about marijuanas risksThe opposition made good traction for 50 years and it was built around locking people up A massive industry was built around it said Richard Branson the entrepreneur who founded Virgin Group and a member of the Drug Policy Alliances international honorary boardOpponents said they were facing for the first time an emerging industrial complexThis is not about independent Alaskans smoking marijuana in their homes but a commercialization and industrialization of an industry said Charles Fedullo a spokesman for Big Marijuana Big Mistake which opposes Ballot Measure 2 in AlaskaChanges required for the meeting about marijuana and youth here in Keizer opponents of legalization say offers a case study in the tough new tactics of prolegalization groupsA few weeks before the Marijuana and Our Youth meeting legalization supporters pointed out to federal and state authorities that a small drug treatment center funded by government grants was sponsoring a tour of the state by Kevin A Sabet a cofounder of a national antilegalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana They reminded all parties that federal and state laws prohibited the use of public funds to influence electionsThe State of Oregon agreed and issued a stern warning that any group receiving public money  a list that included 70 counties tribes schools and nonprofit agencies that provide drug treatment or substanceabuse prevention programs  had best tread carefullyThe result was a sudden silence in the antidrug contingent and a muted meeting here in Keizer Even though private funds were substituted to avoid the appearance of impropriety talk of Measure 91 organizers said was taken off the table out of concern for jobs and future government grants A central constituency in the opposition heavy on health care professionals was stifledBoth sides said the new terrain offered a glimpse toward the next wave of states notably California where supporters are gearing up for a vote in 2016 But there are strange historical echoes too Alaska and Oregon were both pioneers of marijuana law in the 1970s Oregons Legislature debated full legalization in 1973 and ended up passing the nations first law decriminalizing possession of small amounts Alaskas Supreme Court held in 1975 that possession of marijuana in ones home was protected by constitutional privacy lawWhether the antidrug coalition of the past is dead or just sleeping both sides agree that the old arguments no longer workTodays parents are yesterdays children who were smoking marijuana and have personal experience and therefore the kind of advertisement which shows fried eggs doesnt really cut it with them Mr Soros said in an interview this year He was referring to an antidrug television campaign that showed a sizzling egg in a pan and the tagline This is your brain on drugsBut the pressure is also on proponents they say not to fall short because every new state is a kind of test caseIf we win I think it shows that public opinion has decisively changed  weve won in two election cycles said Peter Zuckerman a spokesman for New Approach Oregon the main group supporting legalization If we lose I think it becomes much harder he said We have to maintain the momentumProfessor Sabet of the department of psychiatry in the College of Medicine at the University of Florida founded his antilegalization group with Patrick J Kennedy a former Democratic congressman from Rhode Island He said an interview that on the surface the fight against legalization probably looks unwinnable hereIt looks bad  I want to be on the other team he said laughing Turning serious Professor Sabet said that experiences in Washington and Colorado were exposing flaws in legal marijuana  from greater exposure to young people to questions of highway safety  that he thinks will turn off many voters even though opponents of the ballot measures lack the money to shout their messageLegalization in practice has been the biggest enemy of legalization

is not at restThe county district attorney R Michael Tantillo asked a grand jury to determine if there was evidence to support a charge of manslaughter in the second degree or criminally negligent homicide against Stewart but the panel found no aberrational drivingTantillo said a toxicology report revealed that Ward was under the influence of marijuana at the time of the accident  enough to impair judgmentI respect everything the district attorney and sheriffs office did to thoroughly investigate this tragic accident Stewart said in a statement released by a team spokesman While the

Sprint from Port Leyden NY left his racecar and walked onto the track to confront Stewart As Stewart drove past his car hit Ward Ward was declared dead at a hospital shortly afterwardThe grand jury heard testimony from about two dozen witnesses including drivers track employees and two accident reconstruction experts The grand jury reviewed two videos and photographs of the accident deliberating for less than an hour before coming to a decision Tantillo would not say if Stewart testifiedAn affirmative vote of at least 12 members of the 23member grand jury would have been needed to indict Stewart Tantillo did not reveal the vote tally but said he believed the grand jury blamed Ward for the accidentThe grand jury was never tasked with the responsibility of anything other than to determine whether there was enough evidence to file charges against Tony Stewart Tantillo said in a news conference They were not considering whether anybody else was at fault However I am sure from their deliberations and discussions that the fact that Kevin Ward was observed running basically down twothirds of the track into a hot track in the middle of other cars that were still racing played a big big factor in their decisionTantillo said that Stewart did not change course as he passed Ward and that the fishtail movement of his racecar seen on a widely viewed video of the accident came at impact and was a result of his cars hitting WardWhen reached by phone Pam Ward Kevins mother read a prepared statement maintaining that Stewarts actions were dangerousOur son got out of his car during caution while the race was suspended she said All other vehicles were reducing speed and not accelerating except for Tony Stewart who intentionally tried to intimidate Kevin by accelerating and

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/fashion/in-colorado-a-rebranding-of-pot-inc-marijuana.html,Step into a Colorado pot dispensary at random and youll long for the luxuries of the DMVMetal bars cover windows Vinyl signs are tacked to walls Guys in hoodie sweatshirts greet you from behind the counter Even the act of ordering the product itself is borderline absurd What grown adult can respectfully walk into a store and ask for an eighth of Green Krack and a nub of Big Buddha Cheese pleaseBut that experience is changing thanks to a new breed of entrepreneur in Colorado  young ambitious and often female  that is trying to reach a more sophisticated clientele in everything from language to packaging to social eventsWere weeding out the stoners said Olivia Mannix the 25yearold cofounder of a startup called Cannabrand an advertising agency devoted exclusively to marketing marijuana We want to show the world that normal professional successful people consume cannabisColorado became the first of two states to legalize recreational marijuana sales this year paving the way for millions in tax revenue and a new kind of consumer That is why on a recent weekend Ms Mannix and her cofounder Jennifer DeFalco were camped out in Aspen for a potthemed and potinduced brainstorming sessionThe gathering was billed as a writers retreat but mostly it involved talking They discussed edible marijuana and flavor pairings over a meal prepared by Melissa Parks a chef trained at Le Cordon Bleu THCinfused truffles optional They contemplated strain hybrids and herbal remedies with commentary from a selfdescribed cannabis sommelier as well as the gangapreneurs who have flocked to Colorado since pot was made legal not wanting to miss out on the socalled green rushAnd of course they talked about branding How can the pot industry shed its stoner stigmaPot has practically gone mainstream A majority of Americans now supports legalization efforts There are coming ballot measures in Alaska Oregon and the District of Columbia Yet when it comes to pot culture the industry remains comically rudimentaryDispensaries still look like underground abortion clinics Ms Mannix said Advertisements are full of women with whipped cream straddling bongs Ms DeFalco said And the old stoner stereotype endures lazy mostly men rolling joints in their parents basement covered in Doritos crumbsThe average person when you say the word marijuana they have a visceral reaction said Paul Armentano the deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws one of the oldest of such groups Theres a reason the alcohol industry spends tens of millions of dollars to advertise and market their products Successful branding pays offSo where do branding specialists begin For starters they would like to stop calling it pot thank you very much Better to call it cannabis the plants scientific name Less aggressive Rather than smoke one consumes the product Subtler For those in the business  or cannabusiness as its known  9to5 chic is crucial said the Cannabrand owners no sweats no tiedye no Bob Marley TshirtsWhile smoking or rather consuming on the job seems to be par for the course its not without a certain decorum a daintylooking joint or perhaps a vaporizer pen like an ecigarette for weed that slides neatly in a purse or pocketCultural crossover is already well underway in the state The Colorado Symphony made headlines this summer when it began a series of shows called Classically Cannabis in which freespirited music lovers were invited to BYOPThroughout Denver there are monthly cocktail and cannabis events put on by a local party planner as well as a weekly painting course called Puff Pass and Paint hosted in a charming Victorian studio  an effort to as Heidi Keyes the cheerful 28yearold instructor put it blend Mary Jane and MonetCannabrand recently rolled out a yoga class called Vape and Vinyasa The company is working on an app that will allow users to place their pot order online and skip the line as they describe it like an OpenTable for weedThe thing is said Ms DeFalco who is the duos creative director baby boomers are smoking stayathome moms are smoking business executives are smoking But for so long theyve done it behind closed doors We want to bring them out of the shadowsAnd they want to keep them out there Meg Sanders the chief executive of a network of dispensaries called Mindful recently hired Cannabrand to do an overhaul of her company formerly called GaiaThe new name was chosen to reflect the brand philosophy she said but also to modernize its look  in everything from logo to the uniforms worn by employees to the dispensaries shabby insides Many of the marketing materials do not even mention the word cannabis or any other word for potIve heard time and time again I walk into a dispensary and I feel like Im walking into a stoners basement said Ms Sanders during a tour through the expansive factory where her plants are harvested It also acts as the companys headquarters So we really had to think How do we package our product in a way that wherever we go  whether its the most liberal or the most conservative clientele  people look at us and think I get it Im not offended by this Its not Joeys weed shop you knowMs Mannix and Ms DeFalco studied together at the University of Colorado at Boulder though neither has a business background Ms Mannix studied communications Ms DeFalco advertising They are young working overtime trying to project a business savvy but theyve also filled a hole in the industry that the mainstream business sector has yet to touchFor example the women were among the sponsors of a recent career fair called CannaSearch to recruit for some of the 500 open pot jobs in the state The jobs included dispensary workers yes but also horticulturalists social media managers and marketing executives The applicants showed up  among them Csuite level executives said Ms Sanders  but not a single mainstream brand had even a sponsorship presenceThere is a huge untapped market here said Ashley Picillo a 26yearold former teacher who runs a cannabis events agency and was the fairs coorganizer Its about reaching nonconsumers Women Young people Business professionals Grandmothers and soccer moms People like meIn

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/08/04/weed-world-what-i-saw-at-the-revolution/, Lawrence Downes wrote the lead editorial on Colorados experiment in marijuana legalization We asked about the trip he took to research the issueI went to Colorado in June on assignment as a member of the editorial board to learn about marijuana legalization there I didnt know much about the state but after a week traveling mostly in Denver Gunnison and Crested Butte I had learned a lotIt was obvious even to a skeptic that Colorado is standing on firmer ground than even many legalization advocates expected I concluded that the experiment is working and the doomsayers are wrong The Colorado sky  big blue a little smudgy over Denver  is still in place held up by mountain peaks that arent going anywhere On the ground the marijuana dispensaries are the most visible signs of the new world of weed They are mostly small storefronts sometimes hard to notice until you realize what signs like Wellness Center and Natural Remedies are telling you Stoner culture flourishes openly in clubs and the backofthebook ads in Westword the alternative paper in Denver But there is very little inyourfaceness to the brickandmortar cannabis trade The growing takes place out of sight  in unmarked warehouses along the South Platte River in Denver for example and in peoples homes Unless the very existence of a sign saying Denver Kush Club offends you youre not likely to be appalled by the openness of cannabis cultureBut if youre looking to indulge retail shops are easy to find Tourists are flocking to gawk and discuss cannabis strains and effects with dispensary salespeople called budtenders who are no doubt delighted to find themselves so employable While marijuana legalization is about ending hypocrisy repairing the criminal justice system favoring facts over hysteria its also about turning users into consumers Colorados cannabis advocates and entrepreneurs have in classic American fashion gotten down to businessA bunch of ganjapreneurs took over the Colorado Convention Center for a twoday summit sponsored by the National Cannabis Industry Association when I was there in midJune I saw two sets of blonde dreadlocks and average tattoo density otherwise the scene was all business casual polo shirts and pencil skirts smartphones and networking Drug dealers dont fit the stereotype when they are discussing human resources media relations tax regulation and lobbying or when their companies have names like Envirotech Greenhouse Solutions EZTrim and CannLabsPhotoPipes for sale at the Denver PrideFest in Civic Center Park in JuneCredit Lawrence DownesAmbitions were high but the scale was human there is no Philip Morris or Walmart of cannabis yet The industry is young enough for its capitalists to still be steeped in marijuana idealism The summiteers sounded sincere ironyfree even poignant Even though they were there to cash inPhotoCareful trellising and sophisticated grow lights keep plants healthy in the LivWell warehouseCredit Lawrence DownesThe biggest player I met though not at the summit was a Denver entrepreneur named Ben Burkhardt who wants his cannabis business LivWell to succeed on the Budweiser model delivering vast quantities of a pretty good product He told me his 120000squarefoot operation near downtown Denver is the largest legal marijuana farm in the world with three levels under grow lights that bring hot sunshine indoors I watched his employees planting potting and expertly trimming plants with scissors I saw a guy using rubber gloves and razor blades to cut and pot clones I saw machines in his kitchen mixing chocolate and oils to make potent little candies I met a marijuana photographer named Ry Prichard who shoots for High Times and The Denver Post He and I sat in a Burger King where he showed me dozens of lovingly shot photos on his laptop like baby pictures of leaves and buds and bits of marijuana concentrates with names like shatter and budder He belongs to a subculture of devoted users who smoke dabs of concentrates using glass pipes and butane torches Its the marijuana equivalent of doing shots but without the cirrhosisRy told me something amazing He said that the preferred tool for lighting dabs is a crme brle torch and that if I went to the Bed Bath  Beyond in Denver I would find a dab island a pile of torches stacked beside glass bowls digital scales vacuum sealing machines and plastic bags  everything for the dabbing lifestyle At the chains store on First Avenue it was just like he said a mountain of torches 135 of them otherwise unmarked and unnoticed by shoppersRy also told me that he was named for the guitarist Ry Cooder which I think is one of the coolest things about himI saw some troubling things too The best available responses to the edibles problem  more education clearer packaging more parental responsibility  are sound but not entirely reassuring And while consumers might expect basic foodindustry cleanliness standards with products they smoke and eat for now they are taking their chances New health and sanitation rules to prevent problems like mold and bacteria dont take effect till the fall Another point Marijuana is supposed to be sold in childsafe envelopes After I bought some edibles in Crested Butte I gave an empty envelope to a 5yearold boy who conquered its zipper lock in about half a minute He would have been quicker but he was holding a piece of toast The federal prohibition of marijuana has created a banking crisis Mr Burkhardt says he and other business owners cant get banks to save our lives Armoredcar companies wont work with him he has to use private vehicles and be discreet He pays corporate and personal taxes in cash taking suitcases to the IRS which means a handful of people will spend the rest of the day flicking and stacking bills He feels certain that the feds will fix the banking problem eventually  after somebody gets killed in a robberyThere is another physical danger hardcore users making hash oil at home using butane as a solvent to leach the THC from carefully nurtured buds Done in a competent lab this produces concentrates with a purity up to 90 percent THC and a high that blissedout users rave about Done ineptly in a kitchen or garage it produces explosionsAdvocates response to this and other concerns more legalization not less A cheaper supply of legal concentrates makes users less inclined to risk blowing themselves upBut cheaper cannabis is also easier for teenagers to get and some advocates fear a dramatic increase in use by teenagers could stop legalization in its tracks Much is riding on the states drugprevention campaign to counter the inconveniently mixed signals that arise from normalizing what teenagers have been told all their lives is a dangerous narcoticBecause I was working I didnt inhale Nor did I chew or sip I had heard from reliable sources that edibles can really mess you up I did drop 80 on a bottle of cannabisinfused sarsaparilla elixir applecandy drops and ointment But I gave them away to some lawyers I met Colorados law against public consumption means there are few places for tourists to smoke what they buy Smoking a joint on the sidewalk wont send you to state prison but it might get you a ticket I did not risk it My direct experience boiled down to talking and listening to a lot of people taking notes and photos Looking around And sometimes smelling Parts of Colorado are definitely funkier than beforeSpending a week looking at Colorado through a marijuana lens had an odd effect Somehow it made me lose my alcohol goggles the ones that make you blind to the ubiquity of liquor in the culture at large Ours is a boozesoaked country theres no denyingI went to a Merle Haggard concert in downtown Denver after a long day at the cannabis summit Mr Haggard dedicated one song to all the drunks in the audience especially the female drunks whom he found delightful Later he sang his biggest hit Okie From Muskogee We dont smoke marijuana in Muskogee he began and people whooped to hear his legendary putdown of longhaired hippies and their cannabisThe song long ago lost its countercountercultural punch but whether Mr Haggard was being all satiric or truly in earnest I have never heard any hidden meaning or irony in his matteroffact refrain about what Okies consider the biggest thrill of all  getting drunk on grain alcoholInside the lovely Art Deco Paramount theater where the seats have cup holders audience members raised high their Pabst Blue Ribbon tall boys and sang along The song was a perfect summation of incoherence of the American drug war with its prim rejection of one relatively benign herbal drug and affection bordering on reverence for a wretchedly damaging liquid one It was an accidental anthem for legalization and we knew all the words by heart,2014-08-04T06:59:37Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/nyregion/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-biggest-pot-dealer-in-new-york-city-history.html,One day in January 2007 the disgruntled exgirlfriend of a Queens pot dealer walked unprompted into the district office of the Drug Enforcement Administration on Long Island Sitting down with an agent she bitterly gave vent Her former boyfriend the father of her child was selling weedAs a rule the drug agency isnt in the business of settling romantic scores but the woman who had shown up with her child in tow was adamant that her onetime lover was a major player in the citys wholesale marijuana trade A group of federal agents started looking into the manWhat began that day with a woman scorned unfolded over the next seven years into an investigation that went beyond the wildest imaginings of the agents assigned to it an elaborate case that led to the discovery and subsequent arrest of a surprising quarry an international criminal who is now described as the biggest marijuana dealer in New York City historyThat man a French Canadian playboy named Jimmy Cournoyer spent almost a decade selling highgrade marijuana in the city trafficking the drug through a sprawling operation that moved from fields and factories in western Canada through staging plants in suburban Montreal across the United States border at an Indian reservation and finally south to a network of distributors in New York Along the way Mr Cournoyer a martialarts enthusiast with a taste for fast cars oversaw an unlikely ensemble of underlings a company of criminals that came to include Native American smugglers Hells Angels Mexican money launderers a clothier turned cocaine dealer in Southern California and a preppy Polowearing Staten Island gangsterIt all came to an end three weeks ago when Mr Cournoyer pronounced koornWAHyay was sentenced in Brooklyn to 27 years in federal prison finally bringing to a close the investigation that emerged in 2007 from that domestic disputeThe size and sophistication of his fallen empire were unprecedented those who chased him say Starting in the mid2000s Mr Cournoyer managed the shipment of mansize bales of hydroponically grown pot across the border on motorboats and snowmobiles Nearly 1 billion of his cash was laundered through the Sinaloa drug cartel or was ferried back to Canada in pickup trucks equipped with secret traps in their radios and gas tanksWe never saw anything like this guy before said Steven L Tiscione a federal prosecutor in New York who supervised the task force that broke the case In terms of his longevity and scope and the connections he had around the world nothing nobody comes closeAt the height of his success Mr Cournoyer who is now 34 and is awaiting placement in the federal prison system drove a Porsche Cayenne and a 2 million limitededition Bugatti Veyron He was friends with Georges St Pierre a mixedmartial arts fighter and dated a lingerie model His social circle was configured such that once on a trip to Ibiza he attended the same party as Leonardo DiCaprio These circumstances could not have been more different from those of his pursuers on the task force composed of local detectives career federal agents and government prosecutors like Mr Tiscione The task force however had a lead and within a year of receiving the womans complaint the Queens dealer who was caught selling drugs was facing prosecution and became an informantOne piece of the information he provided was the alias of his Canadian supplier a man known as Cosmo whose name he said derived from his residence in the Cit Cosmo a luxury condominium in the Montreal suburb of Laval Mr Tiscione and his team eventually learned Cosmos real name by eavesdropping on his network with wiretaps and by putting pressure on other dealers but they were unaware of his lengthy history until they contacted the authorities in Laval The Canadians described Mr Cournoyer as a seasoned trafficker whose criminal career had begun at age 18 when he and his brother Joey were arrested with a stash of 11 marijuana plants at their apartmentIn 1998 Mr Cournoyer pleaded guilty in that case and was sentenced to probation But two years later he was caught again selling marijuana out of his Jeep at the Kanesatake Mohawk reservation a halfhours drive from Laval Although he pleaded guilty in that case too he escaped a serious prison term He was arrested for a third time only 12 months later On that occasion Mr Cournoyer had checked into a Hilton in Toronto planning to sell 10000 Ecstasy pills to a customer for 65000 The customer turned out to be an undercover agent As he tried to flee Mr Cournoyer was captured despite court papers say brandishing a handgun loaded with armorpiercing bulletsThe lesson he learned from prison that time was perhaps not what the authorities intended As Mr Tiscione would later write in a legal memorandum Determined to never again be found in the compromising position of physically touching narcotics Cournoyer began expanding his roster of associates and installing additional layers of subordinates between himself and the drugsAmong those subordinates was Mario Racine a fellow Canadian whom Mr Cournoyer sent to the United States in the early 2000s court papers say to manage the increasingly giant loads of marijuana flowing across the border Mr Cournoyer had met Mr Racine through Mr Racines sister Amelia the lingerie model whom he dated for several years Mr Racine organized the outfits East Coast distribution The biggest distributors were generally given up to 200 pounds of marijuana at a time with brand names like Sour Diesel which they then resold in pound quantities to smaller retail salesmenAnother top lieutenant was Patrick Paisse a onelegged Qubcois who helped Mr Cournoyer arrange a deal with the Hells Angels to drive huge loads of pot from fields in British Columbia and greenhouse factories equipped with charcoal air filters and offthegrid power systems across the border hidden beneath the tarps of tractortrailersMr Paisse pronounced pahEES also helped him make contact with a network of Native American smugglers at the St Regis Mohawk Reservation who moved their own loads south across the St Lawrence River on small boats during temperate months and on snowmobiles in winterThe reservation which sits along the border of New York State and Canada was a perfect corridor for shipping drugs to American buyers and the Native residents who worked with Mr Paisse had long experience in moving contraband like firearms and cigarettes through its skein of private docks One of the Natives who took part Kenneth Cree lived in an immense house studded with surveillance camerasBefore long court papers say the trafficking operation was pumping regular shipments of highgrade marijuana into the United States But in 2004 one of Mr Cournoyers top New York distributors stole a load worth more than 1 million souring relations with the Hells Angels who lost out on the fee to transport the drugsThat same year Mr Cournoyer crashed his Porsche killing a passenger and was imprisoned on charges related to the death Although he served only a year he was forced upon his release to live in a halfway house in Montreal In his absence his enterprise had fallen into tatters Mr Tiscione said But Mr Cournoyer managed to rebuild it meeting secretly with associates during hurried rendezvous in the Montreal subway and while on work release from the halfway house where  industrious as ever  he had found a job driving an elderly woman to her medical appointmentsThe operation was flourishing again by late 2007 when the Drug Enforcement Administration began to make inroads in its investigationUnbeknown to the task force in New York a separate team from the drug agency had around that time started a sting operation against money launderers working with Mexican drug cartels That fall for instance an undercover agent posing as a cartel financier had persuaded Mr Racine Mr Cournoyers New York manager and one of his closest partners to give him 94000 in marijuana profits promising to reinvest  and cleanse  the money through the purchase of cocaineThough the agents in New York could have had Mr Racine arrested at that point they chose to let him go albeit under surveillance to preserve the investigation Mr Tisciones task force knew that Mr Cournoyer already had ties to the Hells Angels the Mohawk smugglers and the Rizzuto crime family of Montreal which ran large swaths of that citys drug trade Now the task force realized that the outfit also had a Mexican component and set about to infiltrate that corner of the businessIt took a few years but by 2010 the agents had persuaded Mr Cree who was facing a lengthy prison term to work as an informant According to Mr Tiscione they had Mr Cree engineer a money drop at a safe house only blocks from the Brooklyn federal courthouse Calling Mr Cournoyer one day Mr Cree offered to oversee the shipment of 200000 from New York to Los Angeles for a 6 percent commission As part of the deal he was given the phone number of a man in California who would take the cash on arrivalWhen undercover agents in Los Angeles called that number they reached a man named Alessandro Taloni Mr Taloni court papers say was an Italianborn associate of the Rizzutos who also served as Mr Cournoyers manager for West Coast operations He ran a lucrative moneylaundering business out west using dirty cash to buy cocaine from the Sinaloa drug cartel while maintaining his sideline as a vendor of highend haircare products A former salesman at a Montreal mens shop Mr Taloni had been charged a decade earlier with threatening to kill the owner of a rival clothing store in an attempt to cow the competitionNow the agents watched Mr Taloni pick up the money that a courier hired by Mr Cree had flown to California on a private jet After fetching the delivery Mr Taloni with the surveillance team in tow continued on in his MercedesBenz to the Beverly Hills Hotel There court papers say he met another man who handed him a suitcase with a second cache of money This was cause enough for the agents on his tail to stop him and later to search his apartment where they found 49 kilograms of plasticwrapped cocaine and nearly 1 million all of it in cashAlmost from the moment their case began Mr Tiscione and the task force had relied on oldfashioned grinditout police work Now however the task force caught a lucky and unexpected breakDominick Curatola was a muralist turned house painter turned pot dealer living on Long Island He was a minor player but he still had connections his boss in Canada was a close associate of Mr CournoyerOne day in midNovember 2010 Mr Curatolas usual money launderer was unavailable and he found himself in need of someone to help him move a cash shipment to Canada According to Mr Tiscione Mr Cournoyer volunteered his own man for the job a Hondurasborn trafficker named Jos CastilloMedinaMr CastilloMedina three years earlier was involved in the cartel moneylaundering operation with Mr Racine Now he was at it again according to court papers dispatching a woman named Elizabeth Jennings to meet with Mr Curatola in the parking lot of a Staples store in Brooklyn Even the government acknowledges that this was a onetime favor Mr CastilloMedina simply picked the wrong day to be helpfulAs it happened a different team of federal drug agents on Long Island had for weeks been following Mr Curatola and were there that day when Ms Jennings took from him a black Express shopping bag filled with 169000 then hurried back to her apartment in Brooklyn to walk her dog They were also there when Mr CastilloMedina arrived at the apartment later When the agents searched the place they found bags of marijuana two narcotics scales 500000 in cash and coded ledgers indicating deals of more than 4 million between a man named Primo and a large New York distributor referred to only as Staten IslandIt took a wiretap investigation to finally determine that Primo was Mr CastilloMedina and that Staten Island was a Bonanno crime family associate named John Venizelos Besides selling millions of dollars worth of marijuana court papers say Mr Venizelos who favored hornrim glasses and Ralph Lauren pastels managed a Mafiaowned strip club Jaguars 3Once the task force had identified Mr Venizelos federal agents descended on his house on Staten Island and then on his parents house nearby They seized more marijuana more narcotics scales and more ledgers as well as a shotgun and a loaded GlockThey also seized an encrypted BlackBerry Mr Tiscione said which was the device of choice for the Cournoyer outfit Given that a number of the bosss men were already in custody the agents were especially concerned by a message that Mr Venizelos had sent just days before his own arrest to a partner who had been captured and was under pressure to cooperate with the task forceU just got to hope they never find out u said a word seriously bro Mr Venizelos wrote He added chillingly that Mr Cournoyer kept on hand a 2 million slush fund to pay for the murder of anyone who crossed himThe flight to Mexico left Canada at 6 am Among the passengers onboard that day Feb 16 2012 was Jimmy CournoyerAfter five years of flipping witnesses listening to wiretaps and conducting secret stings Mr Tiscione and his team had finally gotten a Brooklyn grand jury to indict Mr Cournoyer on drug conspiracy charges on Jan 20 2012 A month later the newly minted defendant tried to abscond to CancunLanding at the airport he was immediately detained by the Mexican authorities Pointing to a red notice alert issued in his name by Interpol they refused to let him inAlthough Mexican officials tried three times to put Mr Cournoyer on a plane to the United States he refused to go threatening court papers say to harm the captain and the crew Finally he was hooded and escorted onto a flight to HoustonIn the year that followed his arrest Mr Cournoyer and his lawyer Gerald J McMahon disputed his removal from Mexico as a forcible abduction and tried to have the sprawling case against him dismissed But as the evidence mounted Mr Cournoyer pleaded guilty in May 2013 just days before his trial was scheduled to begin in federal court in BrooklynEven though marijuana is increasingly legalized and unlike methamphetamine or heroin rarely makes for sensational headlines prosecutors argued in a sentencing memorandum that Mr Cournoyers operation was a violent one and that it led to the enrichment of other criminal syndicates His friends and family countered with letters to the Brooklyn court praising Mr Cournoyers good nature and blaming his criminal exploits on the trauma he suffered at age 16 when his father left his familyThats when I started to see a change in my son his mother Linda Bremer wrote He wasnt focused anymore He was kind of a rebel I thought it was because of the divorceWhatever his psychic pain Jimmy Cournoyer had been driven all along by a singular passion his lawyer said in an interview a love of moneyTheres a lot of weed smokers here on the Eastern Seaboard a lot of them Mr McMahon explained Thats why he came to New York for the capitalist markets It was basically a Karl Marx kind of thing,2014-09-07T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/timing-the-call-to-repeal-marijuana/,In February of 2011 The Seattle Times published a very influential editorial calling for marijuana to be legalized Its impact was significant because it gave mainstream support to legalization at the moment when the state of Washington was beginning a serious debate on the issue In November of 2012 the states residents voted by a 56to41 margin to legalize marijuana for recreational purposesIn the practice of editorial writing timing matters a great deal The series that The New York Times editorial board began on Sunday calling for an end to the federal ban on marijuana is receiving a great deal of attention not because it is a wildly radical move far ahead of its time Its because it comes at a moment when the country is engaged on this topic and is moving with surprising speed toward a different appraisal of marijuana than existed in the 1970s when the current ban went into effectSo far 37 states plus the District of Columbia have liberalized their marijuana laws in some fashion either decriminalizing possession allowing various forms of medical use or legalizing it outright Two more states  Alaska and Oregon  are preparing to vote on legalization and others are likely to do the same before long A year ago polls show public sentiment for legalization first became a majority position There are several bills in Congress to end or soften the federal ban and in May the House voted to stop prosecuting medical use of marijuana in states that allow itThese are not new arguments said the Los Angeles Times citing statistics about the cost to society of widespread marijuana arrests But this time they come from the New York Times not High Times Support for marijuana legalization has grown so rapidly within the last decade and especially within the last two years that some advocates and pollsters have compared it with the sudden collapse of opposition to samesex marriage as a cultureredefining eventSome newspapers seemed to be shocked by our editorial statement The expression of so progressive and colourful an opinion is a surprising move from a newspaper so earnest in its coverage that it is nicknamed the Grey Lady  wrote The GuardianBut a few web sites including Gawker and Gothamist said we should have taken this stand years ago The Thought Leaders are late to the party and showed up with half a sixpack and a sticky roach Gothamist wroteIf the current editorial series had been written in the Clinton years it might have caused a stir but would have had very little impact on a society that wasnt ready to hear itMore to the point The Times wasnt ready to write it back then It was important for the board  which still believes in the oldfashioned virtues of deliberation and examination  to see how the legalization experiment was working in Colorado and Washington which so far is quite well The two states did a good job of creating a regulation mechanism and Colorado which is further along has kept legal marijuana out of the hands of minors and is beginning to collect a substantial amount of tax revenue In addition the criminaljustice costs of arresting hundreds of thousands of people for marijuana possession have become overwhelming as documented in one of the best studies on the subject which was produced just last year by the American Civil Liberties UnionEven welltimed editorial positions need constant updating however Kate Riley the editorial page editor of The Seattle Times said its vital to keep reminding the federal government of the cost of its ban on states that have chosen to legalizeWe feel like weve been hollering at the administration across 3000 miles on everything from banking to irrigation water and even had to chide some sense into our own congressional delegation she said in an email Yet so far the US Bureau of Reclamation does not want water from its federal dams in Eastern Washington to be used on cannabisWere glad to have joined The Seattle Times and other newspapers that have come out in favor of legalization or decriminalization The hollering is only beginning,2014-07-28T16:05:34Z,drugs

York region Submit yours to realestateqanytimescomWhen Smoke Gets in Your ApartmentQMy two roommates and I live on the top floor of a 12story rental building For several months there has been an enormous amount of black exhaust emanating from our roof This disgusting diesellike smoke gets blown through our windows and cakes our floors and furniture with a black oily film Not only has this ruined my furniture but I am concerned about the air I am breathing Are there any environmental precedents that can compel our landlord to get rid of this nasty smoke We have called and complained multiple times with no responseWashington Heights ManhattanA New Yorkers endure many inconveniences as tenants but black smoke caking your floors and furniture should not be among them The oily film that has damaged your furniture could be harming your bodies tooScientific studies have linked exposure to particulate matter to reduced lung function asthma bronchitis heart disease and even cancer according to Lauren Zajac a fellow at the Department of Preventive Medicine at Mount Sinai HospitalStart complaining louder Call 311 and report the condition to the citys Department of Buildings which enforces the citys construction codes and the Department of Environmental Protection which enforces the city air pollution control code These agencies can send out inspectors and issue violations against your landlord Also reach out to your local City Council member who could advocate on your behalfYou also have legal remedies as hazardous fumes in your apartment could certainly breach the warranty of habitability and could also constitute a private nuisance You could withhold your rent which would get your landlords attention But if the landlord takes you to housing court you risk turning up on the infamous tenant blacklist making it difficult for you to find another apartment elsewhere Withholding rent is a basic right that exists under law that has become unenforceable because of the blacklist said Stephen Dobkin a lawyer who represents tenantsInstead file what is known as an HP proceeding in housing court The court could direct the landlord to correct the violations and has the power to enforce its orders Thats one remedy that we frequently pursue Mr Dobkin saidPotSmoking NeighborsQ I understand that secondhand smoke from cigarettes is increasingly banned in public places But do the same rules apply to marijuana and to the secondhand smoke that moves from one apartment to another Our landlord generally declines to follow up on complaints about pot but are there ways to get the management to move under more general secondhand smoke regulationsRoosevelt Island ManhattanA No one is allowed to smoke in the common areas of a residential building with 10 or more units but the law does not prohibit people from smoking in the privacy of their own homes although some individual buildings do When it comes to the secondhand smoke drifting into a neighboring apartment the courts have frequently sided with the aggrieved neighbor since cigarette smoke is a known carcinogenBut marijuana is a little different It is illegal to possess although it has been decriminalized to some degree And medical marijuana is not permitted in a smokable form Most of the court cases about secondhand smoke in apartments however deal with cigarette smoke not potSecondhand cigarette smoke is different from secondhand marijuana smoke said Janet Ray Kalson a lawyer who represents tenants Secondhand cigarette smoke is an established health hazard and marijuana smoke is notAssuming you dont want to call the police knock on your neighbors door and explain politely that the odor of his smoke drifts into your apartment and causes you discomfort Ask the neighbor to crack a window or use an air filter when he smokes as that might lessen the effects Perhaps the neighbor could reserve one room in the apartment for smoking  preferably one that does not share a wall with your apartmentIf your neighbor ignores you keep a journal about when the marijuana smoking happens including the date time duration and the effect it has on your health With that information approach the managingagentand request help express concerns about the habitability of your apartment and the nuisance the smoke creates If that does not work you could start what is known as an HP proceeding against the landlord in housing court and see if the courts would step in and help clear the airIs the Outside Air Safe to BreatheQ I live with my wife and our two young children in a thirdfloor apartment next to a busy avenue Should we open the windows to get fresh air Or should we keep the windows closed and run air purifiers The supporters of fresh air bring up indoor air pollution like gas leaks household cleaners dust and allergens But is the air outside any better Id say no judging by the layer of soot on our windows Plus there are multiple studies and position statements fromleading health organizations linking outdoor air pollution to increased health risks What are your thoughts on the subjectUpper East Side ManhattanA You might be surprised to learn that the air on the Upper East Side has more fine particulate matter than many other New York City neighborhoods  including Mott Haven in the South Bronx But before you pull out a gas mask consider the big picture You live in a neighborhood where childhood asthma rates are well below the city averageIf you are concerned about household toxins swap the commercial products for a solution made from common household products like vinegar baking soda and lemon Dust frequently and unless you live opposite the FDR Drive open your windows on a glorious autumn morning and let the air come inFresh air is a great mixture of things said William Bryant Logan an arborist and author of Air The Restless Shaper of the World W W Norton 2012 Mr Logan found plant debris minerals like silica fungal spores and soil in the air he sampled There are very beautiful things like the scales off butterfly and moth wings he saidWhen he sampled the air alongside the Bruckner Expressway in the South Bronx however his findings were far less colorful It was entirely carbon he said If I lived there I would moveExposure to high volumes of truck traffic can have serious health consequences particularly for children or anyone suffering from asthma When youre talking about people in the Bronx who live close to truck traffic we recommend that they keep their windows closed and keep their AC on said Judith T Zelikoff a

was 16 he had been using medical marijuana since 2009 to relieve the painful spasms that jolted his body But he smoked mostly at night and said marijuana had never hurt his performance answering customer calls for a Colorado satellitetelevision providerSo when his employer Dish Network asked Mr Coats to take a random drug screen he was not surprised when the test came back positive for marijuana He told his bosses why but when he got to work the following week he said my card wouldnt open up the door He was fired for violating the companys drugfree workplace rules despite having a medical marijuana cardThere are a lot of people out there who need jobs can do a good job but in order for them to live their lives they have to have this said Mr Coats who is 35 A person can drink all night long be totally hung over the next day and go to work and theres no problem with itBut when it comes to marijuana Mr Coats and other users are discovering that marijuanas recent strides toward the legal and cultural mainstream are running aground at the office Even as 23 states allow medical or recreational marijuana employment experts say that most businesses are keeping their drugfree policies The result is a clash between a culture that increasingly accepts marijuana and companies that will fire employees who use itEven in Colorado and Washington the countrys most

welder cautions that they are a zerotolerance company including marijuanaEmployers and business groups say the screenings identify drugabusing workers create a safer workplace lower their insurance costs and in some cases are required by law But marijuana advocates say the prohibitions amount to discrimination either against people using marijuana to treat a medical condition or against people who smoke it because they simply have the legal right to do so off the clock and away from the officeIt wasnt like I was getting high on the job Mr Coats said I would smoke right before I go to bed and that little bit would help me get through my daysOn Sept 30 he will take that argument before the Colorado Supreme Court in a lawsuit challenging his 2010 firing For years courts in Colorado and across the country have ruled against marijuana users saying that companies have the right to create their own drug policies But legal experts say that if Mr Coats prevails  he lost 21 in an appellate ruling  his case could transform how businesses must treat marijuana usersMr Coatss lawyer Michael Evans argues that Mr Coatss use of medical marijuana should fall under a state law that prohibits companies from firing workers for legal offduty activities that might rankle an employer Dish Network argues that smoking marijuana can hardly be considered legal because it breaks federal lawIf Dish loses the case the company wrote in a brief to the court Dish and every other Colorado employer can no longer maintain a drugfree policy and companies across the state could risk losing federal contracts because they no longer complied with federal drugfree workplace lawsAfter Colorado voted in 2012 to allow adults to buy sell and grow their own recreational marijuana scarcely any businesses relaxed their own rules according to a survey by the Mountain States Employers Council which represents 3500 companies Seventyone percent left their drugtesting policies in place and 21 percent actually imposed stricter rulesPeople were scared they were going to have a stoned work force said Curtis Graves a staff lawyer for the groupA survey by Quest Diagnostics which conducts millions of drug tests across the country found that positive results for marijuana rose in both Colorado and Washington in the year after legalization measures passed In Colorado the number of urine samples testing positive for marijuana rose to 23 percent in 2013 from 192 percent in 2012 In Washington the rates rose to 238 percent from 194A positive test result can derail a career say people who have been fired for marijuana use In New Mexico a physician assistant named Donna Smith who had used medical marijuana to treat symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder lost her health care job in February after failing a drug testThe health care provider where she had been working Presbyterian Health Services said Ms Smith had worked for an outside staffing agency and had a temporary assignment with Presbyterian One condition of that work was a drug screen Presbyterian is committed to patient safety and we believe that a drugfree workplace is a key component Presbyterian said in a statementMs Smith who is suing Presbyterian said she had been able to find only one sporadic job since then and has cashed out an IRA and spent her savings I cant find any work she saidRecently a handful of businesses in Colorado cautiously opened up to marijuana said Mr Graves of the Mountain States Employers Council They decided their fears were overblown and have asked the group to help them revise their drugtesting policies to remove marijuana from the mixIn Washington State the TitusWill network of car dealerships and service centers now tells job applicants they will have to pass a preemployment profile test background check and drug screen excluding marijuana In Colorado a handful of technology and marketing firms that do not test for drugs have told their employees Do what you want off the clock but come to work sober and alertEven the marijuana industry has grappled with whether to drugtest its employees Outlawing marijuana use would be the height of hypocrisy But in a closely scrutinized industry that deals with huge amounts of cash potent doses of cannabis oil and marijuanalaced foods businesses say their workers cannot be stoned at workAt Open Vape which sells

wages bringing the number of states that have passed such laws to 29 and reflecting widespread dissatisfaction with Congresss failure to increase the federal minimum of 725Residents of Washington DC and Oregon voted to allow recreational use of marijuana following the lead of Colorado and Washington State But in Florida a hotly contested measure to expand the use of marijuana for medical treatment now permitted in 23 states failed narrowly Though a majority of voters approved the measure the margin fell short of the 60 percent it needed to passSupport for lowwage workers and marijuana legalization were just two issues among the many that voters considered in 146 state ballot measures in 41 states covering such topics as genetically modified food the right to bear arms and the right to bait bearsIn Massachusetts voters upheld by a wide margin a 2011 law to allow casino gambling after heavy spending by gambling interests and in another lift for workers rights they required employers to give employees paid sick leaveThough it may seem as if voters had an overwhelming number of issues to decide the numbers of ballot measures are actually trending down according to the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California The number of citizenled initiatives and referendums was at its lowest in an evennumbered year since 1974 in part because some states have made it more difficult to put measures on the ballotJust as notable perhaps is what was not subject to the popular vote Amendments defining marriage as a heterosexual institution were missing as were measures requiring voter identification  though several initiatives dealt with early voting and voter registration States for the most part avoided the hotly disputed topic of immigration except in Oregon where voters rejected a measure that would have allowed illegal immigrants to get drivers licensesSome ballot measures are used as a political tool to raise voter interest Republican critics said some of the measures to increase the minimum wage had been placed on the ballot to bolster turnout for vulnerable Democrats but support for raising the minimum wage has historically crossed party linesI cant stress how popular of an issue it is among voters regardless of political affiliation said Tsedeye Gebreselassie a senior staff lawyer for the National Employment Law Project And the federal minimum wage has been stuck at 725 since 2009Four states  Alaska Arkansas Nebraska and South Dakota  passed measures to increase the minimum wage Alaskas measure will increase the minimum wage to 975 in 2016 the Arkansas measure raises the minimum wage to 850 by 2017 Nebraskas will rise to 9 by 2016 and South Dakotas goes to 850 By a wide margin Illinois voters also recommended an increase to the minimum wage but the vote was nonbindingBoth advocates and opponents of marijuana legalization had expected voters to approve the Oregon and Washington DC measuresThe Washington initiative makes it legal for adults to possess and grow limited amounts of marijuana for personal use while Oregons allows adults age 21 and over to have up to eight ounces of marijuana in their home and up to four plants The manufacture and sale of marijuana products would be licensed and regulated by the State Liquor Control Commission Congress may attempt to block Washingtons vote on marijuana and Representative Andy Harris a Republican from Maryland has already promised to do soBut Mason Tvert a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project which supports legalization said The movement toward ending marijuana prohibition will not go backward its simply a question of how quickly it moves forwardVoters in Alaska also moved to legalized marijuanaIn Florida where the marijuana issue figured in the governors race the story was different There John Morgan a prominent trial lawyer and a supporter of the Democratic challenger Charlie Crist spent 38 million supporting the medical marijuana measure according to Ballotpedia an online politics encyclopedia that tracks ballot initiatives Sheldon Adelson a casino magnate spent even more 55 million opposing it according to committee filingsMr Crist favored the measure and even said it might bring more younger voters to the polls potentially bolstering his support while the Republican incumbent Rick Scott and former Gov Jeb Bush also a Republican opposed it Support for the measure started strong but slipped in recent polls and Mr Crist lost to Mr ScottThe vast majority of America has not legalized marijuana so I dont think its a foregone conclusion that the nation will follow Colorado and Washington State both of which legalized recreational use of marijuana in 2012 said Kevin Sabet the head of Smart Approaches to Marijuana which opposes legalizing the recreational use of the drug As the negative effects show up it could start to turn people offAnother perennial issue gambling has become more urgent as states wrestle with casino closings and bankruptcies In Massachusetts a 2011 law allowed for three casinos and one slotmachine parlor none of which have been built The initiative to repeal the law attracted deeppocketed opposition from the gambling industry which vastly outspent anticasino groups and argued that gambling would create jobs and that the slot parlor which was under construction had already done soNo state has repealed a law expanding gambling since the era of the modern casino began in 1931 according to Clyde W Barrow a political scientist at the University of TexasPan AmericanCalifornia had perhaps the most expensive ballot measure fight in the country pitting trial lawyers against doctors over a measure that would have required doctors to take drug and alcohol tests and would also have raised the cap on pain and suffering awards in medical malpractice casesThe measure failed as doctors and insurance companies spent heavily to defeat it together the two deeppocketed sides raised more than 70 millionCalifornias governor Jerry Brown who won reelection Tuesday also spent more on television ads supporting two ballot measures than he did on his own campaign Both measures passed easily One authorizes 71 billion in water infrastructure projects during a historic drought and the other requires the state to save more in its rainyday fund and to pay down more debtCalifornia voters also approved a ballot measure intended to address prison overcrowding by reducing many nonviolent felonies to misdemeanorsSome hotbutton issues like abortion and gun control were scarce on this years ballots but in Colorado the group Personhood USA backed an amendment to defined an unborn human as a person in Colorados criminal code and wrongfuldeath act The group has twice failed to win passage of a broader amendment that would have granted personhood to an unborn human being in all areas of law and its more limited measure was again rejected by voters on TuesdayIn North Dakota voters rejected a similar amendment that said life begins at conception But in Tennessee voters approved an amendment allowing the legislature to

NYT,http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/a-nation-in-transition-investigating-evolving-research-and-policy-on-marijuana/,Marijuana is illegal in the United States Yet 35 states and the District of Columbia permit some form of marijuana consumption for medical purposes and as of this year two states now allow its recreational use As national policy evolves on this issue the New York Times editorial board this summer published a  sixpart series calling for legalization In this lesson we pull together those opinion pieces as well as many other Times articles graphics and videos to offer starting points for science social studies and English teachers aiming to use the debate as an opportunity for learning research and discussion  Are you teaching this topic How What have we missedThe Natural History of MarijuanaLike other crops marijuana is largely cultivated  legally and illegally  in greenhousetype grow houses and on farms And like other crops marijuana comes from a plant  cannabis originally found in the wild and cultivated over thousands of years Have students research the history of cannabis from its origins in South and Central Asia to its introduction to the Americas  How have people used the different parts of the plant throughout history Then have students work in groups to annotate a map of the world tracing the history of marijuana cultivation This Is Your Brain  and Body  on DrugsMarijuana is best known for its psychoactive properties But how does marijuana bring about these sensations and how else does it behave in the body To answer these questions students might research how the active compounds in marijuana affect the body at the level of the cell and draw parallels with how other drugs act in the body  As is the case with many other drugs  from legal overthecounter medications to illegal street drugs like heroin  the active compounds interact with locations on the surfaces of cells called receptors Cell surface receptors provide a means for cells to receive information and input from the environment when a molecule attaches or binds to a cell surface receptor it triggers a series of events inside the cell like the release of hormones neurotransmitters or other molecules A discussion about marijuanas effects on the body might dovetail nicely with a broader class discussion or review of cell biology the makeup and function of the cell membrane and the function of neurotransmitters To dive a little deeper explain that cells in the human body have receptors for the active compounds in marijuana collectively referred to as cannabinoids By binding to cannabinoid receptors cannabinoid molecules affect how cells release chemical messengers called neurotransmitters The human body naturally makes cannabinoids and the main active ingredients in marijuana mimic these molecules and can therefore bind to the same receptors This might help to explain some of the effects marijuana is reported to have not just on the brain but on other body systems as well With this background in place have students research some of the conditions and disorders marijuana is reported to help What evidence do scientists use to support the idea that marijuana may help these and other conditions What kind of additional evidence about the beneficial effects of marijuana do scientists need and how do they suggest better using marijuana in ways that best help patients Medical Marijuana and ChildrenReview the two active compounds in marijuana THC and cannabidiol CBD and talk about how selective breeding techniques can produce strains of marijuana with varying amounts of these compounds Why might it be important for marijuana used in a therapeutic setting to have a low level of THC  Then watch both of these brief videos Healing Hemp and Pediatric Pot Which of the two active compounds has shown promise in treating children with seizures What are some of the barriers to making this compound more widely accessible What do scientists still need to learn about how this compound works Why arent there more studies of promising applications for medical marijuana Use these videos as a springboard for a discussion about using medical marijuana in young people What do its proponents have to say What are some of the main arguments against it  The Risks of Marijuana UseWhat does medical science have to say about the risks associated with marijuana use compared with the legal but regulated substances tobacco and alcohol The illegal substances cocaine and heroin Students might compare these risks using a chart or other simple graphic organizer What are gateway drugs and why might it be time to revisit the claim that marijuana use predicts harder drug use  What does medical science also have to say about the potential health benefits of marijuanaAt the same time what new information about the developing teenage brain suggests that recreational marijuana use in places where it has been legalized should be prohibited for minors Students might read further about marijuana and the teenage brain like these studies suggesting actual structural changes in the brains of young people who regularly use marijuanaAs students read and work you might have them annotate diagrams of the human body and brain highlighting the various systems affected by marijuana and the effect marijuana has on these systems The History of Marijuana ProhibitionIf marijuana is now considered to have valid medicinal purposes by the scientific community and if marijuana is less dangerous than the highly addictive but perfectly legal substances known as alcohol and tobacco how did the federal government come to categorize it as a Schedule I drug  in the same class of drugs as the highly addictive heroin and more harmful than the Schedule II drug cocaine Students can research the evolving history of attitudes and policy toward marijuana in the United States As a starting point they can read about the role that prejudice and stereotypes and a general fear of Mexican immigrants and AfricanAmericans played in formulating federal policy toward marijuana They can also consult this timeline of marijuana use in the United States and this article on the origins of the term marijuana Evaluating the War on DrugsMarijuana policy has affected millions of lives From 2001 to 2010 the police made 82 million marijuana arrests In 2011 there were more arrests for marijuana possession than for all violent crimes put together And those arrests disproportionately affect AfricanAmericans even though blacks and whites use marijuana at similar rates In states like Iowa Minnesota and Illinois blacks are more than seven times as likely to get arrested as whites for marijuana offenses Nationally blacks are 37 times as likely Arrests often lead to jail time and they can affect employment education and even the ability to get a bank loan Beyond the racial imbalance some nonviolent offenders are spending decades in jail for marijuana possession while in other states marijuana entrepreneurs are getting rich Students can study the consequences of the war on marijuana Who is most affected How are they affected How much does the war cost And what are the results They can start with Jesse Wegmans editorial on the injustice of marijuana arrests and look at this American Civil Liberties Union multimedia presentationDebating Public PolicyCurrent federal law states that marijuana like all other Schedule I drugs has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States Yet 35 states and the District of Columbia permit some form of marijuana consumption for medical purposes And two Colorado and Washington now allow recreational use of marijuana with more states considering a similar move With such radical inconsistency between federal and state law the country is ripe for a national rethinking of its marijuana policy Students can hold a mock Congress or simulate a state legislative session to debate whether marijuana should be removed from the Controlled Substances Act or whether their state should legalize marijuana for medical or recreational use or both Should states treat marijuana like alcohol  regulating and taxing it while banning its use by minors To do their research they can read David Firestones argument in favor of letting the states decide just as states did regarding alcoholic beverages after the end of Prohibition in 1933 Then students can seek out additional evidence on both sides of the debate and determine their own states policy toward marijuana  After their discussion they can write a policy paper advocating a position or simply answer our Student Opinion question Should Marijuana Be LegalIf students want to delve deeper they can investigate Colorados legalization experiment along with some of the early bumps on the road and the finer details of marijuana regulation  This resource may be used to address the academic standards

NYT,http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/marijuana-teens-health-risks/,When the antidrug educator Tim Ryan talks to students he often asks them what they know about marijuana Its a plant is a common responseBut more recently the answer has changed Now they reply Its legal in ColoradoThese are confusing times for middle and high school students who for most of their young lives have been lectured about the perils of substance abuse particularly marijuana Now it seems that the adults in their lives have done an aboutfaceRecreational marijuana is legal in Colorado and in Washington and many other states have approved it for medical use Lawmakers the news media and even parents are debating the merits of fullscale legalizationThey are growing up in a generation where marijuana used to be bad and maybe now its not bad said Mr Ryan a senior prevention specialist with FCD Educational Services an antidrug group that works with students in the classroomTheir parents are telling them not to do it but they may be supporting legalization of it at the same timeAntidrug advocates say efforts to legalize marijuana have created new challenges as they work to educate teenagers and their parents about the unique risks that alcohol marijuana and other drugs pose to the developing teenage brainThese educators say their goal is not to vilify marijuana or take a stand on legalization instead they say their role is to convince young people and their parents that the use of drugs is not just a moral or legal issue but a significant health issueThe health risks are real said Steve Pasierb the chief executive of the Partnership for DrugFree Kids Every passing year science unearths more health risks about why any form of substance use is unhealthy for young peopleAlready nearly half of teenagers  44 percent  have tried marijuana at least once according to data from the partnership Regular use is less common One in four teenagers report using marijuana in the past month and 7 percent report frequent use  at least 20 times in the past monthEven in the states where marijuana is legal it remains like alcohol offlimits to anyone younger than 21 But the reality is that once a product becomes legal it becomes much easier for underage users to obtain itThis summer the Partnership for DrugFree Kids released its annual tracking study in which young people were asked what stopped them from trying drugs Getting into trouble with the law and disappointing their parents were cited as the two most common reason young people did not use marijuana The concern now is that legalization will remove an important mental barrier that keeps adolescents from trying marijuana at a young ageMaking it legal makes it much more accessible more available said Dr Nora Volkow the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse This is the reality so what we need to do is to prevent the damage or at least minimize it as much as possibleDrug prevention experts say the Just Say No approach of the 1980s does not work The goal of parents should not be to prevent their kids from ever trying marijuanaInstead the focus should be on practical reasons to delay use of any mindaltering substance including alcohol until they are olderThe reason is that young brains continue to develop until the early 20s and young people who start using alcohol or marijuana in their teens are far more vulnerable to longterm substanceabuse problemsThe brain is still wiring itself during adolescence and marijuana  or any drug use  during this period essentially trains the reward system to embrace a mindaltering chemicalWe know that 90 percent of adults who are addicted began use in teenage years Mr Pasierb said They programmed the reward and drive center of their teenage brain that this is one of those things that rewards and drives me like food does like sex doesStudies in New Zealand and Canada have found that marijuana use in the teenage years can result in lost IQ points Mr Pasierb says the current generation of young people are high achievers and are interested in the scientific evidence about how substance use can affect intelligenceYou have to focus on brain maturation he said This generation of kids wants good brains they want to get into better schools Talk to a junior or senior about whether marijuana use shaves a couple points off their SATs and they will listen to youBecause early exposure to marijuana can change the trajectory of brain development even a few years of delaying use in the teen years is better Research shows that young adults who smoked pot regularly before the age of 16 performed significantly worse on cognitive function tests than those who started smoking in their later teenage yearsDrug educators say that one benefit of the legalization talk is that it may lead to more research on the health effects of marijuana on young people and more funding for antidrug campaignsThe Partnership for DrugFree Kids plans to continue its Above the Influence marketing campaign which studies show has been an effective way of reaching teenagers about the risks of drug use The campaign does not target a specific drug but it teaches parents and teens about the health effects of early drug use and tries to empower teens to make good choicesLegalization is going to make the work we do even more relevant Mr Pasierb said Its part of the changing drug landscape,2014-08-18T17:46:42Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/us/bid-to-expand-medical-marijuana-business-faces-federal-hurdles.html,WRAY Colo   Behind a tall curtain of corn that hides their real cash crop from prying eyes the Stanley family is undertaking an audacious effort to expand their medical marijuana business to a national marketFor years the five Stanley brothers who sell a nonintoxicating strain of cannabis that has gained national attention as a treatment for epilepsy have grown medical marijuana in greenhouses under tight state and federal regulations But this year they are not only growing marijuana outdoors by the acre they also plan to ship an oil extracted from their plants to other statesThe plan would seem to defy a federal prohibition on the sale of marijuana products across state lines But the Stanleys have justified it with a simple semantic swap They now call their crop industrial hemp based on its low levels of THC the psychoactive ingredient in potThe jump to industrial hemp means we can serve thousands of people instead of hundreds said Jared Stanley 27 who wore muddy Carhartts and a rainbow friendship bracelet as he knelt down to prune his plantsColorado which has legalized the sale of marijuana for recreational and medical use has accepted the new designation But the real question is whether the federal government will go along If it does the impact would be significant opening the door to interstate sales not just by the Stanleys but possibly by scores of other medical cannabis growers across the countryBut if it does not the Stanley brothers could be shut down by federal agentsSo far the Drug Enforcement Administration is offering few clues insisting in public statements that while it is willing to allow marijuana sales in states that have legalized the drug it might step in if growers try to sell beyond state bordersAny chemical that comes from the plant is still a controlled substance said Dawn Dearden an agency spokeswoman When we get into hemp it gets a little squishy but it still is illegalThe Stanleys quest to ship their oil to other states highlights the fraught marijuana legal landscape where state and federal laws conflict and federal agencies can have divergent policies leaving laws sometimes enforced and sometimes notThis is the mode we will be in for some time said Sam Kamin a law professor at the University of Denver who studies cannabis law As marijuana becomes more legal in more states for more purposes the tension with the federal law will become more pronouncedThe hazy legality of hemp can be seen in products like hemp granola and shampoo which are allowed to fill health food store shelves even though they technically violate federal drug laws All those products are made from imported hemp which has generally been permitted into the country so long as it has less than 03 percent THCIf the Stanleys ship their oil industry watchers say it will be the first time in decades anyone has tried to sell domestic hemp nationwideIn recent years hundreds of families with epileptic children have moved to Colorado to try oil made from the Stanleys shrubby strain which they call Charlottes Web The national Epilepsy Foundation has called for it to be available to all patients though formal research into its effectiveness remains scant There is a nationwide waiting list of more than 9000 which the brothers hope to eliminate by expanding their crop from small greenhouses into vast hemp fieldsWe are hoping the enforcement agencies have bigger fish to fry and dont want to take a bunch of medicine away from sick kids Mr Stanley said But if they are going to do it were all in If you are going to be locked up its a thing worth getting locked up forThe brothers who had a Christian upbringing in conservative Colorado Springs started a small medical marijuana business in 2008 after seeing the relief it brought to a relative sick with cancer At first they grew mostly marijuana high in THC that packed a serious psychoactive punch On the side they experimented with breeding plants low in THC but high in another cannabinoid known as cannabidiol or CBD which scientific studies suggested was a powerful antiinflammatory that a handful of small studies showed might have potential as a treatment for certain neurological conditions including seizures and Huntingtons diseaseFor years this variety languished unused in a corner of their greenhouse No one wanted it because it couldnt get you high said Joel Stanley 34 the oldest brother and head of the family business They named the plant Hippies DisappointmentThen in 2012 a Colorado mother named Paige Figi came seeking CBDrich marijuana oil for her 5yearold daughter Charlotte who has a genetic disorder called Dravet syndrome which caused hundreds of seizures per weekAfter a few doses of oil made from Hippies Disappointment Charlottes seizures all but stopped and two years later daily drops of oil keep her nearly free of seizures Ms Figi says The Stanleys renamed the plant Charlottes WebCharlottes story spread and patients began moving to Colorado About 200 families now use the oil and many have seen significant reductions in seizures according to Dr Margaret Gedde a Colorado physician who recently conducted a small survey of the patients Though few have seen their seizures totally disappear nearly 80 percent told Dr Gedde that the oil was more effective than traditional pharmaceuticals with fewer side effectsPeople from around the world started contacting the brothers We didnt have enough Charlottes Web Jared Stanley said Under medical marijuana laws we could never have enough And there were a lot of people who couldnt just drop their lives to come to Colorado to get itColorado medical marijuana law restricted production by requiring limited plant counts locked greenhouses with security cameras and costly seed to sale tracking for every plant The law also required every milligram of Charlottes Web to remain in Colorado But last year Colorado voters passed a law legalizing industrial hemp  defined as cannabis with less than 03 percent THC  allowing farmers to grow it with few restrictions Charlottes Web falls well below that level the Stanleys say Recreational marijuana typically has THC levels around 15 percentBecause United States Customs and Border Protection has also used the 03 percent THC level for determining whether to allow imported hemp into the country the Stanleys say they can legally ship their oil But the DEA maintains that the Controlled Substances Act holds that all cannabis whether called marijuana or hemp is illegalPeople in the hemp industry say it is hard to foresee the agencys response The Bush administration cracked down on all hemp in 2003 saying whether soap cereal vegetable burgers or hemp cheese any product with a trace of THC could be seized A federal appeals court blocked the action in 2004 before it took effectThe Obama administration has generally deferred to states on the question of cannabis allowing recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington and medical use in 21 additional states and in the District of Columbia provided sales followed certain criteria But in the last four months the DEA has seized thousands of pounds of nonintoxicating industrial hemp seeds including a shipment bound for a research project at the University of KentuckyThough the Stanleys maintain that shipping hemp oil is legal they have hedged their bet by working with Representative Scott Perry Republican of Pennsylvania to introduce a bill in late July that would exempt Charlottes Web and other therapeutic hemp from the federal definition of marijuana under the Controlled Substances ActAmid the uncertainty the brothers are pressing forward They have moved oil production from a commercial kitchen to a sterile lab staffed by scientists from the pharmaceutical industry Having planted 17 acres of hemp in Colorado this year they plan to plant 200 next yearThey plan to start shipping their oil as soon as they fill their waiting list of orders in Colorado which they expect to do this fall They are also setting up a 1000acre hemp farm in Uruguay which recently legalized both marijuana and hemp to handle global sales In five years they hope to have 3000 acres growing in different states and countriesMany of their workers are parents or siblings of children who rely on the oil Penn Mattison who moved to Colorado from Tennessee last winter to treat the seizures of his 2yearold daughter Millie is oneMr Mattison said that after starting to use the oil in March his daughters seizures dropped by 90 percent Other children should have the same opportunity without having to move to Colorado he said Its something they are desperate for and we know what being desperate is all about he said as he trimmed the leaves of some Charlottes Web We were there,2014-08-24T00:00:00Z,drugs

access medical marijuana immediately two ounces at a timeSome of Zachs clients are under 21 and cannot buy recreational cannabis legally But others are older students who simply dont want to pay the hefty tax  three times that levied on medical marijuana So despite the abundance of recreational cannabis products since the first retail shops opened in January there is still a vibrant black market for medical marijuana which has been legal in Colorado since 2001 with a doctors recommendationTheres definitely still the demand says Zach who is on track to graduate in December He makes anywhere from a few dollars to a thousand a month depending on how much he hustles but he says that overall sales have declined a bit what with retail shops student growers and all the medical cardsIts difficult to say if students are smoking more There is no longterm data by age but statewide about 16000 18 to 24yearolds are on the medical marijuana registry Thats 14 percent of all cardholders City of Boulder tax revenue for medical marijuana for the first six months of 2014 was up 30 percent at 500000  about equal to revenue on recreational marijuanaNationally marijuana use among young adults has clearly been trending upward The percentage of college students who reported smoking within the previous year plummeted from a high of 51 percent in 1981 to a low of 265 percent in 1991 and has been zigzagging back up to some 36 percent in 2013 according to the Monitoring the Future Study at the University of Michigan Data released in September show that one of 20 college students one of 11 men gets high daily or near daily the highest rate since 1981 To put that in perspective from 1990 to 1994 fewer than one in 50 students used pot that frequentlyExperts say that the increase is surely a reflection of relaxed laws governing marijuana in some states a movement gaining momentum Floridians will face a ballot initiative on Tuesday on whether to legalize medical marijuana which is allowed in almost half the states Alaska Oregon and District of Columbia voters will decide whether to follow Colorado and Washington State where recreational marijuana has been legal since 2012The amendments ban smoking in public  on streets and in parks shops and restaurants The same holds for campuses including university housingDr Donald A Misch associate vice chancellor for health and wellness at the University of Colorado says that his main concern about the way legalization will affect students is that the industry  and associated advertising and commercialization  promotes the notion that cannabis is harmless Monitoring the Future asks high school seniors if they see great harm in smoking regularly 60 percent do not In 2005 42 percent did notDr Misch is working with other campus officials to increase awareness about the effects of the substance including its impact on learning It is not going to turn you into an ax murderer he says but what I tell people is The good news is that marijuana is in many ways better than alcohol The bad news is its not as benign as many people want you to believe Tucked away in a windowless basement room in the universitys Wardenburg

citations by the campus police are in fact down  154 as of Oct 3 compared with almost 256 in the same period last year Christina Gonzales dean of students says the university is moving from a punitive stance to a more educational approach easing up on enforcement But last year 718 students who had been sent to the health center by the courts or university after a substancerelated offense mostly alcohol were found to be engaged in pot use that put them at riskMichael a sophomore from Colorado was caught over the summer in a Boulder park for possession A bike cop came up and saw me exhale He paid fines and fees of about 150 performed 24 hours of community service and had to complete Mr Bentleys threepart class If he stays out of trouble for several months the court will wipe his record clean During the summer he was smoking about five times a week but has slowed down with the start of classesMr Bentley asks the group about problems with memory which seems to resonate with Michael If I get high a number of times per week he says I notice that my memory slumps a littleMr Bentley empathizes You cant remember your car keys phoneNo its not like that If a friend tells me an answer to a problem when Im working on homework and Im not quite there yet I cant remember itSo you cant hold it in your mind Mr Bentley affirms No judgment no confrontation no labels This is the mantraMr Bentley and counselors at other universities say they are seeing a small but growing number of students who have been smoking since age 14 and are serious users He mentions dabs an exponentially powerful form of marijuana Last year he got an email from a member of the housing staff Students were wielding a butane torch in the dorm The kids were saying Were making crme brle on the hot plate Not exactly The

Boulder People on the front lines are playing catchup a lot of times Word spread quickly through the staff of the potential fire hazardUniversities are searching for ways to respond to marijuana the most abused substance on campuses after alcohol But interventions are often adaptations of programs for heavy drinkers that dont capture the marijuana experience says Jason R Kilmer an assistant

sessions for mild and more serious users and a group program for moderate and heavier users For students unable to curb their use a more extensive program is being planned to help them add structure to their lives and find relaxation alternatives  yoga maybeIts a retention strategy as well Mr Bentley says Users even infrequent are more likely to drop out according to a 2013 report from the

shortterm results Three months after a brief intervention students from two campuses in the Northwest reported smoking less and experiencing fewer potrelated consequences ditto for Wilmington students one month after their programAt the heart of the sessions is motivational interviewing which gets students to voice their own ambivalence about their use and eventually consider changing itStudents first discuss whats good about getting high how it lubricates social interactions and dissipates boredom and stress Michael a driven computer engineering major tells Mr Bentleys group that pot helps him feel his emotions Marijuana changed my point of view on life not to take things so hard and go easier on myself And of course there are the perceptionaltering qualities Ben a junior smiles and says When youre high watching a movie or going to a concert is freaking awesomeThey also discuss whats not so good words like bad are taboo Spending too much I dont want to even think about that says Kevin the third member of the group who smoked multiple times a day as a freshman but has cut back to three or four times a week Lack of motivation scores too And anxiety If you have anxiety in your life regularly it amplifies it Ben offersAs students reveal their dislikes counselors listen intently for signs of selfmedication for anxiety depression attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder But mostly they listen for any hook that might motivate a student to cut backRelationship troubles caused by a partners disapproval of their marijuana use is a biggie says Rebecca Caldwell director of the substance abuse program in Wilmington So are slipping grades a factor motivating the three in Mr Bentleys session For an athlete it might be diminished lung capacityBecause marijuanas effects are subtle some students dont connect the dots with say feeling tired after a nights sleep Some dont want to see the connection Pot becomes part of who they are

around a table garnished for an evening of casual indulgence beers playing cards tubes of medical marijuana and a bong All are 21 or almost there and from other statesSeveral voice sentiments that are shared in other corners of campus They didnt come here simply because its located in a permissive pot town but cannabis culture certainly played a role I could have went to a bunch of sweet public schools says Erik Mingo and I chose this one because I knew it was pretty accepted here I knew people had an open mindMr Mingo dropped out after the spring semester to work at a startup He has largely quit smoking and isnt indulging on this night I just didnt really need it anymore he explains It helped me relax and think about myself and the world and I just wasnt getting the same return His priority now is excelling at a demanding job he says I was moving on just naturally in my lifeThe campus is not under a cannabis cloud Sometimes one sees a lit joint in the open or a vape pen in class drawing ire from professors But students and others talk about a shift in how they view cannabis consumption Once an act of rebellion it no longer seems to hold symbolic power Now its just part of everyday life says Joseph Kaley 27 who graduated in 2009 and manages a Mexican restaurant on the Hill an offcampus gathering spot Mr Kaley attended three of the campuss famous April 20 smokeouts lighting up each time to protest marijuanas criminal status at the timeIn 2012 the university successfully shut down 420 saying it had grown so large it was disrupting academic life Many were angered particularly by the methods used to ward smokers away Workers spread smelly fish fertilizer on the quad and anyone without a student identification card was turned awayNew students when asked see the smokeout as a piece of quirky campus history Its just kind of fading from peoples memories says Wyatt Ryder 20 the chief of staff of the student government which last April held a symposium offering an allinclusive inside dive into the realm of cannabis cultureThe goal was to have a very nuanced discussion about marijuana said Caitlin Pratt 23 Mr Ryders colleague in student government Panelists discussed making money in the industry the effects of cannabis on the mind and efforts to legalize the substance in other states One of the most popular panels was led by Nolan Kane a CU professor attempting to map the cannabis genome to better understand marijuanas medical fuel and biotechnology potentialA few months later Mr Ryder attended a national conference for student government representatives He was accosted with questions  and jokes  about pot culture at his university Mr Ryder who doesnt even smoke was shocked to be appointed the conferences unofficial marijuana expertI

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/opinion/the-marijuana-series-other-views.html, To the EditorRegarding your editorial series advocating legalization of marijuanaWhen I ask students in my course on drugs and society if they advocate reforming federal marijuana laws their support is unanimous Yet they are equally unanimous in saying they dont want their own children to use marijuana My students conflicted reactions offer a microcosm of the tension at the heart of marijuana reform How can we move beyond unbridled prohibition in ways that will tolerate but not celebrate moderate use of marijuana by adultsIronically it is the same marginalized communities that feel the brunt of the drug war that are now at greatest risk of becoming fodder for businesses and governments eager to cash in on marijuana Recent figures from Colorado show early troubling evidence of the Pareto or 8020 principle in legal marijuana markets as with alcohol tobacco and lotteries most of the revenue is coming from a small percentage of heavy usersJust as some people keep a few chickens without government regulation let them grow a few marijuana plants But the last thing we need is a profiteering marijuana industry and another regressive sin tax that will merely trade one set of injustices for anotherJONATHAN M WENDER Seattle July 31 2014 The writer a former police officer is a professor at the University of WashingtonTo the EditorYour recent series about marijuana legalization precisely explains what motivated me as a member of the Council of the District of Columbia to introduce legislation in 2013 that would tax and regulate marijuana in the DistrictThe war on drugs has ravished entire communities in the District as evident from the racial disparities in marijuana arrests here According to a report released by the American Civil Liberties Union 91 percent of all drug arrests in DC were of AfricanAmericans despite selfreporting that shows equal rates of marijuana use among AfricanAmericans and whitesRecent surveys show that public support for the legalization of marijuana has changed significantly The conversation has shifted from immorality and war on drugs to one of social justice In spite of attempted congressional interference the DC Council has already taken the first step toward legalization and passed a decriminalization lawThe time is ripe to move forward with a full taxandregulate approach in DC  one that prohibits selling to minors and uses the tax revenue to offer programs that help with substance abuse preventionDAVID GROSSO Washington Aug 1 2014To the EditorRe What Science Says About Marijuana editorial July 31The measuring of marijuanas addictive potential and consequences against our two most highly profitable deadly and legal drugs  tobacco and alcohol  as a justification for its legalization seems to me to reflect a terrible cynicism about public health and it distracts attention from the research findingsIs it really acceptable for one out of every 10 marijuana users among adolescents nearly one of every five to have a diagnosable disorder The majority twothirds of adolescent substance abuse treatment admissions involve marijuana as the primary disorderOther scientific facts need emphasis separate from their comparison to alcohol and tobacco Regular marijuana use is associated with cognitive educational and respiratory problems It increases risk for other substance and psychiatric diagnoses Scientific disagreement remains about marijuana as a gateway drug it is not a myth that has been disprovedMarijuana addiction and withdrawal are considered physical because this potent drug causes significant changes in the brain Finally the belief that marijuana addiction and health problems will be managed better by legalization and government regulation has no basis in science or historyDecisions about the safety of our countrys youth should not be made exclusively in the court of public political and media opinion I hope the science of marijuana addiction will not be minimized or distorted in this polarizing debateSAMUEL A BALL New York July 31 2014 The writer is president and chief executive of

NYT,http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/how-the-federal-government-slows-marijuana-research/,Politicians who dont want to take a clear position on marijuana legalization often say more research is needed on the effects of consuming the drug Hillary Clinton called for more research just last month on CNNWhile existing scientific evidence shows that marijuana is less addictive and harmful than alcohol and tobacco more research would be welcome and useful to the country But what most politicians dont acknowledge is that the federal government has made it incredibly hard to perform this research Researchers have to go through a cumbersome process to obtain approval from multiple federal agencies before they are allowed to obtain and study the drug Often their requests are denied and some researchers have had to sue the government before their projects were clearedIn addition to the Food and Drug Administration which has to approve all clinical trials researchers studying marijuana also have to obtain approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration and the National Institute on Drug Abuse which controls the countrys only legal source for researchgrade marijuana Independent researchers who are not funded by the National Institutes of Health also have to obtain approval from a Department of Health and Human Services scientific review panelThe drug abuse institute says that it has funded and provided marijuana to researchers looking into the therapeutic benefits of the various chemicals found in the plant and that it had 28 active grants in this area as of January But it is far less charitable about providing marijuana to researchers who are independently funded It has agreed to provide the drug to just 16 such projects since 1999One researcher Lyle E Craker a professor at the University of Massachusetts grew so frustrated with the delays in getting access to marijuana that he sought to grow his own plants But the Drug Enforcement Administration refused to grant him a license and a federal appeals court ruled in favor of the DEA last yearA big part of the problem is that marijuana is listed in the restrictive Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act along with much more dangerous drugs such as heroin and LSD The law says Schedule I drugs have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States It is no wonder then that the American College of Physicians said in 2008 that marijuanas inclusion in Schedule I raises significant concerns for researchers physicians and patients and urged an evidencebased review of marijuanas status as a Schedule I controlled substance to determine whether it should be reclassifiedIf politicians are serious when they call for more research on marijuana they should also push for sensible laws that would make it easier for scholars to study the plant and its various chemical compounds,2014-07-30T15:55:28Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/nyregion/a-competition-to-get-a-medical-marijuana-license-in-new-york.html,More than a year before the first legal dose of marijuana will be dispensed in New York a group of entrepreneurs gathered at the Marriott Marquis hotel in Times Square in late October to discuss strategy with an influential state lawmaker It was the weekly meetup of the Cannabis and Hemp Association which formed in May to get a jump on future businessThe mood among the 18 people at the table was one of excitement Oleg Maryasis 30 a former financial adviser said he had just met with a group of investors who were eager to sink tens of millions of dollars into the New York cannabis tradeThe groups organizer Scott Giannotti a bald heavyset 35yearold from Long Island whose rsum includes selling cellphones and rapping and who now sells LED grow lights from China questioned the meetings special guest State Senator Diane J Savino Ms Savino a Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn and Staten Island was a sponsor of the medical marijuana bill that New York passed last summer 18 years after it was first proposed her efforts led Elle magazine to name her one of its 13 most potent women in the pot industry nowSenator Mr Giannotti said what can we do to help you outMs Savino offered some cautionary words The State Health Department she said had not yet written guidelines for the medical marijuana program and the licenses available for companies keen to participate would be few and costly And she added legalized recreational use as proposed by State Senator Liz Krueger a Manhattan Democrat was unlikely any time soonStill Ms Savino called the legislation a turning point for the state and the industry We can probably take in a couple hundred million dollars a year minimally she said referring to potential tax revenue Youre going to have patients who are acclimated to medical marijuana doctors who recognize it communities who realize that if they have a dispensary its not the end of the world Then youre going to have more demand In a state this size the potential is hugeWhen Gov Andrew M Cuomo signed the Compassionate Care Act in July it gave the Health Department 18 months to come up with regulations and choose up to five companies to grow and dispense medical marijuanaNow for the states wouldbe growers private equity investors labor unions lawyers lobbyists consultants branding firms suits stoners and hucksters the rush is onThis is the moment when oldguard legalizers meet a new breed of capitalistIn October 900 people flocked to a hotel in Midtown Manhattan for a 900ahead threeday East Coast Cannabis Business Expo Educational Conference and Regulatory Summit the first of its kind in New York The events organizers were two veterans of the tanning salon business the crowd ranged from venture capitalists to chocolatiers to people currently growing illegally with a smattering of doctors and representatives of at least one nursing home conglomerate There were vendors of supplychain tracking software security services and malpractice insurance as well as a manufacturer of precisiongrade scales from the diamond district Not a single bong in the houseThis is sexy this is drugs one speaker Adam Bierman a managing partner of MedMen a Californiabased consulting company told a crowded conference room This is something theres already demand for This is selling potUnder New Yorks law licensed companies will grow and sell their own product from seed to sale Doctors can recommend but not prescribe it to treat a limited set of conditions including cancer multiple sclerosis and AIDS Though federal law still prohibits the sale and possession of marijuana the Justice Department advised its prosecutors in 2013 that if state laws to legalize the substance properly limited its spread and if companies complied with state laws they should not be prosecutedBecause banks and creditcard companies are federally regulated the purchase and sale of cannabis has so far been a cash business New Yorks health commissioner will set the price of the drug probably based on the street valueNew Yorks law is among the most restrictive to be passed by the 23 states that have legalized marijuana use in some form The 20 dispensaries set to open in a state of nearly 20 million people are likely to be highvolume centers located away from schools or houses of worship where patients or caregivers with state identification cards can get up to a months supply of nonsmokable productThe emerging industry has drawn people from unlikely precincts Patrick McCarthy a lobbyist who spent the last three years pushing legalization for cannabis companies was once an aide to Gov George E Pataki and the executive director of the New York Republican State Committee Dean Petkanas who plans to seek a state license was a chief financial officer at Stratton Oakmont the pennystock boiler room operation depicted in The Wolf of Wall Street Mr Petkanas now runs a phytomedical company called KannaLife Sciences that hopes to get FDA approval of a cannabisbased treatment for two types of brain encephalopathy At the conference he wore a pinstripe threepiece suit and spoke in torrentsI did a lot of pharmaceutical work on Wall Street when I was in boutique investment banking he said skipping over his time at Stratton Oakmont I spent a lot of time in merchant banking I really dug in hard Shares of KannaLifes parent company Medical Marijuana Inc have fallen by more than half since earlier this yearThe competition to acquire the five available licenses will be fierce and expensive Application costs alone could run to several hundred thousand dollars startup costs could top 20 million I would suggest that anyone who wants to be serious be prepared to spend at least a million dollars on an application said Evan Nison 24 a lobbyist and consultant for cannabis companies and a founder of the New York Cannabis Alliance which advocates changing the states marijuana laws Richard N Gottfried a Democratic state assemblyman from Manhattan who led the long fight to legalize medical marijuana cited an unwritten formula of government regulation When you make a statute very restrictive  and the governor did that in the last hours  you raise the stakes and create a need for more lawyers and consultants he saidOutofstate firms able to show they have run successful cannabis operations elsewhere will have an edge in the licensing process But any hope for quick profits will be limited by the small number of conditions for which New York is allowing the drugs useStill the arrival of medical marijuana opens the door to a potentially huge market said Derek Peterson 40 a former senior vice president at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Mr Peterson now heads Terra Tech a publicly traded company that already operates a fiveacre hydroponic growing facility in New Jersey turning out basil kale and other produce while awaiting the opening of more local dispensaries which Gov Chris Christie opposesWe dont love the way the New York policy works but over time the legislation can change Mr Peterson said Even if you cant make a significant profit now you can invest in it for the future He compared New York to Nevada where Terra Tech had already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to apply for a license and hired Senator Harry Reids son Rory as a lobbyist The cost of applying in New York he said might run in the high six figures Cannabis industry cash has begun to flow into New York Ms Savino said her campaign donations from outofstate growers were around 10000 or 15000  not muchThe amount of money at stake has attracted investors from across the spectrum from Wall Street to High Times magazine the 40yearold counterculture survivor that earlier this year announced that it planned to create a private equity High Times Growth Fund to invest in the cannabis businessesUnions have also claimed a share In New York all licensees will be union shops a result of two years of lobbying by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union which has also been successful in other states Cannabis is a rare growth sector for organized labor We saw around the country that these jobs had the potential to be real middleclass jobs if the workers were organized said Ed Draves a lobbyist with Bolton St Johns who led the push for the union Here in New York you saw the home health care industry develop where a lot of the workers were health care workers who couldnt attain health care or pension benefits We didnt want to see that as we developed this industryFor investors the business strikes a familiar chord with the potential for huge growth and high risk There are a lot of parallels that I draw to what happened in the technology space in the late 90s and early 2000s said Al Foreman a former managing director of JP Morgans growth equity fund Highbridge Principal Strategies Since leaving Wall Street last December Mr Foreman helped start a private equity group called Tuatara Capital that plans to invest in cannabis industries across the Americas For lack of another term Mr Foreman said its a new frontierTuatara has not yet started raising money and Mr Foreman declined to say how much it hopes to amass But he said there was already interest among investors And he added the nascent cannabis industry is ahead of where the technology sector was 20 years agoBecause people have been buying marijuana for years he said its a more easily identifiable consumer base than what you might have seen in the early days of the Internet when people were still trying to figure out how to get paying customers Were talking about an industry with real assets and markets where there is existing demandMr Foreman noted that the cultural gap between Wall Street and the purveyors of products like Ghost Train Haze and Holy Grail Kush is not what it once was Money changes everything When I took a trip to Denver to walk the halls and the plants and the factories you realize that these are not kids in the basement he said The stereotype is shattered by the level of professionalism Some of these companies will grow into really large companiesHigh Times hopes to grow with them said Michael Kennedy its controlling owner Mr Kennedy a criminal lawyer who at the magazines inception represented its founder in an investigation into smuggling charges said High Times was close to launching its private equity fund with two partners  so close that he would not discuss previously disclosed details for fear of violating government rules against soliciting business ahead of a launch An interview with Mr Kennedy published by Bloomberg Businessweek in June cited a target of 300 million for the fundOn a recent day Malcolm MacKinnon the magazines silverhaired editor presided over a staff of more than two dozen with ages ranging from their 20s to their 60s as they worked quietly on the February issue the cover story a showdown between cannabis sativa and cannabis indica Professionally Mr MacKinnon uses the pseudonym Dan Skye an artifact from less cannabisfriendly times when he was raising children and coaching Little LeagueWith its runofthemill cubicles the office felt more like the law firm that shares space with the magazine than the partying High Times suggested by its pages Asked whether the staff smoked in the office Mr MacKinnon replied with a note of sarcasm Gee we wouldnt do that because its illegalThe private equity fund continues the magazines efforts to merge with the mainstream These days High Times organizes a sprawling trade show and smokeoff called the Cannabis Cup Once limited to a single annual event in Amsterdam where competitors vied to provide the most potent herb the Cannabis Cup is now a domestic affair that draws tens of thousands of attendees to multiple locations Versions were held in five cities in the United States this year with speakers and vendors of everything a contemporary cannabis consumer might fancy except in some places cannabisHigh Times is now a legacy business with four decades of experience in a field many are just entering Mr MacKinnon saidEverybody wants to talk to us nowThat group may include people like Ari Hoffnung 40 who hopes to get one of the New York licenses He named his fledgling company Fiorello Pharmaceuticals Inc in tribute to New York mayor Fiorello H LaGuardia who opposed the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 when the substance was still legal For now Mr Hoffnung has formed an investor group while seeking to forge partnerships with companies that have grown and dispensed marijuana in other statesMr Hoffnung is a former managing director at Bear Stearns and was a deputy comptroller when John C Liu served as the city comptroller He said he became interested in medical marijuana after seeing folks in my family with ALS and other conditions where cannabis has been proven helpful to relieve pain and sufferingBut he had another interest in legal cannabis While working for Mr Liu he took part in a study that asked how many city residents might benefit from the legalization of marijuana and how much money the city might reap The numbers were big 100000 patients for medical cannabis and tax revenue of 400 million if recreational use were legalizedThe figures Mr Hoffnung acknowledged will not be realized until well into the future if ever But the current regulatory conditions with each state setting its own laws and no distribution across state lines might be an advantage for smaller companies like hisNo major companies want to create a business model and have to replicate it in 23 states he said That doesnt allow economies of scaleThat could change especially as businesses press state and federal legislators harder In New York the public is already on board said Mr McCarthy the lobbyist citing polls that show support for medical marijuana at 83 percent in the state up from just 58 percent a few years ago The support he said is widespread Theres no drop off from a senior in Buffalo to an independent soccer mom in SuffolkIn the meantime at the Cannabis and Hemp Association meeting the aspiring moguls had a regulatory request for Ms Savino They wanted more regulation not less Specifically Mr Giannotti worried about overthecounter remedies being sold as nonpsychoactive hemp oil or CBD oil CBD or cannabidiol is one of the active ingredients in cannabis Such products are largely unregulated and sell for as much as hundreds of dollars for a small amount The attendees worried that such companies might taint the industry Could the state crack down on themMs Savino pulled a bottle of something called Green Cures CBD Oil from her purse eying it skeptically People believe what they want to believe she said Its hard to protect people from what they think will helpMr Maryasis said he hoped the overthecounter products which were plentiful at the recent trade show were not a sign of things to come especially before regulated medical marijuana becomes availableThis sets a bad standard for the industry he said We want to lead with genuineness and not just opportunismHe added If we do this right we can be an example to the nation We dont have to be the first ones to legalize it We just have to do it right,2014-11-02T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/us/dry-california-fights-illegal-use-of-water-for-cannabis.html,NICE Calif   An abandoned recreational vehicle was the first clue In this hamlet two hours north of San Francisco and barely a mile from the largest natural freshwater lake in the state the trailer sat on a hill hidden from the main drag Behind it rose a flimsy fence tall enough to shield its bounty 50 marijuana plants in hastily constructed wooden boxesThis is common said Michael Lockett the chief building official here in Lake County giving a tour of the nowderelict plot where a pipe ran from a stream to a large water tankIt was just one of hundreds of illegal marijuana operations in Lake County officials said some of which have been diverting water for thousands of plantsThe scene has been repeated across Northern California Amid the states crippling drought many communities are fighting not the mere cultivation of cannabis  which is legal in the state though subject to myriad restrictions  but the growers use of water Marijuana is a thirsty plant and cultivating it at a time when California residents are subject to water restrictions has become a sticky issueWhen a statewide drought emergency was declared in January the first thing we wanted to address was water theft and marijuana said Carre Brown a supervisor in Mendocino County a major cannabis hub west of Lake CountyBy midJuly the sheriff there Thomas D Allman had already caught growers siphoning water from springs because wells had run dry too early in the season I have told my marijuana team I want you to fly the rivers fly the tributaries lets prioritize the water diversion Sheriff Allman saidIn July Lake County enacted an ordinance that demanded that growers account for their water supply as in Mendocino the county also has a tip line to identify violators Its very pointedly meant to stop a lot of what were seeing  the illegal diversions damming up of creeks tapping into springs that may be on someone elses property said Kevin Ingram the principal planner for Lake CountyLate last month federal and state agents raided the Yurok Indian Reservation in a move requested by tribal elders to halt illegal marijuana farms whose water use threatened the reservations supplyUsing Google Earth imagery the state Department of Fish and Wildlife has estimated that outdoor marijuana cultivation in Mendocino County and Humboldt County doubled between 2009 and 2012 with what the agency described as disastrous effect A marijuana plant can consume five to 10 gallons of water depending on the point in its growth cycle By comparison a head of lettuce another of Californias major crops needs about 35 gallons of waterNot all marijuana growers are cavalier about their water use Swami Chaitanya 71 has been tending  and smoking  cannabis for decades I grew my first plants in the shadow of the Bank of America in San Francisco on Telegraph Hill in the early 70s Mr Chaitanya said He adopted the name Swami Chaitanya after studies in India and prefers it to his given name which he asked not to useNow ensconced in an offthegrid farm in Mendocino County Mr Chaitanya and a few helpers produce a small crop of medical marijuana plants for an Oakland dispensary Their beds are watered daily from tanks fed by a spring on the property To minimize the environmental impact he said he recycles his wastewater This year he has also reduced the number of plants he saidMost people we know are saying Were growing less because of impending drought Mr Chaitanya said We have a responsibilityEnvironmentally minded marijuana growers say that illegal operators and water guzzlers are giving them a bad reputation Seth Little 28 an organic medicinal marijuana grower near the Lake County town of Clearlake said neighbors could be resentful They just think that were all kind of dooming everything he said and stealing everybodys water and dumping chemicals into the aquifersMr Little who has been growing marijuana for nearly five years with a special irrigation system designed to minimize water use said many fellow growers had been heedless of the water problem A large percentage of them are just really not environmentally aware theyre not in compliance he saidBut the artisanal ways of Mr Little and Mr Chaitanya can conflict with the demands of the market and sometimes the law Because there are countywide restrictions on the number of marijuana plants even legitimate growers may keep Mr Chaitanya said they have an incentive to make those plants as robust as possible  and that means using more water Mr Chaitanya suggested that the problem was exacerbated by confusing regulationsSheriff Allman of Mendocino County was skeptical of this That sounds like logic theyve made up after smoking a joint he observedBut he added the environmental offenders are not the stereotypical marijuana growerOld hippies are not our problem  old hippies get it Sheriff Allman said Theyre going organic theyre doing water reduction So are young hippies he continuedIm talking about people that move here in April grow marijuana as fast as they can until October Sheriff Allman said The 20yearold kid who wants to make his million bucks and hes using these steroid fertilizers He doesnt care about how much water he uses or what he puts in the

surpassesthat of any other nation that the country has very harsh sentencing laws for minor offenses and that as many argue the inherent racial bias in the system is powerful and detrimental to societyIts an issue that as Inimai Chettiar and Abigail Finkelman of the Brennan Center for Justice put at The Daily Beastseems ripe for genuine bipartisan cooperation However they say the debate wasabsent from the 2014 campaign trail perhaps because it was less controversial or because candidates feared being seen as soft on crime This silence creates the risk that a moment of promise will become a missed opportunity for changeBut even though candidates avoided any national discussion of the pressing issue some ballot initiatives could yet influence the criminal justice systemVoters in

billionaire that they were surprised at the number of people asking them why as Republicans were they working to change our criminal justice system Why wouldnt we Mr Rand and Mr Hughes say that the system must be changed because it drains tax dollars destabilizes families and worse isnt making us any saferUsing similar language of the fiscally conservative Newt Gingrich the former Republican speaker of the House also came out supporting the measureandalso writing with Mr HughesReducing wasteful corrections spending and practices is long overdue in California Mr Gingrich and Mr Hughes write pointing out that while the crime rates are similar the number of inmates is five times larger than it was 50 years ago And as Californians know the states prison system ballooned over the last few decades and became so crowded that federal judges have mandated significant reductionsComing out against the proposition were representatives of Californias law enforcement and voices from both sides of the aisleWriting for Fox News WilliamWhalen a research fellow at the Hoover Institution calls the early release initiative a roll of dice meets ticking time bombReferring to the existing

stealing a firearm worth less than 950 would be for instance classified as a misdemeanor She writes that the measure would ultimately lead to the release of thousands of dangerous criminals and a

only proposition to pass that ostensibly veers away from the tough on crime stance Nicole Flatow at Think Progress writes that by supporting these ballots voters sent a signal that they were ready to reform the systemAs part of a larger bipartisan push voters inNew Jersey supported a bail reformthat would ensure that who was kept behind bars depended on the severity of their crime and not their incomeWashington DC Oregon and Alaska voted to legalize the recreational use of marijuana which could lead to fewer people in the countrys overcrowded prisons Ms Flatow points out that the messages of support for these measures were entirely different in libertarian Alaska the message focused on the relative safety of marijuana abuse while in Washington the vote depended on a significant population of very liberal gentrifiers mixed with longtime AfricanAmerican residents who are sick and tired of criminal justice policies that arrest AfricanAmericans for pot at eight times the rate of whitesIt seems that despite political apathy and partisan polarization it is possible for Americans to agree on a big issue even if for different reasons,2014-11-06T09:43:30Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/opinion/from-marijuana-to-gun-control-liberal-initiatives-passed.html,The Democratic brand did not fare well to put it mildly in congressional and governors races on Tuesday Most were contests of political blame driven by ideological hatred for President Obama But when the ballot offered a choice on an actual policy rather than between candidates with a D or R next to their names voters made notably liberal decisions in both red and blue statesOn at least six highprofile and often contentious issues  minimum wage marijuana legalization criminal justice reform abortion rights gun control and environmental protection  voters approved ballot measures in some cases overwhelmingly that were directly at odds with the positions of many of the Republican winnersMINIMUM WAGE Initiatives to raise the minimum wage appeared on the ballots in four deepred states  Alaska Arkansas Nebraska and South Dakota  and passed in all of them The new hourly minimums range from 850 in Arkansas by 2017 to 975 in Alaska by 2016 Minimumwage increases were also approved in San Francisco to 15 an hour by 2018 and Oakland to 1225 an hour by 2015 In all an estimated 609000 lowwage workers will see raises from these approved increasesIn addition voters in Illinois and in several cities and counties in Wisconsin approved nonbinding measures calling for minimums of 10 or more If legislators follow through on the voters will 11 million workers in those states would see raisesThe latest increases bring to 29 the number of states that exceed or soon will exceed the paltry federal minimum of 725 an hour which has been in place since 2009 They underscore the broad support for higher minimums and suggest that Republicans who continue to oppose a higher federal minimum could pay a price in the 2016 elections when lowerwage workers and those who support them could turn out in higher numbersMARIJUANA  Oregon and Alaska became the third and fourth states to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes Colorado and Washington were the first two while the District of Columbia repealed all criminal and civil penalties for possession and allowed limited private cultivation of the drugEven where prolegalization measures lost advocates had reason to feel positive A proposed constitutional amendment in Florida to legalize medical marijuana received 57 percent of the vote but it still failed because amendments there require at least 60 percent approvalBefore Tuesdays election it was already clear that Americans had turned against prohibition because more than 30 states had liberalized their marijuana laws Maybe elected officials who have lagged behind the public on this issue will finally have the courage to embrace changeCRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM For the second time in three years Californians voted to shorten the sentences of people serving time in prison The state  which created the notorious threestrikes law  remains under federal court order to reduce prison overcrowdingIn 2012 voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 36 which has led to the early release of more than 1900 threestrikers serving life in prison And there has not been an increase in crime Proposition 47 on this weeks ballot converts lowlevel drug and property offenses  like shoplifting writing bad checks or simple drug possession  from felonies to misdemeanors It is expected to reduce the sentences of as many as 10000 inmatesOn Tuesday the measure which enjoyed broad bipartisan support passed with more than 58 percent of the vote Many politicians are still afraid of looking soft on crime but Californias experience shows that voters can lead the wayABORTION RIGHTS The overwhelming rejection of personhood measures in Colorado and North Dakota dealt another welldeserved blow to the effort by some opponents of reproductive rights to ban all abortions and some common forms of contraception by passing laws giving fertilized eggs legal rights and protections that apply to individualsThe defeat in Colorado was not unexpected Voters there handily quashed earlier personhood initiatives in 2008 and 2010 and they were not deceived by this rounds revised wording But few expected a similar proposal to be rejected by 64 percent of voters in North Dakota a conservative state that  like Mississippi which roundly defeated a personhood initiative three years ago  has just one abortion provider remainingUnfortunately opponents of abortion rights scored a victory in Tennessee where nearly 53 percent of voters approved a state constitutional amendment that gives the Republicanled State Legislature leeway to curtail access to safe and legal abortion care While nothing will change immediately there will likely be a rush to enact new abortion restrictions beyond those already in place in the months ahead But politicians in Tennessee would be wrong to read Tuesdays relatively close vote as a mandate to obliterate a womans fundamental rightGUN CONTROL In the aftermath of the school massacre in 2012 in Newtown Conn Congress  caving to the National Rifle Association  did nothing to protect the public from gun violence In Washington State a campaign started by outraged church and community leaders fared much better Initiative 594 which will require criminal and mentalhealth checks on gun buyers drew an impressive 60 percent voter support on TuesdayJust as important the gun lobbys measure  Initiative 591 which was on the same ballot  would have blocked background checks and was defeated by 55 percent of the vote Other campaigns are underway at the statehouse level supported by former New York City mayor Michael Bloombergs wellfinanced gunsafety movement and others Opponents decried Mr Bloombergs campaign as outside interference but got nowhere this timeCONSERVATION Environmentalists who may be singing the blues over the election results can take heart from approval of a record 13 billion in land

20 years to preserving open spaces including major investments in the threatened EvergladesNew Jersey voters dedicated 215 billion in corporate tax revenue to land conservation also over the next 20

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/29/us/ap-us-rethinking-pot-political-money.html,DENVER   The entrepreneurs of the young US marijuana industry are taking another step into the mainstream becoming political donors who use some of their profits to support cannabisfriendly candidates and ballot questions that could bring legal pot to more statesThe political activity includes swanky fundraisers at Four Seasons hotels and art auctions at law firms And members of Congress who once politely returned the industrys contribution checks are now keeping themWere developing an industry here from the ground up If we dont contribute politically and get out there with the candidates we cant help shape what happens said Patrick McManamon head of Clevelandbased Cannasure Insurance Services which offers insurance to marijuana growers and dispensariesMedical marijuana businesses have been giving to candidates since the late 1990s With the arrival of recreational pot in Colorado and Washington the industry and its political influence are expanding rapidlyPot is now legal for medical or recreational purposes in 23 states and Washington DC More marijuana measures will be on the November ballot in Oregon Florida Alaska and the nations capital so many contributions are being funneled into those campaigns and the candidates who support themCompared with the donations of other industries or advocacy groups the political spending by marijuana businesses is modest But said Tripp Keber head of Denverbased Dixie Elixirs  Edibles which makes potinfused soda food and lotion the word is out that the marijuana industry has money to giveKeber attended a summer fundraiser for Colorado Gov John Hickenlooper who opposed legalization in 2012 but has promised to regulate the industry according to voters wishesIt was interesting to see how hes starting to evolve I said Im telling you I can get 100 people in the room who would be happy to max out or give the states maximum legal donation of 1100 Keber saidA few weeks later in August Keber threw a fundraiser at the Four Seasons in Denver with a goal of raising 16000 for Hickenlooper The event netted 40000In Washington state the industrys contributions are channeled into reforms that include reducing the tax rate on pot and kicking some marijuana revenue back to cities and counties to encourage more communities to allow dispensaries said dispensary owner John Davis who also serves as director of the Coalition for Cannabis Standards and EthicsNot long ago most marijuana entrepreneurs were trying to scrape a few dollars together to get started Keber said Now this industry is becoming profitable and were taking that profit and investing it politically There isnt a week that goes by where we dont make a political donationThe Oregon ballot measure has raised about 23 million A medicalmarijuana question in Florida has attracted nearly 6 million And the Alaska campaign has brought in about 850000 A recreational pot measure in Washington DC attracted few donations perhaps because it appears almost certain to passColorados congressional delegation alone has received some 20000 this year from the marijuana industry according to federal campaignfinance data The true figure is probably much higher because many donors do not mention the drug in campaignfinance disclosuresThe largest federal spender on marijuana advocacy is the Marijuana Policy Project which plans to donate 150000 to federal candidates this year up from 110000 in 2013 The Drug Policy Alliance and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws have also given directly to federal candidates and taxexempt industry groups such as the National Cannabis Industry Association can spend an unlimited amount of untracked moneyPoliticians who used to reject checks from promarijuana donors arent doing that anymore said Ethan Nadelmann head of the New Yorkbased Drug Policy AllianceStill the same candidates who cash the checks arent always keen to talk about it About a dozen recipients of marijuana money declined interview requests or did not return calls from The Associated PressA Colorado state lawmaker who accepts marijuanaindustry donations conceded thinking twice before taking themI always worry about what peoples perceptions will be said Rep Jonathan Singer a Democrat who is the only sitting

that the images be taken downThey just didnt want to be seen They were still taking the money said Mitchem who declined to name the lawmakerThe only member of Congress who responded to the AP was

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/opinion/sunday/of-pot-and-percocet.html,PRESCRIPTION opioid painkillers like Percocet Vicodin and OxyContin have come under intense scrutiny in recent years because of the drastic rise in overdose deaths associated with their prolonged use Meanwhile access to medical marijuana has been expanding  23 states and the District of Columbia have legalized its broad medical use  and chronic or severe pain is by far the most common condition reported among people using itCould the availability of medical marijuana reduce the hazards of prescription painkillers If enough people opt to treat pain with medical marijuana instead of prescription painkillers in states where this is legal it stands to reason that states with medical marijuana laws might experience an overall decrease in opioid painkiller overdoses and deathsTo find out if this has actually happened we and our colleagues Brendan Saloner and Chinazo Cunningham studied opioid overdose deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2010 Our findings which were published on Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine suggest that this unexpected benefit of medical marijuana laws does existPinpointing the effect of laws on health is notoriously difficult For one thing states that have passed medical marijuana laws are no doubt different in important ways from states that have not passed such laws Differences in say social attitudes about drug use or overall health trends might affect rates of opioid painkiller deaths independent of whether medical marijuana is legalFurthermore from 1999 to 2010 the period of time we studied states implemented various measures in response to the threat of opioid painkiller overdoses including central registries of controlled substance prescriptions laws allowing pharmacists to request identification before filling a prescription and laws increasing oversight of pain management clinics These measures too might affect rates of opioid painkiller deaths regardless of the legality of medical marijuanaWe designed our study to allow us to compare statelevel rates of opioid painkiller overdose deaths before and after the passage of medical marijuana laws while controlling for these and other concurrent state and national trendsUsing death certificates compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention we found that the rate of prescription painkiller overdose deaths increased in all states from 1999 to 2010 But we also found that implementation of a medical marijuana law was associated with a 25 percent lower yearly rate of opioid painkiller overdose deaths on average In absolute terms we estimated that states with a medical marijuana law had a total of about 1700 fewer opioid painkiller overdose deaths in 2010 than would be expected based on trends before the laws were passedThis is the first study that we know of to suggest that medical marijuana laws could contribute to a decline in drug overdose deaths and therefore it should be read with caution Our study was not a controlled experiment and it is possible that states with and without medical marijuana laws differed over time in important ways that we did not or cannot measure and that could explain at least in part our resultsHowever if medical marijuana laws are in fact reducing opioid overdose deaths the next step is to figure out how and why That people are replacing opioid painkillers in part or entirely with medical marijuana for chronic pain treatment is one possibility Another possibility is that the availability of medical marijuana is changing the behavior of people who are addicted to and abuse or misuse opioids We know that marijuana and opioids stimulate a common receptor in the brains reward pathways but we dont know whether people who misuse or abuse opioids for recreational purposes would switch to marijuana in states where it is legal for medical purposesWe hope the results of our study will spur further scientific investigation into the effects of these laws as well as the ways in which medical marijuana can and should be used in clinical practice,2014-08-31T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/11/02/us/politics/ap-us-medical-marijuana-seniors.html,PEMBROKE PINES Fla   The debate over legalizing medical marijuana in Florida constantly generates talk of young people potentially flooding the polls But seniors are the most reliable voters and could be key to the outcome of the measureThough polling on Amendment 2 has been erratic seniors have been showing a level of interest in the initiative that underscores the fact they may benefit most from its passageYou get older you get sick you start getting diseases your bones stop working as well as they used to and youre presented with this pharmacopoeia of different drugs that you have to take just to get through the day said Ben Pollara who leads United for Care the proAmendment 2 campaign To the extent that seniors can use marijuana to supplement or replace any of those drugs I think is a good thingSimilar arguments have been made by older people themselves who have turned up at events across the state even when theyve been intended for more youthful crowds Such was the case at a recent forum at Broward College It was held at an oncampus theater with a promise of pizza for the droves of young people who passed by But inside the audience was full of faces far older than expectedAmong those who attended was MJ Seide of Hollywood who pays about 450 for an ounce of marijuana every six weeks to help her avoid painkillers that left her incapacitated and worried about addiction She begins to explain her congenital disease countless surgeries and the pills doctors pumped her full of when her phone brings things to a pauseMy stuff is in she says before adding At 64 Im a criminal because I have to buy this stuff on the streetAround the state similar voices have sounded from seniors who say theyve used marijuana for everything from easing pain to helping them to sleep If they end up being representative of the overall population of older voters it would delight supporters of Amendment 2 which requires 60 percent approval to pass To obtain marijuana patients would have to get a doctors certification of their condition which in turn would qualify them for a patient ID card they can use at licensed dispensariesIn Florida and across the US a greater percentage of seniors vote than any other age group and their share of the total electorate is even more pronounced in years without a presidential contest In the last midterm election in 2010 about 56 percent of Floridians 65 and older voted far higher than any other age group They represented nearly onethird of the total ballots castOverall public opinion on marijuana has been shifting nationally and medical use enjoys far broader support than recreational use though polls on Amendment 2 have varied widelyA July survey by Quinnipiac University found 83 percent of Florida voters aged 65 and older supported medicinal marijuana An October poll by the University of Florida found about 37 percent of voters 60 and older support Amendment 2 Experts agree seniors show less support than younger voters and most observers believe senior support is somewhere in the middle of those two surveysThe seniors to a degree are being targeted in that this is a wonderful thing for them because they dont have to use opiates etcetera etcetera said Jessica Spencer who is leading the Vote No on 2 group and who says seniors who read the amendment are becoming aware it is riddled with holes Seniors are of course interested in protecting our younger generationsSupporters of Amendment 2 have far outnumbered opponents at forums But Spencer says she has found a sympathetic ear in seniors around the state who worry what its passage could meanSandi Trusso 73 of Ocala has been opposed to marijuana for decades since her 28yearold brother was killed by a driver who was drunk and high She believes many of Amendment 2s younger supporters see it as a gateway to legalized recreational marijuana or that medical permits will be so easy to obtain anyone can get themIf someones severely ill and they could control that to limit it to that and we knew that they could control that who would have a problem with that she askedSteve DeAngelo the executive director of Harborside Health Center a notforprofit marijuana dispensary in California says a reefer madness mentality is common among older people who initially bypassed his clinic He launched an outreach program to seniors and they now account for about a quarter of Harborsides clients Most opt against smoking instead using capsules lozenges drinks foods lotions face masks and all sorts of other products infused with cannabis and he says hes seen incredible turnarounds among seniors who were previously taking numerous other prescription drugsOne of the reasons that you see the high poll numbers that you do he said is seniors are sick and tired of taking pharmaceuticals that have a list of side effects that look like something out of a Stephen King novelThe most ardent supporters of medical marijuana say it hasnt just cut out other drugs side effects but has relieved symptoms in ways those drugs couldnt Beth Ann Krug 61 of Delray Beach traveled to Colorado earlier this year to see if marijuana could help her Parkinsons disease She was amazed Within 20 minutes she said her tremors were gone for the first time in years She has not used marijuana since because she refuses to get it illegally and worries her fulltime volunteer position would be jeopardized because they do drug testing She doesnt understand the scare tactics that opponents have usedWeve taken something and were making it be something evil when its something very very very good she said___Associated Press writer Jennifer Agiesta in Washington contributed to

refuses to exaggerate its dangers You cant get the toothpaste back in the tube he said So now were finding ways to reduce harm and continue on forward He wants marijuana taxes to be earmarked for

Colorado University has had to live down a reputation as a party school locals call it Wasted State and officials there do not think legal marijuana is going to help The dean of students Gary Pierson

editorialized for or against Amendment 64 He couldnt remember We have other issues Its a small town the economys always kind of limping along The environmental issues are always a pressing concern The status of our local education institutions Those are the things that impact peoples livesGeorge Sibley a writer who came to the Gunnison Valley in the 1960s said the key to grasping local politics in the Mountain West is knowing your altitude Above 8000 feet its almost always Democrat and downvalley its almost always Republican he said Downvalley its more agricultural selfreliant Jeffersoniantype Republicanism But upvalley it was miners originally and union people and then it became posturban liberals with urban backgroundsBy this theory Crested Butte at 8885 feet breathes solidly liberal air Gunnison at 7703 feet is more in the zone of political flux Mr Sibley said he expected legalization to win which suited him fine But he said there was a silent faction in town how big he wasnt sure that would vote against marijuana shops simply to preserve the status quoI actually think itll be slow Mr Sibley said But life will not be very much different There will be a significant new tax

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/12/world/europe/12reuters-italy-marijuana.html,ROVIGO Italy Reuters  Italy legalized marijuana for medical use last year but the high cost of buying legal pot in a pharmacy meant few people signed up Now the government has found a solution get the army to grow itStarting next year a highsecurity lab in a military compound in Florence will grow cannabis for Italys health care system in an experiment the government says could bring safe legal and affordable marijuana to suffering patientsThe new army supply should allow the government to lower the price for consumers who now have to pay up to 10 times as much at a pharmacy for marijuana officially imported from Holland as they might for a bag on the street from a local drug dealerRegional health authorities are expected to offer it to qualified patients cheaply or for free helping to put mafialinked drug dealers out of business But whether large numbers sign up will depend on cultural factors in a Catholic country with an historic stigma against drugsAbout 60 km 40 miles from Venice Italys top cannabis expert agricultural scientist Gianpaolo Grassi is trying to grow the perfect pot plant on his 70hectare research farm the only place in the country authorized to grow marijuana outdoors with more than 02 percent of the psyochactive chemical THCHis breeds also blooming indoors under powerful lamps and behind armored doors are expected to be grown in the Florence military lab which already produces socalled orphan drugs to treat rare diseasesThe powerful odor from flowers in full bloom permeates the air at Grassis farm A 10foot high barbed wirecrowned fence surrounds the fields and video cameras peer along the perimeter The sophisticated system was installed a few years ago to keep out thieves who raided the farm and slashed the walls of the greenhouses to steal the plants All kids chuckles GrassiUntil the 1960s this was hemp country where a variant of cannabis was grown for centuries to make rope cloth and paperThe 57yearold researcher fondly recalls the hemp fields of his youth Later as a scientist he became fascinated with the versatility of the plantSince 2002 Grassi has experimented with about 330 different strains of medicalgrade cannabis which for millennia was used to treat pain and illness until being outlawed in most of the world in the 20th centuryFor now the military pot plan is still defined as a pilot project with details on who will qualify for treatment still to be definedItalian officials have made very clear that they dont plan to follow in the footsteps of the United States where medical marijuana laws have been followed by fullblown legalization of pot in some states including for recreational useItaly wants to make sure that curing sick people does not become an excuse to expand the use of the substance said Senator Carlo Giovanardi an outspoken Catholic antidrug campaigner Legalisation he added would lead to a society of zombiesFREE POTBecause of the bureaucracy of obtaining import permission ensuring purity and overseeing sale legal cannabis from Holland now costs about 38 euros a gram in Italian pharmacies compared to as low as 5 euros for illegal pot on the streetEven when a doctor prescribes it the state does not cover the cost which could run to around 1000 euros 1200 a month for a typical patient As a result when legalized medical marijuana arrived last year only a few dozen people signed upHealth Minister Beatrice Lorenzin said that should change once the military production begins The army should be able to produce marijuana at a high enough standard to satisfy regulators for less than half the cost of importing it allowing the government to offer it to patients at subsidized pricesAt a news conference last month announcing the army project the minister said it would be up to Italys regional governments which manage the federal healthcare system to decide how much to charge patients So far about half of Italys 20 regions have pledged to provide it for freeThere are no official estimates of how many people may end up taking medical marijuana in Italy once it becomes free or cheap enough to compete with illegal pot If everyone who could benefit from it signed up the number could be in the millions according to Grassi the researcherYet some arent so sure that the stigma of taking a drug has worn off Francesco Crestani an anaesthesiologist and president of Italys Association for Therapeutic Cannabis predicts the takers to be in the thousands because of caution within the medical community and because marijuana is generally prescribed only after a patient fails to respond to other medicinesMedical marijuana is a controversial idea in a country where the Catholic Church has powerful influence and preaches against drugs Only in recent years for example have doctors warmed to prescribing opiates and Italy still uses fewer opiatebased drugs than most European countriesCannabis is a very effective medicine but since its also a drug theres always fear to use it said Umberto Veronesi a former health minister and one of Italys top cancer physicians The same thing happened with morphine which for years no one would prescribe for the poor patients who were suffering terriblyLaws against marijuana in Italy are severe with selling or growing it a crime that could lead to imprisonment Pope Francis has spoken out against every type of drug use including potLOGICAL SOLUTIONGrassi the agricultural expert said putting marijuana production under military security was a logical solution to the political problem Some political decisions are tied to countrys Catholic mentality This solution makes growing medical cannabis agreeable for everyoneHis work should benefit people like 36yearold clothing designer Elisa Bertero who has a prescription to take medical marijuana to relieve her fibromyalgia a syndrome that causes bodywide pain in joints muscles and tendonsBertero said she tried many medicines to seek to alleviate her pain when the condition began four years ago None worked So after doing online research she tried cannabis on her own as an experiment and it was so effective she never stoppedBut Bertero said she then ran into resistance by some 10 doctors who were unwilling to prescribe marijuana even though it was legal as of last year Eventually she went to anaesthesiologist Crestani who examined her listened to her story and prescribed cannabisFor a long time I took it every day It was the only thing that allowed me to get out of bed in the morning said Bertero She now takes it only a few days a week making marijuana tea in the morning or inhaling with a vaporizer in the eveningBertero says that while cannabis makes her feel happy and light it does not get in the way of her work measuring cutting and sewing garments Sometimes she even pays the official cost of 38 euros per gram even though it is so much cheaper on the streetWhen I have the money I buy it from the pharmacy Bertero says But since Im not a millionaire I often arrange to buy it for 5 euros a gramEditing by Alessandra Galloni and Peter

it was so advanced that all he could do was to try to live out the remainder of his life in as little pain and discomfort as possible That meant taking about 30 pills a day Mr Fortune said  until his brother tried marijuanaI saw him go from 30 pills a day to almost zero he said It helped his appetite and the nausea He had a way better quality of life at the end than he would have without the cannabis It made me a proponent of the industryIt also gave Mr Fortune the idea for a business With more states legalizing marijuana for medical uses  and in Colorado and Washington recreational ones  Mr Fortune identified one of the industrys challenges packaging The old standby the resealable plastic bag was not sufficiently effective especially for a regulated industry and Mr Fortune already owned OdorNo a company that made odorproof bags for human and animal wasteMr Fortune proposed a new product odorproof and childresistant marijuana bags to OdorNos advisory board He expected the members to laugh him out of the room but they did not Every single one of them told me This is the biggest opportunity on the planet right now Follow thatIn May he licensed out production and distribution of OdorNo and he and his team began building FunkSac in Denver Although FunkSac bags are awaiting government approval Mr Fortune said he had hundreds of thousands of orders from cultivators dispensaries and wholesalers The company plans to begin delivering them this month and estimates it will have firstyear revenue of about 2 millionMr Fortune said he had been contacted by dispensaries in 17 of the 22 states where medical marijuana was legal Right now he said its like drinking from a fire hoseTo many todays cannabis industry resembles a modernday Gold Rush Troy Dayton cofounder and chief executive of the ArcView Group in San Francisco a network of 250 highnetworth investors that backs cannabis startups said more than 30 earlystage companies contact it every week In the last year he said the group sent about 12 million in funding to 14 companiesThe size of the legal cannabis industry in the United States measured by sales of the plant was 15 billion in 2013 according to ArcView which projects it will reach 26 billion in 2014 and 10 billion by 2018  figures that do not include the growing numbers of ancillary businesses The entire industry is dominated by small businesses Mr Dayton said both because it is so new and because marijuanas legality remains murky Banks for example have been reluctant to take deposits or make loans to dispensaries because the drug is still illegal under federal lawYou cant have a national business Mr Dayton said because the laws vary by state Opportunities for small businesses also exist because the stigma associated with the industry has discouraged bigger companies from getting involved You cant find another industry growing at this clip that doesnt have any major players he said That gives the little guy a chance to make a run at thisThat potential has spawned a wide array of cannabis startups  many incorporating novel technologies Potbotics in New York City has raised almost 3 million from friends and family and has three cannabisrelated products in the works including a virtual budtender known as Potbot that it expects to be available for sale next year A budtender is a dispensary worker who is knowledgeable about and sells marijuana Potbot is a robot with a tabletsize monitor that is meant to replace the budtenderThe plan is to place Potbot robots in dispensaries and medical facilities where marijuana patients can ask questions and get information Dispensary budtenders almost always have an agenda  they are trying to sell what they have most in their stock said David Goldstein a founder of the company which was started in October We created a software and technology platform that is able to talk to patients and educate them about what strains are actually best for their ailmentsA San Diego startup Herbalizer makes a small sleek vaporizer with a heating system that took three years and two engineers to develop Its cofounder and chief executive Josh Young previously designed advanced NASA computer systems and military programs Bob Pratt a cofounder and the chief technology officer was a designer of stealth bomber radar systems And yet Mr Young said the technology behind the Herbalizer has been the greatest challenge of our livesThe vaporizer heats up in seconds and uses a 32megahertz processor a 300watt halogen bulb and a temperature sensor to release active compounds in the plant selectively without creating smoke Ninety percent of Herbalizers customers use it for marijuana Mr Young said although drug paraphernalia laws prevent the device from being marketed for that purpose it is sold instead for use with herbs like peppermint and lavender The company expects firstyear revenue of more than 2 millionFundraising has been tricky for Herbalizer and similar companies Traditional investors remain leery said Christian Groh a partner and the chief operations officer at Privateer Holdings a private equity firm in Seattle that invests in cannabis startups In the US marijuana remains a Schedule I narcotic so you still have this outlaw mentality within the community he said I know theres a lot of exuberance now but I dont think were at the point where well see real institutional money or a Fortune 500 company making a play in this space Not yetIn 2011 Privateer bought Leafly a Seattle startup that provides consumer ratings and reviews of marijuana strains dispensaries and recreational shops Most dispensaries carry 20 to 50 strains Mr Groh said and the lack of standardization and consistency is a big issue Leafly has about 80000 reviews in its systemThat information has to come from the community right now because there is no WebMD for marijuana said Cy Scott one of Leaflys founders The company also offers tools for dispensaries that let them manage inventory update menus online and respond to reviews Dispensaries and recreational shops pay a monthly subscription fee of 200 to 2000 a month said Mr Scott who expects revenue this year of 36 millionSpeedWeed a Los Angeles delivery service allows customers to place an order online or by phone and have it delivered  depending on traffic  within 45 minutes Although there are hundreds

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/opinion/high-time-rules-for-the-marijuana-market.html,As voters and lawmakers in more states decide to legalize marijuana policy makers will have to answer a fresh and difficult question How should governments regulate the production and sale of the drugBeyond keeping marijuana out of the hands of minors a good regulatory system has to limit the increase in drug abuse that is likely to accompany lower prices and greater availability after legalization It should protect consumers from both dangerous and counterfeit products reducing the physical risk from a psychoactive substance And a wellregulated system should undermine and eventually eliminate the black market for marijuana which has done great damage to societyThe experiences of Colorado and Washington where sales of recreational marijuana started this year will prove instructive While there are important differences in their approaches both states have licensed businesses to grow process and sell marijuana while imposing strict rules and high taxes on them Other states that legalize will probably adopt a similar model because it resembles how the federal and state governments regulate tobacco and alcoholA Better Way to Tax Policy makers trying to regulate the drug will face challenges similar to the ones American lawmakers faced at the end of Prohibition in 1933 Like alcohol during Prohibition marijuana is widely available across the United States today But it will become much more accessible after legalization when businesses engaged in its production and sale no longer operate in the black market nor engage in violence The pretax price of the drug could fall by 90 percent after legalization according to Robert MacCoun a law professor at Stanford and fellow researchers Moreover marijuana businesses will have a financial incentive to get a broad population to use the drug regularly A recent report prepared for the Colorado Department of Revenue concluded that nearly 90 percent of the demand for marijuana in the state this year would come from only 30 percent of users those who use the drug 21 to 31 days a monthRegulators will have to design policies that allow licensed businesses to undercut the illegal market but keep prices high enough so dependence on the drug does not increase a lot One important way to curb use is to tax marijuana heavily following the postProhibition template of replacing criminalization with regulation and taxes Colorado and Washington have imposed high tax rates that are based on price much like existing sales taxes But Mark Kleiman a public policy professor at the University of California Los Angeles rightly warns that those taxes will lose their bite when prices inevitably decline as marijuana businesses become more efficient at production A better approach would be to tax the drug based on its potency  which can be measured in various ways including by the amount of the component THC in a batch  and increase the rate over time to keep up with inflationLawmakers should not repeat the mistakes they made on alcohol in recent years taxing it too lightly and allowing the industry to become highly concentrated Just two companies control about 75 percent of the American beer market today Federal excise taxes on alcohol are levied at fixed rates by volume there are different rates for liquor wine and beer For example the tax on a 31gallon barrel of beer is 18 or 5 cents per 12ounce can But those tax rates were last increased in 1991 even though the Consumer Price Index has increased 75 percent since then Most states have also kept their excise taxes steady in recent years in part because of the heavy lobbying and big money of the beverage industry The median state excise tax on beer is 20 cents per gallon or about 2 cents per 12ounce canStates with an existing medical marijuana market will also have to make sure that users are not abusing it to evade taxes In Colorado for example there are more than 111000 people with medical marijuana cards Those users can buy the drug at much lower tax rates than people buying recreational marijuana in Denver cardholders pay combined city and state taxes of 762 percent compared with the 2112 percent in taxes paid by recreational usersThe problem is that almost anyone can get a card on a doctors recommendation Regulators need to tighten access to cards and penalize doctors who churn out recommendations by the hundreds Otherwise tax rates on recreational marijuana will be easily subvertedDont Market to Minors One of the most important lessons from the countrys long battle with the tobacco industry is advertisings outsize role in creating and sustaining an addiction to nicotine particularly among teenagers and young adults Though marijuana is far less addictive than tobacco states that choose to legalize it must impose limits on the promotional activities of marijuana businesses The controls should emulate the restrictions on targeting young people banning outdoor advertising and product placements that the tobacco industry accepted as part of its settlement with state attorneys general in 1998States must require proper labeling and packaging of products that contain mindaltering substances Beau Kilmer a drug policy expert at the RAND Corporation said regulators can restrict the sale of foods like candies beverages and cookies made with marijuana or limit how much of the drugs active ingredients are in each serving The ingredients should also be distributed evenly throughout the product and regulators must test samples for harmful levels of pesticides mold and other impurities often found in illicit cannabisTo discourage the use of marijuana with alcohol states can require that they be sold in different places and ban the use of cannabis at bars and restaurants Experts say using marijuana and alcohol together is much more dangerous than using them separately  One study on the effects of marijuana use on driving published in the American Journal on Addictions in 2009 found that combining the two drugs results in impairment even at doses which would be insignificant were they of either drug aloneGrowers Shouldnt Be Sellers States should keep the production and retail sales of marijuana separate to ensure that the industry does not evolve into a group of politically and financially powerful vertically integrated businesses After Prohibition American lawmakers adopted a threetier system for the alcohol industry to make sure the country did not see the return of tied houses or bars that were either owned or beholden to brewers through loans and other financial arrangements Tied houses had encouraged excessive drinking by their customers which helped to galvanize the temperance movement Colorado initially required growers to also be retailers in the interest of getting the legal market going quickly but has since allowed them to specializeOver time the state should consider dividing production and sales as Washington has done But states should not blindly copyandpaste alcohol regulations onto marijuana either State beer distribution rules for example have unfairly prevented craft brewers from selling their products in many places a situation that shouldnt be replicated in the marijuana businessFor each level of the industry licensing systems ought to discourage the concentration of market power in the hands of a few businesses Its important for regulators to recall the American experience with the tobacco industry which is dominated by a handful of large corporations For decades those big cigarette companies undermined scientific research into the damage their products were causing and blocked sensible regulations If states allow marijuana businesses to become too big they could face corporate juggernauts that may be hard to regulateStates should also monitor each level of the industry closely including tracking how drugs move through the system This should help to keep legal marijuana from being diverted to other states or countries that have not legalized the drugWhatever states decide to do it is important that they stand ready to modify policies as legal marijuana markets evolve Policy makers have little experience regulating a fully commercial market in this drug It makes sense for states to proceed with caution and reserve the right to change course as they learn more,2014-08-05T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/opinion/sunday/high-time-the-great-colorado-weed-experiment.html,In January Colorado defied the federal government and stepped with both feet into the world of legal recreational marijuana where no state had gone beforeFor seven months Coloradans have been lawfully smoking joints and inhaling cannabis vapors chewing marijuanalaced candies and chocolates drinking cooking and lotioning with products infused with cannabis oil They are growing their own weed making their own hash oil and stocking up at dispensaries marked with green crosses and words like health wellness and natural remedies Tourists are joining in  gawking sampling and tripping in hotel rooms Business is growing taxes are flowing cannabis entrepreneurs are building investing and cashing inCannabis sales from January through May brought the state about 236 million in revenue from taxes licenses and fees That is not a huge amount in a 24 billion budget but its a lot more than zero and its money that was not pocketed by the black marketThe criminal justice system is righting itself Marijuana prosecutions are way down across the state  The Denver Post found a 77 percent drop in January from the year before Given the immense waste in dollars and young lives of unjust marijuana enforcement that far too often targets black men this may be the most hopeful trend of allThe striking thing to a visitor is how quickly the marijuana industry has receded into normality  cannabis storefronts are plentiful in Denver but not obtrusive certainly not in the way liquor stores often are Marijuanagrowing operations are in unmarked warehouses on the citys industrial edgesThe ominously predicted harms from legalization  like blight violence soaring addiction rates and other ills  remain imaginary worries Burglaries and robberies in Denver in fact are down from a year ago The surge of investment and of jobs in construction tourism and other industries on the other hand is realLegal Safe and Taxed This is what the people of Colorado voted for overwhelmingly in amending the State Constitution in 2012 to regulate marijuana like alcohol a shrewd frame that placed a major social shift firmly in the nobrainer category The promise of Amendment 64 is a flood of tax revenue for education drug abuse prevention and research  with as much as 40 million for school construction every year and 10 million for studying marijuanas therapeutic and medical benefits In a state where medical marijuana has been legal since 2000 doing little evident harm the move to legalize recreational use was seen by most voters as a sensible next stepThough Gov John Hickenlooper opposed Amendment 64 he admits that the debate is over  that this is a goodgovernment issue now and his administration is trying to making legalization work The state government began the year well prepared swiftly erecting a system to regulate the new business and to enforce the web of laws that strictly limit where you can use cannabis who can buy it and how products are made marketed and sold A digital inventory system tracks every plant from seed to sale The law forbids public consumption and selling to those under 21 Stings by state regulators recently found 100 percent of targeted shops in Denver and Pueblo complying with the underage law Police are cracking down on nuisance publicsmoking violations but arent wasting time chasing otherwiselawabiding usersTo keep stoned drivers off the roads the state is expanding to 300 the number of lawenforcement officers trained as drugrecognition experts Combating drugged driving is complicated because there are no instant roadside tests for marijuana and results might be meaningless anyway regular users can have blood concentration levels of THC the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis well over Colorados legal limit of five nanograms per milliliter and drive perfectly well and marijuana can be detectable weeks after a high has worn off Research on the dangers of mixing marijuana and driving is scant but so is evidence that legal cannabis makes the highways more dangerous The Colorado State Patrol reported in April that fatal crashes in the first quarter of 2014 were down 255 percent from the year beforeThe Problem of Edibles  Cannabis advocates were caught off guard in the first months after legalization by complaints about the risks of overdosing on cannabisinfused food and drinks Thanks to highpotency oils a single chocolate bar or bottle of soda can contain enough THC to get several people high An unwitting user may not realize this until an hour or two after eating or drinking too muchA handful of emergencyroom visits by children sickened by edibles prompted the state in May to tighten the labeling laws requiring products to be clearly marked as marijuana Last Thursday it enacted an emergency rule requiring edibles to be divided  or easily dividable  into single servings containing no more than 10 milligrams of THC But how to label single pieces of candy or keep tempting sweets away from children are lingering questionsLegalization opponents have seized on two highly publicized deaths in Colorado possibly linked to edibles  a visiting student ate some cannabis cookies and jumped off a balcony a man is accused of fatally shooting his wife after ingesting marijuana candy and possibly painkillers But these anecdotes fall short of a persuasive argument for renewed prohibition and there is still no evidence that THC even in large amounts is even close to being as lethal as alcohol or tobaccoTo discourage minors from using marijuana the state is spending 17 million on youth prevention and education An ad campaign aimed at 12 to 15yearolds who are seen as more open to persuasion than older teenagers is being unveiled this month It will focus on marijuanas potential risk to growing brains using props like giant rat cages and the slogan Dont be a lab rat The state says its deterrence campaign is honest and scientifically sound Still some critics are skeptical citing a long history of ineffective antidrug campaigns and a century of hysteria and shaky evidence about marijuanas dangersLessons Beyond the Rockies The Colorado model of medicalization and legalization is a model that is designed around continuous input and continuous adjustments said Christian Sederberg a lawyer at a Denver firm dedicated to marijuana law and advocacy Other states will be keeping a close eye on those adjustmentsWashington State which approved legalization by a ballot initiative in 2012 got its first recreational dispensaries in July It is following a different model with far stricter controls on advertising and public displays and a tight licensing process that so far has allowed relatively few marijuana stores to open with limited supplies at very high prices How well legalization will drive out illegal operations in Washington is not yet clear Seattle has such abundant and cheap blackmarket weed pot shops may end up being only a tourist noveltyThirtyfive states and the District of Columbia have laws allowing some form of medical marijuana Alaska and Oregon will put full legalization before the voters this fall Industry lobbyists are hoping to have legalization initiatives on ballots in up to six states in 2016Advocates are trying to make California one of them It was the first state to legalize medical marijuana in 1996 and thus has the longest history with an open cannabis culture Many call it de facto legalization because medical marijuana ID cards are laughably easy to get While Californias experience shows the downsides of ineffectual laws and lax enforcement it has not turned the state into a story of rampant addiction crime or community upheaval Support for full legalization there has grown as dire predictions of disaster made over two decades have not been borne outA similar dissonance exists in the Netherlands which for years has tolerated  though never legalized  recreational marijuana in order to separate users of soft drugs from users of hardcore opiates Its system is an awkward mix of tolerance and criminality The countrys cannabis cafes have to rely on blackmarket weed and as cities have grown weary of pot tourism they have tried in the face of great resistance to restrict use to residentsUruguay meanwhile recently became the first country to regulate marijuana growing and selling nationwide through a system in which the price is statecontrolled and everyone involved  sellers distributors buyers  must be a citizen and licensed by the government The goal is to end the narcotraffickers monopoly and drug violence The success of this approach and applicability to the United States has yet to be shownSo Far So Good  Beyond the challenges of edible cannabis and parental anxiety the problems facing Colorado are mostly prosaic and fixable  or out of its handsAt a cannabis conference in Denver in June some panelists were asked to consider existential threats to their industry like the danger that some future crackdown could send them all to federal prison They ruefully acknowledged that possibility but expressed hope that momentum in the states would soon become unstoppable sweeping even the executive branch and Congress in the right direction For now their experiment remains firmly on the rails and moving along with public opinion toward a future ever further from the failed war on drugsRelated Editorial Observer on the debate in two towns in Colorado

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/29/us/politics/29reuters-usa-elections-marijuana.html,WASHINGTON   Voters in the US capital and two West Coast states will decide in the  Nov 4 elections whether to legalize marijuana pushing closer to the mainstream a notion that was once consigned to the political fringeBallot initiatives in Oregon and Alaska would set up a network of regulated pot stores similar to those already operating in Colorado and Washington state A measure in the District of Columbia would allow possession but not retail salesIf successful the ballot initiatives could build momentum for legalization in other states and force candidates in the 2016 presidential election to take a stand on the issuePublic opinion on marijuana has shifted sharply in the past several years and polls indicate more Americans now support legalization than oppose it Advocates say that like gay marriage legal pot is an idea that gains support once people see it in actionThe more public dialogue that goes on about this issue the more support there is said Mason Tvert of the Marijuana Policy Project which is supporting the legalization drive in AlaskaOpponents say legalization will create an aggressive new industry that like the tobacco business will profit by marketing an addictive product to teens Unlike gay marriage legal pot will have harmful effects many sayI dont know anybody who looks around and says My life is better when everybody around me is stoned said Kevin Sabet a former White House drugpolicy adviser who now heads up Smart Approaches to Marijuana an antilegalization groupFew elected officials in the country support legalization  and observers do not expect that to change any time soonIt seems that this is an area where the public is out in front of their elected officials said Jake Weigler an Oregon Democratic strategist not affiliated with the legalization effortSo for the moment advocates are focused on ballot initiatives Such referendums allow voters to shape policy directly at the state level this year alone ballots in various states include measures to raise the minimum wage restrict abortion and ban certain types of bear huntingOn the marijuana issue voters in the District of Columbia back legalization by a twotoone margin according to recent polling while a narrow majority supports legal pot in Oregon Opinion polls in Alaska have been inconsistentNationwide roughly one in four Americans say they have used pot according to ReutersIpsos polling Some 47 percent support legalization and 35 percent oppose itMarijuana remains illegal under federal law but President Barack Obama has allowed Colorado and Washington to move forward with legalization Federal prosecutors have been told to focus enforcement on areas such as interstate trafficking and selling to minors rather than possession The next president will have to decide whether to continue that approach or to insist that federal law trumps local concernsCHANGES OVER TWO DECADESMarijuana has been edging toward legal status across the country since California became the first state to allow its use for medical purposes in 1996The medical use of marijuana to ease ailments ranging from glaucoma to chronic pain is now legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia Florida may become the first state in the South to approve medical pot in NovemberSome 18 states have also removed criminal penalties for possession of small amounts as policymakers on the left and the right have questioned the social and fiscal costs of imprisoning nonviolent drug users Nationwide about 650000 people were arrested for marijuana possession in 2012 FBI statistics showColorado and Washington opened the first statelicensed pot stores earlier this year following legalization referendums in 2012Beau Kilmer a drug policy expert at the RAND Corporation a nonpartisan think tank said it is too soon to determine how those efforts are faring because there is not enough data to determine whether legalization has led to more crime higher rates of underage use or more people driving while highColorado residents are split on legalizations merits Some 51 percent of likely voters in the state support it and 41 percent oppose it according to ReutersIpsos pollingOpponents of legal marijuana are not like the antidrug warriors of past decades Many support decriminalization and medical use if done carefully but argue that other states should not be in such a hurry to follow Colorado and Washington all the way to legal pot shopsI dont want to speak for the next couple of years but right now its not the right choice said Charles Fedullo a spokesman for Big Marijuana Big Mistake which opposes the legalization drive in AlaskaAdvocates have plenty of money to spend In liberalleaning Oregon backers are spending 2 million on a primetime TV ad campaign Opponents meanwhile have raised a mere 168000 largely from lawenforcement groups In Alaska a

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/fashion/marijuana-wedding-guest-colorado-and-washington-state.html,Earlier this month when Ellen Epstein arrived at the Devils Thumb Ranch in Tabernash Colo for the wedding of her friends Lauren Meisels and Bradley Melshenker she like the other guests found a gift bag waiting for her in her hotel room But rather than a guide to activities in the area or a jar of locally made honey the canvas bag contained a rolled joint a lighter and lip balm infused with mango butter and cannabis along with this note We wanted to show you some of the things we love the bestShe knew then that the wedding of her fellow Boulder residents would be just a little different from the ones she had attended in the pastThe Meisels and Melshenker nuptials looked as if their inspiration had come not from the pages of Martha Stewart Weddings but from High Times All of the floral arrangements including the brides bouquet contained a variety of white flowers mixed with marijuana buds and leaves Mr Melshenker and his groomsmen wore boutonnieres crafted out of twine and marijuana buds and Mr Melshenkers three dogs who were also in attendance wore collars made of cannabis buds eucalyptus leaves and pink ribbonsBefore going into dinner the guests were given a baby marijuana plant in a ceramic pot with their name and table assignment written on a card in green ink in the kind of stylish script you might find on a container of artisanal goat cheese The tables were named after different strains of marijuana like Blue Dream Sour Diesel and Skywalker the grooms favorite strain Ms Epstein who was seated at Skywalker said that everyone at her table where the ages ranged from 40 to 70 passed around a device similar to an electronic cigarette  except that it contained hash oil instead of nicotine It didnt feel weird or bizarre she said It kind of becomes a new cocktailWith the sale of marijuana for recreational use now legal in Colorado and Washington State pot and its various paraphernalia are becoming visible at weddings in those states  as table favors for guests like miniature vaporizers or group activites like a hookah loungeBrides and grooms even ones who say they dont partake often but want to be hospitable are giving guests choices that are much different than the standard merlot or chardonnay Now the choice could be Tangerine Haze or Grape ApeMarijuana use at weddings is out of the closet now said Kelli Bielema of Shindig Events in Seattle I did a wedding recently where they had a little box like a trinket box and it had a bunch of joints in it They just passed it around and said Here enjoy yourselfThe choice to make pot an integral if not central part of their wedding was almost a nobrainer for Mr Melshenker 32 and Ms Meisels 34 who also had an open bar Cannabis had been a major part of the couples relationship from the beginning Ms Meisels who grew up in Manhattan and Mr Melshenker who is from Maryland met in 2007 when they were both living in Los Angeles On their first date they smoked a joint together and Ms Meisels who worked at United Talent Agency at the time told Mr Melshenker she had been searching for a boyfriend who smoked potShe was like Ive been going out partying every night and I need a pothead to slow me down to cook dinners and watch movies instead of this Hollywood night life Mr Melshenker remembered Five years ago they moved together to Boulder and opened the Greenest Green a marijuana dispensary and cultivation center which they recently soldOur whole life for the last five years has been cannabis cannabis cannabis said Mr Melshenker who with Ms Meisels now operates Green Life Consulting an advisory firm for those who want to start marijuanabased businesses and 710 Labs which manufactures concentrates like hash oilMany pot enthusiasts think of alcohol as an oldfashioned oldschool toxin whose overuse can inflame family tensions and cause people to say horrible things especially at weddings In comparison marijuana they contend is more like a tonic that calms people down and makes them like each other more rather than less  perfect for a wedding they saySome of those who have attended weddings where joints bongs vaporizers epens or hookahs are passed around also say it heightens the communitybuilding mood that is inherent at a wedding At Get High Getaways a bedandbreakfast in Denver smoking pot is not only permitted but encouraged said Dale Dyke who runs the place with his wife Chastity Osborn Last March Mr Dyke and Ms Osborn hosted a wedding and reception at their inn featuring joints rolled from various strains of marijuana including Critical Mass Widow Kush and Skunk 1 The bride and groom said they love smoking marijuana but did not want to be interviewed about itEverybody was blazing the whole time said Mr Dyke who believes cannabis is a much more romantic substance than alcohol because it represents exploration rebellion openness and togetherness Marijuana intoxication is full of positive emotion People feel love and connection Every single person cried at the weddingThe rules and regulations about marijuana  particularly regarding where it is legal to use and where it is not  are still being written and constantly changing like springtime weather in the Rockies It is legal to imbibe on private property but not in public however there is endless debate about what constitutes private versus publicHeather Dwight who runs Calluna Events in Boulder and organized the MelshenkerMeisels wedding said it was difficult to find a place that would permit a joint bar or hookah lounge Even the owners of private spaces such as lofts or large houses balked It was possible to openly serve marijuana at the Get High Getaways wedding because BBs are considered private property and Mr Dyke was open to itMany of the most popular places to hold weddings in Colorado like the Denver Botanic Gardens the Denver Museum of Nature and Science and the top of Aspen Mountain forbid marijuana citing the law against consumption in public Tourists complain that marijuana is simple to buy in Colorado dispensaries are almost easier to find than Starbucks cafes but there are very few places where it is clearly legal to consume it So for now Ms Dwight said the easiest place to have a weed wedding is in your own backyardBecause they are smokeless cakes and pies with cannabis baked in are a hardtodetect way of consuming pot in public It is also illegal to do so In Washington State Alison Draisin a baker who creates what she calls medibles  because she intends them for medicinal use  said A restaurant cannot offer medibles on their menu as it stands nowEven diehard marijuana enthusiasts say the high from edibles can be incredibly powerful and longlasting Julie Dooley of Julie  Kate Baked Goods in Denver makes granola that contains THC the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana and describes the experience of ingesting a potinfused edible this way Its not like wine or a joint you might pass around for a fun party atmosphere When you eat an edible you are committed for four hours and mine can last six to 12 hours Its a long experienceAlso most edibles which include caramels lollipops and chocolates look like regular treats which makes them especially tempting for children At a wedding where a tray of pot brownies was served a few weeks ago the hired planner Kerri Butler of A Touch of Bliss in Denver said that the spaces bartenders checked the IDs of guests before handing out the brownies which had been baked by the mother of the brideJake Rosenbarger of Kim  Jakes Cakes in Boulder said he would not make a cannabis cake if asked Marijuana ruins the flavor he said and it can even ruin a wedding It can divide a room as much as pull it together he said It creates a vibe of Are you in the cool kids club or notPenni Ervin a wedding planner in Crested Butte was aghast when asked if she was working on any weddings in which pot was involved Were talking about highly professional people and I just dont see CEOs getting stoned she said Its a family event with grandma and grandpa adding and you dont want them to get shockedBefore Jennifer Beck 27 and Chase Beck 24 were married on May 3 also at the Devils Thumb Ranch they briefly discussed serving THCinfused cupcakes in addition to traditional ones Mr and Mrs Beck who founded Cannabaseio a Denver Internet company that connects customers to marijuanabased businesses ultimately decided not to include the special cupcakes in part because it was springtime the season when the rivers are raging with snowmelt and the bears are coming out of hibernation  not the ideal moment for anyone to be stoned in the mountainsHowever Mr Beck had no qualms about sharing some weed  a strain called Space Cheese to be exact  with his groomsmen after the ceremony at a private cabin he rented nearby The Space Cheese itself lent a giggly buzz to everyone while we rehashed the days events he saidToday there are budtenders think sommeliers only they work with cannabis instead of wine in every dispensary to help couples who are so inclined find the ideal strains for their weddings Bec Koop just opened a business Buds and Blossoms in Alma Colo to advise those who want to include marijuana in their centerpieces dinner salads bouquets and boutonnieres or budtonnieres as she calls themWhen it comes to marijuana she is like a skier bombing down a steep slope far more adventurous than cautious For instance during a recent conversation she suggested placing a tincture containing flavored like peppermint or vanilla THCinfused liquid next to the wedding cake for guests who might want to add a few droplets Like putting syrup on your pancakes she exclaimedMs Koop believes brides and grooms should choose their wedding weed as carefully as they select their music or clothes Certain strains help shy people get up and actually enjoy dancing in front of a crowd she said while others could bring out the carefree bubbly side of even the most ferocious BridezillasIf there are two conflicting families who are not too happy about the wedding she said you might want to find a strain that will make them a bit more euphoricKristen Tsiatsios coowner of Jubilee Event Engineers in Seattle worked on a wedding last summer that had a jazzera theme and included a cigarjoint bar set up outside the reception hallWe just walked around telling people If you go to the cigar bar there are joints underneath the table said Brandon Wagner the bridegroom Prohibition is overAs it turned out the cigar bar was like a strong undertow that drew all the guests outside Nobody was on the dance floor Ms Tsiatsios said Everyone had gone out front to get stoned and there they stayed the whole nightIt is hard to predict if pot will become more or less popular at weddings in the future Mark Buddemeyer a Colorado budtender whose nickname is actually Bud expressed doubts that marijuana would ever become widely acceptable at weddingsWeve got to get to the point where smoking is classier than drinking he said A bride blowing out a big cloud of smoke is not necessarily attractive Of course you do not have to inhale to get high anymore You could drink one of Dixie Elixirs THCinfused sparkling beverages that come in trendy flavors like pomegranate or watermelon creamOthers wonder if its really necessary for a bride and groom to heighten lighten deepen or in any way alter the experience of getting married Isnt promising to spend the rest of your life with someone enough of a high The Becks made a pact not to get stoned or tipsy before their ceremony It does change your energy Mrs Beck said It does change your ability to engage For the wedding youve got to be thereOne thing that can be said about weed weddings is they are likely to generate less waste While many centerpieces boutonnieres or bouquets are typically thrown out ones made out of marijuana buds will probably not be discardedFor the wedding at Get High Getaways Ms Osborn made the brides bouquet which included several buds of SAGE Zeta After the wedding Mr Dyke said the newly married couple hung the bouquet in a closet at home to dry it out and intend to smoke it on their wedding anniversary next year Mr Dyke likened it to the tradition to saving a piece of wedding cake in the freezer and sharing it on the first anniversaryThis practice could be a new way to relive the day As Mr Dyke put it You catch the same buzz you had on your wedding

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/20/world/americas/20reuters-uruguay-marijuana.html,MONTEVIDEO   Uruguay is struggling to roll out the commercial production and sale of marijuana and its groundbreaking experiment could be dropped or watered down if an opposition candidate wins this months presidential electionThe South American country is the worlds first to permit the cultivation distribution and use of marijuana aiming to wrest control of the trade from drug gangs while at the same regulating and even taxing its consumptionThe reform is being followed closely across Latin America where the legalization or decriminalization of some narcotics is increasingly viewed as a better way to end the violence spawned by drug trafficking than the USled war on drugsBut first Uruguay needs to work out how to ensure criminal gangs do not finance producers how to regulate the supply and quality of locally produced marijuana and how to satisfy neighboring states that legally grown dope will not be sold illegally on their streetsThe government has missed its own deadlines in implementing the changes that were passed into law last DecemberWeve been working on this since the very beginning since the first day But I just dont know if well manage it  said one government source familiar with the legalization programSebastian Sabini a lawmaker of the ruling coalition who put forward the law said its implementation required the creation of institutions that existed nowhere elseThe plan to start selling marijuana in pharmacies late this year looks unlikely as the government is still tendering cultivation licenses and identifying where seeds can be purchased fromGiven the delays leftist President Jose Mujica now faces a race against time to push through the changes before the countrys next leader takes office in MarchVoters go to the polls to elect a new president on Oct 26Mujica a 79year old exguerilla is constitutionally barred from running for a second consecutive termThe candidate for the leftwing Frente Amplio Broad Front ruling coalition Tabare Vazquez has endorsed the marijuana law though he is less enthusiastic about it than MujicaVazquezs main opponent in the tight race Luis Lacalle Pou of the centrist National Party endorsed a bill in 2010 that would have allowed personal cultivation of marijuana but he says the current reform is inapplicable in realityI am against the state producing and selling drugs and earning money with this he saidLacalle Pou who is the son of a previous president told TV station Canal 10 the law would be difficult to implement adding it meant the state abandons its role of protecting public health and trying to prevent addictionsIf Lacalle Pou wins and the marijuana law has not been rolled out he could simply shelve the project Otherwise he would have to pass a new bill overturning itEDGY SMOKERSThe Netherlands permits the sale of marijuana in coffee shops Canada allows terminally ill patients to grow and smoke their own marijuana and the US states of Washington and Colorado have legalized its cultivation and consumption but only Uruguay has passed legislation to allow commercial productionUruguay is one of Latin Americas most liberal societies and smoking marijuana has been legal here since 1998Even so opinion polls ahead of the election have shown almost two out of three Uruguayans disapprove of the state playing the role of narcotics regulatorMujicas critics say his liberal policies which also include the legalization of abortion and gay marriage have often been more widely acclaimed abroad than at homeAn opinion poll by consultancy group Factum earlier this month showed Vazquez with the support of 42 percent of voters and Lacalle Pou in second place with 32 percentWith both men projected to fall short of the absolute majority needed for a firstround victory they will likely go to a runoff where polls show them running neckandneckVazquez 74 has been largely silent on the marijuana issue and while Lacalle Pou has reiterated his opposition to the law  it has not flared into a hot campaign issue Voters are more concerned about crime health and educationThe marijuana legislation allows each household to grow up to six plants while registered users may buy up to 40 grams per person a month at pharmaciesOut of an estimated 150000 recreational smokers however only 600 have registered to be allowed to grow cannabis at homeOne of them civil servant Renzo Dodera 49 welcomes the change recalling how police last year destroyed his crop after a neighbor snitched on him But he says the law has left some pot smokers feeling uncomfortableThey feel the register can be a way of keeping track of cannabis users in a system that still discriminates against them said Dodera They are worried it may make it impossible for them to get workPricing has proved to be another headache Uruguay wants to undercut cheap Paraguayan cannabis that is often mixed with dirt and sell top grade marijuana that sells at nearly 4 per gram on the street for just 1At those prices some producers may decide there is not enough profit to make it worthwhile Uruguay received 22 applications for commercial production licenses after there were about 100 initial inquiriesStill some smokers back the governments moves and say they are unfazed by the risk of Mujica failing to see through the law before he steps downWe have been fighting for this for 10 years said Juan Vaz chairman of the Association of Cannabis Studies of Uruguay and the first Uruguayan to register as a

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/opinion/Legalizing-Marijuana-Pros-and-Cons.html,To the EditorMuch of the country  with The New York Times regrettably in the vanguard  is advocating the reckless addition of a third drug marijuana to two drugs currently legal for adults alcohol and tobacco These two legal drugs are the leading causes of preventable illnessThe legal status of a drug has dramatic impact on its use In the last 30 days 52 percent of Americans 12 and older used alcohol 27 percent used tobacco and only 7 percent used marijuana The dramatically lower level of marijuana use reflects its illegal status not its appeal Why is it in our nations interest to see marijuana use climb Since when is smoking a program that we promoteThe best policy to protect public health is one that reduces not increases marijuana use There are plenty of ways to achieve this goal including a strong public education effort focused on the negative health effects of marijuanaThere are reasons why employers including the United States government prohibit marijuana use in the workplace There are reasons why marijuana emergency room admissions are reported at the rate of 1250 a day and 455000 a year and why highway crashes double for marijuana usersWe cannot ignore the negative effects that legalization would have on underage use and addiction highway safety treatment costs mental health problems emergency room admissions workplace accidents and productivity and personal healthPETER BENSINGER ROBERT L DuPONT Chicago July 30 2014Mr Bensinger was administrator of the Drug Enforcement

marijuana prohibition and for taking a courageous position in calling for national legalization I became a mother in 1971 the same year that President Nixon declared the war on drugs Twenty years later my son was arrested for marijuana possession which began a decade of cycling through the criminal justice system for nonviolent drug offensesThe outlawing of marijuana translated into a war that has been waged against families like mine for over four decades Prohibition has robbed children of their futures while building a huge prisonindustrial complex It has caused countless casualties wasted taxpayer dollars promoted discrimination and taken away basic human libertiesMothers were instrumental in ending alcohol prohibition in the 1930s and once again moms are uniting to end marijuana prohibition for the sake of our children and future generationsGRETCHEN BURNS BERGMAN Spring Valley Calif July 28 2014The writer is cofounder and executive director of a New PATH Parents for Addiction Treatment and HealingTo the EditorI am concerned by the editorial boards stance in favor of marijuana legalization It has been only six months since retail marijuana sales began in Colorado and just weeks since the rollout in Washington State A robust objective analysis of outcomes in these two states is the only way to determine the best policy on this issue but for now it is too early to make a sound judgmentWhat we do know is that marijuana is harmful particularly for the stilldeveloping adolescent brain As weve seen with alcohol and tobacco imposing a minimum age will probably not be enough to prevent a spike in teenage use and addictionConsidering this likely consequence not to mention the economic burden of regulating the drug and treating new problematic users we may find that the societal costs of legalization outweigh the benefits However if we make pronouncements before we see the research were jumping the gun Lets let the facts speak for themselvesHOWARD P MEITINER New York July 28 2014The writer is president and chief executive of Phoenix House a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centerTo the EditorAs your July 27 editorial Repeal Prohibition Again says There are legitimate concerns about marijuana on the development of adolescent brains For that reason we advocate the prohibition of sales to people under 21Our concern about legalization is its effect on kids Society may not do much better at enforcing this restriction on sale and marketing of marijuana to kids than we have with alcohol and tobacco Research shows that use of any of these drugs in adolescence  especially early adolescence  significantly heightens risks of substance use disorders in later lifeWe need to provide a much better prevention and treatment infrastructure which expanded access to marijuana and increasing teenage use will require That begins with limiting marijuana marketing that kids will be exposed to and equipping parents with information about the very real health risks of early useThese are not details to be sorted later but vital considerations These are the considerations that matter most to us and to most parents including  research shows  those favoring legalizationSTEVE PASIERB President and Chief Executive Partnership for DrugFree Kids New York July 29 2014,2014-08-01T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/10/business/10reuters-canada-marijuana-investors.html,TORONTOST LOUIS   US investors in Canadas medical marijuana industry are betting they will not fall under the scrutiny of US law enforcement officers  but it is a risky betWith marijuana still illegal on a federal level in the United States American investors in Canadian medical marijuana can be seen as violating the Controlled Substances Act according to some US experts And the use of the banking system to transfer the proceeds of such investments could be seen as money launderingThe US Drug Enforcement Administration has already been tracking investments made in statesanctioned marijuana business in the United States When asked by Reuters about the DEAs view of US investments in Canadian marijuana DEA spokesman Rusty Payne said the agency is most interested in those types of activitiesAfter the Reuters report shares in Canadian medical marijuana companies fell sharply at the open before recovering some ground OrganiGram Holdings Inc dropped 69 percent in early trading Bedrocan Cannabis Corp fell 42 percent and Tweed Marijuana Inc declined  28 percentUS investors have been increasingly drawn to the raft of public listings by producers that has sprung up since Canada overhauled its laws this year making it legal to buy marijuana from licensed producers with a doctors prescriptionCanadas medical marijuana market which is expected to grow more than tenfold to C13 billion in a decade has matured more rapidly than its peers While US investors have several European markets where medical marijuana is legal on their radar  Canada has been the biggest beneficiary of fund flows from US investorsWe really like the Canada model which is really unlike any other in the world said Christian Groh a cofounder of Seattlebased private equity firm Privateer Holdings one of the largest players in the medical marijuana sector What were doing here does not violate local state and federal law in CanadaPrivateer created a Canadian subsidiary as its foothold in the market Other investors however have jumped straight in from their US basesTimothy White national risk specialist for Bankers Toolbox Inc a firm that helps banks detect and report money laundering said US investors in Canadian marijuana firms could be violating drug trafficking and money laundering lawsThat is two violations of US federal law I dont see there is any way around that White saidA former DEA official who asked not to be named said that at best the investments are an extremely reckless thing to do Investors could face money laundering charges and any return on investment would have the taint of drug proceeds the former official saidIf they sought legal advice on this they were grossly underserved the former official saidThere have been no prosecutions by US authorities of investors in Canada according to legal experts who have been closely following the marketPayne the DEA spokesman said the US agency has limited investigatory resources to pursue investors and is most interested in targeting those with deep pockets who pour large sums into the industryHIGH HOPESIt is a risk many US investors eyeing healthy returns are willing to take They are counting on shifting attitudes toward marijuana in the United States and they see scant chances of prosecution under the Obama administrationThere are so many companies investing in the Canadian side and this moneylaundering risk is just not something that is coming up as an issue said one US investor in the Canadian medical marijuana market who spoke on condition of anonymityYou can invest in pharmaceutical companies whose drugs are not approved in the United States This is just another medicineCanadian producer OrganiGram has nearly doubled in value since listing on Aug 25 Meanwhile Bedrocan was the secondmost actively traded stock on the TSX venture exchange on its market debut on the same dayRoughly 30 percent of OrganiGrams shares are held by US investors Other producers also reported high levels of US investment in their shares and capital raisingTorontobased PharmaCan Capital one of the most active investors in the Canadian market and likely to go public itself said it raised about 35 percent of its capital outside CanadaSo far only relatively small US investors have been active in Canadas marijuana sector Deeppocketed institutional investors in the United States are yet to be swayed partly because of the legal risks and because the investments available are generally too small to interest them Then there is the stigma associated with the industryCanadian and US investors also have to grapple with the risk of betting in a nascent unproven market that is still finding its way Securities regulators on both sides of the border have warned investors to stay clear of speculatorsThe larger institutions have a lot to lose and face a lot of scrutiny because of everything else they do said Brian Vicente a partner at Vicente Sederberg in Denver They are not interested in taking that risk at this moment and that opens up space and opportunities for smaller firmsHopes that more US states will follow the lead of Washington and Colorado and approve ballot initiatives that make marijuana legal for adult use have boosted the ranks of investors looking at early stage marijuanarelated companies Twentythree US states have legalized medical marijuanaSome investors look at this and think Im getting in on the ground floor Im going to be part of the next Facebook of

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/opinion/high-time-the-injustice-of-marijuana-arrests.html,Americas fourdecade war on drugs is responsible for many casualties but the criminalization of marijuana has been perhaps the most destructive part of that war The toll can be measured in dollars  billions of which are thrown away each year in the aggressive enforcement of pointless laws It can be measured in years  whether wasted behind bars or stolen from a child who grows up fatherless And it can be measured in lives  those damaged if not destroyed by the shockingly harsh consequences that can follow even the most minor offensesIn October 2010 Bernard Noble a 45yearold trucker and father of seven with two previous nonviolent offenses was stopped on a New Orleans street with a small amount of marijuana in his pocket His sentence more than 13 yearsAt least he will be released Jeff Mizanskey a Missouri man was arrested in December 1993 for participating unknowingly he said in the purchase of a fivepound brick of marijuana Because he had two prior nonviolent marijuana convictions he was sentenced to life without paroleOutrageously long sentences are only part of the story The hundreds of thousands of people who are arrested each year but do not go to jail also suffer their arrests stay on their records for years crippling their prospects for jobs loans housing and benefits These are disproportionately people of color with marijuana criminalization hitting black communities the hardestMeanwhile police departments that presumably have far more important things to do waste an enormous amount of time and taxpayer money chasing a drug that two states have already legalized and that a majority of Americans believe should be legal everywhereA Costly Futile Strategy The absurdity starts on the street with a cop and a pair of handcuffs As the war on drugs escalated through the 1980s and 1990s so did the focus on common lowlevel offenses  what became known as broken windows policing In New York City where the strategy was introduced and remains popular today the police made fewer than 800 marijuana arrests in 1991 In 2010 they made more than 59000Nationwide the numbers are hardly better From 2001 to 2010 the police made more than 82 million marijuana arrests almost nine in 10 were for possession alone In 2011 there were more arrests for marijuana possession than for all violent crimes put togetherThe costs of this national obsession in both money and time are astonishing Each year enforcing laws on possession costs more than 36 billion according to the American Civil Liberties Union It can take a police officer many hours to arrest and book a suspect That person will often spend a night or more in the local jail and be in court multiple times to resolve the case The publicsafety payoff for all this effort is meager at best According to a 2012 Human Rights Watch report that tracked 30000 New Yorkers with no prior convictions when they were arrested for marijuana possession 90 percent had no subsequent felony convictions Only 31 percent committed a violent offenseThe strategy is also largely futile After three decades criminalization has not affected general usage about 30 million Americans use marijuana every year Meanwhile police forces across the country are strapped for cash and the more resources they devote to enforcing marijuana laws the less they have to go after serious violent crime According to FBI data more than half of all violent crimes nationwide and four in five property crimes went unsolved in 2012The Racial Disparity The sheer volume of law enforcement resources devoted to marijuana is bad enough What makes the situation far worse is racial disparity Whites and blacks use marijuana at roughly the same rates on average however blacks are 37 times more likely than whites to be arrested for possession according to a comprehensive 2013 report by the ACLUIn Iowa blacks are 83 times more likely to be arrested and in the worstoffending counties in the country they are up to 30 times more likely to be arrested The war on drugs aims its firepower overwhelmingly at AfricanAmericans on the street while white users smoke safely behind closed doorsOnly about 6 percent of marijuana cases lead to a felony conviction the rest are often treated as misdemeanors resulting in fines or probation if the charges arent dismissed completely Even so every arrest ends up on a persons record whether or not it leads to prosecution and conviction Particularly in poorer minority neighborhoods where young men are more likely to be outside and repeatedly targeted by law enforcement these arrests accumulate Before long a person can have an extensive criminal history that consists only of marijuana misdemeanors and dismissed cases That criminal history can then influence the severity of punishment for a future offense however insignificantWhile the number of people behind bars solely for possessing or selling marijuana seems relatively small  20000 to 30000 by the most recent estimates or roughly 1 percent of Americas 24 million inmates  that means nothing to people like Jeff Mizanskey who are serving breathtakingly long terms because their records contained minor previous offenses Nor does it mean anything to the vast majority of these inmates who have no history of violence about nine in 10 according to a 2006 study And as with arrests the racial disparity is vast Blacks are more than 10 times as likely as whites to go to prison for drug offenses For those on probation or parole for any offense a failed drug test on its own can lead to prison time  which means again that people can be put behind bars for smoking marijuanaEven if a person never goes to prison the conviction itself is the tip of the iceberg In a majority of states marijuana convictions  including those resulting from guilty pleas  can have lifelong consequences for employment education immigration status and family lifeA misdemeanor conviction can lead to among many other things the revocation of a professional license the suspension of a drivers license the inability to get insurance a mortgage or other bank loans the denial of access to public housing and the loss of student financial aidIn some states a felony conviction can result in a lifetime ban on voting jury service or eligibility for public benefits like food stamps People can be fired from their jobs because of a marijuana arrest Even if a judge eventually throws the case out the arrest record is often available online for a year free for any employer to look upCorrecting an Old Inequity As recently as the mid1970s politicians and the public generally agreed that marijuana abuse was handled better by treatment than by prosecution and incarceration Jimmy Carter ran for president and won while supporting decriminalization But that view lost out as the war on drugs broadened and intensified sweeping marijuana along with itIn recent years public acceptance of marijuana has grown significantly Thirtyfive states and the District of Columbia now permit some form of medical marijuana and Colorado and Washington fully legalized it for recreational use in 2012 And yet even as ganjapreneurs scramble to take economic advantage thousands of people remain behind bars or burdened by countless collateral punishments that prevent them from full and active membership in societyIn a March interview Michelle Alexander a law professor whose book The New Jim Crow articulated the drug wars deeper costs to black men in particular noted the cruel paradox at play in Colorado and Washington She pointed to 40 years of impoverished black kids getting prison time for selling weed and their families and futures destroyed and said Now white men are planning to get rich doing precisely the same thingAs pioneers in legalization those two states should set a further example by providing relief to people convicted of crimes that are no longer crimes including overturning convictions A recent ruling by a Colorado appeals court overturned two 2011 convictions because of the changed law and the states Legislature has enacted laws in the last two years to give courts more power to seal records of drug convictions and to make it easier for defendants to get jobs and housing after a conviction These are both important steps into an uncharted future,2014-07-29T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/15/us/ap-us-marriage-and-marijuana.html,NEW YORK   While many liberal policy goals have proved elusive during Barack Obamas presidency there have been dramatic advances for two causes that once seemed quixotic  the legalization of samesex marriage and the decriminalization of marijuanaNeither cause was embraced by Obama during his first term Yet he is now a fervent supporter of marriage equality and has said it is important that Colorado and Washington state be allowed to proceed with their pioneering laws approved by voters in 2012 that legalize marijuanaFor both issues the pace of change has been strikingThere are now 19 states that allow gay marriage compared to two in 2008 Bans in the remaining states are being struck down by federal judges at a rapid rate that could presage a Supreme Court ruling legalizing it nationwideAs for marijuana in November voters in Oregon Alaska and the District of Columbia will weigh in on ballot measures that would emulate Colorado and Washington by legalizing recreational use of pot by adults A ballot measure in Florida could add that state to the 23 others which have legalized medical use of marijuana including 10 in the past four yearsWhats distinctive about the marriage and marijuana campaigns is that theyve been able to proceed at the state level unencumbered by the paralyzing gridlock in Congress In contrast efforts by Obama and his Democratic allies to overhaul the immigration system tighten gun control laws raise the federal minimum wage and combat climate change have run aground in the partisan divides on Capitol HillThe paramount Obama initiative that did clear Congress  his health care overhaul  remains entangled in various controversies and its longterm legacy is uncertain On immigration and many of the other issues hes resorting to unilateral executive action often angering his critics on the right while failing to fully satisfy activists on the leftGiven those realities Richard Socarides a former Clinton White House adviser on gay rights makes a case that samesex marriage and other gayrights advances represent a singular achievement for progressives during the Obama presidencyBarack Obama has accomplished more progressive social change on gay rights than anything else Socarides saidDuring his first term Obama helped change military policy so gays could serve openly but said his views on samesex marriage were still evolving Under constant pressure from gayrights activists he endorsed it in 2012 and since then his administration has moved aggressively to maximize federal recognition of married gay couples even in states that ban samesex marriageThe reason why he has that record now is because publicly and privately we really held his feet to the fire said Socarides referring to the activists pressureObamas stance on marijuana is far more nuanced Marijuana remains illegal under federal law and the White Houserun Office of National Drug Control Policy opposes its legalization whether for medicinal or recreational useYet in August 2013 addressing the developments in Colorado and Washington the Justice Department said it would allow legalization efforts to proceed as long as states followed strict guidelines including keeping pot away from minors Obama an acknowledged pot smoker in his younger days subsequently told The New Yorker magazine that he doesnt view marijuana as any more dangerous than alcohol and explained his acceptance of the Colorado and Washington initiativesIts important for it to go forward because its important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punished he told the magazineEthan Nadelmann executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance and a leading critic of the socalled war on drugs said such comments  coupled with the Justice Departments 2013 memo  have put Obama out in front of most congressmen and governorsI wouldnt call it bold but it is significant Nadelmann said of Obamas stance which has paved the way for other states to consider joining the legalization movementNadelmann drew a contrast between the marijuana movement  which he predicted would gain increasing bipartisan support  and issues such as immigration and gun control where partisan divides are pronouncedMarijuana lies at a unique intersection he said Its a civil rightscivil liberties cause and at the same time theres the emergence of a legal market that could be worth tens of billions of dollarsNeera Tanden of the Center for American Progress a liberal think tank said the changes unfolding at the state level on marriage and marijuana reflect evolving public opinion and the growing influence of 18to29yearolds Among millennials support for gay marriage and legalized pot is stronger than for other age groupsYou have a country that is diversifying and at same time you have a House of Representatives that is kind of a block against the wishes of the rising majority said Tanden the CAPs president Immigration reform passed the Senate then hit a wall on the steps of the HouseWith conservative Republicans likely to maintain power in the House for at least two more years Tanden said a statebystate approach is being pursued on some other progressivebacked issues For example measures to raise the state minimum wage will be on the Nov 4 ballot in Alaska Arkansas Nebraska and South Dakota while several cities and two states  California and Connecticut  have recently instituted policies to provide some workers with paid sick daysThese are issues that eventually will pass nationally Tanden saidConservative commentator Jonah Goldberg contends that Obama could have pushed more of his agenda through Congress if hed been more skillful politically and more willing to give Republicans a meaningful roleHe doesnt know how to play that game Goldberg said Now youve got gridlock and the things hes been able to do are things a president can do unilaterallyOthers defend Obamas effortsHis stances on marriage and marijuana will guarantee him a very strong progressive legacy said Ethan Geto a gayrights lobbyist and Democratic political consultant in New YorkHe wants to do the right thing on immigration but its an incredible minefield He pushed hard on gun control Geto said I dont see any of these major issues where he hasnt done as much as realistically expected___,2014-09-15T11:30:42Z,drugs

engineering major at the University of Puget Sound  Go make history  he said quoting his fatherHis friend Mark Rupprecht 33 standing shirtless with other prospective buyers under a blazing sun in a

Rupprecht a bartenderWashingtons experiment with licensed legal recreational marijuana began tentatively in a handful of places around the state on Tuesday with limited supplies  because licensed growers have not had time to bring in a full crop certified by the state to be Washingtongrown  but with great enthusiasm and hoopla in the places where the sales occurredWhere the experiment will lead after the novelty wears off remains deeply uncertainHardly anyone for example in a sampling of people who had come to wait for the opening of Cannabis City a 620squarefoot shop in an industrial area of south Seattle mentioned anything about actually getting high as a reason for a purchase You dont need a store for that they saidMaybe Ill have it bronzed make a trophy out of it C J Graham 22 a recent graduate in biopsychology at Tufts University who was visiting family said of his packet of potDoug Headley 34 a software engineer said he would probably divide his purchase and give it away as party favors Cannabis City was selling packets of two grams for 40 enough for two to four large cigarettes buyers said or more smaller ones though the law allows sales of up to an ounce or about 283 gramsSouvenirs for the barbecue tonight Mr Headley saidPossessing marijuana in small amounts and consuming it at home has been legal in Washington for almost two years now since voters passed Initiative 502 in 2012 and local law enforcement agencies had mostly backed off enforcing marijuana laws before that It had not however been legal to sell it for recreational purposes until TuesdayThe state issued its first retail licenses on Monday but required a 24hour quarantine period for lastminute inspectionsNonlicensed marijuana which remains illegal and medical marijuana which is still widely available are cheaper and more convenient than the marijuana from retail stores with their high state taxes  25 percent on every purchase  and security cameras many buyers saidMr Robinson for example has been using a business rather like the Avon lady that sends a person to his house with a single phone call with a suitcase of marijuana products to choose from A response time of one hour

at age 43 She carried a sign in his memory with the words Thank you Washington at the bottomCale Holdsworth 29 who was first in line at a shop in Bellingham near the Canadian border said it was a happy coincidence that brought him from his home in Abilene Kan to Washington for a family reunion just at the right moment to make a groundbreaking purchaseThis is a great moment he saidThe Washington State Liquor Control Board which administers recreational marijuana issued 25 retail licenses around the state on Monday with the first ones going to businesses that were both lucky  in landing a low lottery number in places that were oversubscribed with license applicants  and physically ready to open their doorsStatewide shortages of marijuana constricted things even more since the law allows stores only to sell marijuana that has been grown in Washington by licensed producers and the first licensed crop begun in March was mostly not ready for harvestA barcode system with each

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/us/03berkeley.html,BERKELEY Calif   Since the birth of the Free Speech Movement half a century ago this city has prided itself on its liberal values and policies be they generous benefits for the needy or a looktheotherway attitude toward marijuana useNow the city is bringing those policies together with a new amenity for the poor here The marijuana will be freeBeginning next August medical marijuana dispensaries in this city will be required to donate at least 2 percent of their cannabis to lowincome residents The City Council approved the requirement this summer  unanimously no less  with the hope of making the drug which can sell for up to 400 an ounce at dispensaries affordable for all residentsBut the charity cannabis mandate which city officials believe is the first such law provoked a swift backlash from critics who mocked it as a tiedyed fantasy in a city already famous for liberal experimentsInstead of taking steps to help the most economically vulnerable residents get out of that state the city has said Lets just get everybody high said John Lovell a lobbyist for the California Narcotic Officers AssociationMr Lovell said the free marijuana would sap patients motivation to look for work  after all it is not a drug known for encouraging anyone to get off the couch  and could easily be resold on the street for profit by people who are short on moneyI dont see anything progressive about that Mr Lovell saidTom Bates the mayor of Berkeley said the city was simply trying to ensure equal access to a drug he emphasized was medicine useful for treating cancer pain and other maladiesThere are some truly compassionate cases that need to have medical marijuana Mr Bates said But its expensive You hear stories about people dying from cancer who dont have the moneyMr Bates a former state legislator and football player at the University of California Berkeley has also championed home brewing and organic vegetables on school menus As for medical marijuana its a novel ideal to have it available to the poor he said Berkeley is sort of known for doing new thingsNearly 20 years after California became the first state to legalize medical cannabis Berkeleys new law highlights a paradox of marijuana as medicine Whether it is sold illegally on the street or legally in a dispensary access to the drug depends almost entirely on whether you can pay for itAlmost anyone with 40 to spare can find a doctor who will prescribe cannabis to treat insomnia or migraines or low appetite or something else but especially insomniaYet because marijuana remains illegal under federal law insurance companies refuse to cover such treatments which can run to hundreds of dollars per ounce for designer strains like All Star Sonoma Coma at local dispensariesIt is not as if marijuana medical or otherwise is tough to find here amid the vegan restaurants in downtown Berkeley and the smoke shops on Telegraph AvenueOn a recent Wednesday afternoon Joseph Skyler an undergraduate at the university here sat on the street with a group of homeless men who were making trinkets and jewelry to sell to tourists He was smoking marijuana that he said had been prescribed to him for insomniaI believe in living a certain kind of lifestyle thats very stress free Mr Skyler 23 said Ive noticed that just from smoking everyone calms downNo one else sitting with him had a medical cannabis card though that had hardly stopped them from smoking marijuana Mr Skyler said they should all have access to medical marijuanaThese people deserve it he said A lot of these guys have the same problems I haveAt least in the San Francisco Bay Area where marijuana is more socially accepted than cigarettes in some circles an informal network already exists to help lowincome people obtain medical cannabis Across the bay in San Francisco David Theisen 56 has relied on what he calls compassion a popular term for free medical cannabis to deal with insomniaAfter moving to the city several years ago he quickly learned the compassion schedule at several dispensaries which give away a few driedout buds to the first comers once or twice a month When one dispensary cut back said Mr Theisen a former line cook who remains unemployed he started going days without sleepingI cant afford to buy it but my need isnt any less than anyone elses he saidThe compassion system has now been formalized in Berkeley where city officials aim to provide lowincome patients with a more reliable supply of medical cannabis Only Berkeley residents are eligible for the free marijuana and they must show proof of income less than 32000 a year for individualsDispensaries which are prohibited by California law from turning a profit will also have to hire security guards to patrol nearby in order to deter crime though true to Berkeleys character the guards will not be allowed to carry firearmsOne of the citys largest dispensaries Berkeley Patients Group already gives away marijuana to patients who cannot pay One of them is Arnie Passman a poet and longtime Berkeley activist who has been a recipient for about a decade he could not remember exactly how long nor was he entirely sure what condition his prescription was meant to treatIt could be for my allergies or my arthritis  you know what happens to us folks We forget Mr Passman 78 said I can give it a blanket I feel better It helps me get going in the morningBut Sean Luse the dispensarys chief operating officer worries that the city mandate could lead to resale on the street Currently about 100 people not all of them Berkeley residents receive free marijuana from Berkeley Patients Group representing about 1 percent of the drug the facility dispenses The new law will now compel the dispensary to give away about twice as muchNo one has really quantified the legitimate demand they just set the 2 percent threshold out of thin air Mr Luse said Are we going to be forcing medicine on people just because its the law There could definitely be a financial incentive for folks to resell itMr Bates the mayor acknowledged that resale was possible but he waved away the question of whether there was enough demandTheres a huge demand  we could make it 20 percent he saidHe said he was more concerned with trying to regulate the safety and quality of the cannabis which is not tested or standardized by the state and varies substantially from one dispensary to anotherUnlike the lowgrade varieties often handed out by San Francisco dispensaries the free cannabis under the law in Berkeley must be of the same quality as the marijuana that customers pay for  ideally grown organically Mr Bates said without any pesticidesAnd despite the mocking from outside city limits on the streets of Berkeley no one voiced much objection to the new lawIf you believe marijuana is medicine then helping lowincome people purchase the medicine they need kind of makes sense to me said Bill Green 49 who works for a solar energy companyHe added that there was probably a lot of use of medical marijuana by people who dont really need it but that he saw an easy fix to that problem full legalizationIf the citys mandate is another step toward legalization for recreational use Mr Bates said then so much the betterI think what were seeing now is an evolution towards full legalization he said Its coming It may not be in the next few years but its coming,2014-09-03T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/opinion/sunday/high-time-let-states-decide-on-marijuana.html,In 1970 at the height of his whitehot war on crime President Richard Nixon demanded that Congress pass the Controlled Substances Act to crack down on drug abuse During the debate Senator Thomas Dodd of Connecticut held up a package wrapped in lightgreen paper that he said contained 3000 worth of marijuana This substance he said caused such dreadful hallucinations in an Army sergeant in Vietnam that he called down a mortar strike on his own troops A few minutes later the Senate unanimously passed the billThat law so antique that it uses the spelling marihuana is still on the books and is the principal reason that possessing the substance in Senator Dodds package is considered illegal by the United States government Changing it wouldnt even require an act of Congress  the attorney general or the secretary of Health and Human Services could each do so  although the law should be changed to make sure that future administrations could not reimpose the banRepealing it would allow the states to decide whether to permit marijuana use and under what conditions Nearly threefourths of them have already begun to do so liberalizing their laws in defiance of the federal ban Two have legalized recreational use outright and if the federal government also recognized the growing public sentiment to legalize and regulate marijuana that would almost certainly prompt more states to follow alongThe increasing absurdity of the federal governments position is evident in the text of the Nixonera law Marihuana is listed in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act alongside some of the most dangerous and mindaltering drugs on earth ranked as high as heroin LSD and bufotenine a highly toxic and hallucinogenic toad venom that can cause cardiac arrest By contrast cocaine and methamphetamine are a notch down on the governments rankings listed in Schedule IIThat illogical distinction shows why many states have begun to disregard the federal governments archaic rules Schedule II drugs while carrying a high potential for abuse have a legitimate medical use Even meth is sold in prescription form for weight loss But according to the language of the law marijuana and the other Schedule I drugs have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United StatesStates Take the Lead No medical use That would come as news to the millions of people who have found that marijuana helped them through the pain of AIDS or the nausea and vomiting of chemotherapy or the seizures of epilepsy As of this month 35 states and the District of Columbia permit some form of marijuana consumption for medical purposes New York is one of the latest states to defy the tired edict of the Controlled Substances ActIts hard for the public to take seriously a law that says marijuana and heroin have exactly the same high potential for abuse since that ignores the vastly more addictive power of narcotics which have destroyed the lives of millions of people around the world There are no documented deaths from a marijuana overdose The 44year refusal of Congress and eight administrations to alter marijuanas place on Schedule I has made the law a laughingstock one that states are openly floutingIn addition to the medical exceptions 18 states and the District of Columbia have decriminalized marijuana generally meaning that possession of small amounts is treated like a traffic ticket or ignored Two states Colorado and Washington have gone even further and legalized it for recreational purposes two others Alaska and Oregon will decide whether to do the same later this yearThe states are taking the lead because theyre weary of locking up thousands of their own citizens for possessing a substance that has less potential for abuse and destructive behavior than alcohol A decision about what kinds of substances to permit and under what conditions belongs in the purview of the states as alcohol is handledConsuming marijuana is not a fundamental right that should be imposed on the states by the federal government in the manner of abortion rights health insurance or the freedom to marry a partner of either sex Its a choice that states should be allowed to make based on their culture and their values and its not surprising that the early adopters would be socially liberal states like Colorado and Washington while others hang back to gauge the resultsPreempted by Washington Many states are unwilling to legalize marijuana as long as possessing or growing it remains a federal crime Colorado for instance allows its largest stores to cultivate up to 10200 cannabis plants at a time But the federal penalty for growing more than 1000 plants is a minimum of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to 10 million That has created a state of confusion in which lawabiding growers in Colorado can face federal penaltiesLast August the Justice Department issued a memo saying it would not interfere with the legalization plans of Colorado and Washington as long as they met several conditions keeping marijuana out of the hands of minors or criminal gangs prohibiting its transport out of the state and enforcing prohibitions against drugged driving violence and other illegal drugs The government has also said banks can do business with marijuana sellers easing a huge problem for a growing industry But the Justice Department guidance is loose aggressive federal prosecutors can ignore it if state enforcement efforts are not sufficiently robust the memo saysThats a shaky foundation on which to build confidence in a states legalization plan More important it applies only to this moment in this presidential administration President Obamas Justice Department could change its policy at any time and so of course could the next administrationHow to End the Federal Ban Allowing states to make their own decisions on marijuana  just as they did with alcohol after the end of Prohibition in 1933  requires unambiguous federal action The most comprehensive plan to do so is a bill introduced last year by Representative Jared Polis Democrat of Colorado known as the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act It would eliminate marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act require a federal permit for growing and distributing it and have it regulated just as alcohol is now by the Food and Drug Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives An alternative bill which would not be as effective was introduced by Representative Dana Rohrabacher Republican of California as the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act It would not remove marijuana from Schedule I but would eliminate enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act against anyone acting in compliance with a state marijuana lawCongress is clearly not ready to pass either bill but there are signs that sentiments are changing A promising alliance is growing on the subject between liberal Democrats and libertarian Republicans In a surprise move in May the House voted 219 to 189 to prohibit the Drug Enforcement Administration from prosecuting people who use medical marijuana if a state has made it legal It was the first time the House had voted to liberalize a marijuana law similar measures had repeatedly failed in previous years The measures fate is uncertain in the SenateWhile waiting for Congress to evolve President Obama once a regular recreational marijuana smoker could practice some evolution of his own He could order the attorney general to conduct the study necessary to support removal of marijuana from Schedule I Earlier this year he told The New Yorker that he considered marijuana less dangerous than alcohol in its impact on individuals and made it clear that he was troubled by the disproportionate number of arrests of AfricanAmericans and Latinos on charges of possession For that reason he said he supported the Colorado and Washington experimentsIts important for it to go forward he said referring to the state legalizations because its important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punishedBut a few weeks later he told CNN that the decision on whether to change Schedule I should be left to Congress another way of saying he doesnt plan to do anything to end the federal ban For too long politicians have seen the high cost  in dollars and lives locked behind bars  of their pointless war on marijuana and chosen to do nothing But many states have had enough and its time for Washington to get out of their way ,2014-07-27T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/opinion/high-time-times-readers-online-make-their-own-cases-for-legalizing-marijuana.html,WE learned something about New York Times online commenters recently They are far far more supportive of marijuana legalization than the average AmericanOver the last 10 days The Timess Editorial Board published a series calling for an end to the federal ban on marijuana This stance we realized was hardly avantgarde As we noted in an essay on public views a majority of Americans now favor legalizing use of the drug But this majority is not especially large 54 percent to 42 percent according to the Pew Research Centers latest pollIn the comments section of the High Time series we asked readers to state their preference for legalization against it or unsure Obviously combing through Internet comments wont yield results that are publishable in a scientific journal Still the lopsided response seems to indicate that Times readers  at least readers of the online edition  overwhelmingly believe that prohibition is pointlessAs of Tuesday afternoon roughly 15000 comments were published online on seven editorials 12658 were for 982 against and 254 unsure Not everyone chose a category And letters to the editor by contrast were far more mixedBy and large readers seem to support legalization for the same reasons the editorial writers do They are convinced marijuana is less dangerous than alcohol and tobacco and believe that the criminalization of marijuana is more likely to ruin lives than marijuana itself Arrest and incarceration for possession of a relatively harmless substance is to many readers unacceptableMark Hanna of Virginia summed up the consensus view Like many wars the war on drugs has caused too much carnage Lets responsibly legalize marijuanaKyle of Oklahoma made the same point in more detail No matter how bad you think marijuana is for kids teens or adults the fact is that arrest incarceration and the ruin they bring is worse The question is not whether marijuana is OK It is how to effectively deal with it Illegality and moral censure are and should remain separate tools  I think many people are worried about losing control of their kids but I dont think a single one of them wants to see their kid locked upAnd Justine a nurse in Portland Ore wrote from personal experience I have yet to see one patient come through our doors suffering the longterm consequence of pot use Not one Alcohol I cant even begin to count And when they do it is very ugly Patients in the ER because someone smoked a couple of joints and got violent Not so muchNot surprisingly commenters did advance arguments that the Editorial Board overlooked or touched upon only in passing Some including Daniel of Alabama supported legalization on ideological libertarian grounds I reject the federal governments right to decide what I put in my body Even if it was bad for you so what We dont ban skydiving driving in cars hunting professional backyard wrestling traveling to 3rd world countries sugary foods and beverages standing outside during thunderstorms with a metal pole swimming after eating caffeine ibuprofen alcohol cigarettes or prescription drugs all of which are statistically more likely to harm youOther readers endorsed legalization as a way to reduce the power of drug cartels Pedro a reader in Mexico City explained In Mexico we have a bloody war against drugs  This prohibition has done nothing but destroy people by putting them in jail Drug dealers killing each other for territory etc There are more cartels than there were when the prohibition started This prohibition has only empowered drug dealers I say let cannabis be free Stop benefiting the cartelsInstead of allowing gangs to profit from marijuana some readers suggested that local governments could patch up their budgets by taxing the drug In this era of dwindling coffers wrote Kelli Dunaway of St Louis it seems that the regulation sale and taxation of marijuana offers some badly needed fiscal relief In my state that may be the only argument with any impactALTHOUGH the vast majority of readers wrote in support of legalization there was of course some dissent There were readers who considered the series downright reckless and who questioned our prioritiesRobert Jackson of Denver said we need to put the needs of Americas youth ahead of the needs of people who want to get stoned He dismissed the notion that pot is a safe and harmless drug as the product of a wellfunded blitzkrieg propaganda campaign and called the argument that alcohol is more dangerous than marijuana a propaganda tactic of distraction Sam Coulter of New York was more blunt Arguing marijuana should be legal just because alcohol is legal is just plain stupidWe expected some readers to make the slipperyslope case against legalizing marijuana and they did Keval Parekh of New Jersey wrote sarcastically Sure Democrats lets fully legalize marijuana  And while were at it how about cocaine meth heroin and LSD But he also took a rather surprising position He called on Republicans to end their hypocritical stance on alcohol and tobacco  They should come out as against ALL types of drugs including alcohol and tobaccoMr Parekh was not the only reader to recommend doublingdown on prohibition Susan of Boston identified herself as someone who thinks tobacco smoking should be outlawedSomehow we dont anticipate repeal the 21st amendment ban tobacco working as a slogan on the campaign trail certainly any candidate who suggested blanket prohibition would lose The Timess readership In fact many readers argued that legalization  rather than continued or broader prohibition  was the political winner They noticed the nearunanimity in the comments section and perhaps getting a little carried away imagined hopeandchange emanating from the White HouseChris of Virginia had some advice for President Obama He should use executive authority to legalize marijuana on a national level and let each state decide their own laws This could be an opportunity for Pres Obama to cement his legacy and give the nation what it clearly desiresThe president would at least be giving a majority of Times commenters what they clearly desire,2014-08-06T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/public-editor/public-editor-on-marijuana-editorials-and-campus-assault-accusation.html,WHEN The New York Times decides to put its full weight behind a topic it packs a powerful punchThats true on the opinion side of the paper as with the current editorial series on legalizing marijuana Its true on the news side too as in a recent 5000word article about a single sexualassault case on an upstate New York college campus it started on the front page and continued on two full pages insideReading these pieces and hearing reader reaction made me wonder why some stories or projects deserve this go big or go home treatment in The Times How can their success be measured And does it ever amount to overkillIn the case of the pot series it wasnt just the length of the project that made it different The use of the Sunday Review section front to kick it off was new as was having editorials normally unsigned carry authors namesWe decided we wanted to shout something out to really crank up the volume said Andrew Rosenthal the editorial page editorThe topic deserved the big play not because we want everybody to go out and smoke all the pot they can Mr Rosenthal said but because of the effect laws against marijuana have on society  particularly the harm they do to young black men The decision to sign the editorials he said was an experiment and he noted a distinction These are not columns The authors are writing on behalf of the editorial board The use of the Review section front was another way to increase visibility and a signal that this was something unusualMr Rosenthal is aware that there is a possibility of going too far But he said the chance to make a societal difference provided adequate justificationThe article about a sexual assault accusation at Hobart and William Smith Colleges used a single situation to illuminate a broader issue The story of Anna whose last name was withheld but whose photograph was used allowed us to get into one of the key issues on sexual assault which is how do colleges adjudicate these cases said Matt Purdy an assistant managing editor who supervises the investigative team In doing so it delved deep into the students own story and into the process that ended up clearing the accused students members of the football teamWe work hard to use that substantial hammer on something important and relevant not just because it fascinates someone Mr Purdy saidAs for why the story is told through a onesituation lens the deputy investigations editor Christine Kay said it had to do with impact and keeping the readers interest Often the best way is to tell the narrower story she said You develop the characters and that becomes a thread that pulls the reader through the entire pieceFinding the right story to tell is crucial The reporter who wrote the Hobart and William Smith piece Walt Bogdanich had earlier written a major article about a botched police investigation into an alleged sexual assault at Florida State University involving its star quarterback Jameis Winston Afterward Mr Bogdanich told me he received a number of tips about cases at other collegesThe Hobart and William Smith tip intrigued him I saw it as an opportunity to explore what happens when students opt to adjudicate their complaints through their school rather than the criminal justice system What was more

airing its complaints on its website and in emails to The Times which have been answered in detailMajor stories can carry major consequences for the reputations of institutions or individuals and this too is something that Times editors say they are always aware of We have to always think about the fact that we affect peoples lives Mr Purdy said We cant be cavalier about thatIn both recent cases editors told me they were pleased with the national discussion that was generated which included an unhappy response from the White House to the pot series At Hobart and William Smith officials are

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/opinion/what-science-says-about-marijuana.html,For Michele Leonhart the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration there is no difference between the health effects of marijuana and those of any other illegal drug All illegal drugs are bad for people she told Congress in 2012 refusing to say whether crack methamphetamines or prescription painkillers are more addictive or physically harmful than marijuanaHer testimony neatly illustrates the vast gap between antiquated federal law enforcement policies and the clear consensus of science that marijuana is far less harmful to human health than most other banned drugs and is less dangerous than the highly addictive but perfectly legal substances known as alcohol and tobacco Marijuana cannot lead to a fatal overdose There is little evidence that it causes cancer Its addictive properties while present are low and the myth that it leads users to more powerful drugs has long since been disprovedThat doesnt mean marijuana is harmless in fact the potency of current strains may shock those who havent tried it for decades particularly when ingested as food It can produce a serious dependency and constant use would interfere with job and school performance It needs to be kept out of the hands of minors But on balance its downsides are not reasons to impose criminal penalties on its possession particularly not in a society that permits nicotine use and celebrates drinkingMarijuanas negative health effects are arguments for the same strong regulation that has been effective in curbing abuse of legal substances Science and government have learned a great deal for example about how to keep alcohol out of the hands of minors Mandatory underage drinking laws and effective marketing campaigns have reduced underage alcohol use to 248 percent in 2011 compared with 334 percent in 1991 Cigarette use among high school students is at its lowest point ever largely thanks to tobacco taxes and growing municipal smoking limits There is already some early evidence that regulation would also help combat teen marijuana use which fell after Colorado began broadly regulating medical marijuana in 2010Comparing the Dangers As with other recreational substances marijuanas health effects depend on the frequency of use the potency and amount of marijuana consumed and the age of the consumer Casual use by adults poses little or no risk for healthy people Its effects are mostly euphoric and mild whereas alcohol turns some drinkers into barroom brawlers domestic abusers or maniacs behind the wheelAn independent scientific committee in Britain compared 20 drugs in 2010 for the harms they caused to individual users and to society as a whole through crime family breakdown absenteeism and other social ills Adding up all the damage the panel estimated that alcohol was the most harmful drug followed by heroin and crack cocaine Marijuana ranked eighth having slightly more than onefourth the harm of alcoholFederal scientists say that the damage caused by alcohol and tobacco is higher because they are legally available if marijuana were legally and easily obtainable they say the number of people suffering harm would rise However a 1995 study for the World Health Organization concluded that even if usage of marijuana increased to the levels of alcohol and tobacco it would be unlikely to produce public health effects approaching those of alcohol and tobacco in Western societiesMost of the risks of marijuana use are small to moderate in size the study said In aggregate they are unlikely to produce public health problems comparable in scale to those currently produced by alcohol and tobaccoWhile tobacco causes cancer and alcohol abuse can lead to cirrhosis no clear causal connection between marijuana and a deadly disease has been made Experts at the National Institute on Drug Abuse the scientific arm of the federal antidrug campaign published a review of the adverse health effects of marijuana in June that pointed to a few disease risks but was remarkably frank in acknowledging widespread uncertainties Though the authors believed that legalization would expose more people to health hazards they said the link to lung cancer is unclear and that it is lower than the risk of smoking tobaccoThe very heaviest users can experience symptoms of bronchitis such as wheezing and coughing but moderate smoking poses little risk A 2012 study found that smoking a joint a day for seven years was not associated with adverse effects on pulmonary function Experts say that marijuana increases the heart rate and the volume of blood pumped by the heart but that poses a risk mostly to older users who already have cardiac or other health problemsHow Addictive Is Marijuana Marijuana isnt addictive in the same sense as heroin from which withdrawal is an agonizing physical ordeal But it can interact with pleasure centers in the brain and can create a strong sense of psychological dependence that addiction experts say can be very difficult to break Heavy users may find they need to take larger and larger doses to get the effects they want When they try to stop some get withdrawal symptoms such as irritability sleeping difficulties and anxiety that are usually described as relatively mildThe American Society of Addiction Medicine the largest association of physicians specializing in addiction issued a white paper in 2012 opposing legalization because marijuana is not a safe and harmless substance and marijuana addiction is a significant health problemNonetheless that health problem is far less significant than for other substances legal and illegal The Institute of Medicine the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences said in a 1999 study that 32 percent of tobacco users become dependent as do 23 percent of heroin users 17 percent of cocaine users and 15 percent of alcohol drinkers But only 9 percent of marijuana users develop a dependenceAlthough few marijuana users develop dependence some do according to the study But they appear to be less likely to do so than users of other drugs including alcohol and nicotine and marijuana dependence appears to be less severe than dependence on other drugsTheres no need to ban a substance that has less than a third of the addictive potential of cigarettes but state governments can discourage heavy use through taxes and education campaigns and help provide treatment for those who wish to quitImpact on Young People One of the favorite arguments of legalization opponents is that marijuana is the pathway to more dangerous drugs But a wide variety of researchers have found no causal factor pushing users up the ladder of harm While 111 million Americans have tried marijuana only a third of that number have tried cocaine and only 4 percent heroin People who try marijuana are more likely than the general population to try other drugs but that doesnt mean marijuana prompted them to do soMarijuana does not appear to be a gateway drug to the extent that it is the cause or even that it is the most significant predictor of serious drug abuse the Institute of Medicine study said The real gateway drugs are tobacco and alcohol which young people turn to first before trying marijuanaIts clear though that marijuana is now far too easy for minors to obtain which remains a significant problem The brain undergoes active development until about age 21 and there is evidence that young people are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of marijuanaA longterm study based in New Zealand published in 2012 found that people who began smoking heavily in their teens and continued into adulthood lost an average of eight IQ points by age 38 that could not be fully restored A Canadian study published in 2002 also found an IQ loss among heavy schoolage users who smoked at least five joints a weekThe case is not completely settled The New Zealand study was challenged by a Norwegian researcher who said socioeconomic factors may have played a role in the IQ loss But the recent review by experts at the National Institute on Drug Abuse concluded that adults who smoked heavily in adolescence had impaired neural connections that interfered with the functioning of their brains Early and frequent marijuana use has also been associated with poor grades apathy and dropping out of school but it is unclear whether consumption triggered the poor gradesRestricting marijuana to adults is more important now that Colorado merchants are selling THC the drugs active ingredient in candy bars cookies and other edible forms likely to appeal to minors Experience in Colorado has shown that people can quickly ingest large amounts of THC that way which can produce frightening hallucinationsAlthough marijuana use had been declining among high school students for more than a decade in recent years it has started to climb in contrast to continuing declines in cigarette smoking and alcohol use Marijuana was found  alone or in combination with other drugs  in more than 455000 patients visiting emergency rooms in 2011 Nearly 70 percent of the teenagers in residential substanceabuse programs run by Phoenix House which operates drug and alcohol treatment centers in 10 states listed marijuana as their primary problemThose are challenges for regulators in any state that chooses to legalize marijuana But they are familiar challenges and they will become easier for governments to deal with once more of them bring legal marijuana under tight regulation,2014-07-31T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/opinion/high-time-federal-marijuana-ban-is-rooted-in-myth.html,The federal law that makes possession of marijuana a crime has its origins in legislation that was passed in an atmosphere of hysteria during the 1930s and that was firmly rooted in prejudices against Mexican immigrants and AfricanAmericans who were associated with marijuana use at the time This racially freighted history lives on in current federal policy which is so driven by myth and propaganda that it is almost impervious to reasonThe cannabis plant also known as hemp was widely grown in the United States for use in fabric during the mid19th century The practice of smoking it appeared in Texas border towns around 1900 brought by Mexican immigrants who cultivated cannabis as an intoxicant and for medicinal purposes as they had done at homeWithin 15 years or so it was plentiful along the Texas border and was advertised openly at grocery markets and drugstores some of which shipped small packets by mail to customers in other statesThe law enforcement view of marijuana was indelibly shaped by the fact that it was initially connected to brown people from Mexico and subsequently with black and poor communities in this country Police in Texas border towns demonized the plant in racial terms as the drug of immoral populations who were promptly labeled fiendsAs the legal scholars Richard Bonnie and Charles Whitebread explain in their authoritative history The Marihuana Conviction the drugs popularity among minorities and other groups practically ensured that it would be classified as a narcotic attributed with addictive qualities it did not have and set alongside far more dangerous drugs like heroin and morphineBy the early 1930s more than 30 states had prohibited the use of marijuana for nonmedical purposes The federal push was yet to comeThe stage for federal suppression of marijuana was set in New Orleans where a prominent doctor blamed muggleheads  as pot smokers were called  for an outbreak of robberies The city was awash in sensationalistic newspaper articles that depicted pushers hovering by the schoolhouse door turning children into addicts These stories popularized spurious notions about the drug that lingered for decades Law enforcement officials too trafficked in the assassin theory under in which killers were said to have smoked cannabis to ready themselves for murder and mayhemIn 1930 Congress consolidated the drug control effort in the Federal Bureau of Narcotics led by the endlessly resourceful commissioner Harry Jacob Anslinger who became the architect of national prohibition His case rested on two fantastical assertions that the drug caused insanity that it pushed people toward horrendous acts of criminality Others at the time argued that it was fiercely addictiveHe may not have actually believed his propaganda but he fed it by giving lurid stories to the press as a way of making a case for federal intervention This narrative had a great effect at Congressional hearings that led to the enactment of The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 which tried to eradicate the use and sale of the drug through heavy taxationMr Bonnie and Mr Whitebread report that the witness list for those hearings contained not a single person who had done significant research into the effects of cannabis Mr Anslinger testified that even a single marijuana cigarette could induce a homicidal mania prompting people to want to kill those they loved The bill passed handily President Franklin Roosevelt signed it into lawIt was not until 1951 when Congress again took up the issue that a reputable researcher was called to testify Dr Harris Isbell director of research at the Public Health Service Hospital in Lexington Ky disputed the insanity crime and addiction theories telling Congress that smoking marijuana has no unpleasant aftereffects no dependence is developed on the drug and the practice can easily be stopped at any timeDespite Dr Isbells testimony Congress ratcheted up penalties on users The states followed the federal example Louisiana for instance created sentences ranging from five to 99 years without parole or probation for sale possession or administration of narcotic drugs The rationale was not that marijuana itself was addictive  that argument was suddenly relinquished  but that it was a steppingstone to heroin addiction This passed largely without comment at the timeThe country accepted a senselessly punitive approach to sentencing as long as minorities and the poor paid the price But by the late 1960s weed had been taken up by white college students from the middle and upper classes Seeing white lives ruined by marijuana laws altered public attitudes about harsh sentencing and in 1972 the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse released a report challenging the approachThe commission concluded that criminalization was too harsh a tool to apply to personal possession even in the effort to discourage use and that the actual and potential harm of use of the drug is not great enough to justify intrusion by the criminal law into private behavior a step which our society takes only with the greatest reluctance The Nixon administration dismissed these ideasDuring the mid1970s virtually all states softened penalties for marijuana possession Thirtyfive states and the District of Columbia have made medical use of some form of the drug legal The Justice Departments recent decision not to sue states that legalize marijuana  as long as they have strong enforcement rules  eases the tension between state and federal laws only slightly but leaves a great many legal problems unresolvedThe federal government has taken a small step back from irrational enforcement But it clings to a policy that has its origins in racism and xenophobia and whose principal effect has been to ruin the lives of generations of

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/14/us/ap-fbn-nfl-marijuana.html,Marijuana is casting an everthickening haze across NFL locker rooms and its not simply because more players are using itAs attitudes toward the drug soften and science slowly teases out marijuanas possible benefits for concussions and other injuries the NFL is reaching a critical point in navigating its tenuous relationship with what is recognized as the analgesic of choice for many of its playersIts not lets go smoke a joint retired NFL defensive lineman Marvin Washington said Its what if you could take something that helps you heal faster from a concussion that prevents your equilibrium from being off for two weeks and your eyesight for being off for four weeksOne challenge the NFL faces is how to bring marijuana into the game as a pain reliever without condoning its use as a recreational drug And facing a lawsuit filed on behalf of hundreds of former players complaining about the effects of prescription painkillers they say were pushed on them by team trainers and doctors the NFL is looking for other ways to help players deal with the pain from a violent gameA Gallup poll last year found 58 percent of Americans believe marijuana should be legalized Thats already happened in Colorado and Washington  the states that are home of last seasons Super Bowl teamsThe World AntiDoping Agency has said it does not need to catch outofcompetition marijuana users And at least one highprofile coach Pete Carroll of the champion Seahawks publicly said hed like to see the NFL study whether marijuana can help playersThere are no hard numbers on how many NFL players are using marijuana but anecdotal evidence including the arrest or league discipline of no fewer than a dozen players for pot over the past 18 months suggests use is becoming more commonWashington Redskins defensive back Ryan Clark didnt want to pinpoint the number of current NFL players who smoke pot but said I know a lot of guys who dont regularly smoke marijuana who would use it during the seasonWashington wouldnt put a specific number on it but said he too knew his share of players who werent shy about lighting up when he was in the league including one guy who just hated the pain pills they were giving out at the time Another longtime defensive lineman Marcellus Wiley estimates half the players in the average NFL locker room were using it by the time he shut down his career in 2006They are leaning on it to cope with the pain said Wiley who played defensive line in the league for 10 seasons They are leaning on it to cope with the anxiety of the gameThe NFL is fighting lawsuits on two fronts  concussions and painkillers  both of which some argue could be positively influenced if marijuana were better tolerated by the leagueThe science however is slowmoving and expensive and might not ever be conclusive says behavioral psychologist Ryan Vandrey who studies marijuana use at John Hopkins Marijuana may work better for some people while narcotics and other painkillers might be better for othersDifferent medicines work differently from person to person Vandrey said Theres pretty good science that shows marijuana does have pain relieving properties Whether its a better pain reliever than the other things available has never been evaluatedWashington who is part of the concussion lawsuit is working with a biopharmaceutical and phytomedical company called KannaLife Sciences that recently received licensing from the National Institutes of Health NIH to develop a drug to treat concussions using derivatives from medical marijuanaCofounder Thoma Kikis who has been working on cannibasbased solutions to concussions for a few years said he approached the NFL about signing on to the researchThey didnt want to meet didnt want to take a position to create any kind of controversy Kikis said I understand that But ultimately theyre going to have to make a decision and look into different researchNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has treaded gingerly around the subject Before last seasons Super Bowl he said the league would follow the medicine and not rule out allowing players to use marijuana for medical purposes An NFL spokesman reiterated that this month saying if medical advisers inform the league it should consider modifying the policy it would explore possible changesA spokesman for the players union declined comment on marijuana beyond saying the union is always looking for ways to improve the drugtesting policy But earlier this year NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith said the marijuana policy is secondary when set against the failure to bring Human Growth Hormone testing into the game Some believe relaxing the marijuana rules could be linked to a deal that would bring in HGH testingIve heard that in conversations said Wiley a plaintiff in the painkiller lawsuit And I think its despicable that youd pit them against each otherThe NFL drug policy has come under even more scrutiny this summer after the NFL handed down a seasonlong suspension of Browns receiver Josh Gordon for multiple violations of the NFL substanceabuse policy That suspension especially when juxtaposed against the twogame ban Ray Rice received for domestic violence has led some to say the leagues priorities are out of whackIn June Harvard Medical School professor emeritus Lester Grinspoon one of the forefathers of marijuana research published an open letter to Goodell urging him to drop urine testing for weed altogether and more importantly fund a crash research project for a marijuanabased drug that can alleviate the consequences of concussionsAs much as I love to watch professional football Im beginning to feel like a Roman in the days when they would send Christians to the lions Grinspoon said I dont want to be part of an audience that sees kids ruin their future with this game and then the league doesnt give them any recourse to try to protect themselvesThe league does fund sportshealth research at the NIH to the tune of a 30 million donation it made in 2012 But the science moves slowly no matter where its conducted and as Vandrey says the NFL is in business for playing football not doing scientific researchMeanwhile marijuana becomes more and more acceptable across America every day But even with the Super Bowl being dubbed The Stoner Bowl and the issue hanging heavily over the NFLs marquee event the league has shown no signs of quick movementThe leagues threshold for a positive test remains 10 times lower than that of WADA which changed its limit last year in a nod to the reality that the drug is not a performance enhancerThe NFLs conundrum is figuring a graceful way to keep tabs on those who use marijuana recklessly  or recreationally  while giving others a legitimate form of pain reliefId like to see us advance the subject to where were all mature and we get it Wiley said and we let players make the decision for themselves___AP Sports Writer Joseph White in Washington contributed to this report,2014-08-14T11:47:29Z,drugs

Columbia punishable by only a 25 ticket one of the laxest drug laws in the nation has ignited a feud between Washingtons mayor and a Republican House member days before it is to take effectMayor Vincent C Gray urged district residents to boycott the beaches and resort towns of Marylands Eastern Shore after its congressman moved to block the citys marijuanafriendly law claiming more teenagers will take up drug useHe is interfering with democracy in this city and we want people to understand how we feel about it the mayor said in an interview He pointed out that Maryland like the district decriminalized marijuana this year and if the congressman Representative Andy Harris had been in the legislature he would have been outvotedMarijuana has potent political symbolism in this city with a large black population because the vast majority of arrests here for possession is of blacks But at issue is more than marijuana Infringements on Washingtons home rule hits an eversensitive nerve setting off howls of hypocrisy and tyranny in a city whose license plates read Taxation Without RepresentationA city of liberal voters the district has long had prickly relations with conservative members of Congress who set up parttime housekeeping here and thanks to the Constitution get a big say in local affairsThese are things people cant even do in their own home states and they use the District of Columbia to make an example out of us Mr Gray saidCity officials accuse federal lawmakers of grandstanding for voters back home or nationallyTheres a long tradition of people trying to score points off of us said David Catania a District of Columbia council memberIn recent years conservative Republicans have stopped the city from implementing a needle exchange program to slow the spread of HIV a registry of gay domestic partners and medical marijuana All eventually went forward sometimes after a decade of obstructionMr Catania accused Mr Harris of seeking to enhance his bona fides in a campaign for leadership of the Republican Study Committee a group that seeks to pull the House further right The chairmanship opened in a House leadership shuffle after the primary defeat of Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia who resigned as majority leader Mr Harris who is a physician won his seat in 2010 after a State Senate career in which he was known for opposing lateterm abortions as well as Xrated movies at the University of MarylandHe denied a political motive in opposing marijuana decriminalization If I were looking to advance my position among the broad spectrum of Republicans this is probably not the way to do it he saidHis objection to the districts law is because it reduces the penalty for possession of up to one ounce of marijuana to a 25 civil fine  a trivial sum in his view which he predicted would entice more teenagers to drug use One ounce can be almost 100 joints he said That is not a small amountSociety has some responsibility for protecting minors he added I think the DC law protects them in no way shape or formThe law passed in a 101 council vote in March Supporters cited a study showing a racial disparity in enforcing marijuana laws 90 percent of Washingtonians arrested on charges of possession were black in a city where blacks are 50 percent of the populationMr Harriss effort to block the law came in the form of an amendment to a spending bill which passed the House Appropriations Committee The rider would stop the district from using its tax revenues to enforce decriminalization The measure must survive a full House vote and in an unlikely scenario a joint conference with the Democratcontrolled SenateAttaching budget riders is a backdoor way for lawmakers to block local laws an authority granted to Congress in Article 1 of the Constitution The more straightforward and rarely successful path is a joint resolution of Congress overturning a district law Because Congress has not moved to do that within the required window of 60 legislative days the law is scheduled to take effect this weekIf Mr Harriss rider later becomes law it would make the citys decriminalization a brief interludeDistrict officials while acknowledging the constitutional authority of Congress denounced its interference as undemocraticShouldnt the people of the District of Columbia in a democracy be permitted to make decisions Mr Gray said We have more people in the District of Columbia than in the whole state of Wyoming or in Vermont I cant imagine Representative Harris feels he ought to interfere in the business of those two statesMichael K Fauntroy a political scientist at Howard University who has written extensively on Washington home rule said Congress has not stepped in as often in recent years as during a volatile period in the citys management before 2000But its still a tinderbox and it wouldnt take much to get Congress back involved he saidOne possible spark The citys move to go beyond marijuana decriminalization to full legalization This week activists presented signatures to qualify a referendum for the November ballot that would legalize possession of up to two ounces of pot for personal use and the right to grow three marijuana plants at homePassage of the measure Initiative 71 would put the city in the vanguard of promarijuana jurisdictions including two Western states Colorado and Washington where legal retailers selling recreational marijuana opened this yearThe District of Columbias referendum would not allow sales But the prospect of marijuana plants bending to the sun in the windows of Capitol Hill rowhouses might prove too great a provocation to many lawmakersI think Congress would step in to overturn it Mr Fauntroy said Especially if Republicans take control of the SenateHowever in the face of a sweltering summer it does not appear that many residents have heeded the mayors call to skip their traditional visits to the Eastern Shore beaches and bay towns in Mr Harriss districtWe had huge crowds in town for the Fourth of July said Donna Abbott director of tourism for Ocean City Md a popular destination on the Atlantic Ocean,2014-07-14T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/09/nyregion/brooklyn-district-attorney-to-stop-prosecuting-low-level-marijuana-cases.html,After months of resistance from the New York Police Department the Brooklyn district attorneys office announced on Tuesday that it would immediately carry out its plan to stop prosecuting most lowlevel marijuana casesThe policy was proposed in a draft confidential memorandum in April but was delayed as prosecutors and police officials tried to iron out their differences in meetings and phone callsThe policy described in a memo dated Tuesday still offers plenty of exceptions Only those with no criminal records or minimal ones qualify and the cases of people caught smoking in public spaces  and especially around children  will not automatically be thrown outThe district attorney Kenneth P Thompson said in the memo that the policy was set up to keep nonviolent people and especially young people of color out of the criminal justice system an open case Mr Thompson wrote can lead to problems with jobs housing and school for defendantsThe policy became an early criminal justice policy test for Mayor Bill de Blasio a fellow Democrat who had criticized police arrest practices over marijuana in terms similar to Mr Thompsons But in negotiating the policy the mayor seemed to defer to his police commissioner William J Bratton a proponent of the brokenwindows approach to policing that holds that stopping lowerlevel crimes leads to stopping major crimesThe policy places the Police Department in what its officials say is a difficult position There will be one set of enforcement rules in Brooklyn and another in the four other boroughsIn response to the policy Commissioner Bratton released a statement saying that he understood that Mr Thompson had the prerogative to decline to prosecute any criminal offense in BrooklynHowever in order to be effective our police officers must enforce the laws of the State of New York uniformly throughout all five boroughs of the city Mr Bratton said Accordingly the Kings County policy change will not result in any changes in the policies and procedures of the NYPDOver the past 15 years marijuana arrests in New York have soared partly because a rising number of stopandfrisk encounters led to searches of peoples pocketsThere were 8150 cases in Brooklyn in which the top count was a minor marijuana possession charge in the year ending June 30 according to the memo on Tuesday Marijuana arrests have decreased during the first six months of this year compared with the same period in 2013The police were initially wary that the policy was a blanket one covering every arrest but the Police Department was mollified when it became clear that there would be a casebycase review according to a person involved in the negotiationsAnother specific concern was whether Mr Thompsons office would prosecute members of crews on marijuanarelated arrests Such arrests can be used by the police as part of its larger antigang strategy in specific precincts and department officials want to preserve that option the person saidPolice officials also pushed for the ability to make cases on someone smoking or holding lighted marijuana which they said was a publicsafety issue particularly if the person was somewhere like a playground a law enforcement official saidThe district attorneys office agreed to add language in its policy that the office may prosecute a defendant charged with smoking or holding lighted marijuana in a public placeWhether they are smoking or holding marijuana 16 and 17yearolds will be routed through a diversion program so they may be successfully redirected onto a healthier path the memo readsUnder the new policy those arrested for marijuanarelated offenses in Brooklyn will still be taken to the precinct station house and then be sent to central booking where they would await the next days incourt arraignment in a holding cell Or the police may give the offender a desk appearance ticket for court on a given dateIf the district attorney decides not to prosecute and the person is in the system the office will tell the police to free the person If the person has received a desk appearance ticket and the district attorney decides not to prosecute the office will send a letter telling the person that the case will not be prosecuted and that there is no need for a court appearance In both instances the offenders fingerprints will be destroyedThe policy covers possession of marijuana in the fifth degree a misdemeanor for either holding or burning marijuana in the open or possessing up to two ounces of marijuana and unlawful possession of marijuana which is a violationThe wording in the memorandum seems to reflect the political nature of the negotiations in one passage which was not part of the draft memo the district attorney pays homage to the policeThe policy does not undermine the authority of the police to enforce the law the memo read This office respects the officers of the New York City Police DepartmentWe recognize that the possession of marijuana is illegal in this state and that the police when acting in a constitutional manner have authority to arrest offenders who break the lawHowever prosecutors believe the new policy will result in a better use of the offices resources and be more costeffectiveBut the primary reason for the new policy the memo continues is because the district attorney has a duty to reform and improve the administration of justice not merely to convictIn the majority of lowlevel marijuana possession cases Mr Thompson wrote obtaining a conviction against the defendant does not advance public safety with fairness and justice and indeed might well sabotage that

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/us/politics/medical-marijuana-research-hits-the-wall-of-federal-law.html,Nearly four years ago Dr Sue Sisley a psychiatrist at the University of Arizona sought federal approval to study marijuanas effectiveness in treating military veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder She had no idea how difficult it would beThe proposal which has the support of veterans groups was hung up at several regulatory stages requiring the researchs private sponsor to resubmit multiple times After the proposed study received final approval in March from federal health officials the lone federal supplier of research marijuana said it did not have the strains the study needed and would have to grow more  potentially delaying the project until at least early next yearThen in June the university fired Dr Sisley later citing funding and reorganization issues But Dr Sisley is convinced the real reason was her outspoken support for marijuana researchThey could never get comfortable with the idea of this controversial highprofile research happening on campus she saidDr Sisleys case is an extreme example of the obstacles and frustrations scientists face in trying to study the medical uses of marijuana Dating back to 1999 the Department of Health and Human Services has indicated it does not see much potential for developing marijuana in smoked form into an approved prescription drug In guidelines issued that year for research on medical marijuana the agency quoted from an accompanying report that stated If there is any future for marijuana as a medicine it lies in its isolated components the cannabinoids and their synthetic derivativesScientists say this position has had a chilling effect on marijuana researchThough more than one million people are thought to use the drug to treat ailments ranging from cancer to seizures to hepatitis C and chronic pain there are few rigorous studies showing whether the drug is a fruitful treatment for those or any other conditionsA major reason is this The federal government categorizes marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug the most restrictive of five groups established by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 Drugs in this category  including heroin LSD peyote and Ecstasy  are considered to have no accepted medical use in the United States and a high potential for abuse and are subject to tight restrictions on scientific studyIn the case of marijuana those restrictions are even greater than for other controlled substances Marijuana remains illegal under federal law though nearly half the states and the District of Columbia allow its medical use and two Colorado and Washington have legalized its recreational useTo obtain the drug legally researchers like Dr Sisley must apply to the Food and Drug Administration the Drug Enforcement Administration and the National Institute on Drug Abuse  which citing a 1961 treaty obligation administers the only legal source of the drug for federally sanctioned research at the University of Mississippi Dr Sisleys proposed study also had to undergo an additional layer of review from the Public Health Service that is not required for other controlled substances in such researchThe process is so cumbersome that a growing number of elected state officials medical experts and members of Congress have started calling for loosening the restrictions In June a letter signed by 30 members of Congress including four Republicans called the extra scrutiny of marijuana projects unnecessary saying that research has often been hampered by federal barriersIt defies logic in this day and age that marijuana is still in Schedule 1 alongside heroin and LSD when there is so much testimony to what relief medical marijuana can bring Gov Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island said in an interview In late 2011 he and the governor of Washington at the time Christine O Gregoire filed a petition asking the federal government to place the drug in a lower category The petition is still pending with the DEADespite the mounting push there is little evidence that either Congress or the Obama administration will change marijuanas status soon In public statements DEA officials have made their displeasure known about states legalizing medical and recreational marijuanaThe agencys position seems at odds with that of President Obama whose Justice Department has allowed states to legalize either medical or recreational marijuana as long as they follow certain federal priorities such as not allowing sales to juveniles Mr Obama has also said that he believes marijuana is no more dangerous than alcohol and that he is bothered by the disproportionate number of minorities incarcerated for possession of the drugAsked if there was an inconsistency between the presidents stance and that of the Drug Enforcement Administration a White House spokesman Matt Lehrich said The administrations policy continues to be that while the prosecution of drug traffickers remains an important priority targeting individual marijuana users is not the best allocation of federal law enforcement resources The DEA is carrying out that policyThere are signs though of a possible shift in attitude within the federal government In May the DEA issued new rules to increase the governments production of marijuana for research this year to 650000 grams from 21000 gramsAnd at the National Institute on Drug Abuse for instance records show that at the beginning of this year there were 28 active grants for research into the possible medical benefits of marijuana in six disease categoriesMost of the studies focus on the potential therapeutic uses of individual cannabinoid chemicals from marijuana or synthetic versions and not the plant itself Furthermore a dozen or so of those studies are being conducted with animals and not humansAdditionally other National Institutes of Health entities have been supporting marijuana research As for independently funded marijuana research the federal government has cleared 16 projects since 1999 13 of them at the University of California San DiegoMoving the drug to a less restrictive category could do more than reduce some obstacles to research proponents say It would be a significant step toward allowing doctors around the country to prescribe the drug Federal lawmakers say it could also permit medical marijuana operations that are legal at the state level to take business deductions on their federal taxesDr Sisleys predicament shows that even in states like Arizona where medical marijuana is legal the matter remains politically volatile Last month Arizona authorized the use of marijuana for patients undergoing conventional treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder Dr Sisleys study is supposed to use five different strains of marijuana that would be smoked or vaporized by 70 veterans The goal is to develop a marijuana drug in plant form that would be smoked or vaporized approved by the Food and Drug AdministrationHer firing seemed to stem from a fight over money In March the Arizona House passed a Republicansponsored bill designed to provide her project with some funding from fees collected in the states medical marijuana program But the measure died when State Senator Kimberly Yee a Republican who is the chairwoman of the Education Committee refused to put the legislation on the panels agenda Ms Yee said at the time that she preferred the funds be used for antidrug educationAngry about her opposition to the bill a group of veterans began a recall effort against Ms Yee Some of those veterans had been treated by Dr Sisley in the past and Senate leaders concluded that Dr Sisley herself was involved in the campaignThe State Senate president Andrew Biggs called the universitys chief lobbyist Tim Bee to complain that Dr Sisley seemed to be lobbying too aggressively and inappropriately Tim said he would call me back after he found out more Mr Biggs said in an interview And then he did and told me This will not be a problem going forwardIn April a university vice president who said he was calling on behalf of the president Ann Weaver Hart told Dr Sisley that Mr Biggs thought she should resign Dr Sisley recounted In June she received a letter from the university saying her annual employment contract would not be renewed as of Sept 26Dr Sisley denied participating in the recall effort She acknowledged talking to senators and their aides about funding but as a member of the Arizona Medical Association The university could not take the political heat from the hyperconservative legislators and fired me and deserted all these veterans who have been fighting alongside me for years she saidA university spokesman Chris W Sigurdson said that while university policy prevented him from discussing specifics about Dr Sisleys case the school had not been pressured to fire her Mr Biggs also denied trying to get her fired He added that the university had proposed that another faculty member take over the project as lead investigatorLate last month the university notified Dr Sisley that it had denied her appeal for reinstatement Rick Doblin founder and executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies which is sponsoring Dr Sisleys research said he would now try to persuade the Arizona Board of Regents to allow the study to continue at another state institute with Dr Sisley as the lead investigatorMr Doblin said he was committed to staying with her as the lead investigator and would help her look for an alternate research location A switch to a new study location would require further regulatory review for the proposed research which still needs another approval from the DEA Mr Doblin

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/opinion/sunday/high-time-the-public-lightens-up-about-weed.html,When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992 he admitted that he had experimented with marijuana but said he didnt like it didnt inhale it and never tried it again Whatever the accuracy of that statement he was accused of pandering to the marijuanawary voting publicFlash forward to the early stages of the 2008 presidential campaign At an event in Iowa thencandidate Barack Obama disclosed that he had not only smoked marijuana as a young man but inhaled it too That was the point he said The public responded with a shrugBetween the two campaigns Americans had loosened up considerably By the time Mr Obama was wooing voters in Iowa Nancy Reagans just say no slogan was a relic of a fustier era and Weeds a comedy about a widowed mother who sells marijuana to support her family was on TV Few people remembered Judge Douglas Ginsburg who in 1987 had to withdraw from consideration as a Supreme Court justice after admitting that he had used marijuana while a professor at Harvard Law SchoolSeventyeight percent of Americans thought marijuana should be illegal in 1991 That figure fell to 57 percent in 2008 according to the Pew Research Center In 2013 for the first time in over four decades of polling on the issue prohibition was a minority position Fiftytwo percent said they favored legalizing marijuana use 45 percent were opposedIt seems likely that the legalization majority will continue to grow Pews latest survey says 54 percent of Americans now support legalization That includes 52 percent of baby boomers who opposed legalization in the 1980s and 69 percent of millennials As with samesex marriage young people do not seem to understand what all the fuss is about On these two social issues theyre libertariansSo what happened How did we get from just say no to no big deal from I didnt inhale to that was the point Americans are not on the whole more liberal politically than they used to be  Gallup polling on ideological selfidentification has been quite consistent for 20 years They simply appear to have come around to the view that the war on marijuana is more harmful than marijuana itselfNearly threequarters of Americans 72 percent say government efforts to enforce marijuana laws cost more than they are worth Even Republicans who tend to be more skeptical of legalization overwhelmingly hold that opinion 67 percent And a shrinking share of the population believes marijuana is a gateway substance that leads to harder drugs 38 percent in 2013 versus 60 percent in 1977 or that marijuana use is morally wrong 32 percent in 2013 down 18 points since 2006Starting with California in the mid1990s Americans have seen state after state legalize the drug for medical use  and two states legalize it for general use  without enduring fire and brimstone Theyve heard about ordinary people arrested on possession charges who cannot find jobs because of their criminal record And theyve read statistics showing a persistent racial bias in enforcement Black citizens are nearly four times as likely as white people to be arrested for possessionPerhaps Americans have also been swayed by the array of public figures who have spoken out against prohibition Pat Robertson the founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network told The Times in 2012 that we should treat marijuana the way we treat beverage alcohol Ive never used marijuana and I dont intend to he added but its just one of those things that I think This war on drugs just hasnt succeeded Bob Barr a former congressman and Grover Norquist president of Americans for Tax Reform signed a letter to Congress in 2009 arguing that each state should have the right to dictate its own marijuana policy Giving states this authority they said would free federal law enforcement resources for the more urgent tasks of thwarting apprehending and prosecuting international terrorists or murderersBut Americans are not deriving their opinions on marijuana just from the media Fortyeight percent of respondents told Pew in 2013 that they had tried marijuana up from 38 percent a decade earlier One in 10 said they had used the drug in the last year Someone whos tried marijuana is unlikely to succumb to Reefer Madnessstyle fearmongering or to less hysterical but equally invalid ideas about the medical risks of occasional use Roughly seven in 10 Americans believe alcohol is more detrimental to a persons health which is what the scientific establishment believesThis isnt the first time the nation seemed to be heading toward more liberal marijuana laws In 1972 the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse unanimously recommended decriminalization in 1977 President Jimmy Carter asked Congress to accept that advice But there was a backlash movement led in part by suburban parents worried that weed was turning their children into layaboutsAmericans still associate smoking marijuana with apathy Theres a whole subgenre of Hollywood comedies devoted to stoned antics like Pineapple Express or the Harold and Kumar series which keep alive the impression that weed is the drug of choice of young people whod rather sit on the couch eating snacks than grow up and get a job Only a minority of Americans now think its the governments responsibility to discourage that behavior through the criminal justice system A majority believe that the war on marijuana has failed and that its time to end itOn Monday at 420 pm Eastern Time Andrew Rosenthal the editorial page editor will

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/world/europe/marijuana-clubs-rise-out-of-decades-old-spanish-laws.html,BARCELONA Spain   On a recent evening two vacationing German college students armed with addresses they had gotten off the Internet were trying to get into one of Barcelonas new marijuana clubsThey were not members But no matter They quickly found a club near the citys central boulevard La Rambla that was willing to ignore the rules helping them choose from a dozen strains of marijuana for sale in plastic bins before letting them settle into the cushy lounge area to light upFortyfive minutes later they were back on the street smiling It was very nice said one of the students who had researched cannabis clubs before choosing Barcelona as a holiday destination We will go back tomorrowThe number of cannabis clubs that have opened in Barcelona recently has some experts saying this city will soon challenge Amsterdam as the goto destination for vacationers who want to get high in peaceEven as Amsterdam has wrestled with drug tourism in recent years reducing the number of coffee shops where it is legal to buy and smoke marijuana and hashish about 300 new cannabis clubs have opened in Barcelona and the surrounding Catalan region a result at least in part of enterprising Spaniards looking for new ways to earn a living experts sayIt is not that Barcelona officials have given their blessing to this new phenomenon The clubs are operating under decadesold Spanish laws that allow anyone to grow and smoke marijuana in private or to band together with others to form a cannabis club as long as it is a nonprofit organization for members only something like a chess or a cooking clubBut in the last three years new clubs have opened particularly in tourist areas like La Rambla in many cases circumventing the spirit if not the letter of the law While some clubs refuse walkin customers like the German college students many of them offer membership about 20 euros or about 27 over the Internet or by phoneThe clubs vary enormously from basement rooms equipped with foosball tables and huge television sets to more elegant settings with designer chandeliers and fresh fruit drink bars Some give marijuana away to those who use it for medical purposes and see a business in this area Others cater only to recreational users Few of the clubs are noticeable from the streetThe Rambla Dragon Club for instance which opened last year is on the ground floor of an apartment building Only a small sign over the doorbell as well as the constant presence of young people squinting to read it indicates its presence It has the feel of a Starbucks without windows its high ceilings and a mighty ventilation system keeping the air fresh Some of the smokers sit at tables with their laptops open Others sit in on sofas watching movies on a giant screenSome cannabis advocates say the clubs are a bright spot in the economy Though they are nonprofits advocates say the clubs are generating thousands of jobs and tax revenues for the state In addition to selling a wide array of cannabis products and hashish many of the clubs also sell food and drinks and offer extras to their members like live music nights and Pilates classesAlbert Ti the president of Fedcac an association of cannabis clubs in the region of Catalonia that includes Barcelona said the clubs now had 165000 members up from virtually none five years ago His association was formed in 2011 with only a handful of clubs in existence he saidOne reason for the growth he said was that young people saw the clubs as a way to make a living Another factor he said was Barcelonas new antismoking laws which went into effect in bars and restaurants in January 2011 and sent cannabis smokers who are often also tobacco smokers looking for new places to congregateThe reality is this Mr Ti said Consumers think this is better than buying drugs on the streetRegional officials say that many of the clubs do cater mostly to Spaniards including one club in which all the members are women in their 80s But Barcelona officials are so concerned about the rapid increase in such establishments and this citys growing reputation as a place to get a legal high that they decided in June to put a oneyear moratorium on new licenses while they consider issues such as proximity to schoolsYes its a problem said Joan Delort the head of prevention security and mobility for Barcelona In a very few years you have a huge registration of cannabis users It is very hard to determine what is really going on But in 18 months you have clubs that are in a very small location that have registered 4000 members Its just impossible that they could have that manySome of the biggest names in the marijuana world are here The Strain Hunters for instance a Dutch group that makes documentaries about the hunt for native strains of marijuana around the world opened a club here in March on a charming side street not far from La RamblaWith oneway windows that give the space an open and airy feel but prevents passersby from looking in it has the look and the feel of an upscale bar For those who want to get an early start coffee and fresh croissants are available for breakfast and members can opt for rarer cannabis products such as pure cannabis resin in the shape of a butterflyWebsites that review the clubs such as MarijuanaGamesorg and WeBeHighorg are giving Barcelona clubs high marks for both the quality and the variety of cannabis products they sell as well as for offering a far more pleasant atmosphere than most Amsterdam coffee shops which they say usually offer stale marijuanaOn a recent morning Olivier Vervaet a 21yearold nightclub worker was at the Strain Hunters Club looking over the cannabis menu while having a coffee I joined because this was just a great place to relax he said I can sit down and someone will bring me a drink and a joint and I dont have to worry about the policeA few times a month the police have stepped in taking action against clubs caught leafleting on the street for instance But Edward Sallent the inspector general of community policing for the Catalan regional police said it was difficult to move against the clubs Its a complex situation because a lot of the acts and behaviors are not forbidden he said Selling and trafficking are illegal but consumption noMany advocates say they believe the clubs are cutting down on street sales But Mr Sallent says he doubts that He says the clubs are too new to know exactly what impact they will have There may be all kinds of costs he said Maybe it will affect the value of property Who knowsSome of those involved in managing the clubs in Barcelona hope that Spain will go further in legalizing marijuana soon Though the clubs are run as nonprofit entities some clearly represent big investments One such club RMD has set up an area for members who use marijuana to soothe the effects of chemotherapy or for other medical purposesIt even hired a doctor to discuss their marijuana use and to help them with any issues that might arise Tony Levi who coordinates this aspect of the club said he became interested in the medical benefits of cannabis when his father had cancerHe says he believes that eventually Spain will recognize cannabis for medical use and that the services the club is providing will be covered by insurance I do see a business model here he said,2014-07-11T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/07/us/07potshop.html,VANCOUVER Wash   John Larson a recently retired high school science and math teacher hopes to be in the first wave of legal recreational marijuana salespeople opening shop here in Washington State this weekMr Larson 67 who was talked into the venture by his children said he had never tried marijuana and in fact voted against legalizing it in 2012 But as a business idea  well thats differentIf people were dumb enough to vote it in Im all for it he said over a cup of coffee near his shop here in southern Washington just across the Columbia River from Portland Ore Theres a demand and I have a productAfter nearly two years of anticipation excitement and dread by stilldivided Washington residents the first licenses for legal sale of recreational marijuana will be issued Monday state officials said Sales are to start about 24 hours laterBut the rollout is not unfolding as anyone quite expected it to from the seemingly unlikely businesspeople like Mr Larson who are leading the charge to the downright odd pattern of where the first shops will openSeattle for example with a population of 652000 the states largest city and perhaps most marijuanafriendly will have only a single store initially and a tiny one at that 620 square feet called Cannabis City But Vancouver about onefourth Seattles size in a largely conservative county that has tried to slow or stop marijuana businesses with strict landuse rules could have three shops Tacoma also in a county that has tried to block marijuana businesses may have fourThe pattern came down to chance and circumstance said Mikhail Carpenter a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board which wrote the regulations and administers the system With multiple inspections and requirements to meet a lot of people werent ready Mr Carpenter saidOnly about 20 licenses out of 334 authorized by the regulations will be granted in this first wave Mr Carpenter said with many wouldbe operators slowed by financing troubles inspection questions or other issues Mr Larson for example applied for three licenses in three cities and two were denied in each case because state inspectors said the boundary line was too close to a licensed day care centerHe disagreed but quickly gave up You cant argue with the stateAnd even the shops that open will not have that much to sell because marijuana growers got their licenses only in March not enough time to produce a big crop Mr Larson expects to have perhaps two pounds which he expects could be gone in hours and no edible products at all since no statelicensed marijuana food producers are up and runningSome retailers said they planned to ration supplies in the early days allowing customers to buy only a small fraction of the ounce that the law allows for adults over 21Low supply in turn means high prices at least at first with an ounce  should anyone even be able to buy one  expected to cost at least 400 That is much more than a buyer would typically pay on the black market here in Washington according to The Price of Weed a website that surveys marijuana prices by stateBut in some ways people like Mr Larson put the most distinctive stamp on Washingtons halting first steps Voters in Colorado approved marijuana legalization at the same time that Washington did in 2012 but then went down a much different regulatory path that pushed things faster with stores open since JanuaryColorado also created the first recreational marijuana shops from the medical marijuana dispensaries that were already in business which meant that many of the first wave of operators were already in the marijuana tradeWashington by contrast started from scratch throwing open the application process and giving medical marijuana dispensary operators no edge in the competition for licensesIn the little town of Prosser population 5800 in south central Washington for example two chiropractors formed a partnership and hope to open this week In Seattle a former restaurant and bar owner is expected to get the first licenseRamsey Hamide a manager of Main Street Marijuana a shop here in downtown Vancouver that plans to open Wednesday came into the business from the concert ticket industry He and the other manager Chris Stipe are setting up shop in a former jewelry store after visiting more than 20 shops in Colorado to look for ideasWe saw what to do  and also what not to do Mr Hamide said Anything that felt confining in particular  security doors and waiting areas for access into the product displays a common setup for medical dispensaries  was rejected he saidKeep it light open and friendly he said of their design planAnd while many of the new business operators are brimming with optimism about the new market others say the road ahead might be harder than people want to believe Protesters in Prosser for example have been regularly picketing the chiropractic office of Tim Thompson a coowner of the towns marijuana shop Altitude carrying signs with slogans like God Judges SinInitiative 502 which legalized recreational marijuana passed with 55 percent of the vote statewide but lost in much of central and eastern WashingtonThey camp out in front of my office every day Mr Thompson said in a telephone interviewMr Larson who said his son had also gone into the business as a grower is also braced for a legal fight even as sales begin His shop has a Vancouver address and the city has been accepting marijuana businesses he said but the shop is on the boundary with an unincorporated area of Clark County where different rules apply So Mr Larson said he planned to be ready go to court on the opening day of business to fend off any efforts to close him downWhatever happens though he said will certainly make for an interesting adventure and after 35 years of teaching he said he was readyMy retirement date is when they close the lid on my coffin he said,2014-07-07T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/10/reform-conservatives-and-the-culture-wars/,After my foray yesterday into the specific case of Paul Ryan let me return to broader critiques of reform conservatism picking up threads from EJ Dionnes long essay on our little movement and some ofAndrew Sullivans comments this week I first read Dionnes essay some time ago and intended a long pointbypoint rejoinder Ive read so many far harsher less thoughtful critiques since however that upon rereading the essay seemed marvelously fairminded and worth recommending even if I obviously have disagreements with its substance But heres a prescriptive passage thats worth commenting on the Reformicons who are diverse in their views on social issues need to be bolder in approaching cultural modernization To have a future conservatism cannot view an increasingly diverse and tolerant America as a horror A Burkean traditionalism honors the gifts diverse communities bring to a nationAnd here from Sullivan is a more expansive version of the same argumentAnd then the reformicons are operating at a disadvantage in a culturally polarized America It would be great if this were not the case  but since a huge amount of both parties base mobilization requires intensifying the cultural conflict and since the divide is rooted in real responses to changing mores it will likely endure And that kind of climate makes pragmatic conservatism again less likely to get a hearingSo for example Im perfectly open to new ideas on say helping working class families with kids But some pretty basic concerns about the current GOP on cultural issues  its open hostility to my own civil marriage its absolutism on abortion its panic at immigration its tonedeafness on racial injustice  push me and many others into leaning Democrat for a while And its important to note that even the reformicons are diehard cultural and religious conservatives in most respectsOne answer here and its an important one is that for intertwined reasons of policy and politics reform conservatives arent actually trying to win over Sullivan or at least we arent trying to win him over first The immediate reformist priority the raison detre of the movement is serving the interests and winning the votes of those middle class parents with kids and people who might want to be middle class parents with kids on economic issues the question of how the Republican Party should adapt or not on the issues Sullivan lists is an important but ultimately secondorder concernMy friend PascalEmmanuel Gobry madea version of this caseyesterday which Ill quote from hereLeaving aside the tendentiousness of some of his formulations if there is one absolutist party on abortion in America for example it is the Democratic Party   Sullivan is certainly right the GOPs cultural populism turns off voters like himBut well the reform conservative disposition says that the GOP should not court voters like him by which I mean highly educated urban coastal First because as much as they wish it were not so they do not decide elections in America Second because reform conservatives see the main domestic policy challenge facing America as  the problems of working and lowermiddleclass Americans and that some of their concerns are cultural in nature and that while these concerns may come out in unproductive andor mistaken ways lashingout they are also the expressions of real serious concerns with regard to mainly the slow disintegration of what used to be regarded as the pillars of The Good Life in America namely marriage and the family and religiosityPerhaps another way to phrase this is that reform conservatism thinks that the GOP should be a populist party because well the populists are roughly right about what went wrong at least in a few key respects even if they sometimes are wrong about the particulars or about how to fix it The Democratic Party already has the uppermiddle class locked up precisely because it panders very well to their cultural prejudices  A Republican Party that tried to go after its slice while dumping its base which happens to be a plurality of voters in America would ipso facto become a rump Needless to say this is not something reform conservatives favorSo thats one possible and partial answer Another more conciliatory one is that both Dionne and Sullivan are correct to cast cultural outreach as a necessary and difficult aspect of conservative renewal but that theres room for disagreement about what form this outreach should take Even a figure like David Frum for instance whose relative social liberalism Dionne highlights wants the GOP to shift on abortion and samesex marriage  but not emphatically not on immigration or marijuana legalizationSo for instance while Im personally skeptical of the pass immigration reform to win Hispanics theory of Republican modernization Im quite invested in the make an actual pitch to AfricanAmerican voters on issues they care about and stop obsessing over voter ID theory And I think both reform conservatives and our close cousins libertarian populists have pushed Republicans many of whom from Rand Paul to even a Chris Christie havent needed that much pushing to take up causes like sentencing reform and drug law reform that might further this kind of outreach Its not a complete strategy it obviously exists in tension with other impulses and ideas within conservatism but its a first step at leastOn samesex unions meanwhile I understand that surrender is not exactly the same thing as outreach But I do think reform conservatives share the nearuniversal assumption that Sullivans civil marriage will be recognized in all fifty states within the next few years and our diehard social conservatism is mostly manifested in support for religiousliberty protections in a postWindsor worldan issue on which I know Sullivan himself has at least some sympathy for our perspective There will not be a Cameronstyle preemptive strike on gay rights its true where the GOP leapfrogs the Democrats to somehow back gay marriage even more strongly But neither will there be some conservatismwide outburst of hostility and rage I expect when Anthony Kennedy settles the debate for this generationI could be wrong about this perhaps as Greg Sargent argues hopes the next GOP primary will be consumed by a debate over a federal marriage amendment and other antiSSM unicorns But most likely not The typical religious conservative of my acquaintance considers the battle lost Fox News and other tubthumping outlets have never much cared for the issue anyway and ambitious Republican politicians will be happy to stop talking about it as they mostly have already Which is why I expect that meaningful public opposition to the redefinition of marriage will be largely depoliticized soon enoughconfined to polite mostly marginal intellectuals and clerics and impolite but equally marginal agitators Where the GOP is concerned that may not be modernization enough to satisfy Sullivan but it will be a pretty striking transformation nonethelessThen more broadly I think both Sullivan and Dionne might do well to ponder the possibility that having a more substantive economic agenda would itself be a significant form of conservative outreach to a more diverse America a way of showing greater respect for the everyday interests of nonconservatives on the one hand and a way of channeling certain forms of rightwing populist grievance in more productive directions on the other If youre talking about profamily tax policy for instance youre talking about an issue thats as relevant to single mothers and middleclass Latino parents as it is to married white women who already tend to pull the lever for the GOP If you have a plan to address longterm unemployment youre giving disaffected bluecollar whites a reason to vote for you that doesnt require encouraging a kind of white identity politics on cultural issues If your social conservatism comes equipped with a substantive socioeconomic vision its less likely to devolve into xenophobia or figurewagging reaction and less likely to be successfully caricatured as such by an opportunistic liberalism There isnt a bright line between economic and cultural outreach in other words the two arent identical but they run together more often than you might thinkThen a final point building off Gobrys own last line As much as cultural outreach matters I wouldnt want the kind of conservative political party that essentially declines to represent populist and social conservatives at all on many issues enforcing an elite consensus instead of representing its own constituents wherever those constituents seem too disreputable or insufficiently cosmopolitan This is what you have on the centerright in many European countries Sullivans native isle at times included and I dont think its worked out particularly well When it hasnt led directly to disaster see Eurozone disastrous antidemocratic expansion of its often shunted important issues immigration religious identity crime multiculturalism etc to a back burner where they simmer and simmer until some crisis makes them boil over and the next thing you know you have to deal with a Marine Le Pen if not a Golden Dawn And to a lesser extent this is the dynamic thats made the Tea Party so angry uncompromising and intermittently destructive in our own politics  the sense often somewhat accurate that their leaders want their votes but not their ideas and that there are semideliberate conspiracies to deceive them about what their elected representatives are really afterThe reality is that except in truly exceptional cases our politics is better off in the long run when views held by large proportions of the public are represented in some form by one of our two parties Right now to run down a partial list of divisive cultural issuesa plurality of Americans want the immigration rate decreased about half the country opposes affirmative action more than half supports the death penalty about half of Americans call themselves prolifeSupport for gay marriage and marijuana legalization has skyrocketed but in both cases about 40 percent of the country is still opposed Even independent of my own yes populist and socially conservative views I think these people these opinions deserve democratic representation Representation that leads and channels and restrains representation that recognizes trends and trajectories and political realities but also representation that makes them feel wellserved spoken for and in the case of issues where theyre probably on the losing side respected even in defeatBecause without that representation populism doesnt go away it festers Just ask David Cameron Sullivans example of a modernizing conservative a politician whose agenda has had a number of admirable features  but whose style and approach also helped roll out the red carpet for UKIP and Nigel Farage In the United States a more populist and conservative and religious country than Britain the Farage scenario would look wilder and stranger and much much worse for conservatism and the country And so Republican politicians interested in outreach and coalitionbuilding and modernization have an obligation to make sure they dont also create a pervasive sense of populist disenfranchisement along the wayIts not an easy challenge to meet and its one that  notwithstanding all of liberalisms weaknesses couldkeep the GOP out of the White House in 2016 and beyond But both practically and I would submit morally its one that simply cannot be evaded or escaped,2014-07-10T16:04:09Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/13/us/politics/ap-us-rethinking-pot-nations-capital.html,WASHINGTON   A debate over legalizing marijuana in the nations capital is focusing on the outsized number of arrests of African Americans on minor drug chargesPot legalization supporters in Colorado and Washington state also spoke about racial justice but their voters are mostly white and their campaigns focused more on other issues The race factor hits closer to many more homes in the District where nearly half the population is blackAnd that means this referendum could change how the nation talks about marijuana some drugpolicy experts sayI think DC is going to probably set off a chain of events in which communities of color generally and cities in particular take on the issue of legalization as a racial justice social justice issue in a much stronger way than they have so far said Bill Piper director of national affairs at the Drug Policy AllianceThere are many other differences between the District and states that have legalized pot The city is a patchwork of local and federal land and there will be no lighting up in front of the White House or at the Jefferson Memorial Also Washington remains under the thumb of Congress which could thwart the will of the voters as it has on other matters where liberal District tendencies clash with conservative priorities on Capitol HillNonetheless the District is on track to join Colorado and Washington state in legalizing marijuana A poll last month showed nearly 2 of every 3 voters favor the initiative which will be on Novembers ballot Voters in Alaska and Oregon also decide this fall whether to legalize potRoughly half of the Districts 646000 residents are black The American Civil Liberties Union found that in 2010 blacks were eight times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession in the District and 91 percent of those arrested that year were blackIt would alleviate a lot of problems said Kenneth Agee 46 a heating and air conditioning mechanic who plans to vote for legalization There may be less violence on the streets associated with marijuana trafficking and salesThe DC Council tried earlier this year to address racial disparities by decriminalizing marijuana as 17 states have done Possession of up to one ounce of pot in the District is now subject to a 25 fine among the lowest in the nation The law took effect in July despite an attempt by Rep Andy Harris a Maryland Republican to block the measureLegalization advocates say decriminalization hasnt done enough citing police statistics that show most of the 25 tickets are being handed out in predominantly black neighborhoodsWe can tell the police Guess what Its not even a crime You dont have to write a ticket said Adam Eidinger chairman of the DC Cannabis Campaign the group that crafted the initiative and got it on the ballotThe initiative also is notable for what it lacks Because ballot initiatives in the District cant affect the budget it does not provide for the legal sale of marijuana or set up a system to tax and regulate it That would be up to the mayor and the council Voters will also be choosing a new mayor in November to replace Vincent Gray and both leading candidates have said they support legalizationIn Colorado and Washington state the federal government said legal pot must be kept off federal property such as parks and other huge swaths of US land That could be more complicated in the District where the situation can change from block to block The parkland the federal government owns in the District for instance includes 59 innercity squares and trianglesBecause Congress has authority over lawmaking in the District the initiative wouldnt take effect until a congressional review period that could last several months The triedandtrue tactic for members of Congress who want to undo local laws in the District is to attach an amendment to a crucial piece of legislation such as a spending bill that funds the federal government Thats how Congress banned medical marijuana in the city for more than a decade after voters approved it Medical marijuana is now availableHarris said in a statement that he would consider using all resources available to a member of Congress to stop legalization If he attaches an amendment to a major bill its fate could depend on negotiations between the House Senate and White House The District hasnt always been the winner in such deals even during President Barack Obamas tenureSome voters remain skeptical of legalization out of concern that marijuana is harmful to young people Leaders of an antilegalization group known as Two Is Enough DC argue that District residents already suffer too much from drinking and smoking and dont need another legal drugWhere are the liquor stores in DC Theyre in the poorer communities theyre in the communities of color Theres more cigarette tobacco advertising in our community said Will Jones III the groups lead organizer Marijuana has been used to unfairly target our community Nevertheless to say that if we have it legal thats going to deal with the problem I dont understand that logic___,2014-10-13T14:20:19Z,drugs

intense getoutthevote drives are mobilizing in Oregon and Alaska to legalize retail sales of marijuana to anyone old enough to drinkBut backers of the legalpot ballot measures in both states have a challenge that their predecessors in Colorado and Washington state didnt face two years ago  increasing turnout of young voters in a midterm electionYoung voters who as a generation are more likely to support recreational marijuana usually turn out during presidential years like 2012 but stay home during midterms when the electorate skews older and more conservativeIf young people 18 to 29 years old vote like they did in 2012 Oregons Measure 91 for example would pass said Ethan Nadelmann head of Drug Policy Action a major contributor in the national campaign to legalize marijuanaThats really what it boils down to he saidWashington DC is voting on whether to make it legal to possess marijuana but not sell itWhatever happens in the states and the nations capital advocates plan to quickly shift their attention to the 2016 presidential elections and the big prize California where hopes are high for approval of legal pot despite a 2010 rejectionEven if all those things go down to defeat I still think its a clean slate in 2016 said Jeffrey Miron an economist at Harvard University and the Cato Institute who follows national drug policyMark Kleiman a drug policy consultant who helped Washington set up its legal marijuana industry said the outcomes in Oregon and Alaska will help determine the enthusiasm of funders financing the legalization campaign in CaliforniaIn the meantime the focus is on Oregon and AlaskaOregon is a blue state that decriminalized marijuana in 1973 and authorized medical marijuana in 1998The states southwestern corner is renowned for growing some of the nations best marijuana and attracts outlaw growers from the US and Mexico Medical pot dispensaries were approved last year to sell to nearly 70000 patientsAlaska by contrast is more conservative but theres a strong libertarian streak and small amounts of marijuana have been legal for personal use since a 1975 state Supreme Court ruling Medical pot is legal but not dispensariesBoth states have seen previous initiatives to legalize marijuana fail This time around campaigns have major contributions from outofstate donors who want see the legal pot movement garner more victoriesIn Alaska supporters of Measure 2 have raised more than 890000 nearly all of it from the Marijuana Policy Project the largest federal spender on marijuana advocacy Opponents have raised nearly 150000Despite the difference the no campaign  Big Marijuana Big Mistake  is not giving up relying heavily on volunteers social media letters to the editor and word of mouthMore and more Alaskans are donating to the no campaign said spokeswoman Deborah Williams Theyre convinced we need to defeat this measure And we will win this measureIn Oregon two groups backing Measure 91 have raised a total of nearly 4 million most of it spent on TV ads Opponents have raised 168000In the state where elections are settled exclusively by mail ballots closing the deal means a twostep process said Liz Kaufman campaign director for Yes on 91 People need to mark their ballots and then turn them inThe campaign is reaching out with TV phone trees doortodoor canvassing chalking on college campuses and a Facebook app that lets people track whether their friends have voted and nag them until they doYoud be surprised how many people mark up their ballots and dont turn them in Kaufman saidThe Facebook app didtheyvoteorg has been around since the 2012 election and is available to anyone campaigning in Oregon said Ben Unger of Our Oregon a nonpartisan getoutthevote organization It is especially effective in votebymail states like Oregon where people get their ballots weeks before election dayWhile other campaigns are using it the Yes on 91 campaign has dived in with both feet Former Portland Mayor Sam Adams sent out an email blast urging people to use it and phone bank volunteers finish their shifts with a round of nudging their Facebook friends campaign spokesman Peter Zuckerman saidIn Alaska a recent poll for initiative proponents shows overwhelming support among voters under 35 with the measure winning by 18 points Another for opponents shows it losing by 10 pointsIts a very polarized race said Anchorage pollster Ivan Moore who conducted the poll for the initiative sponsor Young people like it and old people dont And the trouble for the yes side is that old people vote and young people dontAnother key demographic is mothersWith only 168000 to spend the Noon91 campaign in Oregon used most of it to mail 155000 postcards to mothers from Portland to Eugene It focused on fears that marijuanainfused candy and sodas pose a danger to kidsThey have also flown in people from Colorado to speak out said Clatsop County Sheriff Tom Bergin a leader of the no campaign Its really difficult he said Weve got daytime jobs The potheads dont This is their job to get this legalizedPolls in Oregon have shown support for legalization declining as election day approaches but still with a fair chance of passing said Seattle pollster Stuart ElwayIn Washingtons experience the measure outperformed the polls he said What we have in Oregon right now is a statistical dead heat Its going to depend

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/nyregion/rikers-island-undercover-investigator-contraband-inquiry.html,Despite repeated promises by the Correction Department to tighten security at Rikers Island a city investigator posing as a guard last month was able to smuggle in heroin pills marijuana vodka and a razor blade an inquiry by the Department of Investigation foundThe city investigator carried the contraband  valued at over 22000  through six different security checkpoints used by jail employees hiding the drugs in his cargo pants and holding a water bottle filled with vodka the Department of Investigation said in a report released on ThursdayThe revelations once again raised questions about the citys ability to address the widespread corruption and brutality at Rikers detailed in several critical reports by federal and local authorities as well as the news media The Department of Investigation has been urging the Correction Department for years to improve screening of jail employees but to no availWeapons and narcotics remain easily available to any inmate with funds to pay for them the report saidThe report called on the Correction Department to take steps to bolster screening including starting to routinely use drugsniffing dogs at employee entrances Though the powerful correction officers union has long opposed such searches the correction commissioner Joseph Ponte told investigators that he would complyInvestigators say that while visitors to city jails bring in some contraband a large proportion of the illegal trafficking is carried out by uniformed guards and civilian employees The report described the arrests of six correction officers and a nurse for contraband over the last year and a halfGiven the extent of smuggling that we know goes on and given what we know about whats coming in from visitors a lot of stuff has to be coming in from guards and employees because this stuff doesnt magically appear said Mark Peters the Department of Investigation commissionerOn Sept 1 the Correction Department imposed what it described at the time as heightened security measures  including searching guards lunch containers  intended to target smuggling by employeesIt turns out these steps were not sufficient Mr Peters saidLast month the undercover investigator an employee with the Department of Investigation was able to sneak contraband into all six of the Rikers jails that he tried to enter The pockets of his cargo pants according to the report were bulging with 250 packets of heroin 24 strips of Suboxone a pain killer and a half pound of marijuanaAny kind of serious search by trained professionals should have caught this every time Mr Peters saidAt one facility the undercover guard set off the metal detector twice When a security officer asked the undercover guard to empty his pockets the undercover responded that he already had emptied them the report said The security officer accepted his answer without further inspection of his pocketsMr Peters said that correction officers and civilian staff members often do not sell the drugs directly to inmates Rather they serve as couriers shuttling contraband between people on the outside and the inmates for a fee that can range from 500 to 1000Mr Ponte in a statement said that he agreed with the Department of Investigations assessment that screening needed to be improvedI have zero tolerance for anyone including staff bringing contraband into DOC facilities he said As part of DOCs ongoing systemwide reforms we are working on significant new steps to improve our methods for searching for contrabandIn addition to the dogs Mr Ponte said that special operations officers would be posted at each entrance to inspect employees replacing the rankandfile guards who have typically carried out the searches There is also a plan to upgrade screening techniques to conform to federal airport security standardsThe Department of Investigation said that the drugsniffing dogs and new security teams should be put in place within six months Mr Peters said he expected that the dogs would be used for random searches at each of the 10 jails at Rikers several times a week though he said Mr Ponte would have the final say about the deployment of the canine unitsThe success of the new security measures could depend in large part on the response from the correction officers union and its president Norman Seabrook In an interview last week Mr Seabrook said even agreeing to the modest changes in September including checking the lunches caused friction with the rankandfileI took some heat for it he saidFor the report the Department of Investigation observed 15 shift changes and reviewed 50 hours of surveillance video from June through October monitoring the entry of more than 2500 employeesEven after the heightened security measures were imposed in September the report said that some officers still refused to have their food Xrayed or were allowed to place their lunch containers on top of the Xray machines without having it scannedSecurity officers also permitted some people to enter even though they had set off the metal detectors the

12 hours a day to nurture nearly grown plants in strains with vaguely aristocratic names like Argyle Houndstooth and TwillingThe new owner of this factory at 1 Hershey Drive is Tweed Marijuana It is one of about 20 companies officially licensed to grow medical marijuana in CanadaA court ordered the government to make marijuana available for medicinal purposes in 2000 but the first system for doing so created havoc The government sold directly to approved consumers but individuals were also permitted to grow for their own purposes or to turn over their growing to small operations The freeforall approach prompted a flood of complaints from police and local governmentsSo the Canadian government decided to create an extensive heavily regulated system for growing and selling marijuana The new rules allow users with prescriptions to buy only from one of the approved largescale profitseeking producers like Tweed a move intended to shut down the thousands of informal growing operations scattered across the countryThe requirements which went into effect in April are giving rise to what many are betting will be a lucrative new industry of legitimate producers The government

Mr Staples Probably not the best way to communicate to the mayor he saidHershey shut down its conveyor belts in 2008 But that was just the beginning of the bad news for Smiths Falls A year later the province of Ontario closed a nearby home for up to 2650 developmentally disabled adults Stanley Tools an industrial company left as did two other American manufacturers And a portion of the Canadian Pacific Railways old transcontinental line for which Smiths Falls was a regional hub was ripped up In all about 1700 jobs vanished according to Mr StaplesAt first Hershey promised to help the town find a new business to take over the plant A flavoredwater company expressed interest but couldnt get the money together In 2012 Hershey sold the plant to a holding company controlled by the Omnicom Group the adagency giant The new owner inquired about demolition permits last summerAround the same time Mr Rifici who lives in Ottawa showed up in Smiths FallsMr Staples and the town council were supportive They believed that Tweed would help stem even if just a little the outflow of jobs and investmentIf its going to happen somewhere in Canada why not Smiths Falls Mr Staples said Its an opportunity to be part of an industry thats sanctioned by the federal government he said Its going to create 100 jobsThe mayor also had a personal reason When his younger brother was dying from colon cancer 11 years ago marijuana was the only way he found relief from his painDespite the warm welcome Tweed has had to overcome the stigma of a onceillicit business Mr Rifici said the factory owner wouldnt lease the plant to a startup focused on marijuana So Mr Rifici and his business partner Bruce Linton had to form a small investment pool to buy the plant for an undisclosed amountEven once in the building Mr Rifici said it was impossible to get a bank loan to buy equipment Initially Tweed raised money from private investors More recently the company has tapped the public markets for 15 million Canadian dollars by issuing stockOther licensed marijuanagrowing operations have faced similar impediments When Privateer decided to start Tilray for example Mr Kennedy crisscrossed Canada to find the right spot It was apparent he said that Privateer would hit resistance in many areas Illegal growing operations had attracted widespread negative publicity for destroying rental houses with mold and creating fire hazards with their lighting systemsIn Nanaimo British Columbia Mr Kennedy found economic development officials who eagerly courted Tilray The city was looking for new businesses to offset a gradual decline of the forestry and fishing industries the regions historical economic base The officials introduced local zoning bylaws that made it easier for the medical marijuana industry to operateTilray has since bought a building for 35 million and spent 17 million to renovate it The company employs 65 people with plans to increase that number to 100 One hundred new jobs in a community of less than 100000 thats a big deal Mr Kennedy saidStill he said it took a while to find a bank that would deal with a marijuana grower The Royal Bank of Canada eventually agreed to take Tilrays account and to process its credit card transactionsNor has Tweed won over everyone in Smiths Falls Like many small bluecollar towns in rural North America it has an illegaldrug problem mainly crack cocaine and marijuanaDarlene Kantor 50 works as a building manager and she says she is thrilled that Tweed came to town with its jobs and millions of dollars of investment But my main concern is Is it going to make the illegal drugs more rampant she saidSome are more skeptical about whether Tweed will be able to provide many jobs They were talking about creating jobs and such and its not going to its not going to do anything said Andrew Brinkworth 18 outside the downtown Tim Hortons A lot of people here have criminal records and theyre not going to be able to get a job at the plant if they have a recordA 300Page ApplicationDressed in a casual shirt and slacks Mr Rifici 39 is built from an entrepreneurial mold His fast speech and seemingly inexhaustible enthusiasm appear to be byproducts of pitching startup ideas to investors or anyone who will listen for two decadesHis early interest in the Internet came from playing simple textbased games Slaying virtual dragons with someone from Australia from my computer in my parents basement in 199192 was eyeopening to how the Internet would fundamentally alter how we lived he said So I had to get involved in some wayIn 1995 during his third year of computer engineering studies at the University of Ottawa he decided to start an Internet service provider He sold the business in 2003 for 11 million Canadian dollars 1 million to a larger competitor Cybersurf where he became chief financial officer Over the next two decades he helped start a dozen tech companiesHis interest in politics indirectly inspired his marijuana business Mr Rifici who volunteers as chief financial officer of the Liberal Party of Canada one of the three main national parties closely tracked the evolution of marijuana lawsIn October 2012 Health Canada the federal agency responsible for drug controls published a long technical list of proposed reforms One thing caught his eye Under the new approach customers could buy only online or through call centers types of systems that his Internet businesses had operatedBut his background didnt prepare him for the regulatory strictures of the medical marijuana business Accustomed to developing startups on the fly with little capital Mr Rifici and Mr Linton another Ottawa entrepreneur who is Tweeds chairman underestimated the money they would need by a factor of three largely because of the governments regulatory demands The application ran 300 pages not including attachments And before they could even submit applications Tweed and other growers had to secure sites for their operations and obtain all local permissions Applicants who passed the initial vetting then had to pass a final twoday inspectionThe requirements are significant Growers must have sophisticated carbon filtration systems to prevent the smell of marijuana from wafting outside They must maintain highsecurity measures like biometric thumbprint readers Employees need to pass rigorous security checks conducted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police which take four to six monthsIf I knew how much regulatory overhead there would be from the beginning I would have probably been just as excited about the industry Mr Rifici said But I might have thought that I might not be able to get thereNothing like a bit of ignorance to allow you to move aheadThe red tape was part of an effort to reform Canadas initial approach to medical marijuana In court filings the government suggested that the old system had become little more than a legal veneer for recreational growers with a significant amount of marijuana making its way to illegal operations Health Canada said users on average grew enough marijuana to roll 54 to 90 cigarettes a day far beyond what they needed for personal useThere was big big diversion going on Brent Zettl the chief executive of Prairie Plant Systems the company that grew and distributed the governmentsupplied marijuana under the old system The company is now among the newly approved growers They ducked behind legitimate patients and used them he saidTrying to Convince DoctorsWalking the vast 425000squarefoot factory Mr Rifici talks animatedly about Tweeds next steps Just behind the new entrance of glass and shiny stainless steel he has carved out space for a gift shop He also hopes to lure a craft brewer into the unused portion of the factory He wants to make 1 Hershey Drive a destination for tourists againTweed is taking a subdued almost artisanal approach to its branding avoiding the CheechandChong vibe of some rivals Many of its marijuana strains are named after fusty fabrics like tweed as well as people and places associated with such clothes The Herringbone strain is supposed to help with depression Bakerstreet is used to treat anxiety Donegal is promoted as a pain relieverBut the industry faces an uphill battle as prominent doctors researchers and even the Canadian Medical Association are advising against prescribing marijuana at all Marijuana they say has not been through the testing and approval process required for other pharmaceuticalsDr MaryAnn Fitzcharles a rheumatologist and professor of medicine at McGill University in Montreal was the lead author of a widely publicized paper recommending that without clinical evidence marijuana should not be prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis About 65 percent of users in Canada under the old system said they suffered from that condition She compares the medical claims for marijuana to those once made for tobaccoI dont think any physician today would say I suggest you take up smoking cigarettes to deal with your anxiety Dr Fitzcharles saidSo Tilray Prairie Plant and Tweed are creating sales teams to persuade doctors to prescribe marijuana Tweeds chief medical adviser Dr John Gillis an emergencyroom and chronicpain doctor in Dartmouth Nova Scotia is working to develop best practices for prescribing marijuana Christopher Murray who worked with a Canadian agency that evaluates new drugs and medical technology leads a medical education and outreach group for TweedA Fine Legal LineWhen Tweed shipped its first two orders directly to customers on May 5 about half of the companys management watched partly for ceremonial reasons but mostly to make sure that its elaborate governmentmandated inventorytracking system worked Employees weighed the total inventory before doling out the shipments onto smaller scales calibrated to 001 gram The marijuana was dropped into boxes bearing Tweeds logo and then to meet government requirements vacuumpacked into odorblocking bags Then came a final check on the scales before the two parcels left in standard courier pouches that did not bear Tweeds nameAs with many in the new industry Tweed repeatedly cites a Health Canada forecast suggesting that the user base will grow to more than 400000 from about 40000 But some analysts wonder how the industry will reach such levels Mr Zettl is one of the few players who acknowledges that many buyers will probably be recreational users with sham prescriptionsLike most people in the medical marijuana trade Mr Rifici rejected suggestions that the industry was ultimately counting on the introduction of an open legalized market But there is such a possibility Justin Trudeau the leader of the Liberal Party has vowed to legalize marijuana if he takes power in elections scheduled for next year and polls suggest that the idea has widespread supportMr Rifici speaking over the drone of dehumidifiers in the production facility said that the difference between medical marijuana and nonmedical marijuana is one of legislationAnd at the end of the day he added our product is essentially highquality marijuana under a medical

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/opinion/dowd-dont-harsh-our-mellow-dude.html,The caramelchocolate flavored candy bar looked so innocent like the Sky Bars I used to love as a childSitting in my hotel room in Denver I nibbled off the end and then when nothing happened nibbled some more I figured if I was reporting on the social revolution rocking Colorado in January the giddy culmination of pot Prohibition I should try a taste of legal edible pot from a local shopWhat could go wrong with a bite or twoEverything as it turned outNot at first For an hour I felt nothing I figured Id order dinner from room service and return to my more mundane drugs of choice chardonnay and mediocremoviesondemandBut then I felt a scary shudder go through my body and brain I barely made it from the desk to the bed where I lay curled up in a hallucinatory state for the next eight hours I was thirsty but couldnt move to get water Or even turn off the lights I was panting and paranoid sure that when the roomservice waiter knocked and I didnt answer hed call the police and have me arrested for being unable to handle my candyI strained to remember where I was or even what I was wearing touching my green corduroy jeans and staring at the exposedbrick wall As my paranoia deepened I became convinced that I had died and no one was telling meIt took all night before it began to wear off distressingly slowly The next day a medical consultant at an edibles plant where I was conducting an interview mentioned that candy bars like that are supposed to be cut into 16 pieces for novices but that recommendation hadnt been on the labelI reckoned that the fact that I was not a regular marijuana smoker made me more vulnerable and that I should have known better But it turns out five months in that some kinks need to be ironed out with the intoxicating open bar at the Mile High ClubColorado raked in about 126 million the first three months after pot was legalized for adults 21 and over Pot party planners are dreaming up classy events the Colorado Symphony just had its first Classically Cannabis fundraiser with joints and Debussy But the state is also coming to grips with the darker side of unleashing a drug as potent as marijuana on a horde of tourists of all ages and tolerance levels seeking a mellow buzzIn March a 19yearold Wyoming college student jumped off a Denver hotel balcony after eating a pot cookie with 65 milligrams of THC In April a Denver man ate potinfused Karma Kandy and began talking like it was the end of the world scaring his wife and three kids Then he retrieved a handgun from a safe and killed his wife while she was on the phone with an emergency dispatcherAs Jack Healy reported in The Times on Sunday Colorado hospital officials are treating growing numbers of children and adults sickened by potent doses of edible marijuana and neighboring states are seeing more stoned driversWe realized there was a problem because were watching everything with the urgency of the first people to regulate in this area said Andrew Freedman the states director of marijuana coordination There are way too many stories of people not understanding how much theyre eating With liquor people understand what theyre getting themselves into But that doesnt exist right now for edibles for new users in the market It would behoove the industry to create a more pleasant experience for peopleThe whole industry was set up for people who smoked frequently It needs to learn how to educate new users in the market We have to create a culture of responsibility around edibles so people know what to expect to feelGov John Hickenlooper and the Legislature recently created a task force to come up with packaging that clearly differentiates pot cookies and candy and gummy bears from normal sweets  with an eye toward protecting children  and directed the Department of Revenue to restrict the amount of edibles that can be sold at one time to one person The governor also signed legislation mandating that there be a stamp on edibles possibly a marijuana leaf Or maybe a stoned skull and bonesThe state plans to start testing to make sure the weed is spread evenly throughout the product The task force is discussing having budtenders give better warnings to customers and moving toward demarcating a singleserving size of 10 milligrams Industry representatives objected to the expense of wrapping bites of candy individuallyMy kids put rocks and batteries in their mouths said Bob Eschino the owner of Incredibles which makes candy and serves up chocolate and strawberry fountains If I put a marijuana leaf on a piece of chocolate theyll still put it in their mouthsHe argues that since pot goodies leave the dispensary in childproof packages it is the parents responsibility to make sure their kids dont get hold of itSomebody suggested we just make everything look like a gray square so it doesnt look appealing Why should the whole industry suffer just because less than 5 percent of people are having problems with the correct dosingDoes he sound a little paranoid,2014-06-04T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/health/politicians-prescriptions-for-marijuana-defy-doctors-and-data.html,New York moved last week to join 22 states in legalizing medical marijuana for patients with a diverse array of debilitating ailments encompassing epilepsy and cancer Crohns disease and Parkinsons Yet there is no rigorous scientific evidence that marijuana effectively treats the symptoms of many of the illnesses for which states have authorized its useInstead experts say lawmakers and the authors of public referendums have acted largely on the basis of animal studies and heartwrenching anecdotes The results have sometimes confounded doctors and researchersThe lists of conditions qualifying patients for marijuana treatment vary considerably from state to state Like most others New Yorks includes cancer HIVAIDS and multiple sclerosis Studies have shown that marijuana can relieve nausea improve appetite and ease painful spasms in those patientsBut New Yorks  list also includes Parkinsons disease Lou Gehrigs disease and epilepsy conditions for which there are no highquality trials indicating marijuana is useful In Illinois more than three dozen conditions qualify for treatment with marijuana including Alzheimers disease lupus Sjogrens syndrome Tourettes syndrome ArnoldChiari malformation and nailpatella syndromeI just dont think the evidence is there for these long lists said Dr Molly Cooke a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco who helped research a position paper on cannabis for the American College of Physicians Its been so hard to study marijuana Policy makers are responding to thin dataEven some advocates of medical marijuana acknowledge that the state laws legalizing it did not result from careful reviews of the medical literatureI wish it were that rational said Mitch Earleywine chairman of the executive board of directors for Norml a national marijuana advocacy group Dr Earleywine said state lawmakers more often ask themselves What disease does the person in a wheelchair in my office haveResearch into marijuanas effects is thin not because of a lack of scientific interest but chiefly because the federal government has long classified it as a Schedule 1 drug with no currently accepted medical use Scientists who want to conduct studies must register with the Drug Enforcement Administration submit an investigational new drug application to the Food and Drug Administration for human trials and win approval from the Department of Health and Human Services or one of the National Institutes of Health The National Institute on Drug Abuse is the only supplier of legal researchgrade marijuanaThe legal and administrative hoops make it hard for investigators to start the randomized placebocontrolled trials that are the gold standard of medical research and the basis for determining which drugs are effective at what doses and in which patientsIts one thing to say we need to have more research and its another thing to obstruct the research said Dr Steven A Jenison former medical director of New Mexicos medical cannabis programThe dearth of data has not prevented legislators and voters across the nation from endorsing marijuana for more than 40 conditions Patients with rheumatoid arthritis for instance qualify for marijuana treatment in at least three statesYet there are no published trials of smoked marijuana in rheumatoid arthritis patients said Dr MaryAnn Fitzcharles a rheumatologist at McGill University who reviewed the evidence of the drugs efficacy in treating rheumatic diseases When we look at herbal cannabis we have zero evidence for efficacy she said Unfortunately this is being driven by regulatory authorities not by sound clinical judgmentNew York considered including the chronic inflammatory disease on its list a development that astonished Dr Mary K Crow an arthritis expert at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan People with rheumatoid arthritis have higher rates of certain respiratory problems she notedInhaling into your lungs is not a great idea with rheumatoid arthritis given the substantial number of patients who have lung disease Dr Crow said The final version of New Yorks law prohibits smoking marijuana and did not end up including rheumatoid arthritisIn Arizona and Rhode Island among other states people with Alzheimers disease may receive medical marijuana to help quell nighttime agitation But Dr Gary Small director of the division of geriatric psychiatry at the University of California Los Angeles said he does not recommend cannabis to Alzheimers patients Agitation and increased confusion are possible side effectsStill he said he would not discourage a caregiver from providing it if it calmed a family member with dementiaParents of children with intractable epilepsy have lobbied hard in several states including New York for inclusion in medical marijuana legislation They want access to an oil called Charlottes Web that is rich in CBD a nonpsychoactive ingredient of marijuana that they say reduces the number of seizuresThis month Gov Rick Scott of Florida a conservative Republican signed a law allowing epilepsy patients access to the oil calling it the best treatment availableScientists have begun randomized placebocontrolled research to determine whether CBD effectively treats severe forms of childhood epilepsy But at the moment highquality research showing that marijuana is a safe or effective treatment for epilepsy does not exist experts sayAs far as data out there there are great animal models and very provoking anecdotes said Dr Orrin Devinsky director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at NYU Langone Medical Center The human data is not there right nowPsoriasis was included in the New York legislation after representatives of Gaia PlantBased Medicine a Colorado company operating dispensaries met with State Senator Diane J Savino and suggested that cannabis lotions helped people with those red raised skin plaques It was dropped from the measure after questions were raised about the lack of supporting evidence  as were other conditions like diabetes and lupusMedical marijuana advocates contend that suffering people should not have to wait for scientific research to catch up to patients needs And why limit marijuana use to only certain conditions they ask when doctors routinely prescribe drugs offlabel for anything they feel likeAmanda Hoffman 35 an information technology specialist in Basking Ridge NJ struggles with ulcerative colitis an inflammatory bowel disease She has tried steroids and Remicade an intravenous infusion but no drug has given her as much relief from frequent daily diarrhea and abdominal pain as her homemade cannabis caramelsOn a recent Sunday Ms Hoffman used a green buttery sludge made with marijuana she bought for 500 an ounce from Garden State Dispensary to make a new batch She is grateful that the state legalized marijuana for patients like her whatever the scientific evidenceCannabis to a lot of people is a punch line but it can also be a lifesaver she saidEven if strong medical research regarding marijuana did exist it is not clear that state lawmakers would be swayedIt would be possible to take case studies or anecdotal information from patients or research done from a university put it in front of a legislator and say We need to include this disease  said State Representative Lou Lang sponsor of the medical marijuana law in IllinoisBut the legislative mind be it in DC or in Springfield Illinois doesnt always go to public policy Mr Lang said The default position is politicsOften state legislators have been motivated not just by constituents in distress but also by the desire to restrict access to limited patient populations so that legal marijuana does not become widely available as a recreational drug in their statesFor example while there is research suggesting that marijuana alleviates certain kinds of chronic pain Mr Lang noted legislators in Illinois were reluctant to legalize its use in such a broad patient population The states list of

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/health/politicians-prescriptions-for-marijuana-defy-doctors-and-data.html,New York moved last week to join 22 states in legalizing medical marijuana for patients with a diverse array of debilitating ailments encompassing epilepsy and cancer Crohns disease and Parkinsons Yet there is no rigorous scientific evidence that marijuana effectively treats the symptoms of many of the illnesses for which states have authorized its useInstead experts say lawmakers and the authors of public referendums have acted largely on the basis of animal studies and heartwrenching anecdotes The results have sometimes confounded doctors and researchersThe lists of conditions qualifying patients for marijuana treatment vary considerably from state to state Like most others New Yorks includes cancer HIVAIDS and multiple sclerosis Studies have shown that marijuana can relieve nausea improve appetite and ease painful spasms in those patientsBut New Yorks  list also includes Parkinsons disease Lou Gehrigs disease and epilepsy conditions for which there are no highquality trials indicating marijuana is useful In Illinois more than three dozen conditions qualify for treatment with marijuana including Alzheimers disease lupus Sjogrens syndrome Tourettes syndrome ArnoldChiari malformation and nailpatella syndromeI just dont think the evidence is there for these long lists said Dr Molly Cooke a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco who helped research a position paper on cannabis for the American College of Physicians Its been so hard to study marijuana Policy makers are responding to thin dataEven some advocates of medical marijuana acknowledge that the state laws legalizing it did not result from careful reviews of the medical literatureI wish it were that rational said Mitch Earleywine chairman of the executive board of directors for Norml a national marijuana advocacy group Dr Earleywine said state lawmakers more often ask themselves What disease does the person in a wheelchair in my office haveResearch into marijuanas effects is thin not because of a lack of scientific interest but chiefly because the federal government has long classified it as a Schedule 1 drug with no currently accepted medical use Scientists who want to conduct studies must register with the Drug Enforcement Administration submit an investigational new drug application to the Food and Drug Administration for human trials and win approval from the Department of Health and Human Services or one of the National Institutes of Health The National Institute on Drug Abuse is the only supplier of legal researchgrade marijuanaThe legal and administrative hoops make it hard for investigators to start the randomized placebocontrolled trials that are the gold standard of medical research and the basis for determining which drugs are effective at what doses and in which patientsIts one thing to say we need to have more research and its another thing to obstruct the research said Dr Steven A Jenison former medical director of New Mexicos medical cannabis programThe dearth of data has not prevented legislators and voters across the nation from endorsing marijuana for more than 40 conditions Patients with rheumatoid arthritis for instance qualify for marijuana treatment in at least three statesYet there are no published trials of smoked marijuana in rheumatoid arthritis patients said Dr MaryAnn Fitzcharles a rheumatologist at McGill University who reviewed the evidence of the drugs efficacy in treating rheumatic diseases When we look at herbal cannabis we have zero evidence for efficacy she said Unfortunately this is being driven by regulatory authorities not by sound clinical judgmentNew York considered including the chronic inflammatory disease on its list a development that astonished Dr Mary K Crow an arthritis expert at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan People with rheumatoid arthritis have higher rates of certain respiratory problems she notedInhaling into your lungs is not a great idea with rheumatoid arthritis given the substantial number of patients who have lung disease Dr Crow said The final version of New Yorks law prohibits smoking marijuana and did not end up including rheumatoid arthritisIn Arizona and Rhode Island among other states people with Alzheimers disease may receive medical marijuana to help quell nighttime agitation But Dr Gary Small director of the division of geriatric psychiatry at the University of California Los Angeles said he does not recommend cannabis to Alzheimers patients Agitation and increased confusion are possible side effectsStill he said he would not discourage a caregiver from providing it if it calmed a family member with dementiaParents of children with intractable epilepsy have lobbied hard in several states including New York for inclusion in medical marijuana legislation They want access to an oil called Charlottes Web that is rich in CBD a nonpsychoactive ingredient of marijuana that they say reduces the number of seizuresThis month Gov Rick Scott of Florida a conservative Republican signed a law allowing epilepsy patients access to the oil calling it the best treatment availableScientists have begun randomized placebocontrolled research to determine whether CBD effectively treats severe forms of childhood epilepsy But at the moment highquality research showing that marijuana is a safe or effective treatment for epilepsy does not exist experts sayAs far as data out there there are great animal models and very provoking anecdotes said Dr Orrin Devinsky director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at NYU Langone Medical Center The human data is not there right nowPsoriasis was included in the New York legislation after representatives of Gaia PlantBased Medicine a Colorado company operating dispensaries met with State Senator Diane J Savino and suggested that cannabis lotions helped people with those red raised skin plaques It was dropped from the measure after questions were raised about the lack of supporting evidence  as were other conditions like diabetes and lupusMedical marijuana advocates contend that suffering people should not have to wait for scientific research to catch up to patients needs And why limit marijuana use to only certain conditions they ask when doctors routinely prescribe drugs offlabel for anything they feel likeAmanda Hoffman 35 an information technology specialist in Basking Ridge NJ struggles with ulcerative colitis an inflammatory bowel disease She has tried steroids and Remicade an intravenous infusion but no drug has given her as much relief from frequent daily diarrhea and abdominal pain as her homemade cannabis caramelsOn a recent Sunday Ms Hoffman used a green buttery sludge made with marijuana she bought for 500 an ounce from Garden State Dispensary to make a new batch She is grateful that the state legalized marijuana for patients like her whatever the scientific evidenceCannabis to a lot of people is a punch line but it can also be a lifesaver she saidEven if strong medical research regarding marijuana did exist it is not clear that state lawmakers would be swayedIt would be possible to take case studies or anecdotal information from patients or research done from a university put it in front of a legislator and say We need to include this disease  said State Representative Lou Lang sponsor of the medical marijuana law in IllinoisBut the legislative mind be it in DC or in Springfield Illinois doesnt always go to public policy Mr Lang said The default position is politicsOften state legislators have been motivated not just by constituents in distress but also by the desire to restrict access to limited patient populations so that legal marijuana does not become widely available as a recreational drug in their statesFor example while there is research suggesting that marijuana alleviates certain kinds of chronic pain Mr Lang noted legislators in Illinois were reluctant to legalize its use in such a broad patient population The states list of

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/02/us/politics/ap-us-rethinking-pot-driving-stoned.html,WASHINGTON   New York teenager Joseph Beer smoked marijuana climbed into a Subaru Impreza with four friends and drove more than 100 mph before losing control The car crashed into trees with such force that the vehicle split in half killing his friendsBeer who was 17 in October 2012 when the crash occurred pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicular homicide and was sentenced last week to 5 years to 15 years in prisonAs states liberalize their marijuana laws public officials and safety advocates worry there will be more drivers high on pot and a big increase in traffic deaths Its not clear though whether those concerns are merited Researchers are divided on the question A prosecutor blamed the Beer crash on speed and weed but a jury that heard expert testimony on marijuanas effects at his trial deadlocked on a homicide charge and other felonies related to whether the teenager was impaired by marijuana Beer was convicted of manslaughter and reckless driving chargesStudies of marijuanas effects show that the drug can slow decisionmaking decrease peripheral vision and impede multitasking all of which are important driving skills But unlike with alcohol drivers high on pot tend to be aware that they are impaired and try to compensate by driving slowly avoiding risky actions such as passing other cars and allowing extra room between vehiclesOn the other hand combining marijuana with alcohol appears to eliminate the pot smokers exaggerated caution and to increase driving impairment beyond the effects of either substance aloneWe see the legalization of marijuana in Colorado and Washington as a wakeup call for all of us in highway safety said Jonathan Adkins executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association which represents state highway safety offices We dont know enough about the scope of marijuanaimpaired driving to call it a big or small problem But anytime a driver has their ability impaired it is a problemColorado and Washington are the only states that allow retail sales of marijuana for recreational use Efforts to legalize recreational marijuana are underway in Alaska Massachusetts New York Oregon and the District of Columbia Twentythree states and the nations capital permit marijuana use for medical purposesIt is illegal in all states to drive while impaired by marijuanaColorado Washington and Montana have set an intoxication threshold of 5 parts per billion of THC the psychoactive ingredient in pot in the blood A few other states have set intoxication thresholds but most have not set a specific level In Washington there was a jump of nearly 25 percent in drivers testing positive for marijuana in 2013  the first full year after legalization  but no corresponding increase in car accidents or fatalitiesDr Mehmet Sofuoglu a Yale University Medical School expert on drug abuse who testified at Beers trial said studies of marijuana and crash risk are highly inconclusive Some studies show a two or threefold increase while others show none he said Some studies even showed less risk if someone was marijuanapositive he testifiedTeenage boys and young men are the most likely drivers to smoke pot and the most likely drivers to have an accident regardless of whether theyre high he saidBeing a teenager a male teenager and being involved in reckless behavior could explain both at the same time  not necessarily marijuana causing getting into accidents but a general reckless behavior leading to both conditions at the same time Sofuoglu told jurorsIn 2012 just over 10 percent of high school seniors said they had smoked pot before driving at least once in the prior two weeks according to Monitoring the Future an annual University of Michigan survey of 50000 middle and high school students Nearly twice as many male students as female students said they had smoked marijuana before drivingA roadside survey by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2007 found 86 percent of drivers tested positive for THC but its not possible to say how many were high at the time because drivers only were tested for the presence of drugs not the amountA marijuana high generally peaks within a halfhour and dissipates within three hours but THC can linger for days in the bodies of habitual smokersInexperienced pot smokers are likely to be more impaired than habitual smokers who develop a tolerance Some studies show virtually no driving impairment in habitual smokersTwo recent studies that used similar data to assess crash risk came to opposite conclusionsColumbia University researchers compared drivers who tested positive for marijuana in the roadside survey with state drug and alcohol tests of drivers killed in crashes They found that marijuana alone increased the likelihood of being involved in a fatal crash by 80 percentBut because the study included states where not all drivers are tested for alcohol and drugs most drivers in fatal crashes were excluded possibly skewing the results Also the use of urine tests rather than blood tests in some cases may overestimate marijuana use and impairmentA Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation study used the roadside survey and data from nine states that test more than 80 percent of drivers killed in crashes When adjusted for alcohol and driver demographics the study found that otherwise sober drivers who tested positive for marijuana were slightly less likely to have been involved in a crash than drivers who tested negative for all drugsWe were expecting a huge impact said Eduardo Romano lead author of the study and when we looked at the data from crashes were not seeing that much But Romano said his study may slightly underestimate the risk and marijuana may lead to accidents caused by distractionMany states do not test drivers involved in a fatal crash for drugs unless there is reason to suspect impairment Even if impairment is suspected if the driver tests positive for alcohol there may be no further testing because alcohol alone may be enough to bring criminal charges Testing procedures also vary from state to stateIf states legalize marijuana they must set clear limits for impairment behind the wheel and require mandatory drug testing following a crash said Deborah

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/01/us/politics/ap-us-rethinking-pot-driving-stoned.html,WASHINGTON   As states liberalize their marijuana laws public officials and safety advocates worry that more drivers high on pot will lead to a big increase in traffic deaths Researchers though are divided on the questionStudies of marijuanas effects show that the drug can slow decisionmaking decrease peripheral vision and impede multitasking all of which are critical driving skills But unlike with alcohol drivers high on pot tend to be aware that they are impaired and try to compensate by driving slowly avoiding risky actions such as passing other cars and allowing extra room between vehiclesOn the other hand combining marijuana with alcohol appears to eliminate the pot smokers exaggerated caution and seems to increase driving impairment beyond the effects of either substance aloneWe see the legalization of marijuana in Colorado and Washington as a wakeup call for all of us in highway safety said Jonathan Adkins executive director of Governors Highway Safety Association which represents state highway safety officesWe dont know enough about the scope of marijuanaimpaired driving to call it a big or small problem But anytime a driver has their ability impaired it is a problemColorado and Washington are the only states that allow retail sales of marijuana for recreational use Efforts to legalize recreational marijuana are underway in Alaska Massachusetts New York Oregon and the District of Columbia Twentythree states and the nations capital permit marijuana use for medical purposesIt is illegal in all states to drive while impaired by marijuanaColorado Washington and Montana have set an intoxication threshold of 5 parts per billion of THC the psychoactive ingredient in pot in the blood A few other states have set intoxication thresholds but most have not set a specific level In Washington there was a jump of nearly 25 percent in drivers testing positive for marijuana in 2013  the first full year after legalization  but no corresponding increase in car accidents or fatalitiesWhat worries highway safety experts are cases like that of New York teenager Joseph Beer who in October 2012 smoked marijuana climbed into a Subaru Impreza with four friends and drove more than 100 mph before losing control The car crashed into trees with such force that the vehicle split in half killing his friendsBeer pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicular homicide and was sentenced last week to 5 years to 15 years in prisonA prosecutor blamed the crash on speed and weed but a Yale University Medical School expert on drug abuse who testified at the trial said studies of marijuana and crash risk are highly inconclusive Some studies show a two or threefold increase while others show none said Dr Mehmet Sofuoglu Some studies even showed less risk if someone was marijuana positive he testifiedTeenage boys and young men are the most likely drivers to smoke pot and the most likely drivers to have an accident regardless of whether theyre high he saidBeing a teenager a male teenager and being involved in reckless behavior could explain both at the same time  not necessarily marijuana causing getting into accidents but a general reckless behavior leading to both conditions at the same time he told jurorsIn 2012 just over 10 percent of high school seniors said they had smoked pot before driving at least once in the prior two weeks according to Monitoring the Future an annual University of Michigan survey of 50000 middle and high school students Nearly twice as many male students as female students said they had smoked marijuana before drivingA roadside survey by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2007 found 86 percent of drivers tested positive for THC but its not possible to say how many were high at the time because drivers were tested only for the presence of drugs not the amountA marijuana high generally peaks within a half hour and dissipates within three hours but THC can linger for days in the bodies of habitual smokersInexperienced pot smokers are likely to be more impaired than habitual smokers who develop a tolerance Some studies show virtually no driving impairment in habitual smokersTwo recent studies that used similar data to assess crash risk came to opposite conclusionsColumbia University researchers compared drivers who tested positive for marijuana in the roadside survey with state drug and alcohol tests of drivers killed in crashes They found that marijuana alone increased the likelihood of being involved in a fatal crash by 80 percentBut because the study included states where not all drivers are tested for alcohol and drugs a majority of drivers in fatal crashes were excluded possibly skewing the results Also the use of urine tests rather than blood tests in some cases may overestimate marijuana use and impairmentA Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation study used the roadside survey and data from nine states that test more than 80 percent of drivers killed in crashes When adjusted for alcohol and driver demographics the study found that otherwise sober drivers who tested positive for marijuana were slightly less likely to have been involved in a crash than drivers who tested negative for all drugsWe were expecting a huge impact said Eduardo Romano lead author of the study and when we looked at the data from crashes were not seeing that much But Romano said his study may slightly underestimate the risk and that marijuana may lead to accidents caused by distractionMany states do not test drivers involved in a fatal crash for drugs unless there is reason to suspect impairment Even if impairment is suspected if the driver tests positive for alcohol there may be no further testing because alcohol alone may be enough to bring criminal charges Testing procedures also vary from state to stateIf states legalize marijuana they must set clear limits for impairment behind the wheel and require mandatory drug testing following a crash said Deborah Hersman former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board Right now we

towering marijuana plants checking the buds for the telltale spots of white that indicate they are ready for harvestMuch of the crop had been picked and left to dry on the roofs of stoneandwood huts that dot the valley the heart Moroccos potgrowing region Benabdallah says he openly grows the crop while understanding the risk We are regularly subject to blackmail by the gendarmes he said as he scythed through stalks and wrapped them into a bundleMoroccos marijuana farmers live in a strange limbo in which the brilliant green fields are left alone while the growers themselves face constant police harassment A new draft law may bring some reprieve It aims to legalize marijuana growing for medical and industrial uses a radical idea for a Muslim nation It could alleviate poverty and social unrest but the proposal faces stiff opposition in this conservative country as well as the suspicions of farmers themselves who think politicians can do nothing help themMorocco is joining many other countries in the world as well as some US states in reexamining drug policies and looking to some degree of legalization Moroccos situation is unusual however in that Islamic traditions create deep taboos against drugs despite the centuriesold tradition of growing marijuana in the northThere are some 80000 families in the northern Rif mountains of Morocco who make their living from growing pot according to UN estimates the region supplies nearly all of Europes hashish and is the worlds top supplier along with Afghanistan The World Customs Authority reported that in 2013 65 percent of hashish seized at customs worldwide came from Morocco Estimates vary wildly for how much the business is worth but legalization would certainly provide a substantial boost to farmers and to Moroccos anemic economy which is forecast to grow by just 25 percent this yearFor now the profits go to the buyers and smugglers who pay the farmers little for their crop and reap huge profits in Europe  where consumption in places like Amsterdams famed coffee shops has been decriminalized The trade has brought little wealth to the region with farmers saying a kilogram of kif as the plant is known locally sells for 8 and they make an average of just 3000 to 4000 a yearThey say they are completely neglected by the state  except for its police forceGrowers say that neighbors with scores to settle file anonymous complaints with authorities resulting in a visit from the paramilitary gendarmes confiscation of the crop and months or years in prison  unless a bribe can be paid Nourredine Mediane a lawmaker from the region said some 15000 people from the area are currently in detention and another 30000 are wanted by authoritiesClutching his widebrimmed straw hat one deeply lined farmer described how he learned he was wanted by police when he went to renew his national ID card in a nearby town Since then he has not left his mountainside village and relies on family members to pick up suppliesI am scared to even go to the doctor he said asking that his name not be used for fear of arrest I dont even have the national identity card and Im stuck in the villageDespite fear of arrest many locals have no choice but to grow pot The valleys rocky soil is poor and the only crop that seems to thrive is marijuana which was legal to grow under royal mandate in certain regions of the Rif until 1974 when the government passed a blanket ban on the cultivation and consumption of all drugsThe marijuana ban was passed just as European visitors to the marijuana growing regions taught the farmers to produce hashish for export to feed rising demand across the Mediterranean The ban also brought Morocco in line with the 1961 UN convention against drugs it had signedThe securitycentered approach to the problem has failed argued Mehdi Bensaid a lawmaker with the opposition Party of Authenticity and Modernity that was founded by a close associate of the king The partys draft law would keep pot consumption  widespread among young Moroccans in parts of the country  illegal but legalize productionUnder the legislation the entire crop would go to a state agency that would use it to produce new cannabisbased medications that have been developed to aid cancer and multiple sclerosis patients and eventually for industrial uses such as textiles paper and fiberboard as well Under the UN drug conventions marijuana can be legally be grown for industrial and medical uses Factories would be set up in the region to process the plant and provide jobs The statedriven industry would prevent cannabis from being turned into hash and going to the smugglersBensaid added that he has already been contacted by European and American pharmaceutical companies interested in investing in the venture if the law passes It is not clear however if there is sufficient demand for medical purposes to meet the vast supply coming from Moroccos fields And UN conventions would prevent the statesanctioned crop to be sold abroad for recreational purposesStill Bensaid sees legalization as a potential economic saviorIf Morocco has a crop that could produce these medicines that could be sold today in the US Canada and France it is an employment opportunity for citizens living in a miserable situation Bensaid told The Associated Press Its a winwin for the state because there is tax for the citizens because they are in an illegal situation and for the sick who get their medicineBensaids party is backed in its effort by Moroccos oldest political party the Istiqlal or Independence Party The two have presented a draft law to both the upper and lower houses of parliament It is unclear however if the draft is on the schedule to be debated when parliament reopens this monthThe laws have received some highprofile backing including the ministers of health and higher education who have supported the idea of using marijuana for scientific researchHowever the Islamistled government and the powerful palace have remained silent with few wanting to break a deeprooted taboo against illegal drugs While not specifically banned in Islam marijuanas effects are likened by most imams to alcohol which is banned by the religionMustapha Khalfi Moroccos government spokesman and communications minister refused to discuss the draft law pointing only to government efforts to combat drug smuggling and reduce the amount of land under cultivationMembers of the Islamist Party for Justice and Development have accused those behind the law of merely looking to boost their standing in the Rif Valley region ahead of key local elections next yearThese people are not just trying to get votes from the poor peasants in these regions but are also looking for the sympathy and money from the drug barons ahead of the 2015 elections said Abdelaziz Aftati a leading member of the Islamist partyThe growers themselves express suspicion about the plans concocted by politicians in Rabat Farmers worry that legalization would mean a fall in the already low price for their crop and competition from wealthy estates with vast acreage and the latest agricultural technologyIf legalization happened for all of Morocco we could never compete with the other farmers that have lots of land and the price of cannabis wouldnt be any different than that of carrots  wed make nothing said local activist Mohammed BenabdallahMore than any other region in Morocco the wild Rif mountains have seen little government investment in no small part due to a history of rebellions and the marijuana cultivation itselfThe locals are mostly Berbers North Africas original inhabitants rather than Arabs In the 1920s the region threw off Spanish rule and declared an independent republic that was subdued only after years of attacks by French and Spanish soldiersThe Rif revolted again in 1958 soon after Moroccos independence In the aftermath it was left poor and undeveloped with bad roads and few schools and hospitals Locals say the police dont dare to destroy all the marijuana fields for fear of provoking another uprisingSo instead the economy remains firmly anchored to marijuana Every year with the approach of the cold autumn months villagers take their dried bundles of kif place them over fine mesh and rhythmically beat them with sticks to extract a powder which is then rolled into bricks of hash Pot is still smoked by the older generation in longstemmed pipes called sebsisBy November the sheer walls of this valley will resound with the sound of tapping It is a like music said Benabdallah a festival of hashishThe government has repeatedly tried to persuade farmers to grow other crops but efforts have failed By 2010 most alternative crop programs had been suspendedWalking along terraces of rocky earth 63yearold Mohammed Fathi said he tried to grow other crops not least to fend off 32 police complaints against him He was part of a cooperative that grew olives figs and almonds but it failed due to lack of rain  and he turned back to growing potMarijuana he said resists the drought that kills other plants,2014-10-07T02:27:07Z,drugs

What is the concentration What are the hazardsOn Wednesday the state task force met to forge a rule denoting 10 milligrams as a serving so that the dosage is clearly demarcated And on Friday Gov John Hickenlooper signed legislation proposing a banking solution for the mainly cash pot business but the Federal Reserve will need to sign off on itBecause the Colorado law was approved by referendum its like a Wild West statute where things are getting filled in underneath with a haphazard application of the regulatory processOne major reason I got involved in the movement was so that consumers could have basic access to information about the products theyre consuming which was totally impossible under the prohibition that created the black market said Tom Angell the founder and chairman of Marijuana Majority So its particularly disappointing to see that some companies in the legal marijuana industry  which our years of advocacy allowed to exist  are falling short of those principles It seems basic labeling and consumer information hasnt been a chief priority but hopefully now its starting to changeHe wants budtenders behind the counter to be trained so they can give customized guidance to customers of varying tolerance levelsAs the black market comes into the light the hangloose community can be uptight about any moves to regulate or put contours around the sale of pot to better protect neophytes teenagers and children Perhaps because they have spent so much time fighting to move past the old Reefer Madness caricature the reefer crowd gets mad at the suggestion of any regulation no matter how small or helpful The clubby community that long existed in the shadows can have a countercultural reaction to rulesAlso as one Colorado political aide pointed out Theres so much money involved This is a group of people who probably never thought about money and now a lot of people just have dollar signs in their eyesLaughing he noted The weirdest thing in the world is to hear from an angry pothead who finishes a tirade about rules with dude,2014-06-08T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/opinion/mandatory-sentencing-for-medical-marijuana.html,How did the United States land of the free become the worlds top jailer Its a question asked by visitors from other democracies and the American citizen who wakes from a stupor to find that our prisons are stuffed with people serving interminable sentences for nonviolent crimesFor the answer you need look no further than the real America the sparsely settled ruggedly beautiful financially struggling eastern third of Washington State There 70yearold Larry Harvey his wife two family members and a friend are facing mandatory 10year prison terms for growing medical marijuana  openly and they thought legally  on their farm near the little town of Kettle FallsTo get a sense of the tragic absurdity of this federal prosecution reaching all the way to the desk of Attorney General Eric H Holder Jr consider what will happen next month Pot stores will open in Washington selling legal marijuana for the recreational user  per a vote of the people A few weeks later the Feds will try to put away the socalled Kettle Falls Five for growing weed on their land to ease their medical maladies Federal sentencing guidelines which trump state law call for mandatory prison termsHarvey is a former longhaul truck driver with a bad knee spasms of gout and high blood pressure He says he has no criminal record and spends much of his time in a wheelchair His wife Rhonda FirestackHarvey is a retired hairdresser with arthritis and osteoporosis Mr Harvey says he takes his wifes homebaked marijuana confections when the pain in his knee starts to flare The Harveys thought they were in the clear growing 68 marijuana plants on their acreage in northeast Washington one of 22 states allowing legal medical marijuana Federal authorities say they are several plants over the limitTheir pot garden was a coop among the four family members and one friend the marijuana was not for sale or distribution Mr Harvey says I think these patients were legitimate Dr Greg Carter who reviewed medical records after the arrest told The SpokesmanReview of Spokane They are pretty normal people Were not talking about thugsBut the authorities using all the military tools at their disposal in the exhausted drug war treated them as bigtime narco threats First a helicopter spotted the garden from the air Brilliant except Harvey himself had painted a huge medical marijuana sign on a plywood board so that his garden in fact could be identified as a medical pot plot from the airThis was followed by two raids One from eight agents in Kevlar vests The other from Drug Enforcement Agency officers They searched the house confiscating guns and a little cash in a drawer The guns are no surprise Finding someone who does not own a firearm in the Selkirk Mountain country is like finding a Seattleite who doesnt recycle Still the guns were enough to add additional federal charges to an indictment that the family was growing more than the legal limit of plantsNow lets step back The Harveys live in the congressional district of Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers who is part of the House Republican leadership She loves freedom You know she loves freedom because she always says so most recently in a press release touting her efforts to take away peoples health care coverage Americans must be protected from out of control government she statedWell maybe Unless that government is trying to take away the freedom of a retired couple growing pot to ease their bodily pains That freedom is not so good Astonishingly in our current toxic political atmosphere Republicans and Democrats joined together last month to vote by 219 to 189 to block spending for federal prosecution of medical marijuana in states that allow itYaayyy for freedom There was one dissent from Washington States delegation Yes Cathy McMorris Rodgers standing firm for an out of control government instead of defending one of her freedomloving constituentsLets go further up the government ranks As a candidate Barack Obama promised to immediately review these sentences  mandatory minimums  to see how we can be smarter on crime and reduce the ineffective warehousing of nonviolent drug offendersHe kept that promise in ordering a review And his Justice Department also issued new guidelines saying the Feds would try to avoid prosecution of medical marijuana operations so long as they dont do things like funnel money to interstate drug operations or sell to children The Harveys say they meet the guidelinesWhy the federal prosecution then Attorney General Holder was in Spokane last week meeting with his subordinates But he said nothing about the case Trial is set for July 28 and the Harveys cant use legal medical marijuana as a defense a judge has ruled All the government has to prove is that the Harvey family was growing marijuana  a federal crimeIf they go to prison for a decade as the mindless statutes that grew out of the crackcocaine scare stipulate they would become part of a federal system where fully half of all inmates are behind bars for drug offenses And one in four of those crimes involves marijuanaSo remember the Kettle Falls Five when all the legal pot stores and their already legal growing facilities open for business in Washington State next month There will be silly features about cookies and candy bars laced with pot and discussions about etiquette dos and donts The press will cite polls showing that a majority of Americans favor legalizing marijuana and more than 80 percent feel that way about medical cannabis But in the eyes of the federal government these state laws are meaninglessIf Larry Harvey at the age of 70 with his gout and high blood

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/us/with-marijuana-legalized-a-city-in-washington-state-says-not-so-fast.html,SEATTLE   The first retail shops selling legal recreational marijuana in Washington State are preparing to open next month Cash registers are standing by and the first crops are almost ready for harvesting But not every part of the state is joining the partyThe state attorney general in a nonbinding legal opinion has said local governments can regulate marijuana under the statute legalizing its recreational use and at least 10 cities and counties in Washington have gone even further banning marijuana businesses outright An additional 69 municipalities and 12 counties have voted for moratoriums on such businesses according to the Municipal Research and Services Center a nonprofit group in Seattle that works with local governments on multiple issuesNow a lawsuit brought by a man who was denied a license to sell marijuana in Wenatchee in central Washingtons applegrowing country is challenging the rights of local governments to ban marijuana businesses  and also raising the possibility that the states marijuana law will come under sharp legal scrutinyThe plaintiff Shaun Preder has been told by the city that he will not get a local business license to sell marijuana because the drug remains illegal under federal law  and that all Wenatchee businesses must comply with federal lawMr Preder who runs an office furniture store in Woodinville near Seattle said he spent about 12000 in rent for a 3000 squarefoot shop in Wenatchee that he had hoped to open for marijuana sales But uncertainty about a license has kept him from spending more to get the place readyWenatchees City Council is scheduled to meet on Thursday to decide whether to respond to the suit which was filed in Chelan County Superior Court A resolve to fight  especially if the city takes the position that federal law preempts state law  could ultimately take the suit to the United States Supreme Court where the conflicts between federal and state laws on marijuana have never been addressed legal experts saidWashingtons marijuana law could be affirmed by the courts or struck down And what unfolds in Wenatchee a city of about 33000 that was closely divided from the start about the wisdom of legal marijuana  with a narrow majority in the county supporting it in 2012  could set the stage Backers of legalization say it is a fight they are eager for asserting that the statute will be affirmedWe need clarity said Alison Holcomb the criminal justice director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington State and primary author of the Initiative 502 statuteMs Holcomb said the ACLU would seek to intervene in the case only if Wenatchee specifically claims federal protection for its position The federal preemption issue hasnt been resolved she saidBut a will to fight is not the only consideration Wenatchees mayor Frank Kuntz who does not have a vote on the sevenmember City Council has said the city cannot afford hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal billsMr Kuntz urged the Council last fall to drop the word federal from the licensing code and to grant the marijuana licenses that might be pending but the Council affirmed the language instead by a 4to3 voteMr Preders lawyer Hilary Bricken said that no matter what the Council decides on Thursday her client has already been harmed by Wenatchees actions because the Washington State Liquor Control Board which regulates recreational marijuana said it would proceed first in license applications in places where the local authorities are not trying to bar the door She said she would seek an emergency court order holding the citys ban in abeyance if the suit goes forwardAnother legal expert who studies marijuana law said that uncertainty at least for now is the only certainty  in Washington and any other state considering legalizationAs long as marijuana remains illegal under federal law you will have a certain amount of grayness in the system said Douglas A Berman a law professor at Ohio State University and editor of the online legal forum Marijuana Law Policy and ReformProfessor Berman said the strains of a system without uniformity  legal under one legal code illegal under another  echo the cracks that emerged near the end of alcohol prohibition when some states in the 1920s began to back off enforcement of the Volstead Act banning alcohol even as federal enforcement continuedIn marijuana regulation and enforcement he added Unintended legal consequences are inevitable because its a territory were still kind of ambivalent about as a nationMr Preder 34 who said he has never been involved in the marijuana business before said he has also never been invited in by the city to talk about his plans But he rented a space bigger than most proposed marijuana shops around the state which he said average about 2000 square feet because he believes that Wenatchees market will be

rules and regulations that govern whether and how it can be grown bought and sold cause major headaches for marijuana businesses  and enticing opportunities for those who want to exploit itAt the heart of the complexity lies a basic disagreement The federal government views marijuana as an illegal narcotic like heroin with no currently accepted medical use But 23 states and Washington DC have legalized pot for medical purposes In Colorado and Washington State it can be bought for recreational use just like alcohol and tobaccoLaws differ from state to state and sometimes from county to county A bumper crop of consultants and shady public companies have bloomed promising to show entrepreneurs and investors how to navigate the twisted way to success and fat profits Consumers have an array of highquality potrelated products to choose from  but they must also discern truth from hope in the many claims about the supposedly wonderful things pot can doENTREPRENEURSIts a gray market industry thats just how it is says Kayvan Khalatbari who owns both a marijuana dispensary and a chain of pizza restaurants in DenverKhalatbari started his first pizza restaurant with a bank loan Raising money for a new marijuanagrowing facility hasnt been so easyFederallyregulated banks are afraid to serve a business the US government considers illegal Residency restrictions in Colorado prevent raising money from outofstate investors in exchange for a share of a company  exactly what most investors wantSo to build his 40000 squarefoot growing facility Khalatbari teamed with an outofstate investor who paid for construction while trying to establish residency in Colorado When that comes through the investor could get an ownership stakeOnce up and running entrepreneurs face more twists Khalatbari kept his bank account in the name of a management company and he was careful not to pay potrelated vendors out of the account Still three successive banks dropped him after learning the management company had ties to potOnce open a business can flourish Wouldbe competitors face the same hurdles to getting started so months if not years can pass before they challenge the established businessKhalatbaris marijuana business boasts a profit margin 60 percent higher than his pizza restaurants Even after the legal headaches its easier to make a profit selling the bud of a

professionalsIt takes a lot of time and energy to sort through the hyperbole and find the right legitimate opportunities says Brendan Kennedy a former Silicon Valley banker who helped found Privateer

quite so simpleUltimately its a crop its a commodity not very different from a lot of agricultural products that are out there Kennedy says Would you invest in a winery  Or a strawberry growerInvesting in pot stocks is even scarier Most are socalled penny stocks that trade outside of major exchanges There are now a couple dozen of these companies often with names that play on marijuanas scientific name cannabis sativa such as Advanced Cannabis Solutions or Cannabusiness Group But many have tenuous ties to the marijuana industry regulators sayCanadian regulators issued a warning about marijuanarelated stocks in June following similar alerts from the US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority last year and one from the SEC in May Five times this year the SEC has suspended trading in shares of companies claiming to be in the marijuana businessCONSUMERSInstead of relying on possibly dangerous backalley transactions pot consumers can now shop openly for a wide variety of strains with different levels of potency and they can buy pot in lotions foods and drinks with precise dosesBut buyers still need to beware Companies are using pots new legitimacy to try to equate getting high with taking care of your body or curing any number of ailmentsBecause its a drug that makes people feel good marketers want to put medical claims on it says Bill London a professor of public health at California State University in Los Angeles and a health claim watchdogSome chemicals in marijuana have been shown to effectively reduce nausea and stimulate appetite in patients undergoing chemotherapy Others may help control seizures and inflammation or even treat some diseases But others could be dangerous in ways that scientists and the public dont yet understandIn a

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/04/us/ap-us-rethinking-pot-the-business-plan.html,NEW YORK   Legal or not the business of selling weed in the US is as wacky as everThe tangle of rules and regulations that govern whether and how it can be grown bought and sold create complexity and ambiguity that cause major headaches for marijuana businesses  and enticing opportunities for those who want to exploit itIts a gray market industry thats just how it is says Kayvan Khalatbari who owns a marijuana dispensary and a chain of pizza restaurants in DenverThe big issue the nation hasnt decided whether marijuana is a dangerous illegal drug or not much worse than tobacco or alcohol According to federal law it is an illegal narcotic like heroin with no currently accepted medical use But recent legalization pushes have made it legal  for medical use  in 23 states and Washington DC In Colorado and Washington State it can be bought just for funEntrepreneurs and investors have to navigate laws that are different from state to state and sometimes from county to county That has given rise to a bumper crop of consultants promising to show the way to success while shady public companies spin visions of fat profits Consumers now have an array of new potrelated products to choose from many of far higher quality than whats offered on the corner But they must also discern truth from hope in the many claims about all the supposedly wonderful things pot can doENTREPRENEURSKhalatbari started his first pizza restaurant with a small business loan from a bank To raise money to build a marijuanagrowing facility a bank loan wasnt an optionAlmost all banks avoid working with pot businesses because pot is illegal federally and banks want to avoid running afoul of antitrafficking laws Also residency restrictions in Colorado prevent raising money from outofstate investors in exchange for a share of the company which is exactly what most investors wantSo to build a 40000 squarefoot growing facility Khalatbari teamed with an outofstate investor who paid for construction while trying to establish residency in Colorado When that comes through the investor could get an ownership stake in the facilityKhalatbari says theres plenty of investor money sloshing around looking to fund marijuana businesses but the terms are expensive because of the risk and the restrictionsIts almost impossible not to get funding he says but its not going to be on the terms you wantOnce up and running entrepreneurs face more twists Khalatbari kept his bank account in the name of a management company instead of his marijuana dispensary called Denver Relief He was careful not to pay potrelated vendors out of the account instead using cash which is common in the pot business And he didnt make cash deposits over 10000 in order to avoid triggering suspicious activity inquiries Still three successive banks dropped him after learning the management company had ties to potWe cant be honest and open about where we can put our legal money he says They are pushing us undergroundHe has recently found an unidentified bank that will work with him and a few other pot businessesKhalatbari cant write off certain expenses the way most businesses can The Internal Revenue Service prohibits deductions for expenses incurred while selling what the federal government considers to be an illegal drug That makes his profit lower than it otherwise would be It also encourages him and other sellers to designate for tax purposes only a small portion of their stores as having anything to do with selling potThese conditions can help a business flourish once its open however Wouldbe competitors face the same hurdles to getting started  local zoning rules state regulations financing complexity or a slow bureaucracy  so it can often be some time before the established business faces a real challengeCalifornia rules are relatively lax and there are believed to be at least 500 dispensaries just in Los Angeles But Connecticut has approved only six dispensaries The first opened last month  without pot  two years after getting approval Illinois growing facilities must put up a 2 million surety bond to get approval Washington has awarded 43 licenses to sell marijuana for recreational use  and just one in Seattle called Cannabis CityKhalatbari has plenty of competition but the profit margin at his marijuana dispensary is 60 percent higher than at the pizza restaurants Even after the legal headaches its easier to make a profit selling the bud of a plant for 200 an ounce than it is selling a meat lovers pizza pepperoni spicy sausage Canadian bacon and mozzarella for 1999Its much higherrisk he says of the marijuana business But the reward is much greaterCONSULTANTSEveryone wants to be in the weed business says Adam Bierman managing partner at a marijuana consulting company based in Culver City California called the Med MenThat suits Bierman just fine Dozens if not hundreds of consultants like Bierman have popped up feeding off the complexity of the marijuana business and the desire of so many to make it big in pot Some act as matchmakers promising to connect investors with entrepreneurs looking for money Others sell help navigating the licensing process tips on how best to grow marijuana or advice about how to manage a startup that must operate outside of the banking systemBut many of these consultants have little or no experience in the business Bierman acknowledges he didnt when he started six years ago We got our teeth kicked in he saysNow his firm knows the ropes he says but the industry is crawling with people who dontThere are a lot of opportunistic people coming into this industry from every angle he says And unfortunately we are part of that  We are one of the companies Im blasting and I hate thatIn February PetroTech Oil and Gas  a drilling services company  announced it was establishing a management company in Colorado and Washington to help pot growers Trading volume in the tiny companys stock rose 13fold and the penny stock rose to 7 cents per share over three weeks The Securities and Exchange Commission suspended trading in the stock in March over questions about the accuracy of the information about the companys operationsINVESTORSInvesting in the pot business seems like it should be as easy as printing money The products millions of users are so dedicated that theyve been willing to risk arrest to get it To reach them all businesses have to do is grow a weed and sell the flowersPot investing is treacherous though even for professionalsThere are a lot of large egos and puffery in this industry says Brendan Kennedy a former Silicon Valley banker who helped found Privateer Holdings a marijuanafocused private equity firm It takes a lot of time and energy to sort through the hyperbole and find the right legitimate opportunitiesEvery new pot company thinks it has the best growing technique or marijuana strain Kennedy says but few have worked out a longterm business plan that coldly assesses the market and the risks Growing plants for profit isnt quite so simpleUltimately its a crop its a commodity not very different from a lot of agricultural products that are out there Kennedy says Would you invest in a winery  Or a strawberry growerInvesting in pot stocks is even scarier because nearly all of them are socalled penny stocks like PetroTech that trade outside of major exchanges There are now a couple dozen of these companies often with names that play on marijuanas scientific name cannabis sativa such as Advanced Cannabis Solutions or Cannabusiness Group But many have tenuous ties to the marijuana industry regulators sayCanadian regulators issued a warning about marijuanarelated stocks in June following similar alerts from the US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority last year and one from the SEC in May Five times this year the SEC has suspended trading in shares of companies claiming to be in the marijuana businessKennedy says the penny stock companies are full of charlatans and hucksters who are purely playing on the desire of Main Street investors to get into the industryOne of the companies targeted by the SEC called GrowLife makes urban gardening equipment and trades under the ticker symbol PHOT An October report designed to look like it was issued by a Wall Street firm suggested the companys stock was poised to rise nearly 300 percent But that research was actually paid for by GrowLife  a detail found only in the reports fine printGrowLifes shares soared 900 percent to 60 cents from 6 cents between October and early April when trading was halted by the SEC In June the company revealed that the 37 million loss it reported for the first quarter was actually double that 74 million GrowLife shares have since fallen back to 7 centsGrowLife CEO Marco Hegyi says the report was never intended to boost the stock and that legalization efforts boosted shares of GrowLife and other marijuana companies Hegyi who became CEO in March says the company is working to improve its financial reporting Were more on top of our business he saysCONSUMERSA decade ago pot consumers risked jail time by buying pot of uncertain origin and quality in backalley deals Now in many states they can shop openly for a wide variety of strains with different levels of potency Pot can be bought in lotions foods and drinks with precise dosesBut buyers still need to beware Companies are using pots new legitimacy to try to equate getting high with taking care of your body or curing any number of ailments making extraordinary health claims about pot to push their productsBecause its a drug that makes people feel good marketers want to put medical claims on it says Bill London a professor of public health at California State University in Los Angeles and a health claim watchdog London has no problem with legalization but says many medical claims for marijuana are false or exaggerated and should not be toleratedThe website Cannabisorg started by GrowLife and carries the tagline Cannabis is Medicine lists 17 major diseases that cannabis can treat including Alzheimers cancer and diabetesSome of the chemicals in marijuana have been tested thoroughly and found to effectively treat some conditions such as reducing nausea and stimulating appetite in patients undergoing chemotherapy These or other chemicals in pot may someday be found to be effective in treating other diseases  or they could be found to be dangerous in ways not yet understood Scientists simply dont know yetA Colorado company called Dixie Elixirs sells pot in pill form called scrips  short for prescription These pills allow users to manage both their ups and downs despite the same amount of pot in each pill with additives like ashwagandha root Awakening Scrips are said to provide a stimulating sensation while Relaxing Scrips are said to reduce mental and physical stress and promote relaxationJoe Hodas chief marketing officer at Dixie Elixirs says the company is careful to not make specific medical claims about its products Its the regulatory framework that forces businesses to sell marijuana as medicine because thats the only way its legal in most states he saysIn a marketing pitch for one potbased product called Foria

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/nyregion/crime-dips-in-new-york-as-misdemeanor-arrests-rise-report-says.html,Two decades ago New Yorkers were more likely to be arrested in the middle of Manhattan for a misdemeanor than in any other neighborhood Then as crime fell minor arrests in the heart of the city went down tooBut almost everywhere else they skyrocketedThe brunt of those arrests fell on young black and Hispanic men according to a wideranging report on misdemeanor arrests released on Tuesday by the John Jay College of Criminal JusticeAnd when arrestees reached the courtroom in recent years the report found nearly half saw the charges against them  for everything from jumping the turnstile to minor drug possession to assault  dismissed or dropped altogetherThe report drawing on state and local arrest data since 1980 presents the clearest picture to date of a threedecade long shift in crime policy in New York City beginning when crime was on the rise and ending last year when it reached historically low levelsThirtyfour years ago felony arrests outpaced those for misdemeanor crimes hitting a peak in 1989 with 149204 felony arrests By last year however the two categories had not only flipped the report found but the arrest rate for lowerlevel crimes had eclipsed those for more serious offenses rising 190 percent by 2013 when the police made 225684 such arrestsIn presenting the report at a breakfast forum on Tuesday Jeremy Travis the president of John Jay College said the steep rise in misdemeanors marked a profound change in our cityWhile the study by Preeti Chauhan an assistant professor at John Jay does not attempt to explain the reasons for the change it provides a stark illustration in charts and figures of a policing strategy increasingly based on preventing major crime by aggressively pursuing minor offenses The strategy is closely associated with Police Commissioner William J Bratton and is emulated around the countryAs stopandfrisk numbers have diminished across the city the high number of lowlevel arrests has come under scrutiny Mr Bratton and Mayor Bill de Blasio have said officers can use discretion in how they address minor offenses while at the same time stressing that complaints from residents drive much of misdemeanor enforcementThe first principle is that police respond to complaints said Elizabeth Glazer the head of the Mayors Office of Criminal Justice Thats their job Thats their customer serviceThe report found that about half of the misdemeanor arrests over time were in response to complaints or serious offenses such as assaults theft drunken driving or weapons possession The other half were for lowerlevel offenses including marijuana possession or trespassingIn an introduction to the 114page report Mr Travis said the data documents the exercise of discretion by the police city prosecutors and the courtsA pair of charts tracking the most common misdemeanor charges suggest how officers are using that discretion Arrests for more serious offenses like assault gradually rose and those for crimes like theft declined first before slowly increasing the report found But arrests spiked and dipped over the past 30 years for lesser offenses like drug possession and turnstile jumping a hallmark of Mr Brattons crimefighting approach in the early 1990sArrests for prostitution a quintessential sign of disorder in the broken windows model declined over the last two decades the report found But marijuana arrests soared beginning in the early 1990s peaking at nearly 28 percent of all misdemeanor arrests in 2000 before tapering to 15 percent of arrests last year By comparison the report found marijuana arrests in five other cities in New York State never reached that proportion of misdemeanor offensesOnce those charges reached the courtroom nearly half ended in some form of dismissal or with prosecutors simply declining to pursue the caseIn 2011 the report found city district attorneys declined to prosecute 107 percent of misdemeanors and did so in 76 percent of cases the next year Elsewhere around New York State that rate hovered near zeroMr Bratton who sat in the audience on Tuesday but was not a speaker viewed an early draft of the analysis and provided feedback as did George L Kelling the criminologist whose broken windows theory of addressing minor disorder helped shape Mr Brattons thinking on crimeThe arrests documented in the report vary widely by precinct and have changed over the yearsIn 1993 four of the top five precincts for misdemeanor arrests were in Manhattan including Chelsea and two Midtown precincts By 2013 the Midtown South precinct remained a hot spot but arrests there had declined while misdemeanor arrests soared in East New York in Brooklyn East Harlem in Manhattan and Morris Heights and Mott Haven in the BronxThe report found one relative constant over the years Black and Hispanic men made up a far greater portion of those arrested than whites even as misdemeanor arrests increased across the board for all ethnic groups The arrest rate for black men in particular nearly doubled from 1990 to

Wailer gives a satisfied grin through a haze of aromatic smoke in his concrete yard painted in the red green gold and black colors identified with his Rastafarian faithThese days the baritone singer from the legendary Wailers the group he formed in 1963 with late superstars Bob Marley and Peter Tosh has reason to feel good  There is unprecedented traction building in Jamaica to decriminalize pot meaning the dreadlocked Wailer and other adherents of Rastafari  a homegrown spiritual movement that considers the drug divine  may soon be able to smoke without fear of arrestRastas have treated marijuana as something legal all along even though we have been sent to prison for using the herb in our prayer But this is the time for all these pressures to stop The world is catching up now the 67yearold threetime Grammy winner said at his modest Kingston homeJamaica is known internationally for its marijuana The hardy plant grows easily on the tropical Caribbean island where its use is culturally entrenched despite being legally banned for 100 years Cultivation is kept hidden with small patches tucked into mountainsides in swamps and between rows of other crops Wailer himself was convicted of possession in 1967 and did more than a year of hard laborPrevious moves to decriminalize the drug failed to advance mainly because officials feared they would violate international treaties and bring sanctions from Washington But now with a number of US states relaxing their marijuana laws  Colorado and Washington even allow recreational use  Jamaica is rethinking its positionJustice Minister Mark Golding says Jamaicas Cabinet has approved a plan to decriminalize marijuana including for religious purposes and legislators are expected to authorize it before the end of the yearFreedom to use marijuana for religious worship is one of various amendments to Jamaicas Dangerous Drugs Act supported by Prime Minister Portia Simpson Millers administration Her ministers also have proposed unclogging courts by decriminalizing small amounts of weed for personal use making possession of 2 ounces or less a ticketable offense The main hope is that a regulated medical marijuana and scientific research sector could help draw investments to the cashstrapped island which is laboring under its latest loan program with the International Monetary FundGanja as marijuana is known locally has a long history on the island It was introduced to Jamaica in the 19th century by Indian indentured servants and it gained popularity as a medicinal herb Use spread among the poor in the 1930s with the founding of Rastafari a spiritual movement that melds Old Testament teachings and PanAfricanism and whose followers worship the late Ethiopian Emperor Haile SelassieRasta adherents say use of the holy herb induces a meditative state that brings them closer to the divine The faithful smoke it as a sacrament in chalice pipes or cigarettes called spliffs add it to vegetarian stews and place it in fires as a burnt offeringFor years Rastafarians were treated as secondclass citizens and looked down upon by many Jamaicans as oddball even dangerous drugaddled cultists Police shooting ranges once had images of dreadlocked Rastas as targets The spiritual movement attracts only a small percentage of the countrys mostly Christian population of 27 millionIt wasnt until the 1970s when the Wailers and other Rasta musicians popularized the Rastafarian culture among betteroff Jamaicans that marijuanas popularity began to filter through the islands rigid class structure and gain a wider acceptance Marleys worldwide popularity has made him Jamaicas most famous and revered sonWhile Rastafari followers tend to disdain government initiatives for many Jamaicas decriminalization plans signal a crucial victory after decades of struggleThe momentum building presents a major step forward for the recognition of the religious rights and expression of Rastafari said Anta Anthony Merritt a Rastafarian priest who is a faculty member at San Diego State UniversityEven if the current proposals fall short of the full legalization Rastas long have sought they are welcomed by many said Priest Dermot Fagan leader of a small sect in an isolated commune in the Blue Mountains that tower over KingstonWe are thankful for the coming changes and yes some of the pressures will be eased But we cant forget the destruction the mayhem that has been caused by the persecution of this divine herb said Fagan waving his hands for emphasis on a balcony overlooking the School of Vision retreat a place where Rasta mysticism brushes against the realities of modern lifeResearchers who study the movement are curious about how decriminalization for Rastafari will play out For now there are a lot of unanswered questions Ennis Edmonds an associate professor of religious studies at Ohios Kenyon College whose publications focus on Rastafari said determining what is religious use in Jamaica will not be easy Theres essentially no formal church organized conversion process and few places of communal gathering An individual Rastas personal relationship with Jah or God is considered central to the faithMost ritual smoking does not take place in official places of worship but in peoples yards and on street corners Can a single Rasta smoking a spliff in any location claim religious use privileges Edmonds askedBut for Wailer the time is clearly ripe for change in Babylon the unflattering Rasta term for the Western worldRastas have gone through a lot of hassles for years getting criminalized and locked up for using the herb But things are changing because ganja is what the world needs now Wailer said before taking another appreciative toke from his

OpEds calling for the legalization of pot The firstcompares current policy to the nationwide prohibition of alcohol between 1920 and 1933It took 13 years for the United States to come to its senses and end Prohibition 13 years in which people kept drinking otherwise lawabiding citizens became criminals and crime syndicates arose and flourished It has been more than 40 years since Congress passed the current ban on marijuana inflictinggreat harm on society just to prohibit a substance far less dangerous than alcoholThe reactions on Twitter were robustThe New York Times is right the war on marijuana is racist So is the rest of the war on drugs httptcoAh1xETxRsZ Vox voxdotcom 27 Jul 14And not a moment too soon nytimes The NYT Editorial Board is endorsing a repeal of the federal ban on

KevinWGlass 27 Jul 14Was glad to see Times editorial didnt claim marijuana legalization would put Mexican cartels out of business Not likely for many reasons Damien Cave damiencave 26 Jul 14If marijuana legalization wasnt already a major political issue its about to get much bigger httptcoNfaoibx3ZD Rebecca Berg rebeccagberg 26 Jul 14The Times is the largest newspaper in the United States to come out in support of pot legalization  though not the first The Seattle Times published an editorial in February 2011 urging the Washington State Legislature to lift a state ban on the drug Marijuana should be legalized regulated and taxed The push to repeal federal prohibition should come from the states and it should begin with the state of Washington Initiative 502  a statewide measure legalizing marijuana use  passed in November 2012Colorado also passed a legalization ballot initiative that year and although an editorial in The Denver Postsaid that possession and use of marijuana should be legal Amendment 64 a state constitutional amendment was considered an inappropriate route If the federal government continues to resist concessions to growing sentiment in the favor of a truce in the war on marijuana the editorial said individual states may have to defy Washington in the same way many have with medical marijuana But were not prepared to welcome such a step by Colorado now or the clash that would ensue between the federal government and this state For that matter if Colorado becomes an island with legal marijuana whats to prevent it from also becoming a magnet nationally for marijuana users and distributorsLast year after leaders in the District of Columbia endorsed aplan to make smalltime marijuana possessiona civil rather than criminal offenseThe Washington Post which has not always been amenable to legalization efforts published an editorial supporting a similar plan to slap smalltime users with a civil fine which is a measured way to send a message that the government does not condone or tolerate marijuana useAttitudes about marijuana are changing and quickly The Post conceded Of all the official reactions to changing mores on marijuana decriminalization is the bestOther major newspapers to have endorsed decriminalization of marijuana at the federal or state level or bothinclude The StarLedger New Jersey The Las Vegas ReviewJournal The Indianapolis Star The Orange County RegisterandThe Baltimore SunOthers remain hesitant if not outright opposedThe editors of The Oregonian for example were concerned about Initiative 502 Washington voters have changed the question Oregonians will answer in November when they cast their ballots for or against legalization To a significant degree the question of availability has been settled Credit  or blame  rests with both Oregonians who approved a wideopen medical marijuana system and Washingtonians who will now be peddling pot legally to thousands of OregoniansOregon will vote on legalization this November and The Oregonian advises marijuana opponents who resent being maneuvered into an uncomfortable position by Washington voters to think of Novembers vote as an opportunity to fight backThe fact that legal pot has growing momentum doesnt mean its a good idea a 2012 editorial in USA Todaysaid Modern marijuana can be very powerful potent enough to make it dangerous to drive or operate other machinery under the influence Backers of legal pot wisely advocate tough penalties for driving while stoned but do we really want to add another widely available drug to roads where alcohol already causes mayhem And do we want to worry more than we already do that pilots or train engineers or others are high when they come to work That would be more likely if pot were legalIn an editorial published earlier this year The Wall Street Journal was similarly skeptical Marijuana politics are changing especially in California the West and New England but the consequences of legalization are unknowable in advance Perhaps the gains will be everything the stoners claim though bonginspired visions tend to be defeated by realityOther major newspapers to express antilegalization views even in medical cases include The Los Angeles Timesin 2010 The Arizona Republic2013 The Deseret News2012 The Oklahoman2014 and The Christian Science

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/opinion/mexicos-deadly-narco-politics.html,IGUALA Mexico  STUDENT protesters in rural Mexico have long dealt with heavyhanded police officers But on the black night of Sept 26 students who attended a rural teachers college realized they were facing a far worse menace in this southern city Not only were police officers shooting haphazardly at them killing three students and several passersby shady gunmen were also firing from the sidelinesThe next morning the corpse of a student was dumped on a major street Hed had his skin peeled off and his eyes gouged out It was the mark of drug cartel assassinsSoldiers and federal detectives detained two alleged cartel hit men who confessed they had conspired with the police to murder students They led troops to pits on the outskirts of Iguala containing 28 charred corpses Forensic teams are working to identify the bodies A total of 43 students went missing that night many last seen being bundled into police carsWhen I went to the grave site on an eerie hill it still stank of decaying human flesh I had just been interviewing some of the students classmates at their university mostly teenage sons of poor farmers who are idealistic committed and frightened I have covered cartel violence in Mexico for over a decade But as I inhaled the stench of death on that hill and saw photos of the mutilated student on the road I felt as never before that I was covering an act of pure unadulterated evilWhy drug cartels want to slaughter students may at first seem inexplicable But it is a symptom of a systematic process that has been taking place in Mexico for years Drug cartels are taking over chunks of government apparatus from local police forces to city and state governments Sometimes they control the officials other times cartel members themselves are the officials I call it state capture A student I talked to had a more visceral term for it narcopolitica or narcopoliticsIts a terrifying concept Being ruled by corrupt and selfinterested politicians can be bad But imagine being ruled by sociopathic gangsters They respond to rowdy students in the only way they understand with extreme violence designed to cause terror They stick the mutilated body of a student on public display in the same way they do rival traffickersThe market city lies amid hills of marijuana and opium fields and is the fief of a brutal cell of traffickers who call themselves Guerreros Unidos or Warriors United After the discovery of the massacre of the students federal soldiers took control of the city Twentytwo police officers were detained for working with the cartel In a brazen move the Warriors put up banners calling for the release of the officersThe Iguala police chief is now on the run with an arrest warrant behind him The Iguala mayor has also fled town as the state moves to impeach him An intelligence agency report linked him to the Warriors the Mexican media revealed His wife has also come into the spotlight One of her brothers served prison time for trafficking and two others were killed in a gangland shooting according to the intelligence report Who knows how high this trail of corruption may leadThe Iguala mayor was a member of the opposition Democratic Revolution Party But the international attention to this atrocity is also an embarrassment for President Enrique Pea Nieto Since taking power in 2012 he has been laboring to change Mexicos violent image focusing on reforms such as opening up the nations energy sector to foreign companies He has also taken down major drug traffickers such as Joaqun Guzmn Loera known as El Chapo and Nazario Moreno Gonzlez also known as El Ms Loco Some observers say Mr Pea Nietos reforms have made this Mexicos moment But can it really be Mexicos moment with such barbaric crimes against young people taking place The president may be reforming Mexicos laws but this case highlights the deep problems in the institutions needed to uphold those lawsThe students in Iguala had themselves protested against Mr Pea Nietos reforms as they are opposed to an education law that will evaluate teachers Most come from poor indigenous communities where many dont even speak Spanish and they object to being tested and someday possibly being fired for not knowing enough EnglishThe rural teachers university the students attend is a longtime center of radicalism covered in pictures of Che Guevara and Lenin Their protests can be noisy and anger residents as they blockade roads holding up traffic and vandalize buildings To travel to their marches they often commandeer commercial buses They normally return them and the practice is largely tolerated but the bus companies complain about the disruption of their operationsAbout 120 of these students had come to Iguala from their nearby university on Sept 26 and took three buses from the city station They were driving the buses out of town when the police officers and cartel gunmen opened fire on them Some students say they threw stones back but none of them were armed when the killing spree beganThe events that led to such a violent response are still blurry There are reports that city officials were particularly angry about students disturbing a public event The large group of boisterous students could be seen by cartel operatives as invading their turf But whatever the exact mechanics the frightening specter is of a city controlled by gangsters responding to public disorder with mass murderThe students wanted the buses to travel to an annual demonstration on Oct 2 in Mexico City That day commemorates the massacre by soldiers of dozens  or possibly hundreds  of students in the capitals square of Tlatelolco in the leadup to the 1968 Olympics The students in Iguala never made it to mourn the dead of half a century ago Now Sept 26 marks a new date of atrocities on Mexicos calendar,2014-10-10T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/23/us/ap-us-border-deaths.html,TUCSON Ariz   The number of people who died trying to cross the USMexico border has dropped to the lowest level in 15 years as more immigrants turned themselves in to authorities in Texas and fewer took their chances with the dangerous trek across the Arizona desertThe US government recorded 307 deaths in the 2014 fiscal year that ended in September  the lowest number since 1999 In 2013 the number of deaths was 445The Border Patrols Rio Grande Valley sector finished the 2014 budget year with 115 deaths compared with 107 in the Tucson sector according to figures obtained by The Associated Press It marks the first time since 2001 that Arizona has not been the deadliest place to cross the borderArizona has long been the most dangerous border region because of tripledigit temperatures rough desert terrain and the sheer volume of immigrants coming in to the state from Mexico But more immigrants are now entering through Texas and not Arizona driven by a surge of people from Central AmericaThe Tucson and Rio Grande Valley both saw their numbers of deaths decline from 2013 although Arizonas drop was more precipitousBorder enforcement officials say the lower numbers are in part due to increased rescue efforts as well as a Spanishlanguage media campaign discouraging Latin Americans from walking across the borderTucson Sector Division Chief Raleigh Leonard says the addition of 10 new rescue beacons that were strategically placed in areas where immigrants traverse most often has been a factor in the decrease in deathsI think we can all agree that crossing the border is an illegal act but nothing that should be assigned the penalty of death Leonard said in an interviewImmigrant rights advocates are skeptical that it is solely the Border Patrols efforts contributing to the decrease in deathsAt best what the Border Patrol is accomplishing is a geographical shift in where these deaths are happening  rather than adequately responding to the scale of the crisis said Geoffrey Boyce a border enforcement and immigration researcher at the University of Arizona and a volunteer with the Tucsonbased nonprofit No More DeathsThe Rio Grande Valley sector was flooded with a surge in unaccompanied minors and families with children who turned themselves in at border crossings in Texas Most were from Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador where gang violence and a poor economy have driven out huge numbers of people That surge has dwindled recently however as US and Central American authorities have launched a public relations campaign warning parents against sending their children to the USMeanwhile the Tucson Sector once the busiest in the nation has seen a steep decline in border crossers Fewer Mexicans are crossing into the US as the economy here has faltered and drug violence at home has improvedThe Border Patrol also responds to hundreds of cases each year of immigrants who need to be rescued while crossing the desert long an issue in the Arizona desert The Border Patrol conducted 509 rescues in the 2014 fiscal year in the Tucson sector compared to 802 in 2013Some of the rescues are made with the help of beacons that were activated 142 times this year The beacons are 30feet tall solarpowered and have sun reflectors and blue lights on top that are visible for 10 miles The beacons also have signs in three languages directing users to push a red button that sends out a signal for help Agents respond usually within 10 minutes to an hourThe agency has a team dedicated solely to rescues called Border Patrol Search Trauma and RescueAgents in this elite group spend their days searching for immigrants and responding when one seeks help They assist not only those who cross the border in search for jobs but also drug mules and smugglers who become injured or dehydrated in the summer heatIt was only 10 am and already 95 degrees on a day in late June when the units agents provided medical assistance to a 28yearold man suspected of smuggling drugs near Sells ArizonaThe thin man had an ID from El Salvador and said he lived in Tucson He oscillated between Spanish and English but his message was the same He was in extreme painThe agents gave him a gallon of a sports beverage He was to drink it slowly they told him or else it would make him sick Next they connected a saline bag intravenously and checked his vitalsThe agents monitored him and reexamined his vitals concluding that he wasnt dehydrated but suffering from muscle fatigue Minutes later agents who used a drugsniffing K9 to search the area found several bundles of marijuana and another suspected smugglerThe men were arrested on suspicion of being in the country

Should legalized gambling be expanded And should Montanas state auditor who does not audit the state instead be called the Commissioner of Securities and InsuranceVoters will decide 147 statewide questions in all ranging from the profound to the mundane Here are a few key themes to watch for on election nightMinimum wage The federal minimum wage is 725 per hour Four states Alaska Arkansas Nebraska and South Dakota will consider proposals to raise it to levels ranging from 8 to 975 Illinois will vote on a nonbinding advisory question about whether the minimum wage should be 10 Michigan voters however will not vote on a minimumwage increase because lawmakers there enacted one in May under pressure from groups collecting signatures to pass a larger increase by initiativeDrugs and alcohol Colorado and Washington legalized recreational marijuana by ballot initiative in 2012 this year Alaska the District of Columbia and Oregon will consider doing the same Florida will vote on legalizing marijuana for medical use Arkansas will consider a proposal to legalize alcohol sales statewide currently about half the states counties are dryGambling Eight states will vote on proposals to expand legal gambling In two the question is whether legislatively approved expansions should be ratified in Massachusetts voters will decide whether to go ahead with three casinos that the legislature authorized while Californians will consider rejecting a state law that authorizes the North Fork band of Mono Indians to open a casino in the Central Valley on a site 36 miles away from the actual tribal settlement Another tribe that operates a nearby casino has led the opposition to offreservation gamblingColorado Rhode Island and South Dakota will decide whether to legalize more kinds of gambling games at existing facilities For example blackjack is currently legal in Deadwood SD but craps and roulette are not Kansas South Carolina and Tennessee will vote on allowing raffles or lotteries as nonprofit fundraising vehiclesHunting Alabama and Mississippi voters will decide whether to establish a constitutional right to hunt Maine voters will decide whether to ban bearbaiting and using dogs to hunt bears And the only statewide ballot questions in Michigan are two nearly identical proposals to reject state laws authorizing wolf hunting  but it doesnt really matter how people vote on them since the states legislature enacted a new law to ensure that its authorization of a wolf hunt would stand even if voters reject the other two lawsTransportation funding Several states are considering how much money to dedicate to transportation Texas will vote on a constitutional amendment to divert certain oil and gas extraction taxes to shore up its transportation fund Maryland and Wisconsin may amend their constitutions to prevent legislators from raiding transportation funds to pay for other parts of government Massachusetts legislators have indexed the states gasoline tax to inflation so that transportation revenues would keep up with inflation voters are now being asked to repeal indexationVoting Montana will decide whether to abolish sameday voter registration Missouri will consider amending its constitution to allow early voting but only during business hours on six weekdays before the election Earlyvoting advocates had hoped for a more expansive early voting periodBaitandswitch questions Arkansass Issue 3 is titled The Arkansas Elected Officials Ethics Transparency and Financial Reform Amendment of 2014 Its most important effect however would be to lengthen term limits in the states legislature from a maximum of 8 years to 16Californias Proposition 46 is called Drug and Alcohol Testing of Doctors Medical Negligence Lawsuits Proponents advertisements have focused on the aspect of the law that would require doctors to submit to random drug and alcohol tests But the core of the dispute over Prop 46 is whether the cap on pain and suffering damages in medical negligence lawsuits should be raised to 11 million from 250000 As Adam Nagourney reported for The Times in AugustBaseactivating measures Illinois voters will consider three questions on hotbutton issues for the left raising the minimum wage requiring prescription drug plans to cover contraception and imposing a tax on millionaires to fund education However all three questions are purely advisory and will have no force of law Republicans in Illinois have criticized the questions as using the referendum process to drive turnout rather than for lawmakingOf course using referendums for base activation isnt a strategy unique to the left Republicans sought to put proposals against samesex marriage on ballots in 2004 in part to increase turnout among social conservatives And this year there are some largely symbolic questions coming from the right including those righttohunt measures in the South and a state constitutional amendment to ban the use of Sharia law in Alabama a similar proposal adopted by Oklahoma voters in 2010 was thrown out by federal courtsAre we really voting on this In general state constitutions can be amended only by popular vote and the overinclusiveness of those constitutions can lead to voters being asked to weigh in on some very mundane questionsFor example New York voters will decide whether to allow the state legislature to distribute proposed legislation to its members electronically Currently a paper copy of every proposed bill must be placed on every members desk three days before voting leading to the use of 19 million sheets of paper in every twoyear session The paperbills requirement is in the constitution so the legislature cant stop the printing without voters permissionWyoming voters will decide whether nonresidents of the state may sit on the University of Wyoming board of trustees Again yes thats a matter in the state constitution that the legislature couldnt change without voter approvalAnd then theres the issue of the Montana state auditor Despite her title the state auditors job is regulating the securities and insurance industries State Auditor Monica Lindeen thinks that confuses the public and shes already started using the title Commissioner of Securities and Insurance Making that change official requires amending the constitution which legislators voted to do last year now voter approval is requiredBut this is not the first time Montanans have weighed in on what the auditor should be called In 2006 when the legislature put a question on the ballot asking whether to rename the office as Insurance Commissioner 64 percent of voters rejected the proposal Perhaps this time will be different,2014-10-31T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/us/joseph-d-mcnamara-father-of-community-policing-dies-at-79.html,Joseph D McNamara a onetime New York City patrolman who earned a doctorate from Harvard and went on to become a California police chief whose pioneering embrace of community policing and diversity in the ranks helped catalyze broad changes in police practices nationwide died on Sept 19 at his home in Carmel Calif He was 79The cause was pancreatic cancer according to a family statementMr McNamara who headed police departments in San Jose Calif from 1976 to 1991 and in Kansas City Mo for three years in the 70s was known for the farsighted policies he implemented and for his iconoclastic outspokenness on law enforcement topics often decades ahead of the packSince the 1980s he had openly criticized the federal governments war on drugs which he said filled prisons and squandered resources without putting a dent in the drug problem He opposed mandatory sentencing laws and supported legalizing marijuana when few in his position were doing so And his condemnation of gun manufacturers in the 1980s for their production of assault weapons and armorpiercing bullets led the National Rifle Association to attack him personally in fullpage ads in Time and in NewsweekAt the same time Mr McNamara was making changes in San Jose  the nations 17thlargest city in 1980 and now the 10th  that drew the attention of police professionals around the countryA decade before the New York Police Department began experimenting with community policing in 1989 Mr McNamara had tested those techniques in Kansas City and put them to use in San Jose He trained San Jose officers in how to develop relationships with merchants residents and community leaders in highcrime areas promoting officers who accepted the changes and sidelining those who did notHe recruited more minority group members into the citys mostly white police force and rooted out officers who were the subjects of repeated excessiveforce complaints He was among the first chiefs to use neighborhood crime statistics in deploying officers and to install computers in police carsHe was about 20 years ahead of his time and one of the most thoughtful people in the business said Jim Bueermann the president of the Washingtonbased Police Foundation a nonpartisan research center created by the Ford Foundation in the late 1960s to promote improvements in police policies His views were sometimes controversial to say the least But they stretched the thinking of everyone in the professionMr McNamaras views on drug policy community relations statistics and use of force once considered almost fringe ideas have entered the mainstream of police policy discussions Mr Bueermann saidIt wouldnt have seemed possible 20 years ago  how much we have evolved toward his thinking he saidMr McNamara was born into a New York City police family on Dec 16 1934 in Manhattan His father and brother were both police officers After joining the citys police force in 1958 he rose through the ranks to become a lieutenant while taking night classes at the John Jay School of Criminal Justice which awarded him his bachelors degreeIn 1968 he received a fellowship from Harvard University to study criminal justice He went on to receive a PhD in public administration there before returning to the Police DepartmentHe was a deputy inspector in charge of crime statistics analysis for several years before he was hired as the chief of police in Kansas CityHe is survived by his wife Laurie a son Donald two daughters Lauren McNamara Barrus and Karen McNamaraRust and four grandchildrenDuring Mr McNamaras time in San Jose the city grew enormously overtaking San Francisco as the most populous in Northern California as it rode the Silicon Valley boom and its crime rate in 1990 was the lowest of any city in the United States with a population of more than 400000 according to the FBIIn March 1991 when Los Angeles police officers were videotaped beating Rodney King after a highspeed car chase Mr McNamara was the only American police chief known to have publicly demanded the resignation of the Los Angeles chief Daryl Gates The tape was evidence that brutality was ingrained in the citys Police Department he saidThat tape has cast a cloud over the credibility of all police he said No one is going to believe you if you say it is just an isolated incident It is selfevident that it couldnt have beenHis stand brought him into open conflict with the San Jose Police Officers Association which like other police groups around the country criticized him as interfering in the investigationMr McNamara announced his resignation that April telling The San Francisco Chronicle that the stress of the job and his history of heart trouble were factors in the decision I thought I was going to end up in the emergency room myself he saidAfter resigning he became a fellow at the Hoover Institute at Stanford University a conservativeleaning think tank He also wrote five crime novelsWriting in academic journals and mainstream newspapers he was among the first to question the growing use of military hardware by local police departments nearly two decades before the armored police response to protests in Ferguson Mo this summer over the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officerHe blamed the drug war for instilling a military mindset in police departments saying it undermined community policingSimply put he wrote in a 2006 oped article in The Wall Street Journal the police culture in our country has changed An emphasis on officer safety and paramilitary training pervades todays policingPolice work would always be dangerous he wrote but this isnt Iraq,2014-09-29T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/06/sports/phelps-steps-away-seeking-the-help-others-could-have-provided.html,Watching Michael Phelpss return to swimming was like worrying a loose tooth with your tongue His comeback was a cause for nervousness for anyone familiar with the master plan that had made him greatThe blueprint for becoming the most decorated athlete in Olympics history required Phelps 29 to be a onedimensional swimming machine and that singular focus proved a doubleedged sword It was the tool that enabled Phelps to dominate the best swimmers for more than a decade but it provided him no mechanism for maneuvering in the world beyond the poolSo when Phelps ended his retirement after 18 months it raised a concern Did he have unfinished business in the water or was his return an act of surrender an acknowledgment that he could not find firm footing on dry landPhelps was arrested and charged with driving under the influence last week and like his first such incident in November 2004 it came during what passes for the soak phase in swimmings competitive cycle Many of the other postcollegians who competed alongside Phelps in the Pan Pacific Championships in August are just getting back in the water or in the midst of their last extended break before the training thrust that will carry them through the 2016 OlympicsThis down time when a swimmers life has the least amount of structure has always been Phelpss danger zoneGive him a goal like winning eight gold medals becoming the winningest Olympian or making the 2014 Pan Pacific team and Phelps can summon a champions focus Without such a road map Phelps appears lostWith his decision Sunday to enter a sixweek inpatient program to address his drinking Phelps has taken a huge step toward finding himself It was his decision alone not an intervention his handlers saidThe truth is Phelps has been floundering for a long timeAt the USA Swimming nationals in August Phelpss longtime coach Bob Bowman recalled a conversation the two had after the 2004 Olympics in Athens where Phelps won eight medals including six golds Bowman had moved to Ann Arbor Mich to coach the Michigan mens team Phelps followed him there and was miserableBowman said He came into my office and said I dont fit in here And I was like You dont fit in anywhere He said Im just not normal And I was like Thats right and isnt that awesomeWell yes and no Phelps had clearly defined goals which separated him from most of the undergraduate population But he also lacked the social skills that could have helped him find new friends that might have broadened his interests With the 2008 Olympics approaching the people closest to Phelps were largely invested in narrowing his world not broadening itIn 2009 after a photograph surfaced of Phelps with a marijuana pipe Bowman acknowledged the tradeoffs inherent in Phelpss becoming the most decorated athlete in a single Olympics as he did with eight golds in 2008He missed some experiences that other people had Bowman said I guess the question is what do we do after that And I think thats what hes working on now expanding his horizons beyond swimmingPhelpss mother Debbie said in 2009 that she could foresee her son becoming a businessman in the next four eight yearsFive years and six Olympic medals later Phelps was back where he started in the pool training for another Summer Games It was hard to argue that Phelps ought to be anywhere else when he finished the summer longcourse season as one of only two Americans to post a worldbest timePhelps said he was having fun Others said he was making a much greater effort than before to connect with his younger teammates But there were signs he hadnt changed much at all as when he gave Bowman an expletivelaced earful in the warmdown pool after one of his lossesSo much of Phelpss bad behavior over the years has been enabled by people invested in him carrying his sport on his broad shoulders Would he be guilty of continuing lapses in judgment if USA Swimming had suspended Phelps for more than three months in 2009 after the marijuana pipe photograph surfaced and he had been forced to sit out the World Championships in Rome that yearWould Phelps need this time away to better understand himself if those around him had insisted that he complete his undergraduate college degree the better to find and develop a passion to drive him for the next quartercentury of his lifeOn Sunday morning Phelps wrote on Twitter Swimming is a major part of my life but right now I need to focus my attention on me as an individual and do the necessary work to learn from this experience and make better decisions in the futurePredictably the questions raised by his Twitter posts tended to be about his availability

NYT,http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/after-celebrity-drug-cases-industry-signs-deal-in-beijing/,Fortytwo artist management agencies in Beijing have signed an agreement with the police vowing to take action against illegal drug use within the industry The Beijing News reportedThe signing on Wednesday came just days after the actor Gao Hu 40 became the latest Chinese celebrity to be detained on drugrelated charges according to a report in the newspaper Peoples Daily Mr Gao who has appeared in films including Zhang Yimous The Flowers of War 2011 and The Bullet Vanishes 2012 was detained in Beijing this month for possession and use of marijuana and methamphetamine the newspaper reported on TuesdayThe agreement and the wave of celebrity detentions are part of what appears to be one of Chinas toughest crackdowns on illegal drug use in recent yearsIn June President Xi Jinping vowed to come down hard against drugrelated crimes while Premier Li Keqiang called drugs a common enemy to humanity That month the Supreme Peoples Court announced that in the first five months of 2014 39762 people had been sentenced in Chinese courts on drug offenses up 278 percent from the same period the year before according to Xinhua the state news agencyA string of highprofile entertainers have been ensnared in the crackdown in recent months including the singer Li Daimo the film director Zhang Yuan the writer and director Chen Wanning who uses the pen name Ning Caishen the actor Roy Cheung and more recently Mr GaoAt the signing on Wednesday the artist management agencies promised to help purify the industry by promoting antidrug rules and pledging not to hire or get involved with any performers with a history of drug useWe will not promote anyone who has a record of using drugs not even those who have quit since they have already had an extremely negative impact on society said Jin Jianqiang a senior executive for Beijing Century Performing Arts Company according to The Beijing NewsAntidrug officials have been especially active in Beijing which according to one employee for the Beijing Public Security Bureau quoted in The Beijing News has become a major hub for the drug trade in ChinaFrom April 22 when Beijing public security officials started a special operation to crack down on drugs to Aug 8 the authorities have uncovered 926 drugrelated cases and have seized more than 38 kilograms or 84 pounds of drugs The Beijing News said The police in Beijing said on Wednesday that they were planning to offer cash rewards to residents who provided information about drug offenders the newspaper saidAccording to Pi Yijun an antidrug adviser to the Beijing government the police have been relying heavily on informants to identify drug users The Associated Press reportedThis new type of drug is making it more difficult for the police to identify users because when they come into a club everybody can be suspicious not just a few people It would be too costly to test everyone so they mainly rely on whistleblowers Mr Pi said according to The APMr Pi also said the current drug crackdown was one of Chinas biggest in two decadesOn Saturday night the police reportedly made a surprise raid on a bar in Beijing called 2 Kolegas known for its live music and forced all the patrons in the bar to submit to a urine drug testIn an email that was circulated among China scholars and journalists Stephen McDonell a Chinabased correspondent for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation wroteFollowing a raid by uniformed and plainclothes police everyones name passport number and mobile phone number were taken downPolice held the little plastic bottles up to the light There was apparently some type of reaction if you failed the testThen those who tested positive including some foreigners were taken outside and made to sit on the ground some handcuffed some with their hands tied using tapeSeveral had their mouths tapedIn some cases it was marijuana use that had registered though I cant confirm if that was the same for everyoneAll of those who failed the test were then piled into police vans and driven away to a police station for questioningIn an update on Thursday Mr McDonell wrote that all the foreigners 4 or 5 were taken to a detention centre in Beijing where it seems they are to be held for two weeks before being deportedThe intensified crackdown is being carried out in response to what the antinarcotics authorities say has been a rise in illegal drug use As of the end of May the Ministry of Public Security reported 26 million registered drug users in China according to China Central Television the staterun broadcasterIn Beijing the number of drug addicts has been increasing at an annual rate of 10 percent for the past few years according to The Beijing News citing the citys Narcotics Control Bureau Last year the bureau said that 73 percent of the registered drug addicts in 2013 were 35 or younger and that as of May this year there were 25000 registered addicts in the city the newspaper reportedLiu Yuejin the director of the Ministry of Public Securitys Narcotics Control Bureau had previously labeled the spread of drugs  including more traditional drugs such as heroin and opium but also synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine ecstasy and ketamine  a grave situation While users of drugs such as heroin continue to be mostly farmers and the unemployed the user base of synthetic drugs has broadened to include entrepreneurs and professionals working in the entertainment and

the second time on DUI charges early Tuesday in his hometown of Baltimore another embarrassment for a swimmer who came out of retirement this year with his sights set on competing at the Rio GamesPhelps issued an apology that sounded very familiar to the ones he made after a drunkendriving arrest a decade ago as well as when a British tabloid published a photograph in 2009 that showed him using a marijuana pipeI understand the severity of my actions and take full responsibility Phelps said in a statement I know these words may not mean much right now but I am deeply sorry to everyone I have let downMaryland Transportation Authority police charged the 18time gold medalist after officers said he was caught speeding and failed field sobriety testsThe arrest came about a month after the 29yearold Phelps won three golds and two silvers at the Pan Pacific Championships in Australia setting himself up to compete at next summers world championships and at Rio in 2016Its too early to say if Phelps might face sanctions from USA Swimming which took no action after his 2004 arrest but suspended him from competition for three months over the pot pictureThe news regarding Michael Phelps and his actions are disappointing and unquestionably serious the national governing body said in a statement We expect our athletes to conduct themselves responsibly in and out of the poolThe US Olympic Committee had a similar reaction CEO Scott Blackmun said the organization was surprised by Phelps arrest and disappointed on a number of frontsPhelps was charged with driving under the influence excessive speed and crossing double lane lines in the Fort McHenry Tunnel on Interstate 95 in Baltimore according to the Maryland Transportation AuthorityIf convicted on the DUI charge he would face a maximum penalty of a year in jail a 1000 fine and the loss of his drivers license for six months Under Maryland law the latest case is not considered a second offense because his first DUI conviction occurred more than five years agoPhelps could face the wrath of his sponsors though there was no immediate word of any company planning to drop himIts too early to tell said Don Rockwell the CEO of Phelps new swimsuit sponsor Californiabased Aqua Sphere For the most part were supportive We just need to wait and see what happens This is not a dealbreaker for us unless we find out something else that happenedPhelps also has deals with Subway Under Armour Omega and Master SpasIn early August Phelps announced he was ending his long relationship with Speedo to sign the deal with Aqua Sphere Just last week according to Rockwell company officials were in Baltimore working with Phelps on the sizing of his new suit which he can begin wearing at meets starting Jan 1First he must deal with a more serious issueA Maryland Transportation Authority police officer was using radar about 140 am when Phelps white 2014 Land Rover came through the tunnel at 84 mph in a 45mph zone the agency said in a statementThe officer stopped Phelps just beyond the tunnels toll plazaMr Phelps was identified as the driver by his drivers license and appeared to be under the influence the statement said He was unable to perform satisfactorily a series of standard field sobriety testsKelly Melhem a spokesperson for the transportation agency said department vehicles are equipped with incar video recording devices Officials were trying to determine if there was footage of Phelps arrest which could be used as evidence if the case goes to trialThe statement said Phelps was cooperative during his arrest He was taken to an authority station and later releasedAfter the London Olympics two years ago Phelps followed through on his longstated plan to retire having won twice as many golds as anyone else and 22 medals overallPhelps returned to competition in April and set his sights on competing at the Rio Games which would be his fifth OlympicsHis first DUI arrest came in 2004 on the Eastern Shore of Maryland Phelps received 18 months probation a 250 fine and was required to deliver a presentation on alcohol awareness to students at three high schoolsI recognize the seriousness of this mistake he said at the time Ive learned from this mistake and will continue learning from this mistake for the rest of my lifePhelps wasnt charged after the picture came to light of him using a marijuana pipe at a party in South Carolina He did accept the suspension from USA Swimming for what he called bad judgment and a mistake I wont make againOne of his major sponsors Kellogg Co dropped him almost immediately Subway stayed with him and remains one of his biggest backersPhelps comeback is going wellWe accomplished everything we wanted to he said after the Pan Pacs We were able to find out some of the things I need to improve on over the next year and things I want to improve onHis biggest issue at the moment is outside the pool___Associated Press Writers Juliet

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/opinion/alison-lundergan-grimes-kay-hagan-and-other-candidates-avoid-obama.html,After a few days of trying to ignore the question Michelle Nunn the Democratic candidate for the United States Senate in Georgia acknowledged on Friday that she had voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 By this years standards thats pretty forthright especially compared with Alison Lundergan Grimes the Democrat running for the Senate in Kentucky who refuses to discuss her presidential voteOnly one Democratic Senate candidate this cycle has been willing to appear with the president on the stump Gary Peters in Michigan The others have spent months keeping their distance from Mr Obama and some of his best policies Even Ms Nunn just started running a television ad complaining that an attack ad by her Republican opponent David Perdue featured a misleading photo of her and Mr Obama The photo was actually taken at an event honoring President George HW Bush she saidThe panicky Democratic flight away from President Obama  and from some of the partys most important positions  is not a surprise Mr Obama remains highly unpopular among white voters particularly in Southern states where candidates like Ms Nunn Ms Grimes and several others are struggling to establish leads But one of the reasons for his unpopularity is that nervous members of his own party have done a poor job of defending his policies over the nearly six years of his presidency allowing a Republican narrative of failure to take holdFew voters know that the 2009 stimulus bill contributed heavily to the nations economic recovery saving and creating 25 million jobs Not a word of it is spoken on the campaign trail where little credit is also given to the White House for months of promising economic newsSimilarly the Affordable Care Act one of the most farreaching and beneficial laws to have been passed by Congress in years gets little respect even among the Democratic candidates who voted for it Though none support the Republican position of repeal most talk about the need to fix the health law as if it were a wreck alongside the road rather than a vehicle providing millions of people with health coverageWhen I think about the health care law frustrated disappointed you can put a lot of words toward it but every day I work to try to fix it said Senator Mark Begich of Alaska in a radio ad Mr Begich voted for the law In a recent debate Senator Kay Hagan a Democrat of North Carolina talked mostly about the commonsense fixes she wants to make to the lawSeveral Democratic candidates including Ms Hagan Ms Nunn and Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas quickly adopted the rightwing talking point that President Obama needs to impose a travel ban on all residents of African countries with Ebola cases even though most publichealth experts say such a ban would be ineffective and could make the situation worseSenator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana who has fought loudly against the presidents energy policies has scurried so far to the right that she even opposes legalizing marijuana for medical purposes though her leading Republican opponent supports itMany of these candidates are running in difficult political environments and are being careful about what they say or dont say in hopes of preserving Democratic control of the Senate They run the risk though of alienating important constituencies who prefer a party with a spine especially black voters who remain very supportive of Mr Obama By not standing firmly for their own policies Democrats send a message to voters that the unending Republican criticism of the president is legitimate There is much that is going right in this country and there is still time for Democrats to say so,2014-10-22T00:00:00Z,drugs

Submit yours to realestateqanytimescomFollowing the Smoke TrailQ Periodicallymarijuana smoke intrudes into our coop apartment For months it happened repeatedly day and nightgiving my wife asthma attacksSeveral shareholders complained but the coop board couldnt determine where the smoke was coming from even after management sent guards to check the stairwellsThe board said it would respondto complaintsif shareholders could report the source of the smell but no one can find itAre theremethods coops can use to trace the source of thesmoke Kips Bay ManhattanA There might be a good reason you cant figure out where that smoke is coming from You might be looking for a moving target Unlike cigarette smokers who typically stay put pot smokers have been known to meander particularly if they are teenagers trying to evade a parents watchful gaze Your resident pot smoker or smokers might smoke as he or she walks down the stairs or smoke on the roof leaving the door ajarBut smoke can be located Pot is distinctive  you can pinpoint it said Adam Leitman Bailey a real estate lawyer I went to collegeThe next time you smell it step outside your door to see if you notice anything or call the superintendent immediately and have him try to trace it while its fresh The board could hire a forensic engineer to investigate how smoke travels through apartments in the buildingEssentially what were doing is checking air pressure said Ronald E Bielinski a principal of Erwin and Bielinski a forensic engineering and architectural firm You want to find out how you communicate with your neighborsThe board could install cameras in the stairwells and hallways although shareholders might balk at the prospect of such a Big Brother maneuver Sometimes posting signs reminding residents that smoking is not permitted in common areas is enough to curb the practiceAbove all the board should take this issue seriously particularly because your wife suffers from asthmaIf you look at a list of things in the environment that can trigger an asthma attack cannabis is one of the things said Dr Sidney S Braman a professor of medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital who studies asthmaWrite the board a firm letter expressing your health concerns which ultimately affect your warranty of habitability It should take a more proactive approach about an issue that is putting a shareholders health at riskThe Ethical LandlordQ I rentouta large prewar studio in a coop building in a great neighborhood but the rent is about 300 below market rate I tried to raise my tenants rent by 8 percent but conceded to a 5 percent increase when the tenant balked Between assessments and increases in maintenance fees my rental income has dwindled Im retired and living only on Social Security and this rental income I need to raise the rent the next time the lease is up for renewal but how do I do that without being an evil landlord Im worried that if the tenant rejects the higher rent and moves out I could be left with a vacant apartment for months But ultimately my rental income would be higher with a marketrate tenant So how do I decide if the shortterm loss in income is worth the longterm gain What is the ethical and reasonable thing to doUpper East Side ManhattanA Its not easy asking someone to pay you more money especially if the person has been a good tenant But a landlordtenant relationship is a business arrangement and you are entitled to make the most from your investment I can hear the howls of jealousy coming from the citys longsuffering landlords of rentcontrolled tenantsThere is nothing evil with trying to get what market rate is said Gary L Malin the president of Citi HabitatsWhen the lease expires send the tenant a new one with your desired rent If the tenant balks politely explain that this is what the market would bear and that your costs have gone up as well Most leases provide landlords with a period of time like 60 days before a lease expires to show the apartment to prospective tenants So you should have sufficient time to find a new tenant that will meet board approval without losing any income But before you play hardball with a tenant who pays the rent on time and hasnt made trouble for you do your homework Check websites like Streeteasycom for comparable listings Find out from your property manager what other apartments in the building fetch Look at your apartment critically Is your kitchen updated Does the building have amenities These things affect the price And remember coops dont always command top rental dollar because coop boards can be persnicketyBut if your research confirms your suspicions take a deep breath and demand your due Mr Malin said Stick to your guns and think to yourself How long will it take me to recoup that moneyWhistling NoiseQ I have been a shareholder in a coop for 15 years The building recently modernized the elevators Since then I have been driven mad by a shrill piercing whistling noise I can only compare the noise to an unoiled metal machine or the highest pitch heard in a hearing test or chalk on a blackboard I cannot sleep either at night or when I try to catch up with a nap in the afternoon as the noise continues on and off all night and all day I am a writer and I cannot concentrate on my work and the screeching noise worsens the headache I already have from lack of sleep I have complained repeatedly to the building staff and management and nothing changes What should I doUpper East Side ManhattanA Did you happen to catch the recent episode of Mad Men where the character Ginsberg is driven insane by the hum from the giant computer Given your situation I wouldnt recommend you watch it Sleep deprivation as you know by now affects your ability to concentrate and has been associated with depression weight gain high blood pressure and even heart diseaseOne of the worst things you can do about sleep is worry about sleep said Dr Steven H Feinsilver a professor of medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital who specializes in sleep Take some comfort in knowing that even if your sleep is periodically interrupted during the night so long as you fall back to sleep again you can still get sufficient restThe property manager should certainly bring the elevator company back to take a look at their handiwork But in the meantime start documenting the noise You describe it as constant but is it something that someone else might miss like when you take the car to the mechanic and he cant hear that grating rattling soundWrite down when it starts and stops Bring the superintendent to your apartment to listen for it Invite board members and the property manager to come into your apartment so they can also hear it Write a formal letter to the board explaining the situation in detail pointing out that this began only after the elevator was modernized Ultimately the board needs to resolve this problem Theresa Racht a real estate lawyer said Theyve breached the warranty of habitability and they need to address this,2014-06-01T00:00:00Z,drugs

NFLs many backers Moffitt was a nave idealist who did not know his own luck and would lament his decisionMoffitt who lives in Seattle said he had no regrets Yet his journey into retirement at 27 has

relationship with his girlfriend dissolved and book publishers withdrew interest in his storyIt was like I jumped off a cliff Moffitt said of his arrest and the negative publicity that followed Those opportunities fell by the wayside But it also sent me in a different directionBefore the drug charges were dismissed and he pleaded guilty to the other charge he was fined 254 Moffitt enrolled in

residents at the clinic quizzed him unendingly about his life in the NFLThe biggest thing was that I realized so many people were depending on me and I felt that my only value is my production as a football player he said Whether it was expectations or money or the way I live if I dont meet everyones expectations Im a loser It is out of love but I felt like I was holding up this huge support system that was supposed to be my support systemMoffitts rollercoaster ride is not uncommon said Bahati VanPelt the executive director of the Trust a group funded by the NFL and players union that helps players after they retire Players spend much of their childhood and their adult lives fixated on football and devote little time to developing skills that will help them afterwardThreequarters of players drafted in the NFL are gone within four years either through injury or because they were cut and they may feel they have failed or are too proud to ask others for help Some players live away from those who could provide medical and psychological support and some may not have saved much moneyEver since they were in high school players are told not to worry about the next play only this play said VanPelt who added that making the transition to life outside the NFL could take from three months to two years They were an expert in their field and suddenly theyre expected to be an expert in other fieldsMoffitt is still unsure of how he will make a living though he is interested in the film industry He has considered driving an Uber cab and doing more standup comedy In a few months he said he would leave Seattle and his circle of football friends to start fresh in a new city He is spending time with Sean Pamphilon who has made documentaries about football players and witnessed their ups and downsTheres a duality to John that Im sure you understand Hes incredibly funny or he really wants to go inside himself and disappear Pamphilon said Im excited to see how he can use his brain while not getting it beaten inBy some standards Moffitt  who joked that he had outlived Jimi Hendrix Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison three of his musical heroes who all died at 27  is more fortunate than many players He is single and has no children and he worked with a financial adviser to put away money while he played He moved into a smaller townhouse in Renton not far from where the Seahawks who drafted him in 2011 have their practice facilityHe is also close with his parents who loved that their son had made it to the NFL and were taken aback when he walked away from the game After Moffitt was arrested his father did not give him any ultimatums but made it clear that it was up to him to change his behaviorI said I love you and will visit you in jail but I dont want to have to visit you in jail David Moffitt said I told him Youre at a crossroad there is no in betweenMoffitts father said his son was no angel and he said he recognized that John had partied too much but said You put it under the rug Ultimately he said he was happy that John was at peace with his decisionHes much more relaxed and not jacked up all the time the elder Moffitt said He doesnt have any regrets and I dont either,2014-11-06T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/27/us/ap-fbn-browns-gordon-suspended.html,CLEVELAND   Josh Gordons wait is over and so is his 2014 season Now the star wide receivers career is in perilThe Browns learned Wednesday that Gordons indefinite suspension by the NFL has been upheld and he will miss at least 16 games for another violation of the leagues substance abuse policy A repeat drug offender Gordon had appealed the penalty hoping it would be reduced so he could play this seasonThe NFL though came down hard on Gordon who must now pay the price for stepping out of boundsThe league announced that arbitrator Harold Henderson supported Gordons yearlong suspension for marijuana use The Pro Bowler who was subject to more frequent testing will begin serving his suspension immediately and the league said in its statement that his eligibility for reinstatement will be determined following the 2014 seasonIn the meantime Gordon is not allowed to practice with the team attend meetings or other club functionsBrowns general manager Ray Farmer expressed some disappointment at the decision but said the team has no choice but to move ahead without GordonWhile we may have strong feelings on the timing and the process of this decision we have also consistently communicated that we will focus on what we can control in our day to day approach Farmer said in a statement Right now that is preparing our team for the 2014 season and at the same time supporting Josh however we are able under NFL guidelines during his suspensionThe Browns had feared for months this would be the outcome and now that its official the club will have to somehow make up for the leagueleading 1646 yards 189 yards per catch and nine touchdowns Gordon produced last seasonId like to apologize to my teammates coaches the Cleveland Browns organization and our fans Gordon said in a statement I am very disappointed that the NFL and its hearing office didnt exercise better discretion and judgment in my case I would like to sincerely thank the people who have been incredibly supportive of me during this challenging time including my family my agent my union my legal team and the Cleveland Browns staffWhile hes out Gordon who served a twogame suspension for a drug violation last season will need to pass drug tests comply with treatment and apply for reinstatement with Commissioner Roger Goodell before he plays again Gordon could possibly return inside a year if he stays cleanGordon met with league officials in New York on Aug 4 to appeal his suspension As the days past there was growing speculation he might not be punished to the letter of the collective bargaining agreement But Henderson sided with the leagues initial ruling after an exhaustive processThe Browns have known Gordon could be banished for some time and theyve been eager for a resolution to his case which hung over their training camp He continued to practice and played in Clevelands first three exhibition gamesGordon fought the suspension by hiring attorney Maurice Suh to represent him at the appeal hearing Suh who had successfully gotten a suspension reduced for Seattle cornerback Richard Sherman argued that Gordon tested positive for marijuana due to secondhand smoke Gordons representatives also said test results of his samples were inconsistent and should be thrown outThere was speculation the league might go softer on Gordon following the public outcry after Baltimore running back Ray Rice was suspended for two games on a domestic violence charge Instead the league put Gordon on the sideline for all 16 games and will wait to see how he behaves before deciding whether to let him backGordon didnt help his cause with two legal issues as his case dragged on He was charged with drunken driving after his arrest in Raleigh North Carolina on July 5 In May he was stopped for speeding in Strongsville Ohio and one of the passengers in his car was cited for marijuana possessionThe talented 23yearold led the league with 1646 yards receiving last season despite being banned from the first two games for a failed drug test  It was his second known violation as a pro and Gordon said he had inadvertently taken codeine contained in a prescription cough syrupGordons loss is a crippling blow to Clevelands offense depriving the Browns of their best bigplay threat Pro Bowl tight end Jordan Cameron is now the teams primary target and he may find himself doubleteamed and without open spaces to run routes now that Gordon is missingThe Browns took a risk in selecting Gordon in the 2012 supplemental draft forfeiting a secondround pick to take the speedy 6foot3 225pounder who failed at least three drug tests in college for marijuana abuseThe team has vowed to do all it can to help and support Gordon During training camp owner Jimmy Haslam said the team never considered cutting himAs he awaited word from the league Gordon was noticeably different He dropped passes and seemed detached during an exhibition game in Washington Recently he posted a photo on Instagram of himself on the practice field catching a pass from rookie quarterback Johnny Manziel Gordon captioned the photo Only place I can find peaceIts been taken awayGordons on his own___OnlineAP NFL website wwwpro32aporg and wwwtwittercomAP_NFL,2014-08-27T13:11:55Z,drugs

child when she called the police in desperation Her father was violent she was afraid of him and she had nowhere to goHe pushed me against the refrigerator really hard then closed his hands really hard on my face and caused me pain she wrote in the summer of 2008 when she went to a Gilchrist County Court to seek a domestic violence injunction against her father Don C Spirit I am very scared of him I know what he is capable ofMs Spirit wrote that her father threatened to make her life hell if she called the authorities She did go to the police Although she did not follow up on her request for a restraining order online court records show he was later sentenced to six months in jail on a battery charge that arose that same weekOn Thursday the police said Mr Spirit killed his daughter now 28 her six children and then himself making the case the seventh domesticrelated multiple homicide in Florida this year The victims include Kaleb Kuhlmann 11 Kylie Kuhlmann 9 Johnathon Kuhlmann 8 Destiny Stewart 5 Brandon Stewart 4 and Alanna Stewart who was born in JuneThe Spirits lived together in a cycle of extreme poverty drug addiction and domestic violence in Bell a tiny town west of Gainesville where peanuts are grown and dairy cows roam the fieldsThe Spirit familys story shows how a downward spiral of drug use debt and repeated arrests can sometimes result in extreme violence despite interventions by the authorities Repeated interactions with the Florida Department of Children and Families did not save the children even though court records show social workers sent the parole authorities to the Spirit home just a month ago It is also a reminder that amid the recent focus on domestic violence it is not just spouses and boyfriends who can be assailantsThe agency would not say why the children were still in the home despite court records showing that it knew that Ms Spirit and her boyfriend James Stewart had smoked synthetic marijuana in front of their children while both were on probation The agency said Friday that a Critical Incident Rapid Response Team would assess the agencys interactions and interventions with the family before the killingsA close friend of Ms Spirit who lives in Bell and spoke on the condition of anonymity because she feared reprisals in her tightknit community said Ms Spirit had a good heart but was always struggling to support her family and keep it together Her life was a mess the friend said She had no job She couldnt work with all them kids Every time I turned around something bad was happening to herMs Spirit was 15 when her father an exconvict accidentally shot and killed her brother Kyle during a hunting trip Mr Spirit was not supposed to be in possession of a firearm and for that he was sentenced to three years in prison records showAt 17 Ms Spirit was pregnant with her first child By the time her father was released from prison Ms Spirit had two more children and was taking care of a little brother as well her parents divorce records showIn the years that followed Ms Spirit was in and out of court She was arrested on charges of theft battery and illegal drug use and sought child support payments from the fathers of her children One of those arrests was after a fight with an 18yearold girlMs Spirit was also convicted of grand theft this year after she stole 400 from the wallet of an acquaintance she visited in 2013She had been living in a dilapidated shack on the property of her boyfriends family The boyfriend Mr Stewart also ran afoul of the law He was arrested on charges of battery and dealing in stolen property and is in jailMs Spirit lived hand to mouth on government assistance her friend said The children were often dirty and unfed and at one point they were removed from her custodyA couple of weeks ago Ms Spirit knocked on her friends front door asking for diapers for the newborn and food for the other children With her brother Joshua and both the fathers of her children behind bars Ms Spirit who had epilepsy was so down on her luck that she felt she had no choice but to return to live with her father the friend saidTheir relationship was clearly strained Court records show Mr Spirit took his daughter to court three years ago accusing her of collecting support payments for one of her children Johnathon even though he had been living with Mr Spirit Mr Spirit said the money belonged to himA judge ordered Ms Spirit to pay her father 6578 in back payments She was supposed to be paying him 100 a monthResidents said Mr Spirit disliked his grandchildren and called them names in public The Gainesville Sun reportedYou see how small this town is we all knew he didnt like those kids the newspaper quoted Kim Berry a Bell resident as saying Were shocked it came to thisThe investigators said they knew of no motivesAs far as I know there was no motive related to anybody Lt Jeff Manning of the Gilchrist County Sheriffs Department said at a news conference Friday morning I dont know how you get clear signs that something like this could happenHe choked up and paused Its a difficult scene to try to fathom why somebody did what they did he saidWhat is known about Mr Spirit indicates a troubled life that deteriorated even further after the death of his son Kyle I may not have lived the best life he said in 2001 after killing his son on the hunting trip The St Petersburg Times reported thenMr Spirits divorce records show that when he was released from prison he planned to take custody of his surviving son Joshua He argued with his former wife over possessions such as a Jet Ski and a camper and in letters to her he clearly saw himself as the better parentThe relationship had not always been so fractious His former wife Christine Jeffers had urged the court to be lenient on him in the shooting death of Kyle saying that Mr Spirit had not recovered from his deathThe loss of our son has really taken a toll on him and he blames himself every day she wrote in a letter to the judge according to The Gainesville SunHe has punished himself more than the court system ever could punish him she wrote Since our sons death my husband has been severely depressed The doctors have not found a medication yet to help him There is not a day that goes by that I dont catch him cryingBut court records show that even before his sons death Mr Spirit had a criminal record In cases dating back to 1990 he had been convicted of drug possession battery and depriving a child of food and shelterBill Shaffer a neighbor said Mr Spirit had a strange quality Mr Shaffer said he once gave Mr Spirit a ride but his neighbor scarcely said a word and never even said thank youPolice would not reveal any details about the crime scene Other family members were unavailable for commentRobert Rankin superintendent of Gilchrist County schools said there were no indications of any problems with Ms Spirits children Three attended Bell Elementary School one in second grade one in third and one in fifthMr Shaffer said Bell population 453 is a nice quiet agricultural community the kind of place where if someones house burns down people set up a donation box right away to help There are few jobs though Most of the good ones involve hauling rocks sand and logsMr Spirit was often seen in the neighborhood riding his bicycleAnother neighbor Mark Hall said he knew the Spirits only through his own fifthgrade son Kaleb he said had gotten into fights in school and Mr Hall said he was concerned that he was bullying his sonMy son tried to befriend him but I

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/16/us/ap-car-nascar-stewart-.html,CANANDAIGUA NY   After more than six weeks in limbo NASCAR star Tony Stewart finally got the news he had been hoping forA grand jury that heard testimony from more than two dozen witnesses including accident reconstruction experts and drivers and looked at photographs and video decided against bringing criminal charges against Stewart for the death of 20yearold sprint car driver Kevin Ward Jr during an Aug 9 raceThat doesnt mean its overA few hours after Ontario County District Attorney Michael Tantillo announced the grand jurys decision in this upstate New York hamlet the Ward family indicated in a statement read over the telephone by sister Kayla Herring that they will seek civil damages in the young drivers deathOur son got out of his car during caution when the race was suspended All the other vehicles were reducing speed and not accelerating except for Stewart who intentionally tried to intimidate Kevin by accelerating and sliding his car toward him causing the tragedy the family said Wednesday The focus should be on the actions of Mr Stewart This matter is not at rest and we will pursue all remedies in fairness to KevinThe family might have a difficult task Tantillo disclosed that Ward was under the influence of marijuana the night he died and said two different videos were enhanced frames were isolated and viewed at at least three different speeds and finally overlaid with grids and data Both showed Stewart had done nothing wrongThe videos did not demonstrate any aberrational driving by Tony Stewart until the point of impact with Kevin Ward at which point his vehicle veered to the right up the track as a result of the collision Prior to that his course was pretty straight said Tantillo He added that toxicology evidence from Wards autopsy indicates that at the time of operation he was under the influence of marijuana The levels determined were enough to impair judgmentStewarts reaction was not one of celebration and his statement had the same twinge of sadness that hes carried since he returned to NASCAR three weeks ago following three weeks of seclusion after Wards deathThe 43yearold NASCAR superstar acknowledged the investigation was long and emotionally difficult but noted it allowed time for all the facts to be presentedThis has been the toughest and most emotional experience of my life and it will stay with me forever Im very grateful for all the support Ive received and continue to receive he said While much of the attention has been on me its important to remember a young man lost his life Kevin Ward Jrs family and friends will always be in my thoughts and prayersDavid Weinstein a former state and federal prosecutor in Miami who is not involved in the case said the toxicology evidence will make it difficult for the Wards to win a lawsuit against Stewart  He said the Ward statement showed the family was clearly upset and at a vulnerable pointHopefully someone will explain to them that Kevin will be dragged through the mud during a civil trial he said After the results of the toxicology report and the findings of the grand jury the deep pockets will not be willing to settle this lawsuit so quicklyThe decision came nearly seven weeks after Stewarts car struck and killed Ward sending shock waves through the top racing series in the United States The brash and popular NASCAR driver known as Smoke skipped three races as he grieved and returned to racing in late August  One of the biggest stars in the garage Stewart has 48 career Cup wins in 542 starts but is winless this year and did not make the championship Chase fieldSheriff Philip Povero spent weeks investigating several times saying he did not have evidence to suggest Stewart meant to harm the other driverAuthorities said the first car to pass Ward had to swerve to miss hitting him The front of Stewarts car appeared to clear Ward but Ward was struck by the right rear tire and hurtled through the air He died of blunt force traumaThe sheriff asked in the days after Wards death for spectators to turn over photos and videos of the crash as investigators worked to reconstruct the accident Among the things being looked at were the dim lighting how muddy it was and whether Wards dark firesuit played a role in his death given the conditionsTantillo also said two videos  one from a fan the other from the tiny track in Canandaigua  had been examined and enhanced The grand jurors were not considering whether anybody else was at fault Tantillo saidHowever I am sure from their deliberations and discussions that the fact that Kevin Ward was observed running basically down two thirds of the track into a hot track into the middle of other cars that were racing played a big big factor in their decision he said Realistically I think judgment is probably the most important factor in this caseStewart vowed to cooperate in the investigation but he did not testify before the grand jury He issued a brief statement expressing deep sadness and then dropped off the radar missing races at Watkins Glen Michigan and Bristol before coming back for the Aug 31 race at AtlantaStewarts peers were protective of him as questions emerged in the aftermath of the crash and it pained them that Stewart was grieving in private and had cut off communication with so many of them They welcomed him back in Atlanta two CEOs from his top sponsors stood shouldertoshoulder with him before the race in a sign of support and fans gave him a robust cheer tooNASCAR spokesman Brett Jewkes said there were no winners in the accident and expressed support for Wards family and Stewart Current Chase leader and 2012 NASCAR champion Brad Keselowski tweeted after the marijuana disclosure Cant believe what Im reading about Tony Stewarts case Why didnt they release this soonerAfter Wards death NASCAR announced a rule that prohibits drivers from climbing out of a crashed or disabled vehicle  unless it is on fire  until safety personnel arrive The series also cleared the way for Stewart to make its Chase for the Sprint Cup championship with a win despite missing the three racesStewart who is from Columbus Indiana has long been one of the most proficient drivers in racing winning in every kind of series from sprint cars to the elite Sprint Cup Series He has for years taken part in little races in nondescript towns because he loves the thrill of the high horsepower lightweight cars skidding around the dirtHe rarely made his schedule public popping up when he pleased and he was welcome at the clay track at Canandaigua Motorsports Park the night before the NASCAR race in nearby Watkins Glen___Fryer reported from Charlotte North Carolina

between a sensitive nose and the city streets the streets have the upper hand assailing the nose with the odors of urine decomposing garbage and clammy armpits Mouth breathing is not only acceptable

Wednesday evening a Buildings Department phrase conditions perilous to human life seemed apropos They paused there nostrils twitching eyebrows furrowedIts a salsay smell offered one Alexandra Horowitz The group hovered some more undecidedGarlic exclaimed Sam Vale 35 to general delight It was unmistakable a stench so pungent that even the most congested of his companions took an involuntary step backGood God one mutteredFor the participants in the Smellwalk the worst was yet to come Meandering down a city block pocked with olfactory bombs  artisanally roasted coffee Acqua di Gio cologne emanating from a European tourist blended wheatgrass  they were charged with stopping every so often to smell as it were the roses of Bedford AvenueTheir discoveries would help Kate McLean a multisensory artist and designer from Britain create a Smellmap of the city in which colorful swirls are matched with different street odors much as she has done for cities such as Amsterdam Edinburgh and Milan She has already mapped a block of Greenwich Village and visited what New York magazine has called  the smelliest block in the city on the Lower East SidePeople expect Amsterdam to smell like marijuana Ms McLean said but its most dominant background smells are of canal water the sugary warmth of waffles and coffee In Edinburgh owing to the citys breweries the odor of malt extract reigns for miles aroundIn New York She cogitated A warm musty smell that comes from the cellarIn Brooklyn on Wednesday there were also base notes of car exhaust subway grit and festering sewer punctuated by the occasional whiff of cigarette smoke  an episodic odor in the academic terminology of stinkMs McLeans two dozen followers recorded all of this dutifully They leaned over green trash cans They pinched plants They eyed the meals of outdoor diners They sidled up to walls eyes closed nostrils tremblingThe spirit of the Smellwalk moved Julie Hecht a researcher at the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College to crouch next to a trash can full of discarded coffee cups a retro soda bottle and a cortisone cream packageDown there I get a gum  a minty recently chewed gum said Ms Horowitz Ms Hechts partnerinsmell Ms Hecht shook her head NothingThe spirit compelled John Havens an author from Maplewood NJ who is writing about the nostalgia of smell and his two children to rifle through a

dogs nosing through feces Feces would have been less harmful to eat early in the species history they agreed because it would have contained fewer bacteriaSpeaking of excreta all parties agreed that there was plenty of human waste to offend the nostrils in New York especially in the parksBut thats a park smell  youre not going to find it on this block I hope said Ms Horowitz who was conducting immersive canine research through the Smellwalk Im trying to embody the dog basicallyFortunately for the common nose  though not perhaps for the purposes of the Smellwalk  the evenings breeze carried nothing more repulsive than the aroma of a marijuana jointIts a completely different way of knowing the world Ms McLean said as the group rounded the corner at Bedford Avenue She recounted her Smellwalk exploits She once led a group of 44 highly trained perfumers only to find that they were no better than the average person at nonperfume scents she said Her next venture is a Smellwalk of

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/us/after-5-months-of-sales-colorado-sees-the-downside-of-a-legal-high.html,DENVER  Five months after Colorado became the first state to allow recreational marijuana sales the battle over legalization is still ragingLaw enforcement officers in Colorado and neighboring states emergency room doctors and legalization opponents increasingly are highlighting a series of recent problems as cautionary lessons for other states flirting with loosening marijuana lawsThere is the Denver man who hours after buying a package of marijuanainfused Karma Kandy from one of Colorados new recreational marijuana shops began raving about the end of the world and then pulled a handgun from the family safe and killed his wife the authorities say Some hospital officials say they are treating growing numbers of children and adults sickened by potent doses of edible marijuana Sheriffs in neighboring states complain about stoned drivers streaming out of Colorado and through their townsI think by any measure the experience of Colorado has not been a good one unless youre in the marijuana business said Kevin A Sabet executive director of Smart Approaches to Marijuana which opposes legalization Weve seen lives damaged Weve seen deaths directly attributed to marijuana legalization Weve seen marijuana slipping through Colorados borders Weve seen marijuana getting into the hands of kidsDespite such anecdotes there is scant hard data Because of the lag in reporting many health statistics it may take years to know legal marijuanas effect  if any  on teenage drug use school expulsions or the number of fatal car crashesIt was only in January for example that the Colorado State Patrol began tracking the number of people pulled over for driving while stoned Since then marijuanaimpaired drivers have made up about 125 percent of all citations for driving under the influence of drugs or alcoholProponents of legalization argue that the critics are cherrypicking anecdotes to tarnish a young industry that has been flourishing under intense scrutinyThe vast majority of the states medical and recreational marijuana stores are living up to stringent state rules they say The stores have sold marijuana to hundreds of thousands of customers without incident The industry has generated 126 million in taxes and fees so far though the revenues have not matched some early projectionsMarijuana supporters note that violent crimes in Denver  where the bulk of Colorados pot retailers are  are down so far this year The number of robberies from January through April fell by 48 percent from the same time in 2013 and assaults were down by 37 percent Over all crime in Denver is down by about 10 percent though it is impossible to say whether changes to marijuana laws played any role in that declineEvery major institution said this would be horrible and lead to violence and blood in the streets said Brian Vicente one of the authors of Amendment 64 which legalized marijuana in Colorado None of thats happened The sky did not fallThe argument is being waged with fervor because both sides say Colorados successes and failures with regulating marijuana will shape perceptions of legalization for voters considering similar measures in other states and for leery federal law enforcement officials After the 2012 legalization votes in Colorado and Washington State  where recreational sales are expected to begin this summer  Justice Department officials gave the states a cautious green light But they warned that they might intervene if marijuana ended up fueling violence or drug trafficking or flowing across state lines or into the hands of childrenMarijuana opponents like Thomas J Gorman of the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program which helps law enforcement say Colorado is already falling short of those standardsIn any other state if they were making as much money and growing as much dope theyd be taken out by the feds Mr Gorman saidFew agree on how much legally purchased marijuana is being secreted out of Colorado Michele Leonhart the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration told a Senate panel in April that officials in Kansas had tallied a 61 percent increase in seizures of marijuana that could be traced to Colorado But according to the Kansas Highway Patrol total marijuana seizures fell to 1090 pounds from 2790 pounds during the first four months of the year a 61 percent declineSome sheriffs and police chiefs along Colorados borders say they have noticed little change But in Colby Kan which sits along an interstate highway running west to Colorado Police Chief Ron Alexander said charges for sale distribution or possession related to marijuana were rising fast This year he tallied 20 such cases through May 23 Two years ago there were six during that same time periodSheriff Adam Hayward of Deuel County Neb said he was locking up more people for marijuanarelated offenses Its kind of a freeforall he said The state or the federal government needs to step up and do somethingCriminal marijuana cases in Colorado plunged by 65 percent in 2013 the first full year of legalization for personal recreational use but the police in some areas have been writing dozens of tickets to crack down on public marijuana smokers Police and fire officials across the state have been contending with a sharp rise in home explosions as people use flammable butane to make hashish oil And despite a galaxy of legal regulated marijuana stores across the state prosecutors say a dangerous illicit market persistsIn February for example in the Denver suburb of Aurora a 17yearold planning to rob an outofstate marijuana buyer instead accidentally shot and killed his girlfriend law enforcement officials saidWhy break into a house to steal a TV or a computer that you have to fence when you can steal mounds of cash or marijuana which is like liquid said George Brauchler the district attorney who oversees Aurora Thats the kind of stuff were starting to become more aware ofMany of Colorados starkest problems with legal marijuana stem from potinfused cookies chocolates and other surprisingly potent edible treats that are especially popular with tourists and casual marijuana usersOn Colorados northern plains for example a fourth grader showed up on the playground one day in April and sold some of his grandmothers marijuana to three classmates The next day one of those students returned the favor by bringing in a marijuana edible he had swiped from his own grandmotherThis was kind of an unintended consequence of Colorados new law said John Gates the districts director of school safety and security For crying out loud secure your weed If you can legally possess it thats fine But it has no place in an elementary schoolSo far this year nine children have ended up at Childrens Hospital Colorado in Aurora after consuming marijuana six of whom got critically sick In all of 2013 the hospital treated only eight such casesIn March the state logged what appeared to be its first death directly tied to legal recreational marijuana when a 19yearold African exchange student Levy Thamba Pongi plunged to his death in Denver He and three other students had driven from their college in Wyoming to sample Colorados newly legal wares Mr Pongi ate marijuanainfused cookies began acting wildly and leapt from a hotel balcony officials said the medical examiners office said marijuana intoxication had made a significant contribution to the accidentIn April the shooting death of Kristine Kirk raised even more concerns about regulating edible marijuana Minutes before she was killed Ms Kirk called 911 to say her husband Richard was talking like it was the end of the world and had consumed marijuana and possibly prescription medication for back pain according to a police affidavit Police later confirmed that Mr Kirk had bought the Karma Kandy and a prerolled joint from a licensed marijuana shop that eveningThose two deaths combined with reports of groggy nauseated children visiting emergency rooms forced the state to tighten its labeling and packaging rules for edible marijuana Regulators are also considering whether to set lower limits on the amount of THC the psychoactive component of marijuana that can be packed into one cookie or chocolate bonbonEven supporters of legalization such as Mr Vicente say Colorado needs to pass stricter rules about edible marijuana He said the state was racing up a sharp learning curveMarijuana was illegal for 80 years Mr Vicente said Now its legal and everyones just trying to figure out how to approach these new issues,2014-06-01T00:00:00Z,drugs

and legalized marijuana But the closing days of its tight governors race are coming down to an oldfashioned issue crimeRepublican gubernatorial candidate Bob Beauprez is slamming Gov John Hickenloopers record on public safety hoping a debate over crime and punishment will help him knock off a Democratic incumbent whos overseen an improving state economyBeauprez and GOP allies have criticized Hickenlooper for state prison and parole policies for a law making it harder to charge juveniles as adults and for Colorado Democrats failure to pass tougher penalties for repeat DUI offendersAnd two starkly personal issues continue to command attention in the races closing days Hickenloopers indefinite stay of execution for multiplemurderer Nathan Dunlap and the slaying of Tom Clements the governors prisons chief Clements was killed at his doorstep last year by a former inmate released after spending much of his sentence in solitary confinementWith Colorado voters already casting ballots Beauprezs campaign last week unveiled what essentially is part of its closing argument  a television ad summing up Republicans public safety indictment of Hickenlooper The ad cites reporting from The Denver Post that found prisoners who completed their terms were released even though they threatened to commit violenceIn its original form the ad referenced the case of Evan Ebel who authorities say was responsible for the deaths of Clements and Nathan Leon who was working a second job delivering pizzas to support his familyThe ad closes with the line With John Hickenlooper as governor  is your family safeBeauprezs strategy of painting Hickenlooper as soft on crime is not without riskIt strikes me as a contrived and manufactured issue and voters  have an intuitive sense about what fears are real and what fears are manufactured said Colorado independent political analyst Eric SondermannAfter the ad launched it got an immediate rebuke from Clements widowLisa Clements accused Beauprez of attempting to use our familys tragic loss for your personal and political gain and asked him to stop Beauprez quickly removed the reference to ClementsIts very disappointing to see the death of a public servant and friend used to try and score political points Hickenlooper campaign spokesman Eddie Stern saidHe also noted Hickenlooper has no legal authority to prevent a prisoner from being released from prison after serving their courtordered sentenceClements death exposed several problems in the department including whether parolees were being monitored properly and whether correction officials were overusing solitary confinement  a question Clements was working to addressBeauprez said he didnt mean to offend Clements widow but hes remained steadfast in his latest round of criticism of Hickenloopers administrationThe reference to Clements death was replaced with the mention of a policy to grant deathrow inmates four hours of leisure time The governors office says the policy has been mischaracterized saying it was a staffsafety measure aimed at lessening interaction between prison employees and deathrow inmatesI think we need leadership that is willing to recognize that evil does exist Beauprez said last week flanked by two prosecutors and GOP lawmakers at a news conference Beauprez planned another rally based on publicsafety Thursday with US Republican Senate hopeful Cory Gardner and New Jersey Gov Chris ChristieWe need a governor that starts to care about public safety said Jefferson County District Attorney Pete Weir a Republican who served as the public safety director for former Democratic Gov Bill Ritter The last four years I can say without hesitation or equivocation have been the most offenderfriendly years in my entire careerHickenloopers administration said Republicans are using hyperboleThats partisan nonsense and the kind of thing you hear in an election year but you dont hear in the regular course of business said Alan Salazar one of Hickenloopers top advisersThe bill making it harder to charge juveniles as adults had GOP support And legislation in recent years to reduce penalties for drugpossession offenses had bipartisan backingThis year Hickenlooper also signed a Republicansponsored bill that would make parolees subject to immediate warrantless arrest if they tamper with their electronic monitoring deviceEbel had removed his anklemonitoring bracelet but it was days before authorities found outHowever a bill to remove earned time for inmates who misbehave failed in the Democratcontrolled Senate after passing with bipartisan support in the HouseEbel received 115 days of earned time  which could not be revoked  even though he was cited 28 times for offenses that included fighting and assault during his nearly eight years in prisonHickenloopers campaign said the governor would like to see the issue addressed again next year He also supports tougher DUI penalties but his party has expressed concern about the implementation costs___,2014-10-29T14:54:19Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/15/opinion/no-slowdown-in-unfair-marijuana-arrests.html,When Mayor Bill de Blasio took office in January community groups and juvenile justice advocates hoped that his administration would significantly decrease the numbers of black and Latino young people who are unfairly  and in some cases illegally  arrested and dragged through the court system for possession of tiny amounts of marijuana But a new analysis of state arrest data by a nonprofit called the Marijuana Arrest Research Project which studies police policy suggests that the de Blasio administration is on track to equal the more than 28600 lowlevel marijuana arrests that were made under Michael Bloomberg in 2013 The administration needs to review Police Department policy to make sure these arrests are necessary and being fairly madeThe State Legislature tried to correct the problem in 1977 when it barred the police from arresting people for tiny amounts of marijuana unless the drug was publicly displayed The number of minor arrests declined immediately after the law was passed but rose sharply from fewer than 1000 in 1990 to 50000 in 2011 Research has repeatedly shown that whites and minorities use the drug at similar rates yet more than 80 percent of those arrested are black or Latino And even though most cases are eventually dismissed the arrests exact a cost Young people who are even temporarily entangled in the courts can be shut out of jobs or denied entry into the armed servicesAs the number of arrests skyrocketed defense attorneys made the case that police officers were illegally charging suspects with public possession after directing them to reveal the drug or removing it from their pockets during constitutionally questionable searches Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly tacitly acknowledged that problem in 2011 ordering officers to follow the 1977 law The numbers of arrests declined significantly The 28600 arrests made last year may seem low compared with the number in 2011The police have historically implied that marijuana arrests help get criminals off the street But a majority of these lowlevel arrests end in an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal which means that the charges go away if the person stays out of trouble for six months or a year or in a plea to a violation which is a noncriminal disposition These cases waste scarce court resources and distract prosecutors from working on serious crime Moreover a 2012 study by Human Rights Watch found that only about 3 percent of people arrested for lowlevel marijuana possession subsequently committed even one violent felonyThe new state data for the city shows a slight decline in arrests for the first quarter of this year which can partly be explained by harsh weather that kept people indoors But the 2657 arrests in March exceed the number of arrests made in March 2013 Moreover as in previous years there were few arrests in affluent white areas and those arrested were mostly black and Latino young men in heavily minority neighborhoods Mr de Blasios team has thus far demonstrated no concern about the marijuana arrest problem But the extreme racial disparities in the arrest statistics alone make it imperative that the city look more closely into what is happening here,2014-05-15T00:00:00Z,drugs

Parliament buildings somber and gothic push into the sky above the river An expanse of green lawn slopes down to Wellington Street with its tourists and a hot dog vendor The whole place would be imposing if the locals treated it with deference But we dontTheres no security stopping pedestrians from getting onto the hill On any given day youre likely to find people on the lawn playing soccer or doing yoga There are almost always protesters of some sort  usually polite and not that obtrusive Activists calling for marijuana legalization occasionally gather to smoke potIve always been proud of the relaxed feel of the place its accessibility and frankly its lack of visible security It fits with my ideal of a government that isnt separate from or above the people it serves You dont see portraits of our prime minister in Canadian schools or public buildings either After all hes not our head of state and the government is Her Majestys he merely runs itOn Wednesday a gunman exploited this openness at the heart of Canadas democracy After murdering the Canadian soldier Cpl Nathan Cirillo at the nearby National War Memorial he ran into the main Parliament building and was just outside members caucus rooms when he was shot deadThe attack occurred only two days after a man thought to be a radical Islamist used a car to run over Canadian soldiers in Quebec killing Warrant Officer Patrice VincentWednesdays gunman has been identified as Michael ZehafBibeau a 32yearold Quebec man with a criminal record involving drugs and uttering threats A Twitter account supportive of the Islamic State the jihadist group rampaging through Syria and Iraq published a photograph of him on Wednesday According to a Globe and Mail report on Wednesday Mr ZehafBibeau had been designated a highrisk traveler by Canadian authorities who recently seized his passport But police later stated the report was inaccurate and that he had not been identified as a security threatThe question is whether this attack is related to Canadas recent decision to join the international coalition against the Islamic State In August Canada committed special forces trainers and advisers and ferried arms to Kurdish forces in northern Iraq In September an Islamic State spokesman then urged the groups supporters to attack CanadiansA spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper responded by saying We will not be cowed by threats This month Canada escalated its intervention in Iraq to a combat mission deploying six fighter jets two refueling planes a surveillance aircraft and support personnelWe dont know what motivated Mr ZehafBibeau to kill and its risky to ascribe political or geostrategic motives to murder I was recently in northern Iraq where thousands have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced by the Islamic State because of their religion or ethnicity rather than as an attempt to influence any countrys policyBut if Mr ZehafBibeau followed an extreme and perverted interpretation of Islam its reasonable to wonder if Canadas participation in the combat mission in Iraq influenced him whether he intended to punish Canada to pressure it to withdraw from the coalition to change the country he was attackingIf so he miscalculated Canadas combat mission is certainly politically divisive here An Oct 7 vote on it in the House of Commons split the governing Conservative Party from the opposition Liberals and New Democratic Party But to say Canadians have mixed feelings about going to war in Iraq is different from claiming were easily scaredOn Wednesday the Canadian senator Jim Munson declared Our days of innocence ended todayIm not sure how innocent Canada was before the attack Its true weve avoided much of the domestic strife and terror that has afflicted so many other countries including our closest friend and neighbor the United States and weve done so without draconian security measures Our security services have thwarted attacks and perhaps until now weve simply been fortunate Our society bilingual and multiethnic is mostly at ease with itselfWeve also fought two devastating world wars and recently concluded a 12year mission in Afghanistan that took the lives of 158 soldiers Weve had a peaceful and functional democracy for 147 years Theres luck involved But theres also resilienceYesterdays attack was tragic and obscene and yet far too puny to fundamentally rattle this country Mr Harper made it clear that the attack would not blunt Canadas antiterrorism efforts abroad It will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts to work with our allies around the world and fight against the terrorist organizations who brutalize those in other countries with the hope of bringing their savagery to our shores he said Canadian members of Parliament will continue to debate the merits of military intervention in Iraq and other foreign policies based on their perceptions of whats best for Canada and what we can and should do abroad Yesterdays attack wont change thatAs for Parliament Hill it and downtown Ottawa had a far less placid atmosphere Wednesday There were hundreds of armed men and women dogs sirens and briefly the faint smell of gunpowder And yet the police were professional and respectful Onlookers were calm The hill may never fully return to what it was before but I hope it comes

radicalMichael ZehafBibeau the bearded 32yearold gunman who was shot dead Wednesday after killing a soldier and storming Canadas Parliament aptly fit each of those descriptions In the tumultuous wake of what Canadas prime minister has called a terrorist act Mr ZehafBibeaus radicalism has become the defining oneBut a closer examination of his past draws a somewhat different portrait one of an increasingly troubled mentally unstable man who initially may have embraced religion not as a political cause but as an attempt to scaffold a disintegrating lifeMuch remains unknown about the assault including how Mr ZehafBibeau a convicted criminal managed to acquire the singleaction Winchester deerhunting rifle he used in the attack killing a ceremonial guard Cpl Nathan Cirillo at the National War Memorial and leaving three people in the national parliamentary complex lightly injured Investigators have said they do not know whether he acted spontaneously or deliberately or whyThe law enforcement authorities also say they have yet to find anyone who assisted Mr ZehafBibeau And on Thursday the commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police suggested that his principal motivation was frustration over his failure to secure a passport apparently so he could join Islamist fighters in SyriaIndeed a counselor at a Vancouver Salvation Army shelter Paul Jarjapka said Mr ZehafBibeau had told him as much before setting off to Ottawa last month Mr ZehafBibeau had become exasperated over passport issues he said in an interview adding that his understanding was that he was going to address thatThat would fit an emerging pattern of terrorist acts not just in Canada but throughout the West homegrown zealots often disaffected young men who have embraced radical Islam and act alone or without evidence of direct aid from foreign jihadist groups One such act occurred on Monday when a 25yearold man who had recently adopted radical Islam ran over two Canadian soldiers near Montreal killing one On Thursday another attack bearing similar characteristics occurred in Queens when a man attacked two police officers with a hatchetOne analyst of terrorism and intelligence Wesley Wark of the University of Ottawas Graduate School of Public and International affairs said he believed the terrorist threat posed by Mr ZehafBibeau had been politically overblown But the proliferation of

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/18/world/americas/ap-lt-brazil-conservatives-rise.html,RIO DE JANEIRO   With its Carnival reputation and skinbaring beach life Brazil may look like a liberal bastion But unease over a worsening economy and deteriorating public safety plus a backlash against recent gayrights gains are propelling a conservative rise that will shape the next administration regardless of who wins the presidencyThe general election held earlier this month saw a greater share of Brazils National Congress seats go to various conservative caucuses which now control nearly 60 percent of the 513 seats in the lower house They include evangelical lawmakers who oppose gay marriage or access to abortion the ruralistas whose proagriculture positions counter environmentalists and indigenous groups and a lawandorder faction that demands a crackdown on crimeAhead of the presidential runoff Oct 26 theres no doubt such conservatives are giving greater support to centerright challenger Aecio Neves over leftleaning President Dilma Rousseff But its also clear that neither presidential candidate is as socially conservative as the increasingly powerful elements of CongressBrazil is one of the very few Latin American countries where the parliament is more important than the president in terms of overall power in the decisionmaking process said Thiago de Aragao a political analyst for the Brasiliabased Arko Advice consulting firm The parliament in an armwrestling contest against the presidency would win  because the parliaments main weapon is just crossing their arms and not voting on matters that are of strong interest to the governmentDespite its anythinggoes appearance Brazil is like many predominantly Roman Catholic nations in Latin America socially conservative In recent opinion polls for example more than 80 percent of Brazilians said they oppose loosening their restrictive abortion laws or legalizing marijuana and just over half oppose gay marriageHowever since Brazils return to democracy in 1985 the nations presidents and its judiciary have pushed through progressive projects either by decree or rulings  such as protecting huge swaths of jungle as indigenous reserves a highcourt ruling permitting samesex civil unions and the creation of Bolsa Familia a program that gives monthly cash payments to Brazils poorest familiesSome predict such changes could be rolled back by the growing conservative forcesThe evangelical caucus votes in lockstep on hotbutton social issues and is willing to block projects put forth by the presidency because its members know they represent a growing segment of the electorate While Catholics remain the majority in Brazil since 1970 their portion of the population has fallen from more than 90 percent to 65 percent while those identifying as Protestants have grown from 5 percent to 22 percent according to the Pew Research CenterIn Rousseffs first term the evangelical caucus blocked her effort to promote gaytolerance teaching in schools and managed to have their most outspoken antigay legislator Deputy Marco Feliciano named head of the bodys human rights commission  a move that provoked condemnation from Amnesty International and other activist groups In the Oct 5 election Feliciano was reelected to his Sao Paulo district with nearly double the votes he won four years agoThe ruralista caucus also grew and now has about 200 members who support its agenda These lawmakers showed their strength in 2012 forcing weakening of environmental protection laws which critics say contributed to a 29 percent jump in the number of Amazon acres deforested over the last yearAnd while the lawandorder block is small with only about 20 members it wields influence on security issues The caucus members defend tougher penal codes for young offenders and want to block the sort of drug liberalization seen in neighboring countries even as Brazil copes with overcrowded prisons and years of failed efforts to suppress powerful drug gangsBut its the evangelical lawmakers who are at the heart of Brazils growing conservatism and theyve shown an ability to rally the other groups behind their main cause defeating any attempt to legalize gay marriage or advance protections for LGBT communitiesToni Reis who heads the gay rights advocacy group Dignidade noted it took a landmark Supreme Court decision to legalize samesex civil unions in 2011 following years of congressional stalling on the matter Now he said gay rights groups are focused not on gay marriage but on advancing legislation to criminalize discrimination against gaysGiven the new legislative reality Reis acknowledged it will be an uphill battleWere going to have to work twice as hard he saidJean Wyllys Brazils first openly gay congressman said progressive lawmakers wont give upTheres no doubt its going to be more difficult said Wyllys who represents Rio de Janeiro state But I also have my allies  We are a political force capable of blocking their the evangelicals legislative projectsBut Brazils most influential evangelical pastor Silas Malafaia who campaigned for several Pentecostal politicians says the conservatives dont intend to impose stances out of step with the electorateI am against gay marriage Lets hold a referendum and let society decide Malafaia said in an interview If the people decide that they want abortions to be legalized I will always be against it but I will respect those decisions Were not evangelical extremists trying to impose what we think with an iron fist___Associated Press writer Brad Brooks contributed to this report___,2014-10-18T00:00:33Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/01/world/americas/ap-lt-uruguay-pot-plan-in-peril.html,MONTEVIDEO Uruguay   Uruguays plan to create the worlds first national governmentregulated marketplace for legal pot may be going up in smokeDelays in implementing the plan are putting it at risk as polls point to opposition gains in Octobers election and say most Uruguayans oppose a legal pot marketplace Opposition politicians have said they will seek to repeal or modify the legislation which gives the national government power to oversee the production sales and consumption of marijuanaI am convinced that the current project is never going to be applied the principal opposition presidential candidate Luis Lacalle Pou told The Associated Press The entire project is not workable The pharmacies dont want to sell the drug and nobody is going to register as a user as the law obligesThe legislation which went into effect in May allows for the growing of pot by licensed individuals the formation of growers and users clubs the sale by pharmacies of 40 grams of pot a month to registered users and the tracking of legally grown marijuana through a system of genetic markers of authorized plantsPresident Jose Mujica and his Broad Front movement have promoted the plan as a way to deal with rising homicide and crime rates associated with drug trafficking and the increasing use of crack cocaine In the last 13 years the homicide rate in Uruguay has increased by 21 percent and the rate of violent robbery by 250 percent Officials say a legal pot market could provide an alternative to crack and reduce the power of drug gangsThe appearance of drug trafficking signified a brutal cultural change in the world of crime and a nearly absolute disregard for the value of life Mujica told the AP in May So we decided to try to snatch away a part of that marketIt wasnt until Friday almost three months after the pot law went into effect that the government made its first call for applications from those interested in growing pot for the legal market It said after registration closes Aug 18 bidders will be winnowed to a short list of candidates from which up to five will be chosen to get a license for legal cultivationOfficials have given conflicting dates for when the drug might reach pharmacies ranging from late this year to sometime in 2015Experts say the delays are due to the fact that no other country has attempted such a plan and that authorities still lack detailed plans and rules for creating the market Disagreements within the government over basic aspects of the proposal are also holding things backOpposition Colorado Party presidential candidate Pedro Bordaberry said The entire project is one big improvisationThe man in charge of the program Julio Calzada has dismissed concerns insisting the bids to select growers will be a success and the project will go forwardWhile Mujicas marijuana plan was widely applauded globally and seen as going beyond marijuana legislation in the US states of Colorado and Washington most Uruguayans oppose it The most recent poll said only 27 percent of Uruguayans surveyed approve of the law and 64 percent oppose it Sixtytwo percent said they want the law repealed The survey by the polling firm Cifra questioned 1001 people between July 4 and 15 and had an error margin of three percentage pointsPeople are against drugs and dont distinguish between them said Adriana Raga director of Cifra For a small educated sector  very small  marijuana is something special But for the great majority of Uruguayans all drugs are bad and marijuana is another bad drug the same as base cocaine pasteWith elections nearing politicians are paying heed to public opinion The top opposition candidates are supporting repeal or modification of the lawPolls indicate a tight race in October congressional and presidential elections between the Broad Front and the opposition None of the seven presidential candidates appears capable of getting enough votes to win outright in the first round That would set up a runoff on the last Sunday in November between the two top votegettersFor the law to be out of peril the Broad Front has to win both the presidency and a majority in congress which it currently barely controlsThe data that we now have does not show this is happening said Raga of Cifra There are still three months of campaigning to go but as of today it is not our hypothesisUruguays main polling companies say around 40 percent of Uruguayans intend to vote for the leftist governing coalition which would need almost 50 percent to keep its grip on the legislatureLacalle Pou who is second in the presidential race has said he would try to repeal the articles of the law that allow for the sale of marijuana in pharmacies Other factions in his conservative National Party want to overturn the law altogetherEven the farleft Popular Unity coalition has said its legislators might oppose the legislation if they are electedCommercialization of marijuana by the state is the wrong road to take said Pablo Mieres presidential candidate for the fourthplace Independent Party Decriminalization is

bringyourownmarijuana fundraisers called Classically Cannabis The High Note Series sponsored by the states newly legal cannabis industry the orchestra got laughs on latenight talk shows and was featured in publications that rarely cover classical music including High TimesNow the city of Denver is asking the orchestra to call off the events arguing that they would run afoul of laws prohibiting the public consumption of marijuana The symphony which planned the fundraisers as private events in an effort to comply with the law is mulling whether it can go ahead with the first one scheduled for May 23With the fundraiser concerts now in legal limbo the time seems ripe to consider some of the artistic possibilities of cannabisfriendly classical concerts Before the city raised its objections to the Colorado Symphonys plans The New York Times asked several prominent conductors composers and musicians what they would program to appeal to concertgoers taking advantage of Colorados recent referendum legalizing the recreational use of marijuanaAlan Gilbert the music director of the New York Philharmonic suggested Berliozs Symphonie Fantastique which musically depicts an opium dream in parts and The Poem of Ecstasy by the Russian composer Scriabin who became fascinated by mysticism late in his life Does Scriabins Poem of Ecstasy really need an explanation he asked in an emailScriabin was also one of the choices suggested by Jeremy Denk the pianist and author who will be the music director of next months Ojai Music Festival in CaliforniaMessiaen Scriabin  things where the composer claims certain chords have certain colors and that have rapturous endless clouds of notes were Mr Denks suggestions in an email In that same vein but perhaps a bit more austere he said he would recommend late works by Liszt and pieces by CharlesValentin Alkan a virtuosic 19thcentury French pianist and composer and Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji a 20thcentury English pianist and composerProbably some of the more out there madrigal rep would be good too he said recommending the work of Gesualdo an Italian nobleman famous for a murderous personal life who wrote madrigals around the turn of the 17th century Its very whoainducing he saidThe composer John Adams whose oratorio The Gospel According to the Other Mary was recently released by Deutsche Grammophon and whose 1991

still weighing are on a considerably smaller scaleIts first event sponsored by several companies in the cannabis industry was to be a fundraiser People donating a minimum of 75 would get to attend a fundraiser at a local gallery featuring a small ensemble from the orchestra playing a program that has yet to be announced Any smoking would be restricted to a private patio away from the musiciansCannabis will NOT be sold at any Classically Cannabis event the orchestra notes at its website adding that guests would be encouraged to find alternatives to driving with discounts for car services available The symphonys regular concert venues and programming it adds would remain cannabisfreeIn a letter objecting to the proposed fundraisers the citys Department of Excise and Licenses wrote that it was advising that you cancel the effort to use your business to provide an event for the public consumption of marijuana in violation of local and state laws It warned that failure to follow the law may result in civil and criminal penaltiesThe letter also cautioned that the cannabisthemed events could endanger the symphonys contract with the city for the use of Boettcher Concert HallJerome H Kern the chief executive of the Colorado Symphony and cochairman of its board of trustees said in a statement that the orchestra took the issues raised by the city very seriously and was reviewing them with its legal teamWhen the Colorado Symphony accepted support from the legal cannabis industry  as a means of supporting our financial operations and connecting with a culturally diverse audience  we believed we did so in full compliance with the law he said in a statement Were confident that any questions can be resolved quickly,2014-05-10T00:00:00Z,drugs

remains of three infants found in a squalid vermininfested houseOn Tuesday a judge ordered a Massachusetts woman held on 1 million cash bail after prosecutors said at least two of the babies may have been alive for some period of time before they were discovered Prosecutors had asked for 5 million bail and said Erika Murray could face more serious charges in a case that has repulsed residents of the small town of BlackstoneMurray 31 a resident of the town had been held without bail since her arraignment last month on charges of fetal death concealment witness intimidation and permitting substantial injury to a childThe state Department of Children and Families removed four children ranging in age from 5 months to 13 years from Murrays home in August after her 10yearold son asked a neighbor for help in quieting a crying baby The neighbor found the youngest child  the 5monthold girl  and a 3yearold girl both covered in their own feces in separate bedroomsFriends and neighbors have said Murray appeared to hide the existence of the two youngest children A prosecutor said in court Tuesday that the two children had never been outsideAfter interviewing the 10yearold and 13yearold police got a search warrant and went back to the house where they found the skeletal remains of one baby with a full head of hair in a backpack in the closet of an upstairs bedroomAfter discovering those remains police obtained another search warrant During the second search they found the remains of two other babies in another bedroom also inside a closet The two oldest children slept in the bedroomsBoth bodies were found wearing diapers and onepiece infant outfits Assistant District Attorney John Bradley said during a bail hearing for Murray in Uxbridge District CourtBradley said prosecutors still dont know how the babies died or their ages and are awaiting findings from the state medical examiners office He said the fact that two of the babies were clothed seems to indicate at least two of the babies were alive for some period of time before they diedBradley said the charges against Murray could be upgraded depending on the medical examiners findingsRaymond

in complete shock when he learned he was the father of the two younger childrenBradley said Murrays 13yearold daughter and 10yearold son told police that Murray instructed them to lie to their father

judge told Rivera he needs to hire an attorney Rivera quickly left the courthouse while reporters were questioning Murrays lawyerBradley said Murray told police that Rivera was the father of all four of her children Bradley did not address whether she said Rivera who is also known as Ramon Rivera III in some public records had also fathered the three infants whose remains were found in the closetsMurrays attorney Keith Halpern said the fact the babies were clothed is not by itself proof that the infants were alive for a significant amount of time He suggested the babies may have been stillborn or could have had some kind of medical emergenciesHalpern said he believes investigators are still in the process of putting together the pieces of what happened in that houseThere are parts of this story that make absolutely no sense Halpern saidBradley said a pediatrician who later examined the 5monthold and 3yearold girls found they had been profoundly neglected and severely malnourished The 3yearold could not walk and could not feed herself Neither child had ever been outside Bradley saidMurray initially told police she had the children at a local hospital but later said she had given birth to them in the bathroom of her homeMurrays lawyer Halpern said it makes no sense that Rivera could have lived in the house and not realized there were two younger children there But he also said it doesnt make sense that Rivera knew about the children and did nothing about the alleged neglectHalpern has said he believes Murray is suffering from a mental illness He would not elaborate when asked about that TuesdayHalpern said previously that he believes Murray secretly gave birth to the two younger children because her boyfriend didnt want any more kidsMurray was brought to the courthouse from jail but waived her right to appear in court and was not present for the bail hearing Both Murray and Rivera are due back in court Nov 12The Blackstone Board of Health condemned

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/nyregion/in-brooklyn-proposing-to-end-prosecutions-for-low-level-marijuana-offenses.html,The Brooklyn district attorneys office will stop prosecuting people arrested on charges of possessing small amounts of marijuana according to a confidential policy proposal that the district attorney Kenneth P Thompson sent to the New York Police Department this monthThe policy is part of a broader push on the part of Mr Thompson who took office this year to look at alternatives to court for lowlevel offenders His office is also participating in a task force looking into placing 16 and 17yearolds who commit lowlevel nonviolent misdemeanors like scrawling graffiti or aggressively riding bicycles on sidewalks into a short behavioral program rather than the court systemDefense advocates and community groups across the nation have been pushing the judicial system to rethink the traditional approach to handling small offensesYet the moves have created tension between Mr Thompson and police officials The police commissioner William J Bratton has been a proponent of the broken windows theory of policing which holds that arrests for small violations help prevent larger crimes Mr Bratton espoused this theory when he was the commissioner under Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani in the 1990s and after returning to the department this year has been directing officers to go after subway panhandlers and peddlersNow the Police Department may have to grapple with how to handle those accused of criminal marijuana possession when under the proposed policy prosecution will not followAccording to the memorandum when the police bring a lowlevel marijuana case and the defendant has no criminal record or a minimal criminal record there will be a presumption that such case will be immediately dismissed and the police will be directed to destroy the defendants fingerprintsOn Wednesday Mr Bratton said that he would not respond to something that I have not basically reviewed in great depth or had discussions with the district attorney about but added that the department would continue to make marijuana arrests even as it used a lot more discretion in doing soHe said he opposed the decriminalization of marijuana but pledged to continue to work with the political leadership and to work with the various prosecutors offices on how to deal with that issueMr Thompsons push is rare among prosecutors The Manhattan district attorney Cyrus R Vance Jr publicly supports alternatives to incarceration and endorsed a plan advocated by Gov Andrew M Cuomo to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana but has not gone so far as to propose his office stop prosecuting such casesA spokeswoman for Mr Thompson said in a statement that he was moving forward on a whole range of smartoncrime strategiesOne goal of the proposed marijuana policy still in draft form is to ensure that individuals and especially young people of color do not become unfairly burdened and stigmatized by involvement in the criminal justice system for engaging in nonviolent conduct that poses no threat of harm to persons or property according to the memo a copy of which was obtained by The New York TimesMarijuana possession is the most common reason for arraignment in New York City Criminal possession of marijuana in the fifth degree which is the charge when someone is caught with small amounts of marijuana in public view has repeatedly been the top arraignment charge in the city according to court recordsProcessing such cases  there were over 8500 of them in Brooklyn in 2013  requires a significant amount of paperwork staff and logistics the document says and more than twothirds of the cases end up being dismissedWe are pouring money and effort into an endeavor that produces no public safety benefit for the community the memo readsAccording to civil liberties researchers there is a huge gap between how black and white people are treated in marijuana cases In Brooklyn and Manhattan black people are nine times as likely to be arrested for possessing marijuana than white people  the highest disparities in the state according to a 2013 report from the New York Civil Liberties UnionDefense advocates say the charge of possessing marijuana in public became a particular problem with the rise in stopandfrisk police tactics where their clients were told to empty their pockets and then brought in on misdemeanor chargesThe consequences of even minor charges can be broad said Lisa Schreibersdorf executive director of Brooklyn Defender Services And even if a charge is dismissed people spend up to 24 hours in jail alongside others who have often committed more serious crimes she said Any policy that can move all of these issues in a positive direction is a good policy she saidThe Brooklyn borough president Eric L Adams said he supported the proposalOne of the tragedies that took place over these last few years is many of the D As should have done more to redflag many of these arrests Mr Adams said We cant continue to tie up our court systems with these petty marijuana arrestsAs Mr Thompsons policy on marijuana offenses goes forward he is also examining how to handle other petty crimesA task force that includes the district attorneys office the Police Department Brooklyn Defender Services and the Legal Aid Society has been studying how to divert 16 and 17yearolds from the criminal justice systemThe group has been conducting a pilot program called DATY run by the nonprofit group Young New Yorkers and aimed at young people who receive desk appearance tickets that charge nonviolent offenses Rather than sending the youths through the court system the program has them attend artsbased sessions that promote critical thinking about good choices  for example having the attendees sketch out what the effect on their families would be if they were arrested They graduate at court in front of Judge George A Grasso who

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/09/world/americas/ap-lt-mexico-violence.html,TIXTLA Mexico   Two weeks after 43 students disappeared in a clash with police in rural southern Mexico dozens of anxious parents have gathered at a teachers college that was supposed to be their sons escape from life as subsistence farmersThey wait for any word on the fate of their children eating simple meals of rice beans and tortillas and holding prayer sessions in a makeshift shelter on the schools covered courtyardThey took him away alive and thats the way I want him back said Macedonia Torres Romero whose son Jose Luis is among the disappearedBut it seems ever more unlikely as time passes and new graves are foundOn Thursday federal Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam announced that suspects had led investigators to four new mass graves near the southern city of Iguala where authorities unearthed 28 sets of badly burned bodies last weekendThey said the bodies of the students were also dumped there Murillo Karam saidForensic tests are being carried out to determine whether the first 28 bodies found are those of the missing students Murillo Karam did not say how many bodies the new graves hold A total of 34 people including 26 Iguala police officers have been arrested in the caseProsecutors attribute the Sept 26 disappearances to police who killed six and wounded at least 25 in two separate attacks after which officers rounded up some students and drove off with them Police are believed to have turned over the students to a local drug gang that apparently had ties to the family of Igualas mayor Jose Luis AbarcaThe case has outraged Mexicans even in a country where abuse of authority is common in remote areasThat 43 young men went missing at the hands of the state has drawn calls from around the world for justice including the US State Department and the Organization of American States where Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza said all of Latin America is grievingGuerrero state prosecutor Inaky Blanco said he is asking the state congress to strip the mayor of the political immunity elected officials have under Mexican law Abarca who authorities say is on the run may face charges as well for not intervening to stop the attacks Murillo Karam said Abarca his wife and the citys former police chief are being sought for questioningThe students and their families come mostly from the remote mountains of the southern state of Guerrero where they live in poverty under the thumb of corrupt governments drug traffickers or armed vigilante groups that have sprung up in reaction to the regions lawlessnessTorres a widow raising six children sells peanuts at a stand in the town of Amilcingo in neighboring Morelos state For a while Jose Luis worked odd jobs in the fields to bring in extra money But it wasnt enough to make ends meetHe said Mom Im going to study to try to get ahead Dont you see now that my dads dead I have to do something Torres recalledGraduates of the Rural Teachers College Raul Isidro Burgos in Tixtlas Ayotzinapa neighborhood and others in the normal school system are guaranteed teaching jobs that pay just 500 a month at schools often reachable only on footGraduate Rogelio Guerrero Lopez now teaches in an impoverished threeroom school in the mountains four hours up dirt roads Two weeks ago the teachers couldnt leave the school because a drug gang had blocked the road He was afraid to name which one Farm families in the area grow marijuana and opium poppies to get a little moneyDespite the pervasive poverty and violence Guerrero Lopez has convinced some local kids to attend Ayotzinapa The college is free and students are eager to workBut they also become part of the fray They are indoctrinated in leftist politics and justify their hijacking stealing and civil disruptions in the name of spreading empowerment to Mexicos most impoverished exploited citizensThe face of Argentine revolutionary Ernesto Che Guevara stares down from the side of a building emblazoned with the slogan I will return and I will be millions Other murals feature the likes of Marx Lenin and EngelsMexicos teachers colleges began radicalizing in the 1960s said Jorge Javier Romero an education expert at the Autonomous Metropolitan University in Mexico City Noted rural teacher and guerrilla leader Lucio Cabanas who died in a shootout with Mexican troops in 1974 came out of the Ayotzinapa schoolStudents are expected to go out on risky fundraising activities that range from passing the hat in town to taking over a highway tollbooth and letting motorists drive through in return for a donation It sometimes entails hijacking buses or food delivery trucks or blocking highways and can lead to clashes with policeOn Sept 26 Jose Luis joined in one of the activities which apparently involved passing a tin can in the city of Iguala He told his mother beforehand that he was afraid So was she I told him things can happen out thereThat was their last conversationIm staying here until I find out about my son Torres said tears welling in her eyes Im not leaving here till then___Associated Press writer E Eduardo Castillo in

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/us/washington-dc-statehood.html,WASHINGTON   It could have been a big moment a congressional hearing room packed in such numbers that an overflow room was needed to accommodate the audience a moment two decades in the making an issue that had the support of President ObamaBut when only two senators showed up last month for the first congressional hearing since 1994 on the idea of making the District of Columbia its own state it brought home that the event was more about what was not happening than what was With Republicans on the verge of deepening their hold on the House  and perhaps taking over the Senate as well  advocates for DC statehood showed up in force despite the certainty that the hopes for statehood that had flourished with Mr Obamas election had hit a brick wall The two senators who bothered to appear were Senator Tom Carper the Democrat who sponsored the bill and Senator Tom Coburn a Republican who showed up only to denounce itEleanor Holmes Norton the districts nonvoting delegate to the House said the hearing and what led up to it was an important part of a long struggle It singlehandedly reinvigorated the statehood movement she saidBut most others saw an idea whose time has never quite comeI believe in the power of ideas said Garry Young the director of the George Washington Institute of Public Policy and an expert on the statehood issue But ideas have their moment and its already been decades for the district I dont see an end in sight Many like Mr Young believe DCs best hope may be more modest legislation aimed at pushing Congress out of its affairsFor the better part of five decades a sizable contingent of residents has pressed to make the District of Columbia a state or to at least have a voice in Congress louder than its current municipal murmurThe movement began in 1961 when the 23rd Amendment was passed giving DC residents three electoral votes and the right to vote for presidentPresident Lyndon B Johnson gave his nod to the statehood idea but Congress  led by white Southern Democrats who wanted no part of black representation increasing in their chambers  resisted it and Johnson consumed with other domestic concerns did not dig in on the matter The district did eventually win home rule  allowing nominal control over local affairs  and in 1971 obtained the right to elect a nonvoting delegate to the HouseBut statehood proponents have continued since then to lobby Congress petition courts and hold rallies to advance their cause In 2000 in a show of citywide pique the district adopted a license plate that instead of celebrating a bird or body of water was stamped with the protestation Taxation Without RepresentationA potential partial victory brought only heartache in 2010 when Congress was controlled by Democrats and there was a brief deal with Republicans to give DCs delegate  who is not permitted to vote on the House floor  actual representative status in exchange for an additional House seat for Utah That deal fell apart when Republican senators attempted to repeal some of the districts gun laws as part of the legislation While the dynamics in the White House are similar to those 50 years ago  a supportive president with little interest in using political capital on the matter  racial politics have shifted to partisan ones as Republicans seek to block representation for an overwhelmingly Democratic cityFor residents here this is not simply a matter of pride Congress has the power to pull on the districts purse strings tinker with local laws and use the city as a petri dish for its own policy notions such as charter schools using policy riders on legislative billsCongress once forbade a needleexchange program here and moved to stop the district from using its own money to help fund abortions for poor women in the city This summer House Republicans voted to block funding for a new DC law that would have reduced penalties for some marijuana possessionEric H Holder Jr the departing attorney general singled out the statehood issue in one of his final speeches It is long past time for every citizen to be afforded his or her full responsibilities and full rights he saidDreams are sometimes deferred other times modified Bills in both chambers would give DC autonomy over its own budget  something Congress now controls  and there is a modest movement afoot to send DC back to Maryland  known as retrocession  which would leave just the federal area of DC its own place Maryland would get more representation more revenue and would likely be able to charge Virginia commuters a taxWe see nothing but positives for DC to rejoin Maryland as a unique homerule city like Baltimore said John Forster a spokesman for the Committee for the Capital City We believe strongly that a new state from DC will not happenLess than thrilled are the people of Maryland I do not support retrocession said Representative Steny H Hoyer Democrat of Maryland and the minority whip in an email He added I will continue to work to give DC residents the full voice in government they deserveThis is something less than a burning issue for the American people whose view of Washington is dim to begin with My suspicion is that most Americans dont understand this issue Mr Young said When you talk to tourists here in town they are shocked when you tell them the district has no voting in Congress But in two seconds Marion Barry gets brought up he said referring to the infamous former mayor By that logic why is Chicago part of the United

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/sports/football/in-domestic-violence-cases-nfl-has-a-history-of-lenience.html,On April 10 2007 after more than 50 National Football League players had been arrested in the previous football season Commissioner Roger Goodell was widely hailed for instituting a newly stringent personal conduct policy Mr Goodell threatened to banish players for offthefield transgressions and installed himself as the judge and jury presiding over every caseMr Goodell insisted that he would mete out discipline without waiting for the judicial systemIt is my job  not law enforcements job  to protect the National Football League he said at the timeBut in his role as the NFLs hardbitten sheriff Mr Goodell appears to have had a major blind spot domestic violence cases Players charged with domestic violence routinely received considerably lighter punishments than players accused of other offenses like drug use or drunken driving Often they were not punished at all On Friday seven years after he implemented the personal conduct policy Mr Goodell acknowledged publicly that it had failed and would be overhauledWe should have had the personal conduct policy reviewed more frequently to make the changes necessary to deal with the issues that have changed he said at a news conference in which he announced that outside experts would help the league devise a new system for handling domestic violence casesAn examination of dozens of arrests of NFL players since Mr Goodell established his personal conduct policy in 2007  and the fines and penalties doled out by the league  shows that suspensions of two to four games and sometimes more were far more likely for players arrested on drunken driving marijuana possession or weapon charges A vast majority of players charged with domestic violence crimes if they were disciplined by the league at all received onegame suspensions even after pleading guilty to lesser related charges or entering pretrial intervention programsThe disparity in punishments within the league is illustrated in numerous cases On Nov 25 2011 for example Green Bay Packers linebacker Erik Walden was arrested on suspicion of assaulting his livein girlfriend The charge was reduced to disorderly conduct and then dismissed after Walden agreed to perform 50 hours of community service and receive counselingThe NFL suspended Walden for one gameLess than two months earlier the police seized two and a half pounds of marijuana sent to the home of Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Jerome Simpson The league suspended Simpson for three gamesI dont think the NFL did anything more than give lip service to the notion that they were taking domestic abuse seriously said Ann DeLaney an advocate for victims of domestic violence and the former executive director of the Julian Center in Indianapolis a victim support groupReferring to the Ray Rice case Ms DeLaney continued Thats what they did this time until it was caught on videoMr Rice then a Baltimore Ravens running backwas suspended for only two games after being accused of assaulting his fiance Janay Palmer in February Ms Palmer is now married to Mr Rice After a firestorm of criticism that the punishment was inadequate Mr Goodell increased the leagues minimum suspension for a firsttime domestic violence offense to six games After a video surfaced of Mr Rice knocking out Ms Palmer in a hotel elevator Mr Goodell suspended Mr Rice indefinitelySome of the cases drew criticism at the time but the recent highprofile episodes have led to a firestorm of protest from inside and outside footballTyrone Thomas a Washington lawyer who advises on sports cases said the NFL had always had the power to take a tougher tack in instances in which there were accusations of domestic violence but had chosen not to Mr Thomas said that the NFL had treated domestic violence as a backburner concern and that punishing players caught doping or driving under the influence had been a higher priorityThere certainly could have been a harsher interpretation of certain standards Mr Thomas saidIn multiple cases since 2007 the NFLs response to domestic violence arrests appeared arbitraryWithin the first year of the personal conduct policy the contrast in the handling of different cases was on display when three members of the Pittsburgh Steelers  running back Najeh Davenport linebacker James Harrison and wide receiver Cedrick Wilson  were accused in domestic violence cases according to news reports at the timeMr Davenport who was accused during the season was never suspended and was acquitted after a trial that took place after the season Mr Harrison a star and an important player during the Steelers run to the Super Bowl after the 2008 season also was not suspended But Mr Wilson a lesserknown player was dropped from the team within hours of his arrest and he never played in the NFL againDuring the last seven years when a domestic abuse arrest involved a player who was not a starter or a major contributor to the team the player was sometimes released by his team In those cases the league would not have had to consider a suspensionMr Harrisons agent William Parise said the league had made the right call with Mr Harrison There was never anything there Mr Parise said He did not strike her or do anything like that He didnt press charges She didnt press charges And the league dropped the whole thingIn one of the higherprofile cases Brandon Marshall a wide receiver with the Denver Broncos at the time was initially suspended for three games over events that included his being arrested on charges of assaulting his girlfriend But his suspension was later reduced to one gameIn 2010 Tony McDaniel a defensive lineman for the Miami Dolphins was suspended for one game for violating the leagues personal conduct policy after he pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct after a domestic dispute with his livein girlfriend according to The SunSentinel newspaper in South Florida He was sentenced to probation and ordered to attend counselingIn another case in 2008 Michael Boley a linebacker with the Atlanta Falcons at the time was suspended by the league for a game after he was charged with battery His wife at the time had told the police that he became physical with her The case did not go to trialHis lawyer Randall Kessler of Atlanta said it was troubling that Mr Boley had been punished by the NFLI was not happy that he was suspended based on an allegation but Im glad it ended there Mr Kessler saidLater the police investigated Mr Boley on child abuse allegations which were raised amid a childcustody dispute The outcome of that investigation is unclearBesides the Rice case the NFL has also been harshly criticized for its handling of three other recent abuse cases  those of Adrian Peterson a star running back for the Minnesota Vikings who has been accused of injuring one of his children Carolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy who was convicted of assaulting his girlfriend and San Francisco 49ers defensive end Ray McDonald who was arrested last month on suspicion of domestic violenceMr Peterson was kept of out one game and then reinstated before an outcry led to his being suspended indefinitely Mr Hardy played in one game but is being kept out while still being paid Mr McDonald has continued to play for the team which has said it is waiting for his case to be resolved judiciallyNita Chaudhary a founder of UltraViolet a womens rights advocacy group remained critical of the NFLon Fridaydespite Goodells pledge to revamp the leagues personal conduct policy and penaltiesThis press circus did nothing to change Goodells long history of inaction on and blatant mishandling of domestic violence in the NFL Ms Chaudhary said in a statement We call on all of the NFLs sponsors to take a stand against domestic violence by withdrawing their support for the NFL until Goodell is

morning groundskeepers with metal rakes carefully tend Negrils resortlined shore Some sections however are barely wide enough for a decentsized beach towel and the Jamaican National Environment and Planning Agency says sand is receding at a rate of more than a meter yard a yearThe beach could be totally lost within 30 years said Anthony McKenzie a senior director at the agencyShrinking coastline long has raised worry for the areas environmental and economic future Now the erosion is expected to worsen as a result of climate change and a hint of panic is creeping through this laid back village one of the top destinations in a country where a quarter of all jobs depend on tourismIf the water takes over this beach well thats the end of the tourists Lyn Dennison said as she tended to her beachside stand selling jewelry and wooden statues of roosters horses and other animalsFor much of its history Negril was an isolated fishing outpost In the late 1960s it began to draw American hippies lured by the scenery and cheap marijuana As its fame grew its charms were discovered by hardpartying spring breakers and more soberminded visitors Resorts such as Sandals and the Grand Lido went up and the number of annual visitors grew from about 40000 in 1980 to more than 400000 in 2012Fearful of losing their main draw some alarmed hoteliers are pressing the government to refill the beach with dredged sand a pricey step many experts say is a temporary fix at bestJamaica is readying plans to build submerged breakwaters it hopes will absorb wave energy and slow loss of shoreline using an initial 54 million in grants from a UN climate change conventionThe breakwater project in Negril which one study says could cost as much as 77 million over the course of 80 years offers a glimpse of what may lie ahead for other coastal towns Caribbean islands many already heavily in debt will be faced with the choice of trying to armor shores with seawalls and breakwaters or conducting a costly retreat from seas that the UNbacked Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says could rise by nearly a meter yard by the end of the centuryBeaches across the region are being transformed by a variety of factors shoreline development surges from increasingly intense storms coastal pollution that affects marine life coral reefs crumbling in warmer waters The changes are particularly worrisome for the Caribbean because of its dependence on seaandsand tourism In addition roughly 70 percent of the Caribbeans people and much of its essential infrastructure are situated along coastsThe region is facing an existential threat said Ulrich Trotz science adviser for the Caribbean Community Climate Change Center which provides policy advice and guidelines to more than a dozen member nations and territoriesWe dont have much time Action now is imperative if the Caribbean is to survive as we know it Trotz said in a phone interview from AntiguaAccording to the World Bank some areas of the island of St Vincent have lost up to 30 meters yards of beach over the last nine years A recent study by the bank forecasts that the Dominican Republics capital of Santo Domingo where many residents live along the Ozama River and in its flood plain will be one of five global cities most affected by climate change over the next 35 yearsBuilding seawalls to protect from an encroaching sea an approach that has seen limited success in places like California has been one response on the island of Barbados But in many cases scientists say allowing shores to retreat or bolstering beaches with vegetation and restoring wetlands could be smarter  Last year Cuba razed seaside buildings to restore shorelines to something approaching its natural stateFor many beaches adaptation measures such as bringing in sand and creating seawalls will only slow the inevitable and at a significant and continual financial cost said Jason Spensley of the UN Climate Technology Center and NetworkEnvironmental experts and civil planners say leaders across the region need to adapt for the long term City developers could adjust how they zone improve enforcement of marine regulations and better plan water systems for example Beachfront developers could be encouraged to protect dunes and anchoring vegetation such as seagrasses better manage coastal runoff pollution and push construction farther back from the seaWe just dont seem to be prepared to do any of it Its as if we do not see what Negril has become what the dangers to its future are said Diana McCaulay CEO of

there is no doubt that hotels perched along the beach will be deluged in coming decades he saidWe need to be looking 50 years into the future he said We cant keep going into places with pristine

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/upshot/where-young-college-graduates-are-choosing-to-live.html,When young college graduates decide where to move they are not just looking at the usual suspects like New York Washington and San Francisco Other cities are increasing their share of these valuable residents at an even higher rate and have reached a high overall percentage led by Denver San Diego Nashville Salt Lake City and Portland Ore according to a report published Monday by City Observatory a new think tankAnd as young people continue to spurn the suburbs for urban living more of them are moving to the very heart of cities  even in economically troubled places like Buffalo and Cleveland The number of collegeeducated people age 25 to 34 living within three miles of city centers has surged up 37 percent since 2000 even as the total population of these neighborhoods has slightly shrunkSome cities are attracting young talent while their overall population falls like Pittsburgh and New Orleans And in a reversal others that used to be magnets like Atlanta and Charlotte are struggling to attract them at the same rateEven as Americans over all have become less likely to move young collegeeducated people continue to move at a high clip  about a million cross state lines each year and these socalled young and the restless dont tend to settle down until their mid30s Where they end up provides a map of the cities that have a chance to be the economic powerhouses of the futureThere is a very strong track record of places that attract talent becoming places of longterm success said Edward Glaeser an economist at Harvard and author of Triumph of the City The most successful economic development policy is to attract and retain smart people and then get out of their wayThe economic effects reach beyond the work the young people do according to Enrico Moretti an economist at the University of California Berkeley and author of The New Geography of Jobs For every college graduate who takes a job in an innovation industry he found five additional jobs are eventually created in that city such as for waiters carpenters doctors architects and teachersIts a type of growth that feeds on itself  the more young workers you have the more companies are interested in locating their operations in that area and the more young people are going to move there he saidAbout 25 percent more young college graduates live in major metropolitan areas today than in 2000 which is double the percentage increase in cities total population All the 51 biggest metros except Detroit have gained young talent either from net migration to the cities or from residents graduating from college according to the report It is based on data from the federal American Community Survey and written by Joe Cortright an economist who runs City Observatory and Impresa a consulting firm on regional economiesDenver has become one of the most powerful magnets Its population of the young and educated is up 47 percent since 2000 nearly double the percentage increase in the New York metro area And 75 percent of Denvers population is in this group more than the national average of 52 percent and more than anywhere but Washington the Bay Area and BostonDenver has many of the tangible things young people want economists say including mountains sunshine and jobs in booming industries like tech Perhaps more important it also has the ones that give cities the perception of cultural cool like microbreweries and bikesharing and an acceptance of marijuana and samesex marriageWith lots of cultural things to do and getting away to the mountains you can have the workplay balance more than any place Ive ever lived said Colleen Douglass 27 a video producer at Craftsy a startup with online classes for crafts Theres this really thriving startup scene here and the sense we can be in a place we love and work at a cool new company but not live in Silicon ValleyOther cities that have had significant increases in a young and educated population and that now have more than their share include San Diego Baltimore Pittsburgh Indianapolis Nashville Salt Lake City and Portland OreAt the other end of the spectrum are the cities where less than 4 percent of the population are young college graduates Among those Detroit lost about 10 percent of this group while Providence gained just 6 percent and Memphis 10 percentAtlanta one of the biggest net gainers of young graduates in the 1990s has taken a sharp turn Its young educated population has increased just 28 percent since 2000 significantly less than its overall population It is suffering the consequences of overenthusiasm for new houses and new jobs before the crash economists sayThe population of young educated people in Dallas Charlotte and Raleigh is also growing more slowly than their populations as a wholeThe effects of the migration of the young and the restless are most vividly seen in urban cores In 1980 young adults were 10 percent more likely than other people to live in these areas according to the report from City Observatory which is sponsored by the Knight Foundation In 2010 they were 51 percent more likely and those with college degrees were 126 percent more likely The trend extends to all the largest metropolitan areas except Detroit and Birmingham AlaOf the metropolitan areas with the most populous city centers Washington and Philadelphia showed the largest increases of young adults living there at 75 and 78 percent Other cities that have made big gains in that category are Baltimore Los Angeles San Diego Dallas Miami and St Louis Washington also had the largest share of young college graduates over all at 81 percentThey want something exciting culturally fun involving a lot of diversity  and their fathers suburban lifestyle doesnt seem to be all that thrilling to many of them Mr Glaeser saidHow many eventually desert the city centers as they age remains to be seen but demographers predict that many will stay They say that could not only bolster city economies but also lead to decreases in crime and improvements in public schools If the trends continue places like Pittsburgh and Buffalo could develop a new reputation  as role models for resurgence,2014-10-20T00:00:00Z,drugs

in the town thats as far north as you can go and still be in the United States is hunting for votesHes tired after a late night spent butchering one of three bowhead whales that subsistence hunters towed in from the pewtercolored waters of the Chukchi Sea Slabs of blubber cover front yards all over town and Tegoseak has some whale of his own to cut up and cook at homeBut not yet There is an election coming soon and doors await his knock Harold Snowball answers one of themAre you a Republican or Democrat do you mind if I ask says Tegoseak Snowball thinks hes a registered Democrat but says he votes for who he believes will do a better job In this case that will probably be Alaskas Democratic US senator Mark BegichYeah Tegoseak says with a fist pump and later makes a note of this on a spreadsheetIt takes 22 hours and four connections to get from Washington to Barrow a place where the sun will set two weeks after Election Day and not rise for two months Gas is 7 a gallon offbrand milk nearly 11 Polar bears sometimes prowl the edge of town The roads are dirt because pavement wont make it through the cold of winter and the shortcut to downtown is a path across a frozen lagoonThis is the Alaska bush home to the hardest political ground game in America And this election season Republicans need to pick up six seats to win control of the US Senate They like their chances in Alaska So too do Democrats who are investing in an unprecedented effort in rural Alaska to get out the voteThough independent voters make up the largest voting bloc in the state Republicans have expanded their edge over Democrats in registered voters since 2008 when Begich carried rural Alaska on his way to defeating Sen Ted Stevens by less than 4000 votesThis time Begich faces former state Attorney General Dan Sullivan who has largely focused his getoutthevote efforts in the states more populated areas such as Anchorage Fairbanks and Juneau Sullivan nevertheless visited Barrow and its 4700 residents as part of a recent rural swing and has won the endorsement of leaders of the locally based Arctic Slope Regional Corp with 11000 shareholders primarily of native Inupiat descentBegich doesnt have rural support sewn up said Kyle Kohli a spokesman for the Republican National CommitteeBegich has racked up endorsements from Alaska Native and fishermens groups key constituencies But in places like Barrow its the doortodoor facetoface interactions that can make the difference and why the ground game  no matter how arduous  matters so muchTegoseak 29 was born in Barrow moved away after high school and returned in the last two years with hopes of providing an opportunity for his young daughter to reconnect with their Inupiaq culture He worries about drilling offshore and what that could mean for the whale hunts Begich he says won him over with a measured approach to drilling and his support of alternative energyNow Tegoseak is one of roughly 40 paid state Democratic Party employees working across rural Alaska to reelect BegichThey have an office  a rented twostory house  but Tegoseak often works out of a Ford Ranger with duct tape on the steering column a hula girl on the dashboard Marlboros on the floor and a dogeared Begich sticker on the glove box He worried when Begich was in town a few months back that he would have trouble unbuckling the sometimes sticky passengerside seatbelt He didntIts exciting that people in this small community could shape America Tegoseak said But its trueHe set up recently at his usual spot the entrance to AC the main general store in town his small table tucked between some carts and a man peddling jewelry He tacked up handmade signs reading Are you a whaler and Vote Early But hunters had scored another whale so Tegoseak said I expect it to be deadHey are you registered he called out to a guy he wrestled with growing up Im good the man responded hustling out Tegoseak made a note to follow up He tried making eye contact with everyone who passed Some avoided it An old friend invited him to churchTegoseak doesnt lead with the Senate race when asking people if theyre registered He sometimes mentions that voters in Alaska also will decide next month whether to legalize recreational use of marijuana in case that helps get people to the pollsAmid the whale hunts and a recent election for borough mayor a lot of the people Tegoseak meets believe voting is done for the year Or they just havent been paying all that much attentionAfter an hour at the AC Tegoseak packed up Time to go housetohouseHello Beverly Its Gabe he called out at the door of Beverly and Patrick Hugo both 61 She welcomed him in reminding him to take off his snowcovered shoes Patrick was flipping through mail Dan Sullivans in the trash can he said disposing of a Sullivan mailerOn the wall amid family portraits was a photo of Patrick with Alaskas senior senator Republican Lisa Murkowski In 2010 Alaska Natives formed a political action committee to support Murkowskis writein bid after she lost her primary to tea party favorite Joe Miller The Hugos were among her supporters They also support BegichTegoseak asked if they would like to vote early When is the election Nov 7 Beverly said Nov 4 Tegoseak reminded her before persuading both to fill out a request for an absentee ballot They made small talk as ads attacking Begich flashed on TV during the 6 oclock newsHows your dad Patrick asked Hes still my dad still acting like hes 20something Tegoseak saidHe offered to bring by some whale for the couple a common gesture in the community You know where we live Patrick responded in thanks as Tegoseak headed out Youre welcome to visit any timeWith elders you have to have conversations Tegoseak later explained You may not have much time but their time is importantWith the day quickly fading Tegoseak headed to his truck to get in a few calls and dialed Mike Shults a local tour guide who favors camouflage clothing and wears a necklace made of polar bear and walrus teethTegoseak had heard that Shults was leaning toward Begich Instead he got an earful Shults voted for Begich in 2008 but said he believed Republicans would do a better job addressing spending and taking on Islamic State militants Point by point he laid out why a change in leadership was needed as Tegoseak interjected where he couldIn the end Tegoseak knew he wouldnt sway him Shults it turned out already had his absentee ballotBut thats the beauty of all of this Tegoseak said That people can engage really  for things they feel passionate aboutHe headed back to the office with hopes of getting home early enough to be able to work on his slice of the whale before starting another day looking for more votes for Begich___,2014-10-27T02:20:43Z,drugs

at the forefront of efforts to reclaim it as a mainstream cropResearchers and farmers are producing the first legal hemp crop in generations in Kentucky where hemp has turned into a political cause decades after it was banned by the federal government Republican US Sens Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul advocate for it as does state Agriculture Commissioner James Comer a Republican who is running for governor next yearThe comeback is strictly small scale Experimental hemp plots more closely resemble the size of large family gardensStatewide plantings totaled about 15 acres from the Appalachian foothills in eastern Kentucky to the broad stretches of farmland in the far west said Adam Watson the Kentucky Agriculture Departments hemp program coordinatorThe crops reintroduction was delayed in the spring when imported hemp seeds were detained by US customs officials The states Agriculture Department sued the federal government but dropped the case Friday after reaching an agreement on importing the seeds into Kentucky The seeds were released after federal drug officials approved a permitSince then test plots have shown the crop to be hardy and fast growing  and a potential moneymaker with a remarkable range of traditional uses including clothing mulch hemp milk cooking oil soap and lotionsWhat weve learned is it will grow well in Kentucky Comer said It yields a lot per acre All the things that we predictedAt Murray State University about 180 miles southwest of Louisville plants have sprouted to at least 8 feet tall turning a shade of green and yellow as they reach maturity Harvest is approachingIts had a good growth period said Murray State agriculture dean Tony L Brannon It appeared to tolerate the extremes in weather from extremely wet to extremely dry pretty wellHemps roots in Kentucky date back to pioneer days and the towering stalks were once a staple at many farmsWeve got an excellent climate for it excellent soils for it Watson said Its a good fit for Kentucky producers The ultimate question is going to come down to economics Is there a market and can Kentucky capture thatGrowing hemp without a federal permit was banned in 1970 due to its classification as a controlled substance related to marijuana Hemp and marijuana are the same species Cannabis sativa but hemp has a negligible amount of THC the psychoactive compound that gives marijuana users a highLegal production of the crop has been gone for so long that it was a virtual blank slate in modern Kentucky agricultureTeams of researchers and farmers are studying which seed varieties and soil types are best suited and how much moisture or fertilizer are neededThere are a lot of unknowns Watson said Its those sorts of answers that producers are going to need before they can turn it into an economically viable crop on their farmsFor now growing hemp is strictly limited The federal farm bill enacted this year restricts hemp production to research projects designated by agriculture departments in states that allow the crop to be grown But commercial uses are also emergingFifteen states have removed barriers to hemp production according to Vote Hemp a group that advocates for the plants legal cultivationLicensed growers were able to secure seeds in three states  Kentucky Colorado and Vermont  the group said but  difficulties in obtaining seeds limited production  According to Eric Steenstra president of Vote Hemp the biggest obstacle was gaining approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration to import hemp seeds for plantingIn Vermont about 12 farms registered to grow hemp said Alison Kosakowski a spokeswoman for the states Agency of Agriculture Food and Markets The agency doesnt know how many producers ended up planting a hemp cropThe intentions were much bigger in Colorado There were 56 registrations for commercial hemp production and 76 more for research and development according to Ron Carleton the states deputy agriculture commissionerUnavailability of seed likely kept a fairly significant number of applicants from getting hemp in the ground he said Some farmers able to produce a crop this year may harvest the seeds to grow next years crop he saidIn Kentucky the crop is being studied by researchers at a halfdozen universitiesEastern Kentucky University researchers recently harvested their small hemp plot Those plants reached 7 feet tallIt seems to be fairly easy to grow said EKU agriculture professor Bruce Pratt The plants got established so quickly that they shaded out the weedsA 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service pegged hemp imports at 115 million in 2011 a tiny sum relative to other imported cropsIf widespread US production is someday allowed states able to attract processors close to where the crop is grown will be the winners said University of Kentucky agricultural economist Will SnellIts a small niche market but its growing he said We can grow it The problem is other states and other countries can grow it as well,2014-08-16T11:20:52Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/us/politics/surveys-of-voters-signal-dismay-with-both-parties.html,Politically divided Americans were in dour agreement about much as they voted in this years midterm elections  broadly distrustful of government overwhelmingly disapproving of Congress convinced that the nations economic system favors the wealthy and doubtful that the next generation will inherit a better economic futureRepublicans went into the contest heavily favored to make significant gains typically the presidents party is on the defensive in midterm elections and most of this years battles for Senate seats were in conservative states But voters surveyed after casting their ballots both at the polls on Tuesday and by phone for those who voted early signaled deep dismay with both parties and were at least as negative about Republican congressional leaders as about President ObamaMr Obama was at the center of the campaign debate if not on the ballot as Republicans sought to exploit his unpopularity by tying Democratic candidates to him especially in the fight for control of the Senate A majority of voters said they disapproved of how the president was doing his job and about eight in 10 of those who disapproved supported RepublicansAs bleak as Democrats prospects were the party succeeded to some degree in its strategy of focusing on female voters especially minorities and single women by attacking Republicans for their legislative actions to limit access to abortion and birth controlDemocrats won a majority of women a traditionally supportive group but one that sided with Republicans by a single percentage point in 2010 the previous midterm election year That setback four years ago was a big factor in enabling Republicans to win control of the House and of many state legislatures and governorshipsOn Tuesday single women supported Democrats over Republicans by more than 20 points In Senate battlegrounds like Colorado Georgia Iowa and North Carolina Democratic candidates also won a majority of women But it was not enough to avert losses given the overwhelming support male voters provided for the RepublicansYet political independents  a group that six years ago helped propel Mr Obama to the presidency  once again supported Republicans though by a smaller margin than in 2010 Democrats also failed again in other ways to rebuild Mr Obamas broad coalition of 2008 losing among middleaged voters suburbanites and Catholics though not as badly as in 2010Democrats did hold onto groups that form their base union households gays blacks Hispanics Asians younger voters lowerincome Americans political moderates Northeasterners city dwellers Jewish voters and both those without high school educations and those with graduate degreesThe surveys of voters showed that Republicans also won their core supporters whites men older voters Southerners white Protestants veterans higherincome people weekly churchgoers white evangelical Christians and rural residents Edison Research conducted the surveys for a consortium of news media organizationsAs was true in polls throughout the year the economy was the top issue on most voters minds Nearly half selected this issue as their top concern  nearly double the number that picked health care the next most pressing issue Fewer than one in five voters named foreign policy or immigration as their primary concernDespite a range of good economic news of late including a declining unemployment rate many voters are not believersMore than threequarters said they were worried about where the economy is headed in the next year a majority of those supported Republicans Voters split evenly on whether the economy is getting better worsening or staying the same those who see it getting better backed Democrats by a threetoone margin while those who foresee conditions getting worse similarly supported RepublicansBut perhaps the most telling sign of Americans downbeat state of mind was the measure of their confidence  or lack of it  in the American dream About half the voters said they expect that the next generation will not enjoy a better life than Americans today That was a significant increase from 2010 The pessimistic voters backed Republicans two to one while the half of Americans who believe the next generation will enjoy the same or better lives voted by a similar margin for DemocratsOver all more than half of voters expressed negative feelings toward both the Democratic and Republican parties In a cautionary note for Republicans about reading too much into their victories onequarter of the voters who supported the partys candidates did so despite harboring bad feelings about the party Among voters who backed Democrats a significantly smaller share was negative toward that partyVoters stances on a number of issues emphasized the stark differences between Democrats and Republicans and suggested why it has been years since many Americans claimed they saw no difference between the partiesVoters closely split on whether samesex marriage or marijuana should be legal for example with those in favor overwhelmingly supporting Democrats and those opposed supporting Republicans by similar marginsOn several issues majorities expressed views in sync with Democrats A slim majority said abortion should remain legal supporters favored Democrats and opponents Republicans A larger majority agreed that climate change is a serious problem and those who did overwhelmingly supported Democrats while those who disagreed backed Republicans And most voters favored allowing immigrants here illegally to have a chance to seek legal status  a position at odds with Republican opposition that hardened in the course of the years campaignsVoters remain evenly divided over Mr Obamas signature Affordable Care Act which Republicans sought for a third election cycle to make an albatross around Democrats necks On that issue too voters who support the law or say it should have gone farther overwhelmingly went for Democrats while opponents chose Republicans,2014-11-05T00:00:00Z,drugs

marijuana test triggered a yearlong ban for Browns wide receiver Josh Gordon costing him the 2014 seasonCritics of the NFLs arbitrary policy toward domestic violence point to the contrast between the punishments and say its time for the league to crack down on players who hurt womenThree members of Congress wrote NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell asking him to reconsider Rices suspension the governor of Maine says hell boycott the league and numerous groups that advocate for women and families condemned the penalty as too lenientLeague officials may soon take action on the matter A person familiar with the NFLs plans says the league is looking into increasing punishments for players involved in domestic violence The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no announcement had been made on such a decisionThe first time with marijuana is different from the first time you are knocking your wife unconscious said Judy Harris Kluger executive director of Sanctuary for Families and a former judge in New York City Its not what they did was such a small sort of slap on the wrist Punishment to me they should have suspended for a season at least and let him appeal At least you send a message that this is not tolerated that this mattersRices suspension begins Saturday a punishment handed down after grainy video showed him dragging his thenfiancee off a casino elevator unconscious Feb 15 He has not divulged what happened in the elevator except to call his actions totally inexcusableHis assault charges could be expunged once he completes a diversion program So the NFL gave him the only punishment he likely faces in a suspension and a fine that totals more than 500000My daughter is 2 years old now One day shes going to know the power of Google Me having to explain that to her what happened that night thats something I have to live with the rest of my life Rice said at training campBy comparison Washington safety Brandon Meriweather was handed a twogame suspension for a hit during an exhibition game for a sixth violation of player safety rules Broncos kicker Matt Prater has been suspended four games for violating terms of the leagues alcohol program as a repeat offender Gordon was suspended for two games last season and his appeal of his oneyear ban for violating the substance abuse policy at least a third time was rejected WednesdayThe NFL has guidelines bargained with the NFL Players Association setting out penalties for using illegal and performanceenhancing drugs Domestic violence covered under personal conduct has been left to the discretion of the commissionerThe NFLs personal code of conduct makes it clear that domestic violence will not be tolerated Kluger says But she says the league didnt follow that code in punishing RiceIt boggles the mind that they did not act in a way that  sent a message that this is more serious said Kluger who helped oversee New York putting in courts that deal specifically with domestic violenceThis is not a new issue for the NFL Since January 2000 77 players have been involved in 85 domestic violence incidents with six being cut by their teams according to USA Todays NFL Arrests Database The NFL suspended six players for one game each and Rice now is the second player to be suspended for two gamesGoodell has defended the Rice suspension saying the league cant just make up the discipline and needs to be consistent He also said Rice took responsibility and had not been in trouble beforeUS Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin sent a letter to Goodell and Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome decrying Rices punishment and suggesting the Ravens also discipline the running backThe decision to suspend Mr Rice for a mere two games sends the inescapable message that the NFL does not take domestic or intimatepartner violence with the seriousness they deserve the letter saidThe NFL has yet to punish Carolina Pro Bowl defensive end Greg Hardy who is awaiting a jury trial on his conviction for attacking his exgirlfriend in his apartment in May A judge gave him a 60day suspended jail sentence and 18 months probation which he is appealingWhat the NFL does next is being watched closely according to a consultant who helps train police lawyers and judges on domestic violenceI hope they reflect and selfassess themselves and come out and say We want to be the national standard for how we feel about violence against women said Mark Wynn a former Nashville police lieutenant working to prevent violence against women for 30 yearsGoodell emphasized Rices punishment was for a first offense Wynn says a crisis line director told him victims dont usually call for help until the fifth incidentThe stronger voice of the NFL about this that we have no tolerance for violence against women no tolerance of coercion no tolerance of objectifying women that to me would be a real pivotal moment for professional sports where they say enough is enough Wynn said___AP Pro Football Writer Howard Fendrich and News Researcher Judith Asubel contributed to this report___OnlineAP NFL website wwwpro32aporg

had just suffered nearhistoric losses and Republicans skipped ahead to 2016 by blaming Hillary Rodham Clinton for bringing down Democrats But first lets look at what might happen in the final months of a Democraticled CongressRepublicans may have thrashed them on Tuesday but Democrats will still hold power in the Senate until the end of the year And the maneuvering is well underway for what will or wont get done in the lameduck session that begins next weekThese final days present Democrats with a chance to take care of a few agenda items that will be difficult if not impossible to accomplish under the coming Republican Congress  moving on stalled nominations perhaps And Republicans will have the opportunity to dispose of a few headaches before they start fresh in the new yearTop aides to

it could inspire a flood of amendments on contentious issues like border security presidential action on immigration and Ebola preparednessAnd considering Senator Mitch McConnells promise as the prospective new majority leader to allow freeflowing amendments next year it could be a preview of whats to come Carl HulseIt was like watching someone who has had the weight of the world lifted from his shouldersMaybe it was the fact that President Obama will never be held responsible for another election Maybe it was because he could stop going to so many fundraisers Or perhaps he was relieved that he could move on his agenda without the fear of offending votersWhatever the reason the president was relaxed calm  cheery even  as he faced reporters on Wednesday He said it more than once I am really optimistic about America The election results he said were disappointingIt doesnt make me mopey he added It energizes meAfter a similar drubbing four years ago a grim Mr Obama seemed burdened by the sagging economy by the election losses of many friends in the House who had just helped him pass the health care law and by his own management failuresHis tone was then reflective acknowledging that presidents can lose track of the ways that we connected with folks that got us here in the first place Losing control of the House was a shellacking that had taught him lessonsThere was none of

datainfused smartphones and tablets in hand they have an unprecedented amount of information about the potential voters they are trying to persuade and more money than ever in a midterm election to do itThis fusion of oldschool door knocking and an overlay of data analytics has been changing elections for at least three cycles but each advance builds on its predecessor with voters largely unaware why the canvassers know so much about themSo now even before Emma Benson a field director for the conservative political organization Americans for Prosperity knocks on a door she has more than 700

dollars to improve data collection to achieve a rough parityThe left is still ahead on the ground  they just have more resources said Tim Phillips president of Americans for Prosperity referring more to turnout muscle than to money Yet the steeper climb is for Democrats whose support among young female and minority voters historically drops off in midterm elections President Obamas approval ratings are hovering near alltime lows and Republicans have successfully persuaded their core supporters that the election is a referendum on himIn few states has the ground game been as intense as in

brothers David H and Charles G Koch is the most significant player on the Republican side providing far more clout than either Mr Tillis or the Republican PartyAs far as largescale smart operations nobody on our side compares said Donald Bryson Americans for Prosperitys North Carolina directorFor all the labor and money spent on turnout dividends often pay out in the margins affecting only a few percentage points but can swing a close electionOn Wednesday Seth Noble went door to door on Penny Lane in Cary with a brief soft sell Would you take a twoquestion survey Just two questions Mr Noble 24 a North Carolina State University senior working for the North Carolina Republican Party asked potential voters Ms Hagan or Mr Tillis Voting early or on Nov 4The night before in Chapel Hill Pat Wellington a Hagan volunteer worked her way through an online call sheet at a campaign phone bank I really do think the best thing to do is vote early because if you wait until Election Day Im afraid its going to be very busy she told a likely Hagan voter before reminding him of his neighborhood early voting locationWorkers like Ms Wellington and Mr Noble are in the end critical to any ground campaign no matter how sophisticated data collection and targeting models are said Sasha Issenberg author of The Victory Lab The Secret Science of Winning CampaignsThe great irony of the modern ground game is its this meeting of incredibly modern analytics and data married to very oldfashioned delivery devices he said Its people knocking on doors its people making phone calls out of phone banks but the calculations that are determining which door and which phone are differentDemocratic strategists concede they have to do it better than Republicans given the anger at the presidentTheres a lot more fluidity to the Democratic voting base than the Republican one said Mitch Stewart who ran turnout operations for Mr Obamas campaignsThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ramped up its commitment creating the Bannock Street project a multimillion dollar datadriven effort to persuade register and turn out votersThe easiest way to look at it is our strategy to winning is expanding the voting universe said Preston Elliott Hagans campaign manager in an interview in his Greensboro office Its a little more machineish than just catching a wave and riding momentumRepublicans say they are catching up In Raleigh campaign workers and volunteers showed off a new smartphone app that helps canvassers target their door knocks But Republican officials refused to reveal volunteer numbers paid staff totals field office locations or a tabulation of voter contacts Nor would they allow reporters to recount the phonebank pitch the secret sauce as they called itDemocratic groups are also using smartphone technology to make canvassing more efficient On a Monday night in Durham Ekundayo Akinloye a field manager for Working America the community arm of the AFLCIO walked in an upscale neighborhood An iPhone app helped her choose which doors to knock with a goal of 20 to 30 an hour and as well as a dozen IDs  a voters key issue and which candidate he or she is likely to supportWhen one voter cited her top concern as womens rights womens rights womens rights Ms Akinloye immediately put the information into her phone and it was sent to headquarters to refine targetingThe Hagan campaign said that through its coordinated effort Forward North Carolina it has more than 40 offices throughout the state a paid staff of more than 100 and roughly 10000 volunteers knocking on doors By constantly refining its universe of potential voters with realtime data Mr Elliott said the Hagan team has also been able to identify some folks who looked like Republicans but when we modeled them some more we saw they were a little more movableAmericans for Prosperity in contrast has 47 paid staff members in the state up from nine in 2012 said Mr Bryson the groups state directorPlanned Parenthood while it is not allowed to coordinate directly with the Hagan campaign is also aiding the effort here through its political arm Planned Parenthood VotesAs part of its catchandrelease program it is calling voters and recording them talking about why voting is important Building on research that shows holding voters accountable for their own promises can increase the likelihood a voter will show up to the polls Planned Parenthood Votes is planning to call the voters back on Election Day and the day before and play their message to them reminding them why voting mattersIn Cary Mr Noble was undeterred by the occasional slammed door Bob Hays reluctantly agreed to take his twoquestion survey and declared himself undecided in the Senate raceThat one is up in the air for me right now he said Thom Tillis and Kay Hagan have really been taking some shots at each other Its gotten ruthlessMaybe he added Ms Hagan has annoyed me moreThat seemed like an invitation to press the

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/24/us/ap-us-police-shooting-missouri.html,FERGUSON Mo   Missouri police have been brushing up on constitutional rights and stocking up on riot gear to prepare for a grand jurys decision about whether to charge a white police officer who fatally shot a black 18yearold in suburban St LouisThe preparations are aimed at avoiding a renewed outbreak of violence during the potentially large demonstrations that could follow an announcement of whether Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson will face a criminal trial for the Aug 9 death of Michael BrownPolice and protesters have repeatedly clashed since the shooting which prompted a national conversation about race and police tactics Images of officers in riot gear and armored vehicles confronting protesters have drawn widespread criticismMany protesters want Wilson indicted for murder Grand jury proceedings are secret but legal analysts say recently leaked information about Wilsons testimony to investigators may be an attempt to prepare the public for the possibility that he might not be chargedThe decision could be made public within the next monthIn the meantime law officers have adjusted their tactics to interact more peacefully with protesters while also honing their procedures for quick widespread arrests They plan to have a large contingent of officers at the ready but have been meeting with clergy community leaders and students in hopes of building relationships that could ease tensions on the streetsI know theres a lot of anxiety theres a lot of fear anticipation about that announcement said Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt Ron Johnson who was put in charge of security in Ferguson in the days after Brown was killed and is now part of a coordinated command with local police But I have a lot of hopeLaw enforcement officers expect to receive at least a days notice before a grand jury announcement That should provide time for them to execute security plans but may also allow demonstrators to prepareThe moment I learn that there is in fact a nonindictment then theres going to be an organized protest said Eric Vickers a black St Louis attorney and civil rights activistBrown was unarmed when Wilson encountered him walking in the street with a friend A scuffle ensued and Brown was shot multiple times Witness accounts of what happened varied with some people saying they saw Brown raise his hands as if in surrenderWilson told investigators he felt threatened while fighting with Brown from inside a police SUV where an initial gunshot was fired according to information provided to several news outlets by people described as familiar with the investigation but not otherwise identified After Brown fled the vehicle Wilson said Brown turned around in a threatening manner prompting the officer to fire the fatal shots according to those accounts of his testimonyWilsons description of events was leaked recently as was an autopsy report that showed Brown had marijuana in his system and was shot in the hand at close range Wilson has alleged Brown was trying to grab his gun in the SUVIt appears that it may be calculated to soften the blow if there is no indictment said Peter Joy a law professor at Washington University in St Louis who directs the schools Criminal Justice ClinicBut he said its conceivable that if the leaks are from law enforcement that perhaps there may be an indictment and this is calculated to garner public sympathy for officer WilsonWilsons attorneys have denied being the source of the reportsThe shooting stoked longsimmering racial tensions in Ferguson a predominantly black community with an overwhelmingly white police force Protests have continued for two months in the St Louis area often peaceful but sometimes devolving into clashes between police firing tear gas and demonstrators lobbing rocks and bottlesLaw enforcement agencies have declined to say whether they will proactively line the streets with more officers as the grand jury announcement is made or position them in strategic locations to react as neededSt Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said hes learned it works better to let sergeants and lieutenants retain their normal place in the chain of command instead of supplanting them with higherranking officersWeve also learned we have to have a dialogue with our demonstrators so they know what to expect from us and we know what to expect from them Belmar saidAmnesty International on Thursday released a report documenting what it described as human rights abuses by police during the protests following Browns death The report accuses police of violating citizens rights by intimidating protesters using riot gear aiming highpowered weapons at people using tear gas firing rubber bullets and flashbangs and setting curfewsPolice are attempting to better document events and handle widespread arrests more efficiently To ensure the state Highway Patrol is at full strength it is limiting trooper vacations around the time of a potential decision and local police may be put on longer shiftsAfter the initial clashes with protesters the state Highway Patrol purchased more shields and equipment for its officers St Louis city police recently spent 325000 upgrading helmets sticks and other civil disobedience equipment said Police Chief Sam DotsonMore than 350 St Louis officers now have been trained in civil disobedience tactics St Louis County police and state troopers also have undergone training focused largely on ensuring they understand protesters constitutional rightsBelmar Johnson and other law officers have been meeting frequently with clergy students and community leaders Pastors in turn have been preaching messages of nonviolenceEarlier this week Democratic state Sen Jamilah Nasheed of St Louis intentionally got arrested for refusing to leave the street in front of the Ferguson Police Department Even that was an act preparation Nasheed said she wanted to show others that you can peacefully protest but you dont have to be violent under the banner of justice for Michael Brown___Lieb reported from Jefferson

the job application  Have you ever been convicted of a crime  he shifted nervously in his seatIf he checked the yes box he would almost certainly not get the job as a hospital janitorHe checked the boxA moment later a human resources employee looking over his shoulder told him not to bother with the rest of the form She said I should stop right there that there was no need to continue filling out the application because I was done with the process he saidMr White convicted of possessing a handgun without a license 10 years ago is one of the 60000 people with a criminal record who live in Washington and who along with the 8000 city residents who are released from prison each year have a difficult time finding decent jobsTo ease these residents reentry into society Washingtons City Council this summer approved legislation that forbids asking about criminal history on most job applications a step being considered by Georgia Michigan and New York among other statesAfter more than 25 years of toughoncrime laws and the incarceration of millions of lowlevel drug offenders the effort is part of a bipartisan reevaluation of the criminal justice system and reflects a growing concern that large numbers of people especially AfricanAmericans  who have been jailed disproportionately  remain marginalized from the work force and at greater risk of returning to crimeThe reappraisal joined by such conservative luminaries as Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Newt Gingrich the former House speaker includes a movement to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana endeavors to expunge the criminal records of nonviolent offenders and reassessing parole and probation rules so violators are not automatically reincarceratedTheres been a shift in people away from wanting to get even said Marc A Levin the policy director for Right on Crime a conservative anticrime group in Texas People are focused now on getting results It really is a great benefit to public safety if exoffenders are able to get jobs find places to live and get occupational licenses  whether its from the perspective of the exoffender or those of us who are going to live next to themWith an estimated one in three American adults having been arrested at some point in their lives and 16 million people  about 75 percent of the adult population  who are felons or former felons the question of how to reintegrate the 700000 people who are released from prison each year has become increasingly urgentDuring the past several months states and cities as varied as Illinois Nebraska New Jersey Indianapolis Louisville Ky and New Orleans and have adopted socalled Ban the Box laws In total some 70 cities and 13 states have passed such laws  most in the past four yearsThe laws generally prohibit employers from asking applicants about criminal records as an initial step in the hiring process and from running criminal background checks until job seekers are considered serious candidates for an openingStudies have found that exoffenders particularly AfricanAmericans are far less likely to be called back for job interviews if they check the criminal history box on applications even though research has shown that those possessing a criminal record are no more apt to commit a crime in the workplace than colleagues who have never been convictedStill most of the Ban the Box laws have been enacted so recently that there is little conclusive evidence that they reduce recidivism or unemployment among exoffenders Surveys conducted in Minneapolis and Durham NC after those cities passed laws showed that fewer job applicants had been rejected for public sector work because of a criminal convictionExoffenders who have been at the fore in pushing for the laws say preventing employers from inquiring about their criminal pasts in first interviews is critical in removing prejudices against them that make it tough to get work find a place to live regain their voting rights receive federal student aid or obtain professional licensesMarilyn Scales 52 a New York City resident convicted of selling drugs in the 1990s said telling the truth on job forms had made her virtually unemployable even though she was released from prison 17 years agoWhen I answer that question honestly I never get a call back she said I feel like Im still paying for my crimes 20 years laterBut researchers say Ban the Box laws and other reform measures have gained popularity with lawmakers because of fiscal constraints as much as a desire to aid exoffendersCities and states emerging from the recession are being forced to cut corrections costs  which total more than 52 billion annually  and have begun to focus on reducing prison populations by discouraging recidivismThe changes come as the United States continues to have the worlds largest prison population even though crime is far below its 1990s levels when illegal drugs ravaged urban neighborhoodsWhen a lot of these laws passed there was anxiety about crack cocaine and black homicide rates and arguments that some criminals were super predators  said Steven Raphael a public policy professor at the University of California Berkeley That was a powerful argument especially for legislators so a lot of the reevaluation happening now has to do with the budgetary implications of prisonsWhile most Ban the Box legislation has covered only public employers Washington San Francisco Minnesota and Massachusetts among other cities and states also have prohibited private workplaces from asking the criminalhistory questions on introductory forms or in initial interviews Several of the nations largest private employers including Walmart Target and Home Depot have adopted the rules as well the companies saidThe laws still allow employers to conduct criminal background checks before making hires and to inquire about criminal histories but not until after the first interview The laws typically exempt hiring in law enforcement schools and day care centersAnd while federal law prohibits discrimination against job seekers based solely on criminal history employers are permitted to deny jobs to exoffenders if a crime is deemed to be directly related to the work  for example if a person convicted of theft is applying to be a cashierMany of those returning from prison to their old neighborhoods are AfricanAmerican men who have incarceration rates far higher than any other group  one in 12 AfricanAmerican men of working age 1864 are imprisoned according to a 2010 Pew Charitable Trust study compared with one in 87 workingage white men  a circumstance that has raised concerns about the creation of a permanent underclass of men and women freed from prison with little hope of ever finding workIf we are going to block their path and not give them options to reintegrate  if they cant get a job and the opportunity to earn a livelihood  what alternative do they have said Jim Scheer a Republican state senator from Nebraska who describes himself as tough on crime but was still an outspoken advocate of the states Ban the Box law approved 46to0 in AprilThere have been assertions however that paradoxically the laws might encourage discrimination against minoritiesIf youre not going to allow somebody without a criminal record to say I dont have a criminal record the hiring officer can say I bet this person has a criminal record and Im not going to hire them  said Adam T Klein an employment discrimination lawyer at Outten  Golden a New York law firmJack Mozloom a spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business a lobbying group said he was concerned that hiring decisions were being taken away from businessesDoes everybody deserve a second chance Of course Mr Mozloom said But its up to me as the guy taking the risk to decide that this person is worth taking the risk The fact that they have a criminal record proves that at one point in their lives they werent trustworthyMr White the exoffender now seeking janitorial work said the Washington hospitals human resource officer had not asked him what he had been convicted of  or for any other details about his crimeShe didnt know that I didnt have to serve time Mr White said All she knew was that I checked the box and as far as she was concerned I didnt deserve a shot I was somehow too

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/us/john-g-sperling-for-profit-college-pioneer-dies-at-93.html,John G Sperling a pioneer of forprofit education who turned a 26000 investment into the multibilliondollar University of Phoenix calling himself an unintentional entrepreneur and an accidental CEO died on Friday in the San Francisco area He was 93His death was announced by the Apollo Education Group the universitys parent company which gave no other detailsMr Sperling who lived in the Bay Area and in Phoenix led the life of a stubborn iconoclast A survivor of childhood illness learning disability poverty and physical abuse he earned a doctorate from the University of Cambridge a liberal former union organizer he spent years battling government regulation a longtime professor who did not enter business until his 50s he became a spectacularly successful capitalistWith the University of Phoenix he defied convention by serving working adults offering unusual class schedules giving credit for skills earned outside classrooms  and turning a profitOver four decades he turned the university and later its parent company into one of the largest education ventures in the world At its peak in 2010 it had more than half a million students in hundreds of physical locations and online Its network of locations now extends to 39 statesThat success drew hostile reactions from traditional academia accrediting agencies and government regulators who questioned the quality and cost of forprofit colleges and accused them of milking government aid programs and preying on unsophisticated consumersTo which Mr Sperling said simply Theyre scared to death of usSqueezed by tighter regulation bad publicity and declining demand revenue and enrollment have declined sharply in recent years at forprofit education companies Apollos stock has lost more than twothirds of its value since early 2009 But Apollo remains one of the largest and healthiest companies in its field with 37 billion in revenue and 249 million in profit in its 2013 fiscal yearIn later years Mr Sperlings business achievements were at times overshadowed by his unorthodox activities He poured millions of dollars into an illfated attempt to clone his pet dog research on human life span extension and most successfully efforts to legalize marijuana in partnership with his fellow billionaires George Soros and Peter B Lewis Mr Sperling said marijuana had helped him manage the effects of prostate cancer treatment in the 1970sHe also adopted a number of environmental causes and cowrote a book offering a template for Democrats to take control of the countrys politicsBy his own admission Mr Sperling was endlessly combative while others saw him as quirky at times For one thing he liked to wear the same outfit every day khaki pants and a blue dress shirtJohn Glen Sperling was born on Jan 9 1921 in a log cabin in rural Missouri He said his childhood was marked by nearfatal lung infections dyslexia and frequent beatings by his father He was 15 when his father diedIt was the happiest day of my life he wrote It still isMr Sperling later signed on as a merchant mariner and with the help of a fellow crew member learned to read fluently He soon fell in love with classic novels During World War II he served in the Army Air Corps and afterward with help from the GI Bill attended and graduated from Reed College in Portland OreHe went on to graduate school at the University of California Berkeley studying history and then to Cambridge before embarking on an academic career first at Ohio State University As a history professor at San Jose State in the 1960s he was an organizer and leader of a faculty union and later a faculty strikeIn the early 70s Mr Sperling directed programs for remedial students and the teachers and others who worked with them The adults he found wanted not just job training but also a college education He left the university to found his first company developing adulteducation ventures with collegesA few years later he moved his headquarters to Arizona and started the University of Phoenix In its early years the university clashed with accreditation agencies and state regulators but business boomed and Apollos first public offering in 1994 made Mr Sperling wealthy In the following years however as forprofit companies seized a significant share of the college market filling what they said was an unmet need they came under increasing scrutiny for generally charging high prices and showing high student borrowing rates and low graduation and jobplacement ratesThe University of Phoenix faced allegations that it had illegally paid recruiters according to the number of students they signed up and it ultimately paid 805 million to settle a whistleblower lawsuitMr Sperlings defenders say the bad practices developed in a period when he had largely withdrawn from the companys operations before reasserting control in 2006Mr Sperling and his son Peter the companys chairman controlled all of its voting stockTwice divorced Mr Sperling is survived by his son two grandchildren and his longtime companion Joan HawthorneIn his memoir Rebel With a Cause Mr Sperling wrote that throughout his life he had shown a lack of concern for what peers and authority figures think of me His strengths he said were implacable opportunism joy in conflict and a thrill from taking risks,2014-08-26T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/living-with-schizophrenia-coffee-and-friends/,I have a hard time making friends Getting to trust people well enough to call them a friend takes a lot of work Its especially hard when you are living with schizophrenia and think everyone is making fun of you Schizophrenia is the devil on your shoulder that keeps whispering in your ear and no matter what you try the little demon wont stop He hasnt stopped in the almost nine years Ive lived with the illness and hes not about to stop now Hes just quieted down a bit Id call him my companion but that would imply a degree of friendship and theres no way in hell Im the little devils friend I have plenty of acquaintances and a couple hundred friends on Facebook But real friends mostly family I can count on one hand For me making friends is like climbing a vertical rock wall with no ropes requiring a degree of thrillseeking and a good deal of risk For someone to be my friend they have to accept that Im crazy and even getting to the point of telling them that is daunting when all you hear is the devils whispering that theyre making snap judgments about you or will be going back to their real friends and laughing about you But interestingly in my efforts to make friends coffee shops have helped The simple routine of going to get your fix of liquid energy every day provides a sort of breeding ground for community You see these people every daywhether you like it or not and over time friendships formI used to live in a small town called Niwot about five miles down the highway from Boulder where I now live Every morning around 6 I would go to Winot Coffee the small independent coffee shop and every morning without fail there was a guy my age sitting outside with his computer smoking clove cigarettes Given the regularity of seeing him every morning and given that we were some of the only 20somethings in town we got to talking He was something of an intellectual heavily involved with the writings of Noam Chomsky foreign policy our dependency on oil and the nonGMO food movement And eventually through our morning chats we became friends I told him about my struggles with mental illness and he told me about the history of the conflict in the Middle East He seemed trustworthy though I could never be sure and I never could shake the notion he was judging me as stupid or simple I went over to his house for the first time one evening and found it piled floor to ceiling with strange books on metaphysics and Native American history He lived in in a deep grove of trees and grew kale and marijuana in his backyard We ate vegan pizza and I met his girlfriend who was 11 years older than him One morning at the coffee shop he came to me for advice He said he was having a hard time with anxiety that he wasnt sure of anything anymore We talked for several hours that morning exploring the nuances of our anxiety I shared with him my irrational fear that people were speculating about my virginity and he told me about his overarching feeling that the world was collapsing in around him I think it was too much because the next day at the coffee shop he wasnt there and I never saw him again Sometimes being too vulnerable can throw someone off It was like we had stepped over a line where the friendship got too deep There are others though who have made it into my inner circle and stuck around Id be nothing without their everconstant ear and their sometimes dark humor that can bring a smile to my face when I want nothing else but to curl up in bed I have one friend Brianna who has seen me at my worst I met her a few years ago when I was sitting outside a coffee shop writing in a journal and she waved at me and came over and asked me what I was writing I was skeptical at first seeing her blue hair and the wild look in her eyes I told her what I was writing was nothing but then she started asking me questions and before I knew it two hours had passed and she knew that I had been diagnosed schizophrenic after a trip to the UN where I thought I was a prophet and was trying to save the world It seemed like every time I went to that coffee shop she was there and it was nice to have someone to sit with and to talk with She and I are vastly different people We dont listen to the same music shes into early British punk hardcore stuff and Im on the mellower side preferring Dave Matthews or Blues Traveler Shes a fervent anarchist and Im again mellower taking no sides but believing that everyone should treat each other kindly There are times when her quirkiness really gets on my nerves like when she tells me her stories about magic and fairies or getting drunk with bikers and theres just no way I can relate She lived in a shack with her boyfriend without water and electricity in the Texas desert for several years and traveled the country selling coffee for an independent coffee shop Shes so caring though and describes herself as a demon wrangler working with violent people in mental hospitals and prisons talking them down from suicide and putting themselves in danger Six years on shes done the same for me Shes stuck around despite my delusions that people are out to get me and shes asked me out for coffee during some pretty deep periods of depression I wouldnt be as nearly as stable as I am today without her Somehow we get along  Im grateful to have her  and a few others out of the thousands of people Ive met Because without them theres a good chance Id still be out in the streets thinking I was a prophet and talking about aliens and the coming apocalypse You only really need one or two good friends anyway Michael Hedrick is a writer in Boulder Colo His book Connections is available at

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/sports/golf/also-missing-explanation-for-an-absence-.html,AKRON Ohio  Josh Gordon a Cleveland Browns receiver with abilities that separate him from his peers spent Friday pleading his case before an arbitrator in an effort to avoid a minimum yearlong suspension after testing positive a third time for recreational drugsWe know this because the transparency of the NFLs substanceabuse policy ensures that every development in Gordons case is made public Less than an hour from Gordons workplace a highprofile world golf event proceeded without Dustin Johnson whose absence has cast a spotlight on the opacity of the PGA Tours drug policy Three days after Johnson withdrew from the World Golf Championships event at Firestone Country Club he took an indefinite leave from the tour citing his need to seek professional help for personal challenges I have faced He also described what he was embarking upon as a mission of selfimprovementThe ambiguity of Johnsons explanation combined with a deafening silence from the PGA Tour which released a statement saying it had nothing to add to Johnsons remarks created an information vacuum that commenters on social media and across the Internet rushed to fill On Friday the rampant speculation about Johnsons hardpartying lifestyle gained credence with the publication of a Golfcom article that using a vague unnamed source reported Johnson had been suspended for six months after a third failed drug test and a second for cocaineA few hours after the Golfcom article was posted online the PGA Tour released a statement saying that Johnson had taken a voluntary leave of absence and had not been suspendedThe wording called to mind the coach who is told by his bosses that if he resigns he wont be fired Not surprising really given that the tour offices are populated by lawyers trained to stand on semantics not principlesUnlike the major North American professional sports leagues and even the mens and womens professional tennis tours the PGA Tour has steadfastly refused to announce fines or suspensions Tour officials do not acknowledge discipline meted out for acts like using foul language on the course getting into an oncourse altercation with another player or testing positive for a recreational drug The reasoning tour officials say is that in most cases few people know about the original transgression so why broadcast it to the massesThe tour makes an exception for doping offenses but since it initiated its drugtesting policy in 2009 it has ensnared only one player a journeyman Most of the discipline meted out for behavior unbecoming of a professional that the public finds out about comes courtesy of a court case John Dalys multiple suspensions or a police blotter Matt Everys 2010 arrest on a misdemeanor charge of marijuana possession Every was suspended for three months even though the charges against him were dropped In the absence of any official pronouncement Every now 30 could have tried to explain away his absence as injuryrelatedIn 2012 when Johnson returned from an 11week absence that he ascribed to injuries incurred in a Jet Ski accident he stammered when asked how exactly the injury had happened and gave an answer that was strangely short on details Was he vague because he had not actually been injured and was instead serving a suspension for a failed drug testThe tours nontransparency on disciplinary matters casts everyone in a dark light Every prolonged absence from competition raises eyebrows and invites speculation While Every didnt try to hide his suspension it was not by choice When I got in trouble it was in the papers so people knew when I was suspended what it was for Every said Friday after finishing his round of twounderpar 68 at Firestone Its not like I could hide that as easily as someone else who fails a test or two and no ones ever heard of itReferring to the tour policy Every added If they decide not to make things public why wouldnt you hide the reason youre not playing Whos going to voluntarily say Hey I got busted for thisThe tours policy protects the players from the public shame endured by the likes of Gordon and Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice who received a twogame suspension from the NFL after being accused of assaulting the woman who is now his wife Whether that is a good thing depends on whether you believe as some addiction therapy specialists do that being forced to drive around with license plates that indicate you have arrests for drunken driving is strong motivation to stop drinking or whether you side with those who believe that humiliation is not the road to behavior modificationI think it definitely helps protect our image Every said because there might be a household name out here and Im not saying this is true but if there is and everyone thinks Oh this guys a great guy but he failed one test for marijuana or whatever and the public finds out his image totally changes Is that really that big of a dealHe added If its steroids I think we should know Thats differentThe tours antidoping policy includes outofcompetition testing but Tiger Woods who began the year ranked No 1 in the world said in June that he had not been tested in 2014 Next year when the golfers come under the Olympic umbrella in advance of their 2016 Summer Games debut they will have to provide the World AntiDoping Agency with a daily onehour window of availability listing when and where drug testers can find themOn Friday NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell could be found a halfhours drive from here in Canton defending the leagues decision to discipline Rice much less harshly for hurting a woman than what Gordon faces for hurting no one but possibly himself PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem

reporter for The New York Times sets out to portray the many seamy sides of the war on terror during the past 13 yearsThose willing to overlook his occasionally lumpy prose will be rewarded with a memorable chronicle of the longrange consequences of the panicky reaction of top American officials to the Sept 11 attacks from lost billions in taxpayer dollars to the lost life of a former torturer and the smashed dreams of an intelligence whistleblowerWe are plunged into an unsettled noirish world in which scam artists and thieves swarm government agencies peddling phony software and other novel tools for the war against terror The Bush administration was throwing money at the terrorist problem and plenty of people were willing to catch a few bundles Mr Risen begins by following about 2 billion from the United States to Baghdad which was then stolen with much of it ending up in a bunker in Lebanon in what may be one of the largest robberies in modern historyIn this world it is often unclear who is the handler and who is the stooge Dennis Montgomery was just another overweight gambler in the casinos of Reno Nev until he claimed to have developed a technology that could decode secret messages embedded in the videotapes of Osama bin Laden that were broadcast on the Al Jazeera news network On the basis of that claim he won millions of dollars in government contracts Mr Risen says that around Christmas of 2003 Mr Montgomery influenced the Bush administration to seriously consider shooting down civilian airliners After French government investigators concluded that Mr Montgomerys operation was a hoax Mr Risen reports the CIA quietly dropped him Mr Montgomery then moved on to the United States Special Operations Command which paid his company 96 million for a facial recognition technology that supposedly could identify terrorists observed by cameras attached to drones Mr Montgomerys company eventually collapsed in a welter of debts and legal claimsMr Risen also delves into the human wreckage left behind by the war on terror portraying the hellish postArmy life of Damien M Corsetti a soldier who by Mr Risens account engaged in torture at the Abu Ghraib prison west of Baghdad He illustrates what the United States Army should have known before going into Iraq that torture has two victims the one who suffers it and the one who inflicts it Mr Corsetti is shown living in Savannah Ga having kicked an addiction to heroin but living in a cloud of marijuana smoke with posttraumatic stress disorder He is one of the first veterans known to have been given full disability based on PTSD suffered while conducting harsh interrogations in the war on terror Mr Risen writesThe best section of the book is probably the last about the trespasses against the United States Constitution committed by the National Security Agency Here Mr Risens style becomes clearer and his narrative surer The tale of Diane Roark who worked on the staff of the House Intelligence Committee is both hairraising and representative of the postSept 11 era in which accountability and transparency in government basic elements of a functioning democracy were badly eroded When she realized that the NSA was collecting data on American citizens she tried to find out more and then to warn people She assumed that she had stumbled across a rogue operation She asked members of Congress about it and got nowhere She then contacted a federal judge who oversaw intelligence matters only to have the judge report her to the Justice Department She went to officials she knew at the CIA and the White HouseMs Roark eventually realized that all these people had known about the NSA program and effectively approved of it She retired from her Congressional job and moved to Oregon only to wake up one morning in July 2007 to find FBI agents with a search warrant and a sealed affidavit that allowed them to go through her house apparently to look for evidence that she leaked data about the NSA to newspaper reporters Mr Risen notes that others who discussed their concerns about the NSAs constitutional transgressions received similarly harsh handling one reason that Edward J Snowden fled overseas when he leaked documents about United States intelligence agencies surveillance of American citizensTo follow Mr Risen on this journey the reader must hack through some undergrowth For example is it really necessary to write twice that crazy became the new normal in the war on terrorMr Risen also sometimes overreaches He states flatly that Every general in the military hoped to cash out by going to work for a major defense contractor as soon as he or she retired from active duty This is true of too many retired generals and admirals but hardly all Large numbers go into nonprofit work or academia For example off the top of my head I know of a Marine general who joined a drug addiction rehabilitation charity and an Army lieutenant general who just finished a doctoral dissertation at Johns Hopkins University on just war theory in ancient Greek philosophyMr Risen also discloses the ethically questionable move of misrepresenting himself in an effort to interview two people involved in a front company established for the Special Operations Command I did not identify myself as a journalist or author instead I simply told them I was an investor interested in what they were doing This was a firing offense at the last newspaper where I worked I am assured by an editor at The Times that this did not occur in the course of reporting for the newspaperStill his core message resonates We have scared the hell out of ourselves he quotes an expert on terrorism as saying That conclusion is a fitting epitaph for the first decade of the current century Mr Risen certainly makes the case in this book that America has lost much in its lashing out against terrorism and that Congress and the people need to wake up and ask more questions about the political financial moral and cultural costs of that campaign,2014-10-13T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/06/arts/music/mezzrow-seeks-to-fill-a-jazz-niche-in-the-village.html,Johnny ONeal was smartly dressed for formalities on Wednesday night in a tuxedo vest for the first official set at Mezzrow a spruce new addition to the Greenwich Village jazz circuit But as he did his part to break in the room he put little stock in ceremonyI have no idea what Im going to play but lets go on a little journey he said from the piano with a sly but welcoming smile He rolled his shoulders shook out his hands Just making adjustments he explained Trying to relax in my living roomMezzrow is a long narrow grotto at basement level furnished with Italian marble floors and a Prohibitionera mahogany bar Acoustically tailored for intimate unamplified performances  pianobass duos in particular  its meant to serve a singular purpose on the New York club scene one that hasnt been given this clear a priority in a whileI call it a Greenwich Village listening room and lounge said Spike Wilner a jazz pianist who in partnership with Mitch Borden opened the new club at 163 West 10th Street as a companion of sorts to Smalls on the same side of the street across Seventh Avenue SouthLike Smalls a proudly scruffy institution celebrating its 20th anniversary this year Mezzrow will feature steady jazz bookings with a 20 cover charge In recent years Mr ONeal 57 has developed a cult following at his Sunday night stand at Smalls typically with a trio hell now also work Mondays at Mezzrow in a duo Among the other pianists booked in the new club this month with assorted partners are Cyrus Chestnut Friday and Saturday Anthony Wonsey Tuesday Rossano Sportiello next Friday through Sept 14 David Hazeltine Sept 17 and 18 and Bruce Barth Sept 26 through 28 And on Oct 9 through 11 the pianist Ethan Iverson will perform with the bassist Ron CarterIn style and function Mezzrow doesnt evoke Smalls so much as another cozy jazz haunt in the Village a source of bittersweet reminiscence among musicians ever since it closed its doors 18 years agoThis really fulfills a niche that hasnt been fulfilled since Bradleys said the saxophonist Joel Frahm who had stopped into Mezzrow en route to a gig at Smalls I like that its all acoustic in here I like the size of it I like that its going to be a duo roomHe added A lot of these type of rooms have come and goneBradleys was among other things a clubhouse for the upper stratum of New York jazz pianists like Hank Jones James Williams and John Hicks It cast an intimidating shadow for aspiring players including Mr Wilner now 48When I was 19 or 20 I would go and sit in the corner trying to be inconspicuous he said It just seemed like the most sophisticated place Id ever seen in my life for the hippest music in the worldThe idea for a contemporary heir to the Bradleys legacy had been in the air for a few years Mr Wilner said when he noticed a Basement Space for Rent sign along West 10th Street last November He inquired about the space which had previously housed Tanti Baci Caff an unpretentious Italian restaurant and sensed immediately that he had found his future piano roomMr Wilner set to work on a presentation for the neighborhood community board receiving its hardwon approval in February The clubs gut renovation began in March and ended in late July A 1923 Steinway piano was placed at the back of the room hemmed in by marbletopped cafe tables Those tables seating a total of about 30 can be reserved in advance at the clubs website mezzrowcom The area around the bar up front is more casual and conversational though the music carries nicely along the length of the roomAs for the clubs name its a homage to Mezz Mezzrow a Chicago clarinetist most active from the 1930s through the 50s and best remembered today as an associate of Louis Armstrongs and Sidney Bechets as a dealer and proponent of marijuana and as a Jewish musician who sympathized so fully with the AfricanAmerican experience that he came to identify with it himself living in Harlem and starting an interracial familyIn his colorful autobiography Really the Blues published in 1946 Mezzrow recalled his early ambition to be a musician a Negro musician hipping the world about the blues the way only Negroes can His earnest example later became fodder for cynical critique helping to inspire Norman Mailers galvanizing 1957 essay The White Negro Superficial Reflections on the HipsterFor Mr Wilner Mezz Mezzrow is an emblem of racial progressivism rugged entrepreneurship and musical integrity Plus Im a Jewish guy who has embraced jazz as my lifes work he said And Im an advocate for marijuana usage myself Calling the clubs name tongueincheek he said hed had no qualms about it To be quite honest I never read the Norman Mailer stuff he said Im not that interestedIn any case a framed caricature of Mezzrow in silhouetted profile hangs on a wall beside the clubs piano Mr ONeal seemed untroubled by it during his set on Wednesday a bouquet of bygone popular songs like Answer Me My Love famously recorded by Nat King Cole For a good portion of the set he played with the bassist Hassan Shakur and their sound was an ideal fit for the room round and clean and full At one point Mr ONeal called on Mr Wilner to sit in on a fleetfooted romp through Tea for TwoAfter the set Mr ONeal had a cigarette outside on the sidewalk and obligingly shared his first impressions of the roomThis is kind of a throwback to the gladiator days back in the 80s when there used to be a lot of duo clubs he said It has a lot of potential I usually can tell just by the first set Its going to be a happening thing here,2014-09-06T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/sports/the-san-francisco-giants-in-october-this-is-when-they-roll.html,SAN FRANCISCO  Midway through the black magic act that was this National League playoff game the thought occurred that the San Francisco Giants simply had a Faustian lock on October Perhaps the Washington Nationals should just make their peace with that and slink back inside the BeltwayThe tipoff came when Jayson Werth whose locks and beard made him look like the Nationals resident viking batted in the sixth inning He had been a reliable thumper for his 96win team But an 067 batting average this postseason trailed him like a can tied to his ankleHe faced Giants pitcher Ryan Vogelsong a 37yearold who stumbled through a horrid September but now pitched with the canny desperation of a farmer whose mortgage was past dueWerth flicked his bat and made contact The ball spun high toward the rightfield fenceGiants right fielder Hunter Pence a 6foot4 fellow who wears his black socks so high that his pants resemble knickers went back and back Then he took ungainly flight arm glove and tongue fully extended He held on to the ball as he crashed against the mesh wireI was just like Ive got to get that ball Pence said afterwardWerth stopped as if shot It was as if he knewAutumn belongs to the Giants They earned no style points for this deeply entertaining Twilight Zone of a win They scored three runs on in order a basesloaded walk a groundout and a wild pitch The Giants 32 victory over the Nationals in Game 4 of their division series Tuesday was the teams 11th win in its last 12 postseason tries Next the Giants will face the St Louis Cardinals another notsobad October teamPence whose blond curls were drenched in a conditioning lotion of beer and champagne led his teammates in an offcolor chant in the locker room He noted that bouncingoffwalls defense was how this team rolled The true story is that pitching and defense are the foundation of this club he saidCatcher Buster Posey led the team in the regular season with 22 homers and 89 runs batted in which is nice in a 1960s offense sort of way San Franciscos best pitcher Madison Bumgarner is a terrific hurler but not of the Clayton Kershaw ilk at least not in the regular seasonThis team logged a modest 88 regularseason wins It stumbled through a prodigious losing streak Yet it has acquired an immunity to panicThe Bay Area is probably a contributing factor Giants fans howl and wave orange rally rags but they tend toward the joyous Fans of Eastern teams  and I speak as a hapless member of the Mets tribe  take their cues from the anxietysoaked wars of the Picts and the Angles replete with demands for the heads of losing managersSome readers have suggested I am stereotyping West Coast fans By way of reply I note that the Giants on Tuesday night offered up a rally seal a Photoshopped furry white seal wearing a blackandorange Giants cap and chanting We will we will rock youThe Giants also violate inviolable Major League Baseball rules by playing a quite generous rationing of good music As the team took its final batting practice swings the Grateful Dead laid down Sugar MagnoliaThe weather was Technicolor absurd offering a full moon set against a pale blue sky A performer from the musical revue Beach Blanket Babylon sang God Bless America with a giant hat depicting the skyline of San Francisco perched atop her head I awaited only the medical marijuana sea gulls to make the evening completeYet none of this put the Nationals at ease They played as if in the throes of batsqueezing 24hour jitters Gio Gonzalez their starter booted an easy grounder Matt Williams his manager tried to cover for his pitcher by talking of a huge hole on the moundThis trench did not appear to bother other pitchers several of whom made fine fielding playsPoor Aaron Barrett a hardthrowing rookie was tossed into a tense situation and dissolved He walked hitters bounced a wild pitch that all but leapt over the catcher and in an attempt at an intentional walk threw the ball far over the catchers headThe catcher quickly retrieved the ball and threw out the Giant who was trying to score from third Did I mention it was a full moonThe Nationals lineup offered a multicar pileup The third and fourth hitters sported identical 071 averages in this series The fifth hitter weighed in at 143Only Bryce Harper broke with this hapless narrative He lashed a double down the thirdbase line in the fifth inning In the seventh he hit a home run that flew not to the left or the right of the foul pole but over it altogether It was as if the ball had been dropped from a dirigibleThat guy has insane power Pence noted of Kid Moon ShotHarper came to bat again in the ninth inning but the relief pitcher careful as a mouse in the presence of a tabby walked him on a full count The next batter grounded out to second baseThat was that Williams the Nationals manager was summoned to the interview room to spend a little time on the news media rack He was asked about his decisions and kept insisting Its irrelevant It was like going to a cemetery to watch a man bury himselfI ran into Giants Manager Bruce Bochy He offered a rueful smile when asked about his teams perpetual foot in deaths door Our way is torture I think he saidAfterward I wandered down a dark tunnel to the lip of the moonlit field Bob Marleys lilting Jamming played on the sound system A flock of sea gulls circled the field as if in a victory lapIf this was playoff torture it was

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/07/today-in-politics-10/,Good Tuesday morning from Washington where the Nationals live to fight another day and the Supreme Court has shifted the landscape on the freedom to marryHave Republicans given up the fight over samesex marriageConsider the rather muted responses on Monday from two top Republicans in states where the Supreme Courts decision will have a direct and immediate impactGov Scott Walker of Wisconsin sounded resigned For us its over in Wisconsin The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel quoted him as sayingIn Virginia where samesex marriage ceremonies were underway within hours of the courts decision the Republican candidate for Senate Ed Gillespie also seemed to accept the decision for what it wasObviously given the courts ruling he said it is the law of the land todayNot that long ago Republicans could be expected to follow a predictable script on the issue Judges who threw out voterimposed bans on samesex marriage were thwarting the democratic willIf Republican leaders are unwilling to keep up the fight the issue could lose much of its potency on the right And conservative activists will see it as one more reason to feel alienatedPerhaps the biggest question is how the issue will factor in the 2016 presidential race None of the prospective presidential candidates including Mr Walker favor broadly extending marriage rights to gay and lesbian couples Doing so would almost certainly be politically fatal in the primaries but could help in the general electionSo there was Senator Ted Cruz of Texas wooing social conservatives for a possible 2016 run calling the Supreme Courts move tragic and indefensible Jeremy W PetersThe Supreme Courts lack of action means that the path is clear for samesex couples to marry in 30 states  and the District of Columbia  that account for 60 percent of the American population No nuptials for gay couples in the other 20 states  yetWhat separates the cans from the cannotsEighteen of the states where gay marriage is legal are east of the Mississippi and Minnesota which straddles the big river On the East Coast only Florida and Georgia are missing from the list and Georgia is the last of the original 13 colonies where samesex marriage is not a legal rightOn the Pacific Alaska is the holdout None of the Gulf Coast states are representedTheres still a partisan divide Until Monday only states won by President Obama in both 2008 and 2012 allowed gay marriage Now seven McCainRomney states will do so along with Wisconsin and Virginia carried by Mr Obama and Indiana and North Carolina which have voted both ways Of the 20 states without gay marriage only Florida Ohio Michigan and Nevada were carried by the president Alan RappeportWith just a

additional fines over the nations worst offshore oil spill after a federal judge ruled Thursday that the company acted with gross negligence in the 2010 Gulf of Mexico disasterUS District Judge Carl Barbier concluded that the Londonbased oil giant showed a conscious disregard of known risks during the drilling operation and bears most of the responsibility for the blowout that killed 11 rig workers and spewed millions of gallons of oil over three monthsIn the next stage of the case set to begin in January the judge will decide precisely how much BP must payUnder the federal Clean Water Act a polluter can be forced to pay a maximum of 1100 in civil fines per barrel of spilled oil or up to 4300 per barrel if the company is found grossly negligent Barbiers finding exposes BP to the

steady decline in applications over the summer means that 246 million people collected benefits last week the fewest since June 2007 a few months before the Great Recession beganApplications for

here begins on a paved street in a cluttered neighborhood of this industrial city under the thumb of organized crimeSoon the climb turns rocky rutted and uneven pounding the undercarriage of a regular sedan and slowing even fourwheeldrive trucks Then it gives way to gravel and more jagged stones before jerking and jarring to an end at a narrow forestshrouded trail impassable for any vehicleAlong this last steep stretch with overhanging vines and branches forcing a hunched walk and strenuous stepping it becomes eerily clear that the people in these hillside graves were brought up here alive and then marched to their deathsThat is what prosecutors believe happened to at least some of the 28 people whose bodies badly burned and some dismembered were found over the weekend in several pits on the hill discovered only after witnesses in custody revealed the horrors committed hereSwarming flies buzz in air reeking of rot Charred wood and ash in the fetid muck testify to the burning the macabre tableau in the mountains pointing to the societal decay down belowThe witnesses  members of a local gang that the authorities say has infiltrated the police department in this and other towns  said that 17 students from a local teachers college were apprehended by police officers turned over to the gang taken high up on this hill killed and buriedThey are among 43 students reported missing after a confrontation Sept 26 with the local police leaving a series of pressing questions unanswered Where are the other students Why would the police want them killed And if many of these bodies are not those of missing students whose are theyIt will take time for investigators to confirm the identities of the people buried here This is a Mexico struggling to overcome a wave of drug and organized crime violence that has left tens of thousands killed and missingSo like many others over the years it may take time for this grave to give up its secretsBut its very existence has revealed the troubles below yet another iteration of the dizzying constellation of Mexican criminal groups that corrupt and control with impunityA group called Guerreros Unidos an offshoot of the larger powerful Beltrn Leyva cartel that officials say is crumbling under law enforcement pressure held a strong grip here operating a thriving criminal enterprise that sowed violence and fearThe other morning dozens of the citys police officers lined up with duffel bags packed for a long stay somewhere They were being marched off by the federal police for questioning about criminal ties Already 22 officers are in custody accused of participating in two bouts of gunfire that left six people dead including three of the college students who were part of a group attempting to steal buses to ferry protesters to and from a demonstration over school financing cuts the authorities saidPolice officers the state prosecutor said rounded up several students and turned them over to Guerreros Unidos gang members who for reasons not yet known killed them on the orders of a leader known as El ChuckyThe groups reach the authorities now believe went all the way from collecting hefty parking fines to extracting extortion payments from businesses  with the endorsement of if not leadership from City HallThe mayor Jos Luis Abarca who is wanted for questioning in the case is a fugitive Two brothers of his wife Mara de los ngeles Pineda were killed in 2009 and were known operatives in the Beltrn Leyva drug cartel one of the countrys largestThis was something of an open secret Although residents of this city of 120000 a farming and manufacturing center 120 miles south of Mexico City readily whisper that city leaders were all narcos as one street vendor put it it does not appear that the state or federal authorities took much actionMembers of Mr Abarcas own party the leftleaning Party of the Democratic Revolution said this week that they had presented complaints to the federal prosecutors office about Mr Abarcas suspected ties to organized crime but that nothing was doneA national party leader Ren Bejarano said the dossier included sworn testimony from a witness who reported seeing the mayor shoot to death a social activist last year and bury him in a clandestine grave It is not clear if it was the same one on the hillJess Murillo Karam the federal prosecutor told foreign journalists in his office on Tuesday that he never received conclusive evidence of such allegations Although he acknowledged the wifes family had organized crime ties there was no federal investigation of the mayorWe dont investigate based on kinship only on facts he saidStill he conceded that Guerreros Unidos had grown powerful after the authorities weakened a rival group Los Rojos another offshoot of a larger gang La Familia Guerreros Unidos is now believed to be heavily involved in the trafficking of marijuana and heroin as far away as Chicago he saidThe group has formed alliances with municipal authorities to such an extent that the governor of the state of Guerrero is calling on all 81 mayors in the state and their respective police to be investigatedShortly before the shooting began and the students disappeared Ms Pineda who was in charge of the family services office here was giving a speech in the central square celebrating the years accomplishmentsMexican news reports citing federal intelligence sources said the mayor feared that the students whose school has a history of blocking streets and other militant acts would descend on the square and ordered the police to stop them and teach them a lessonMr Murillo Karam declined to comment on any theory saying that a motive had not been establishedAt a morgue in the state capital forensic investigators are working to identify the remains found on the hill Families of the missing students reel with anguish as they wait to learn if their children were killed in a country where forced disappearances are usually not solvedAt the

roughedged Dallas neighborhood Then his mother boldly moved the family to a leafy suburb 35 miles to the northeastIt was completely my moms idea and I hated it Moore a secondyear Giants defensive end and prospective star said Friday I went from a predominantly black area to a community that was predominantly Caucasian I went from a place where fighting in school was almost an everyday thing to a place where getting in a fight got you suspended and sent to an alternative schoolI felt so out of place and I told my mom over and over I didnt want to be out thereMoores mother Detra Johnson who was 32 at the time had been determined since Moores birth to get her son out of the neighborhood where she and Moores father had been raisedI wanted him to be wellrounded I wanted him to go to school and play sports with everybody not just black people Johnson said The country the business world and college campuses are a mix of people and I wanted him to fit in wherever he wentFor Moore the adjustment to a new city and school Rowlett High was not always easyLots of different rules and new things to learn Moore said Total culture shockHis sports career would also have to wait As a 6foot4 freshman he was a big talented athlete but he did not play a varsity football game until he was a junior and then he was not a starterIt has been eight years since Moore and his mother left DallasLast week at Rowlett High where Moore is known as Tre the teachers were circulating a web link to the NFLs Pro Bowl voting because Moore is on the ballot as a specialteams playerEverybody here loves Tre Rowletts assistant principal Shae Creel said He was a kid who got people to smile A good funloving kid and were very proud of himOn Friday Moore sat outside the Giants locker room absorbing what had been a whirlwind week It began at a news conference on Monday with the Giants general manager Jerry Reese publicly lobbying the coaches to get Moore on the field more oftenGood things seem to happen when hes out there Reese saidNot surprisingly in subsequent days Giants coaches indicated that Moore would most likely have a significant role in Monday nights game against IndianapolisBut the reflective if loquacious Moore was still ruminating about his mothers determined decision making when he was a young teenagerShe worked as a medical assistant and had a second job taking care of athome patients so I could afford what I needed at the time Moore said When I complained about the move she told me I would thank her later And after a year or so I told her that she was right and I appreciated everything she didThere were so many new opportunities The move opened up my eyes to all the places I could go It wasnt the only thing but it was a big stepIt was one of several noteworthy steps for a promising NFL player who turned 22 less than two months agoMoore never lived with both his parents They were never together but they were always on the same page when it came to doing whats best for me Moore said I spent weekends with my dad and lived with him for longer periods sometimes I think my mom wanted to make sure I learned things from him too And he opened up my eyes to the arts and musicIn the Giants locker room or in the weight room Moore is often found singing or dancing he can also be counted on for a prank or twoMy dad made me join a choir because he knew I wanted to sing in public but wasnt going to do it on my own Moore said of his father Damon Moore He encouraged me to develop my creative side and introduced me to origami I spent a lot of enjoyable hours doing that There were many little lessonsAfter games we didnt have the money to go out to dinner like the other kids Some of them offered to pay for my dinner and my dad was the one that taught me to accept their offer once and thats it He said Dont take handouts Work hard so you can pay your own wayEventually Moore earned a starting job at Rowlett but he was recruited by college teams almost by accident A Texas AM coach was watching video of Rowlett wide receiver Marquise Goodwin who is now with the Buffalo BillsAll of a sudden the coach saw Tre chase down someone from sideline to sideline Creel the assistant principal said He said I want to know about that tall kid who can run like thatAt Texas AM Moore quickly became a standout playing with the future NFL star Von Miller whose parents Gloria and Von Sr became surrogates while he was on the AM campusWe told Damontres mom Dont worry about him being away from home  youve got another set of eyes down here Von Miller Sr saidMoore was arrested and accused of marijuana possession the summer before his sophomore seasonI felt terrible for making such a mistake Moore said I felt bad having to tell my coaches but I was terrified to tell my momDetra Johnson had been strict in raising her son forbidding him for example to wear tattoos or an earringI promised my mom that I would learn from what I did wrong and become the mature person she wanted me to be Moore saidJohnson said The thing about Damontre is that he was always the youngest in his group  he graduated from high school at 17 left college at 20  but he was also usually the biggest in his group and because of that people treated him like he was the oldest But he was still just a kidThere have been no significant or embarrassing offthefield episodes sinceDamontre was a smart good kid Von Miller Sr said He just needed better judgment some advice and time to growAfter three productive college seasons and 265 sacks Moore decided to turn professional He was at first considered a topfive pick in the 2013 NFL draft but at the combine he ran one of the slowest times for a defensive end in the 40yard dash surprising for a player who had shown plenty of speed at Texas AM In the benchpress test he again lagged far behind the top prospectsMoore became the poster boy for talented players who squandered their opportunities by not staying in shape for the combine Alarm bells sounded around the NFL and Moore dropped precipitously in the draft rankingsAgain just maturity Miller said He didnt take care of business like he was supposed to do Another life lessonMoore was at the Millers house on the first days of the draft as the first and second rounds went by without his name being calledI turned off the TV and left the room crying Moore said I was so mad I couldnt seeThe Giants took him in the third round the 81st overall pickMy mom told me that God does everything for a reason Moore said I just had to prove myself againMoore got a tattoo over his right rib cage a blue poker chip with an 81 inside itIt means that I went 81st but Im really a bluechip prospect Moore said I got it in the most painful place to get a tattoo because I wanted it to be a painful reminderMoores journey as a Giant has not been all smooth sailing In his rookie year he flashed his pass rushing capabilities and blocked a punt As Reese noted he seemed to create a degree of havoc in the opposing teams backfield but the Giants coaches said they could not count on Moore to consistently stick to his runstopping assignmentsHe also had a shoulder injury that limited his playing time except on special teams where he continued to excelMoore has played more this season but he is still a reserve That could change this week With the Giants defensive line depleted by injuries Moores chance to shine could well be against the passhappy ColtsHes going to be in the playing rotation Coach Tom Coughlin said We all want to see what he can do with the opportunityMoore said it had been difficult to remain patientBut Ive learned that things arent always what they seem and sometimes you have to wait to see whats good for you he said I dont mind When I get out there and do what I can do the surprise will be even greater I like when Im surprised by lifeMoores mother who moved her son against his wishes sees the twists and turns of the last eight years as selffulfillingHes exactly where hes supposed to be Detra Johnson said Its like other parts of life doing the right thing isnt always easy But hes with a nurturing organization and they know what they

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/garden/urban-farming-from-countertop-to-table.html,ST PAUL  Two years ago Elizabeth Millard discovered a way to put fresh produce into car food No shes not the one who smuggled shredded lettuce into the Doritos Cheesy Gordita CrunchFiery a 490calorie zeronoun snack from Taco Bell Rather Ms Millard a sustainable farmer outside the Twin Cities did something even more unlikely she grew a crop of microgreens on the passengerside floor mat of her 2005 VW Beetle convertibleWe were shuttling our box of seeds back and forth from our rented greenhouse space to our house she said the other day And I tripped and they fell all over the place Cress mustards a little purple mizunaMs Millard added Being frustrated and lazy I decided I would clean them up some time in my lifetime Which means neverIt rained the next day Ms Millard now 46 and Karla Pankow her partner in life and in their CSA business called Bossy Acres tracked mud into the car After that the June sun busted loose and they threw down the top I think you can see where this is goingAbout five days after the incident I came out to my car in the morning and there was a beautiful flush carpet of microgreens on the passenger side Ms Millard said It looked like a Chia PetThe accident fed the philosophy behind her new book Indoor Kitchen Gardening Turn Your Home Into a YearRound Vegetable Garden Cool Springs Press This is a howto guide that describes Ms Millards experiments raising crops  sunloving outdoor plants like herbs carrots radishes potatoes and tomatoes  in her Minneapolis bungalowI for one have daydreamed about owning a conservatory a bright climatecontrolled growing space with windows supplemental lights and a handy watering source And here was Ms Millard to tell me that I already possessed such a space and it was called my condoYou dont have to be a plant whisperer to enjoy success in this endeavor Although occasionally you do have to be the bee In a quest for bugless indoor pollination Ms Millard stimulated the tomatos reproductive parts with her electric toothbrush Talk about forbidden fruit But what she discovered and what the book illustrates is that its possible and even easy to cultivate shoots greens and the odd root crop with almost no special equipmentThe VW microgreens did not become the stuff of a piquant salad I cant imagine the carpet of your car is a foodsafe environment Ms Millard said What vinaigrette goes with road salt Instead it became a proof of concept The lesson is Dont worry about it so much Ms Millard said of her indoor garden If the conditions are right it will happenIn many ways the gardening conditions in the northland are best suited to ornamental berries redbarked shrubs and alcoholism The professional eschatologists known elsewhere as meteorologists were predicting scattered frosts for the night after Ms Millard paid me a house call It was early SeptemberThe parsley and sage in my backyard could hang on until Thanksgiving But if I didnt bring the basil inside now I wouldnt see it again until May or JuneWhile I was outside I noticed a volunteer tomato seedling and a stray mint What would be the harm in digging them up and converting them into house pets Ms Millard recommends converting the garage or a threeseason porch into a kind of halfway house where the plants can get acclimatedI asked Ms Millard about what may still be growing at her house across town But she had moved out soon after finishing a draft of the book While she and Ms Pankow shopped for farmland of their own they were dwelling in a downscale version of that VW Microgreen a 25yearold Coachman fifthwheel camper they bought from friends for 2000 The quarters were homey a previous owner had gone through the effort of painting the wallpaperIts surprisingly spacious she said Its like a New York apartmentExcept presumably in New York it would have cost 265 million in an allcash transaction and another 1 million for a parking spotMs Millard has good news for the yardless metropolitan Much of the equipment you need for indoor kitchen gardening is already in the kitchen Sprouts should grow in a Mason jar with a screen lid for air and drainage Soak the seeds Ms Millard likes the flavor of broccoli Then after a day or two turn the jar upside down and waitAre the white filaments edible food or some type of brassica thrush Ms Millard was noncommittal I will sprout things if people ask me to she said But I have not been a huge fanFarther down in the cupboards pie plates or baking sheets make satisfactory planters to grow microgreens or shoots At the start plastic wrap can keep the seeds humid You may even have the shoot seeds in the bulk bin say dried peas raw sunflower seeds or untreated popcornGermination isnt a sign of spoilage its the goal here Ms Millard recommends soaking the seeds for a day or two beforehand changing the water now and again If you leave them longer than that theyll give off a really vile smell she said like burning moldy feet At this point youre not raising food but developing a biological weapons programThe easiest indoor gardening projects look a lot like seedstarting You dont need much dirt an inch and a half for sprouts and maybe half an inch for microgreens a regular lettuce mix harvested early You can do that on a paper towel she said Theyre not going to grow into their fullest expression of what they could be But then who among us hasnt thought about their own dirt nap and harbored the same selfdoubtMs Millard had dragged a full bag of vermiculite as big as a pillowcase up the three flights of stairs This of course was a bit of a sight gag the white filler looks like Styrofoam and weighs no more The idea was to mix it with a bagged organic compost she likes called Cowsmo But any indoor potting mix with a little fertilizer would doYou want something that drains really well Ms Millard said Dirt from your garden is too dense As a nopesticide farmer she welcomed the chance for a clean start Theres a book to be written about how to breed common garden bugs in the house but lets leave that to the newspapers entomology expertMs Millard totes a stack of 20inch black plastic planting flats almost everywhere she goes the same way a real estate agent seems to bleed a trail of lawn signs Get the ones with the bottom watering slits and the translucent lids They are a masterful piece of industrial design they cost about 150 each and they look just like garbageA Pyrex casserole dish makes a smarter display It may help with the drainage to put a low layer of gravel in the bottom Ms Millard said prepping the planter A few handfuls of soil mix flew into the trays She was no more delicate with the pea seeds and the popcorn kernels scattering a single layer over the surface Being housebound they wouldnt need a coat of dirt on topYoull want to sow at the kind of density you would see in front of the stage at Bonnaroo Once the sprouts come up Ms Millard said you could have someone crowd surf without falling inAt this point Ms Millard mentioned a piece of lookforitinthebasement gear a box fan A little airflow helps ward off disease and stiffens a plants resolveMy summer corn crop in the yard had been a mixed success By that I mean it was a success for the squirrels that stripped the stalks clean and a total failure for me who waited 80 days and got nothingDepending on your conditions in here after about two weeks you should be able to harvest them Ms Millard said Cut them like youre giving them the worst haircut in the worldI said I think Ive given someone that haircutMs Millard said I think Ive had that haircutWhat about lights This is the question that every lay agronomist seems to ask Ms Millard said Its as if she has proposed a suspect workaround school without homework say or an affair without text messaging I mean sexMs Millard dutifully runs through the options in the book A window with southern exposure will get you somewhere But the plant will need to be close to the pane where conditions may be drafty Incandescent bulbs give off more heat than light Ms Millard doesnt spend too much time on specialty lighting systems HID LED or plasma This kind of expertise and budget are the province of the marijuana cultivator We have a lot to learn from themUltimately Ms Millard recommends cheap shop lights with fullspectrum bulbs t5 or t8 and reflective hoods The adjustable fixtures are better still You can start them a couple of inches above the newly sprouted seeds and raise them as your plants growWed moved on to planting herbs and root crops Untreated potatoes from the farmers market would turn into suitable plants Just wait for the eyes to form Ms Millard suggested putting five or six in a 15gallon pot They should get some light during the day she said But potatoes do well with the whole benignneglect situation Theyre like children that wayRounded carrots and radishes wouldnt outgrow their Procrustean beds She mentioned French baby carrots carefully bred in France and a favorite radish called Parisienne which had the soul of a carrot Alas indoors they would grow about as fast as the European economy Carrots take forever Ms Millard said About two months if youre luckyIn the end she harvested maybe 10 carrots  not the kind of bounty to run through a juicer When you spend that much time and love she said you slice them up and eat them raw like carpaccioShe wouldnt blame anyone who concluded that indoor kitchen gardening is impractical Theres something of the hobbyist to it she saidBefore I forget then heres a reminder In New York City the outdoor planting date for carrots is only 150 days away,2014-11-06T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/the-cost-of-being-cool/,As the news outletshave proclaimed multiple times yes including The New York Times Brooklyn the birthplace of hipsterdom the epitome of city cool basically the center of the urban universe is over Very over So is its European equivalent the gritty arty BerlinThe artists that made these cities cool are being priced out luxury condos and hotels pop up more often than gallery openings Dunkin Donuts replace local restaurants a JCrew opens among the remaining independent boutiques European tourists flood Brooklyns Williamsburg as American hipsters romp around Berlins Neuklln or Kreuzberg Meanwhile editors chase the next hippest town in the world for the unavoidably viral listicleThe editors will continue to carry out their heated debates and search for the next Williamsburg or the next Berlin candidates for the latter include Warsaw Germanys Leipzig and Estonias Tallinn  but the process begs the question what makes a city cool and is it a good thingIn apiece for The Daily Beast Tom Teodorczuk claims that Manhattans Upper East Side a traditionally uberexpensive stomping ground for the citys elite is the next goto hip area The neighborhood Mr Teodorczuk writes is buzzing thanks to a spate of restaurant bar and retail openings belatedly supplying sting to the once predominantly WASP enclaveBen Adler debunks Mr Teodorczuks claims at Grist listing the criteria for a hip neighborhood The cool kids are attracted to diversity dynamism tolerant liberalism and transit accessibility The Upper East side is still uncool as it always was because it remains mostly populated with rich white people is too expensive for aspiring artists and is too far from the actual happening neighborhoodsIn itslist of Americas coolest cities Forbes weighs entertainment and recreational amenities foodie culture diversity age share of residents between the ages of 20 and 34 and population growth with special regard for influx of new people The winner for 2014 was the nations capital WashingtonBut naming cities cool or even the coolest may not be as innocent as it seemsThe problem with a coolest city ranking is the way it takes things any city ought to be proud of diversity urbanity art energy walkability transit accessibility and attaches them to a polarising sociological identity writes Jordan Fraade at The Guardian Most Americans probably dont have strong opinions about multimodal transit or bicycle infrastructure But they do have strong feelings about snobbish urban hipstersMr Fraade describes the backlash against cool kids in the countrys capital The arguments tend to center ontransportation One battle in DC last year played out over getting rid of parking minimums regulations that require a minimum amount of parking spaces in new buildings with the minimums defenders united by a large serving of disdain for the young people who wanted parking minimums scrappedAnother front is the antibike movement which is so strong in somecities that it has earned its own termbikelashFor some antibikers cyclists are representatives of the gentrifying army of white millennials giving the carversusbike war a class dimensionWhen the focus of city governance shifts away from winning spots on magazine lists and towards useful service provision for as many constituents as possible cool people uncool people and the vast middlingly cool majority the US will finally have the urban renaissance it has been promised writes Mr FraadeAt The New Republic Thomas Rogers also finds branding cities as cool as harmful Over the last 10years Berlins hip factor has become less organic and more aggressively manufactured with even the citys mayor branding it as poor but sexyThis way of talking about cities  upandcoming cool over  is partially the result of a rash of neoliberal reforms that have had a deleterious effect on the way we think about cities over the past two decades Mr Rogers writesIn the 1980s governments started to pull funds from cities which then had to fend for themselves Mr Rogers says competing for investment and attention This race was only exacerbated by globalization and the controversial claim that to have a successful city it needs to attract the creative classThe economic consequences of branding a city as cool are huge experts tell Mr Rogers An influx of a new kind of tourist one that spends a couple of months in a city like Berlin enjoying its hip reputation sometimes working remotely drives up the cost of rent for locals International real estate buyers flock to the city branded as hip Jamie Peck a professor of geography at the University of British Columbia tells Mr Rogers that in a poor city when theres a disparity between the citys income and what foreigners pay for real estate the more locals become a part of a service economy catering to wealthy foreignersAll of these issues become amplified in a city that is branded as the next Berlin which is likely to be smaller with a lessdeveloped cultural scene and cachet says Mr Rogers Ultimately this spedup gentrification may also rob these cities the opportunity to allow their burgeoning art and nightlife scenes to grow and evolveBack in the United States the city of Portland Ore shows what can happen to a city whose reputation grows bigger than its infrastructure and potential for growthIn a piece for The New York Times Magazine Claire Cain Miller writes that Portland has all the perks that economists suggest lead to a high quality of life including the surrounding nature climate and cultural institutions and is also politically open progay rights prolegalization of marijuana in addition to the right of way for unicyclists or the ability to marry in a 247 doughnut shopBut having attracted scores of young educated people Portland became saturated with a generation of overqualified newcomers unable to offer them jobs Between 2000 and 2012 the citys economy grew less than 42 other American cities While people move to New York to be in finance or to Los Angeles to be in show business Aaron Renn an urban affairs analyst tells Ms Miller People move to Portland to move to PortlandEven a report from the states employment agency stated that the average income in Oregon may have been a victim of the states attractiveness and a resulting population influxAnd thus Portland fell into the socalled amenity paradox coined by urban affairs professors at Portland State University to describe cities where the same amenities that attract people end up eroding what made a city desirable in the first placePoor but sexy,2014-10-01T06:12:51Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/movies/at-new-york-film-festival-history-and-detectives.html,With three highprofile mysteries  Inherent Vice Gone Girl and Maps to the Stars  it might seem as though film noir was the dominant flavor of this years New York Film Festival But another theme runs through four selections artist biographies Call it a continental faceoff between North America and EuropeStarting this week the festival brings biopics of the English Romantic painter J M W Turner the French couturier Yves Saint Laurent the 18thcentury German poet Friedrich Schiller and the Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini In each instance a rebellious artistic sensibility coincides with transgressive personal behavior to wreak emotional havocThat said there is nothing in the festival remotely like Inherent Vice Paul Thomas Andersons uproarious screen adaptation of Thomas Pynchons 2009 novel The festivals official centerpiece this comic noirtoendallnoirs is set in 1970 and is suffused with the paranoia of the postCharles Manson era when the hippie dream had entered its terminal phase and American culture seemed adrift in a purple hazeJoaquin Phoenix portrays Doc Sportello a lackadaisical private investigator combing the underbelly of Los Angeles and its environs for two missing persons one of them his exgirlfriend Shasta Katherine Waterston Josh Brolin in a cartoonish flattop haircut portrays Bigfoot Bjornsen a corrupt bullying police officer with a hilarious oral fixation And Martin Short has a small juicy turn as a beadyeyed druggy dentist Reese Witherspoon Benicio Del Toro Owen Wilson and Jena Malone also pop into view Behind it all lurks the menace of a mysterious perhaps imaginary crime cartel known as the Golden FangThe movie creates a surreal vision of a bygone Southern California dense with smog and reeking of marijuana when every street seemed to have its own massage parlor The atmosphere is so steeped in vintage psychedelia that it is impossible to distinguish reality from fantasy it could all be a dream The best approach to Inherent Vice is not to look for profundity but to lie back inhale imaginary clouds of secondhand pot smoke and go with the flow of a yarn so amusingly convoluted it makes The Big Sleep feel like childrens bedtime readingBut while Inherent Vice is one of the high points the honor of the weeks best film belongs to Mike Leighs Mr Turner Its artistic title character who describes himself as a gargoyle is magnificently embodied by Timothy Spall A Calibanlike grotesque who expresses himself in grunts and snorts and has a cavalier attitude toward women Turner is so obsessed with capturing atmospheric detail that as part of his research he lashes himself to the mast of a ship during a blizzardMr Leighs visual palette which has tended toward artfully drab kitchensink realism here explodes into grimy color in cinematography by Dick Pope that evokes the murky hues and textures of Turner canvases The movies procession of gnarly faces and hunched postures suggests a gallery of Dickensian caricatures drawn by HogarthThese are the other films being screened over the next week listed in order of personal preferenceTWO DAYS ONE NIGHT Directed by JeanPierre and Luc Dardenne In the newest film by these Belgian brothers compassion and selfinterest compete neck and neck as a factory worker who has just been fired spends a weekend desperately canvassing her coworkers for votes that would restore her job but would deny them rich bonuses The gripping film follows the worker rivetingly embodied by Marion Cotillard as she knocks on doors and pleads for supportTIMBUKTU Directed by Abderrahmane Sissako Set in the ancient Malian city of the title which is under siege by Islamic fundamentalists Timbuktu is a breathtakingly beautiful heartbreaking study of a settled tribal culture overrun by jihadists intent on establishing Sharia law They arrive armed to the teeth and lay down new prohibitions  no sports no music and no uncovered women  with infractions punishable by death The jarring contrast between the residents and the occupiers prowling the area with flashlights and guns offers a tragic vision of a spartan desert paradise facing extinctionSAINT LAURENT Directed by Bertrand Bonello Divine decadence has rarely looked as scarily seductive as in the second biopic this year about Yves Saint Laurent the French couturier who died in 2008 Starring the willowy Gaspard Ulliel as the designer this glamorous mess of a film hopscotches through Saint Laurents glory years culminating in the 1976 Russianinspired collection depicted in a multiple splitscreen format reminiscent of Saint Laurents Mondrian period The movie though gorgeous wears out its welcome in scenes in which Helmut Berger plays Saint Laurent as an old manBELOVED SISTERS Directed by Dominik Graf This panoramic 170minute historical drama focuses on the fraught mnage  trois involving Friedrich Schiller Florian Stetter Charlotte von Lengefeld Henriette Confurius whom he married and her sister Caroline Hannah Herzsprung with whom he had a secret affair Schiller is a smoothtalking opportunistic charmer but the heart of the film is the bond between siblings whose relationship is fractured by passionHEAVEN KNOWS WHAT Directed by Josh and Benny Safdie Adapted from an unpublished memoir by its star Arielle Holmes this raw streetlevel portrait of homeless heroin addicts dares you to turn away Its view of addicts scuffling to survive in Manhattan while trying to balance relationships in the face of their drug cravings is marginally sympathetic Ms Holmess alter ego Harley is so besotted with a fellow addict Ilya Caleb Landry Jones that she obeys when he orders her to slash her wrists The abrasive tone is established by Isao Tomitas soundtrack which translates Debussy into harsh rollerrink electronicaTHE WONDERS Directed by Alice Rohrwacher This complicated not always coherent second movie by Ms Rohrwacher observes a family transplanted from Germany to an Italian farm where they turn their backs on modern civilization and eke out a living as beekeepers Fourteenyearold Gelsomina Maria Alexandra Lungu the eldest of four daughters enters the family in a tacky realitytelevision contest The juxtaposition of modern and traditional ways evokes Antonioni Fellini and especially Ermanno Olmis The Tree of Wooden ClogsPASOLINI Directed by Abel Ferrara In kaleidoscopic biographical montage Willem Dafoe plays Pier Paolo Pasolini the Italian director who was murdered in 1975 The film set on the final day of his life suggests that the killers were homophobic street thugs and not as the police concluded a lone hustler he had picked up that night Pasolinis preference for rough trade is presented as just one manifestation of his vehement rejection of bourgeois values We witness an interview in which Pasolini condemns the entire Italian social system as based on greed and destruction The weirdest scene is a dramatization of a potential film whose characters attend a bisexual orgy and watch a comet signaling the birth of the MessiahTHE PRINCESS OF FRANCE Directed by Matas Pieiro The fifth movie by this Argentine filmmaker is a clever but weightless divertissement with a highbrow gloss built around the preparation of a radio production of Loves Labours Lost that is a pastiche of Shakespeare,2014-09-30T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/new-york-today-the-living-wage-law-expands/,Updated 1052 am  Good cloudy Tuesday morning to you Mayor de Blasio is expected to sign an executive order to expand the living wage law today a move he promised to make months ago The law covers thousands of previously exempt employers and raises the hourly wage itself Whos affected Living wage laws set a higher minimum wage for employers that receive government subsidies The expansion affects employees of commercial tenants on projects receiving more than 1 million from the city including retailers fastfood restaurants and construction contractors  How many The current living wage law reaches only about 1200 workers the administration estimates the expanded law will benefit an estimated 18000 over the next five years How much The hourly wage goes from 1030 to 1150 for workers who receive benefits Workers who dont get benefits receive 1313 up from 1190  Why Its part of the de Blasio administrations goal to tackle inequality If the mayor can successfully match the minimum wage to the living wage all hourly workers in the city will earn more than 15 by 2019 according to projections  Why now Mr de Blasio promised to expand the living wage by February but failed to follow through drawing criticismHe later explained that his administration initially planned only to expand the law to cover more workers not raise the wage itselfBut the conversation about an increased minimum wage at the state and national level led his administration to consider a bigger overhaul the mayor

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/us/colorados-perceived-left-turn-puts-governor-in-tight-race.html,JULESBURG Colo   When a Democratic mayor and former brewpub owner named John W Hickenlooper was elected governor four years ago he did it with support from voters like Mark Turner Mr Turner is a gun dealer a smalltown politician in eastern Colorado and an avowed enemy of partisan labels  Just call me an American he says He liked Mr Hickenloopers wonky centrism and positive campaigning styleBut now as Mr Hickenlooper slogs through an increasingly tough reelection battle he is spending lots of time answering criticism from voters like Mr Turner that he has steered a swing state too far to the left Mr Turner especially detested a state law passed over unanimous Republican opposition that limited ammunition magazines to 15 roundsI am the protector of my home he told the governor who had stopped at the Julesburg Cafe in this northeastern Colorado town for a vanilla malted Why cant I have the right to protect my family with a 30round magazineIve had this discussion a hundred times Mr Hickenlooper told Mr Turner and reeled off data about the prevalence of highcapacity magazines in mass shootings and said they played a scant role in homedefense cases He pointed out that his own security detail was not armed with large magazines Mr Turner gave a tight grin unpersuadedI voted for him he said Right now Im kind of on the bubbleSo is the governor Four years after vaulting over a divided Republican field in a threeway election Mr Hickenloopers approval ratings and political fortunes have been clouded over amid missteps and a torrent of advertisements attacking his record and leadership A loss in November would raise doubts about the durability of recent Democratic gains in a state that has legalized marijuana and passed tough new gun laws but also drubbed two guncontrol supporters out of elected office and recoiled at raising taxes to fund schoolsRecent polls show Mr Hickenlooper locked in a tight contest with the Republican nominee Bob Beauprez a former congressman and bison rancher who lost his last bid for governor by 17 points Conservative groups are hammering Mr Hickenlooper as a faltering leader and some independent voters are questioning whether to support him againFrom the start of the race Mr Hickenlooper has vowed not to turn to negative advertising a move that may be hurting himThe other sides out there trying to convince people that our policies didnt work that Im indecisive Mr Hickenlooper said in an interview As a rebuttal he pointed to a bustling startup scene in Denver and described how his administration had worked tirelessly to rebuild mountain roads swept away by floods last year Thats indecisive he saidThe narrowing race has surprised political analysts who predicted that Mr Hickenloopers affable style and consensusbuilding approach would help him brush off Republican challenges Conservative voters  even those who want to oust him  say he seems goodhearted and genuine He is presiding over a growing economy And he earned high marks from many Coloradans after guiding the state through a relentless string of fires floods and shootingsBut Republicans are attacking Mr Hickenloopers leadership away from disasters and emergencies saying he has been weak on making tough decisionsThey have homed in on the case of a deathrow inmate named Nathan Dunlap a convicted killer whose fate has become intertwined with the governor Last May three months before Mr Dunlap was to be executed for killing four people at a restaurant in 1993 he received a temporary reprieve from Mr Hickenlooper The order fell short of clemency and is only valid so long as Mr Hickenlooper is in officeMr Hickenloopers decision angered victims family members including Bob and Marjorie Crowell whose daughter Sylvia was killed by Mr Dunlap Mrs Crowell said the reprieve was cowardly and represented a can kicked down the roadThe Beauprez campaign and the Republican Governors Association have both run advertisements excoriating Mr Hickenlooper for his decision saying that Governor Hickenlooper stood in the way of justice Mr Beauprez said he would start the clock on Mr Dunlaps execution if he is electedEmotionally potent as the issue may be only a handful of voters in recent polls cited it as a top priority compared with the economy health care and educationFor Mr Hickenlooper the Dunlap decision was a difficult way station on an evolution toward opposing the death penalty He had pored over studies on mass shootings to decide whether to support the gunmagazine limits as the guncontrol debate stirred the Capitol and he read through court documents talked with victims families and studied death rows costs and history as he considered how to deal with Mr Dunlap and with his broader stance on capital punishmentBut the way he has explained his actions has left him vulnerable on these issues On the death penalty he has said that if he fails to win reelection he might consider granting full clemency to Mr Dunlap The comment was an unaired part of a CNN interview that became public through a conservative bloggers openrecords requestAnd on gun control a video of a meeting Mr Hickenlooper had with Colorado sheriffs who felt their concerns had been sidelined during the gun debate also become campaign fodder after it was posted online by a conservative group in June In the video Mr Hickenlooper said one member of his staff had made a commitment to sign the ammunition magazine limits if they passed and to be honest no

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/26/us/ap-car-nascar-tony-stewart-.html,HUNTERSVILLE NC   For Tony Stewart there was no greater joy than escaping his everyday life and climbing behind the wheel of a sprint car He loves the feel the way they drive the purity he finds at all the tiny dirt tracks across the countryWhen he broke his leg racing his sprint car a year ago an injury that sidelined him for six months he was almost defiant in his desire to never give up his hobby But after the death of Kevin Ward Jr who was killed when Stewarts car struck him as Ward walked on an upstate New York dirt track on Aug 9 Stewart may never get back in a sprint carI would say its going to be a long time before you ever see me in a sprint car again if ever I dont have any desire at this moment to get back in a car Stewart told The Associated Press in his first interview since a grand jury decided he would not be charged in Wards deathIf I had the option to go right now to a race I wouldnt I dont even know when Ill go to a sprint car race again to watch I can promise you its going to be a long time before you ever see me back in oneSitting on his couch Thursday night in his Huntersville North Carolina home a sprint car race in Arkansas was on mute on his television Stewarts eyes were constantly drawn to the action He cant help himself Its where he came from how he made his name and the one form of racing he simply couldnt walk away from even as he was criticized for jeopardizing his lucrative NASCAR career by messing around in the dirtHe just couldnt give it up Not when he became a multimillionaire and one of NASCARs biggest names not after good friend Jason Leffler was killed in a sprint car race last year and not after his own injury led to three surgeries a month in bed and forced him to miss NASCAR races for the first time in his careerStewart is addicted to the simplicity of sprint car racing to racing at venues across the country where the crowd is starving for gimmickfree racing He didnt care that a field full of drivers of varying ages and talent were racing for purses that rarely reach 5000He made it his goal to give back to the sprint car community at every turn especially after his accident He improved the part that broke and caused his broken leg and spent 110000 on firesuits and helmets for nearly 50 drivers who needed updated safety equipmentStewart even paid for the embroidery on the firesuits His only request That his Tony Stewart Racing logo be placed in a position that would not be noticed during interviewsStewart has been grappling with the decision to leave sprint racing since his 2013 crash at an Iowa dirt track Hed only returned to sprint car racing one month before Wards deathIts hurt for 16 months to sit and be scrutinized for it said Stewart and to try to give back to a sport that you love and every time you turn around youve got to constantly defend yourself for doing something and trying to support something that you believe in and care aboutChuck Miller race director and President of the Empire Super Sprints series that Stewart and Ward were racing in that night understands how Stewart feels but believes it would be a blow to sprint car racing if he never returnedI do hope that somewhere down the line hell reconsider Miller told AP There arent many drivers of his stature that have done what hes been able to do for all of motorsports and especially sprint car racing Hes been able to win races at all levels of the sport including almost every sprint sanctioningStewart a threetime NASCAR champion spent three weeks in seclusion at his Indiana home after Wards death and describes those weeks as the darkest of his lifeOn the advice of legal counsel Stewart would not describe what he remembers about the crash at Canandaigua Motorsports Park but insists what happened was 100 percent an accidentWard and Stewart had been racing for position when Ward crashed exited his vehicle and walked down the dark track in an apparent attempt to confront Stewart A toxicology report found Ward also had marijuana in his systemWards family has said the matter is not at rest and Stewart may still face a civil lawsuit Stewart wants to discuss the accident and said not being able to talk about what happened keeps me from moving forward It just stays there hanging over my headIts just been a really tough six weeks I went to go have fun for a night and thats not what ended up happeningWard and Stewart didnt know each other and Stewart doesnt recall them ever talking He laments that in the scrutiny that followed  some questioned if Stewart had tried to intimidate Ward for stepping on the track  that the loss of the 20yearold driver and his promising career fell to the background He said he cant imagine how the Ward family is feeling doesnt blame them for anything they may say about him but hopes to someday get the chance to sit with them and talk about that nightI would hope they understand  maybe they do maybe they dont maybe they never will  that I do care he said Ive tried to be respectful of their process of grieving and not push myself on them Im sure they have things that they want to know what happened and I think its important for them at some point to hear it from my pointStewart believes his past  previous eruptions have included him throwing a helmet at another car shouting and shoving matches and sharply worded dressing downs  has played heavily into how the public has viewed Wards death But he doesnt believe he has a problem with anger and did not have a problem with Ward that eveningAnger had nothing to do with what happened that night Stewart said I wasnt angry with anything or anybodyHe is back at NASCAR events after missing three racesBut when not at the track he barely leaves his house A day feels like a month His mind wanders his emotions get the best of himAt stake now is a streak of a winning at least one race every year of his Sprint Cup career and Stewart has just eight more chances this season to get to Victory Lane Its a mark he can focus on to help his healing and he insists his heart and his head are up to the challengeIf it doesnt happen it doesnt happen Theres going to be a lot bigger things at the end of my life that are going to matter more than my Cup career he said But youve got to have goals youve got to have something to push for youve got to have a reason we do thisIts nice to have something to focus on again,2014-09-26T04:04:44Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/us/for-Jihad-recruits-a-pipeline-from-Minnesota-to-militancy.html,MINNEAPOLIS   It was a friendship that began in high school and ended in militant jihadAs Minnesota teenagers growing up in the 1990s Troy Kastigar and Douglas McAuthur McCain shared almost everything They played pickup basketball on neighborhood courts wrote freewheeling raps in each others bedrooms and posed together for snapshots a skinny white young man with closecropped hair locking his arm around his AfricanAmerican friend with a shadow of a mustacheThey walked parallel paths to trouble never graduating from high school and racking up arrests They converted to Islam around the same time and exalted their new faith to family and friends declaring that they had found truth and certainty One after the other both men abandoned their American lives for distant battlefieldsThis is the real Disneyland Mr Kastigar said with a grin in a video shot after he joined Islamist militants in Somalia in late 2008 Mr McCain wrote on Twitter this past June after he left the United States to fight with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria Im with the brothers nowToday both are dead While their lives ended five years and over 2000 miles apart their intertwined journeys toward militancy offer a sharp example of how the allure of Islamist extremism has evolved enticing similar pools of troubled pliable young Americans to conflicts in different parts of the world The tools of online propaganda and shadowy networks of facilitators that once beckoned Mr Kastigar and Somali men to the Horn of Africa are now drawing hundreds of Europeans and about a dozen known Americans to fight with ISIS according to American law enforcement and counterterrorism officialsTroy and Doug fit together in some ways Mr Kastigars mother Julie Boada said at her home here Theyre both converted Muslims They both have had struggles She added Theyre connected through thatInvestigators are looking into what led a handful of other people from Minnesota to follow the same path said Kyle Loven an FBI spokesman in Minneapolis American intelligence and counterterrorism officials say Mr McCain 33 and a second American believed to have been killed while fighting for ISIS traveled in the same circles in Minneapolis and knew each otherOfficials still have not publicly confirmed the identity of that man but he has widely been reported to be a Somali immigrant in his late 20s who went by at least two names calling himself Abdirahmaan Muhumed on his Facebook page He spent much of his life around Minneapolis worked at the airport over several years and ended up in Syria this year declaring in a text message to a friend With out jihad there is no islamTo law enforcement officials and community leaders here the pathway for many recruits remains murky and difficult to uncover but the latest wave of volunteers is a chilling replay of recent history Beginning in 2007 over 20 men mostly of Somali origin left Minnesota to join the Shabab militants who seized territory across Somalia and besieged the capital MogadishuThe radicalization of the men prompted federal investigations and brought enormous scrutiny to the Somali population in Minneapolis the largest in America Estimates put Minnesotas Somali population around 30000 As Shabab forces withdrew from Mogadishu under pressure from African forces supported by the United States people here held antiShabab rallies and prosecutors eventually won convictions against eight local men on charges stemming from the flow of money and recruits to the militantsBut now leaders in the Somali community say they worry they are losing a battle to keep another round of young people from turning to another Internetsavvy and brutal group ISIS Community leaders say several families have reported that their children have vanishedWe need to open our eyes said Ahmed Hirsi a banker who has led youth groups in the Twin Cities This is not going to stopOfficials say ISIS is not specifically targeting Somalis but is instead using social media chat rooms and jihadist forums to recruit men and women susceptible to its message  a target audience that includes Somalis in Minneapolis Community activists and a friend said one Somali was Mr Muhumed whom they described as a mostly secular man in his late 20s or early 30s whose family had emigrated from Mogadishu He always seemed more interested in working out and basketball than in religion acquaintances saidHe would talk about LeBron James and Kobe Bryant and then the next thing you know  pfft  hes gone Mr Hirsi saidFarhan Abdullahi Hussein said he had met Mr Muhumed when they worked at the MinneapolisSt Paul International Airport Patrick Hogan an airport spokesman said a man named Abdifatah Ahmed an alias Mr Muhumed had used had worked there on and off from November 2001 until May 2011 refueling planes and cleaning Shirwa Ahmed an ethnic Somali who blew himself up in a suicide bombing in Somalia in October 2008 also had a job at the airport pushing passengers in wheelchairsMr Hussein who described Mr Muhumed as my best friend said Mr Muhumed used to fume about violence in Libya and Gaza asking Is this fair Mr Muhumed dreamed of joining the Ogaden National Liberation Front a rebel group trying to carve out an independent state in Ethiopia for ethnic Somalis When he drank Mr Hussein said Mr Muhumeds anger boiled up Once at a shopping center popular with Somalis he even punched a community advocate named Abdi Abdulle who had spoken out against the groups violent tacticsHe always wanted to be a freedom fighter Mr Hussein said He always wanted to be a heroIn April Mr Muhumed sent Mr Hussein a text message saying jihad was his path now God gave us jihad he wrote On July 8 he sent a short message celebrating the Islamic holy month It was the last Mr Hussein heard from himMr McCain and Mr Kastigar grew up in a different world from the towering apartment complexes and rows of Somali barbershops and restaurants that were a backdrop for Mr Muhumeds life But they found a passion for Islam and ultimately a path to militancyTraces of the friendship between Mr Kastigar and Mr McCain are bound up in a few photo albums in Ms Boadas home In one they wear nearly identical plaid shirts This is how relatives say they want to remember them Mr Kastigar as an energetic openminded boy who climbed up walls and Mr McCain as someone who made music and fiercely loved his younger sister LeleThey had a similar sense of humor Ms Boada said of the men In his teenage years Mr Kastigar began drinking smoking marijuana and failing classes and Ms Boada said she had seen a sadness and a darkness settle over him He dropped out of high school got his equivalency diploma and worked at a mortgage office or cutting hair But he was often unemployed And a series of arrests compounded his troubles finding work Ms Boada saidMr McCain whose family moved from Chicago when he was young attended Robbinsdale Cooper High School with Mr Kastigar until 1999 then switched to Robbinsdale Armstrong High for a year the district said He never graduated Court records show he was arrested several times for driving violations theft and a marijuana chargeWhile both men converted to Islam around 2004 it is unclear whether one mans religious decisions steered the others Hatim Bilal a high school friend who comes from a Muslim family said Mr Kastigar had told him that Mr Bilals family and the cohesion among Mr Bilals brothers inspired him to convert A spark returned to Mr Kastigars eyes after he discovered his new faith his mother saidThey just wanted to be a part of something said Mr Bilal who knew both men but was close to Mr Kastigar They were just trying to find something that just accepted them for who they wereBut problems persisted Mr Kastigar was crestfallen when after training to become an Xray technician he was told that his criminal history would make it difficult for him to get a job in the fieldIn 2008 Mr Kastigar told his mother that he was going to Kenya to study the Quran He bought a oneway ticket and left that November He spoke with Ms Boada five times telling her that he was eating well and helping people He was killed in September 2009 at age 28Mr Kastigars death may have shaken Mr McCain friends and relatives said Around 2009 Mr McCain moved to San Diego where he had relatives and worked at a Somali restaurant according to a cousin Don Urbina He enrolled at San Diego City College a college spokesman saidMr Urbina said the family was shocked at his decision to join a jihadist group that has beheaded two American journalists and massacred thousands of Syrians and IraqisAlicia Adams a high school friend of Mr McCains who last spoke to him in 2013 said his faith was such a small piece of who he was adding He was still Doug But Mr Urbina described his cousin as very serious about GodHis mother doesnt know how it got to this point he said None of us really want to knowMs Boada said she still did not know exactly how her son had ended up in Somalia hoisting an assault rifle and wearing a checkered head scarf She said he had never been motivated by hate but by a belief that somehow he could be a hero Sometimes she said people will ask her about his death But more often than not she does not discuss itI just dont tell people she said I just say that my son passed away in 2009 If someone asks why I just say It was a tragedy,2014-09-07T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/the-bud-light-ification-of-bud.html,There are many things that bother Jon Cooper about the market for marijuanaIts nearly impossible to find a consistent product said Cooper one of the legion of tech startup guys and MBAs plunging into the world of pot You go into a dispensary and buy something called Sour Diesel and try it You go to another dispensary buy Sour Diesel and its a different experience You go back to the first dispensary buy it again and its not the same eitherDespite the inconsistency nobody doubts marijuanas popularity as a consumer product 38 percent of Americans admit to having tried it and 7 percent use it on a regular basis But for decades it has been produced and sold primarily on the black market which has only recently developed shades of gray and whiteThis has wrenched the ancient psychotropic substance into the machinery of 21stcentury consumer capitalism  with all the consultants marketers brand advisers and scientists that come with it A joint might never be as easy to access as a can of beer or a cigarette But thousands of people and millions of dollars are hard at work to make it as predictable and dependable as one Call it the Bud Lightification of budTheres a pressing economic reason for the pot industry to get better if it is to survive aside from its formidable legal challenges The plant is relatively cheap and easy to grow and not complicated to process either Left to the whims of the open market  meaning ignoring taxes and regulations  the price of a joint could plummet to the price of a tea bag or a packet of sugar So how will investors help the market mature while still making moneyThe market for marijuana is nothing like the market for corn or wine or tobacco  at least not yet  and the reasons start in the ground Marijuana growing and processing is downright bushleague compared to modern American agribusiness Much of the pot produced in the United States still comes from illegal or semilegal grow sites even given the surge of production and processing in states with recreational or medicinal laws And strains remain understudied and underanalyzed compared with the wheat in your cereal or even the marigolds in your gardenThe inefficiencies continue to pile up after the harvest Marijuana has to be cured then trimmed before it is sold and much of this work is still done by hand Workers use scissors to cut away tough outer leaves and expose the smokable part of the plant Its a laborintensive process the kind that in other instances is completed by a machine like a thresher or a cotton ginAlready the booming industry has started ironing things out Growers House a Tucsonbased indoor gardening center offers a wide variety of mechanical trimmers on its website At the low end for a few hundred dollars they resemble salad spinners studded with blades on the high end they look more like propane grills One of these the Triminator 17900 can process 18 pounds of material in an hour  90 times faster than handtrimming by the companys own estimatePeter Adams the executive director of Rockies Venture Club an investment group that is researching the cannabis industry thinks numbers like that mean an inevitable plunge in the price of pot People selling the ancillary products wont see that Adams said Youre still going to have the same cost for LEDs soil heating ventilation air conditioning those thingsWith costs and prices falling producers might try to scramble up the value chain complicating or sophisticating their offerings to get an edge Why sell nail polish when you can sell French manicures More to the point why sell cornmeal when you can sell Doritos There theyre going to have to do a better job of luring and keeping customers if they want to midwife pot into the great big American consumer market where consistency is kingCrack open a can of Bud Light then another and another The beers should taste identical Try the same with a McDonalds hamburger a Marlboro red a stick of Wrigleys gum or even a glass of namebrand middlemarket wine Unless something has gone terribly wrong it should feel as if you were sipping or smoking or eating the exact same product again and again and againIn spite of marijuanas significant popularity there is still an element of roulette when it comes to smoking a legal joint or eating a legal brownie Federal law does not require companies to test for and disclose levels of the drugs active ingredients like tetrahydrocannabinol Federal law does not hold that pot is legal after all Many dispensaries and producers fail to test for potency contaminants or mold And different states have different disclosure laws with different levels of efficacy As such a gram of AK47 bought in an Oakland dispensary might affect you differently than a gram of the same purchased in Colorado As Cooper pointed out What is AK47 supposed to be anywayCoopers lament also applies to the realm of edibles where marijuana oils and snacks can vary wildly in quality and potency A recent study by The Denver Post for instance revealed large disparities between the amount of THC stated on an edible items package and what the product actually contained Usually the problem was underdosing One chocolate Star Barz had 037 milligrams of the drugs main psychoactive component when it had been advertised as having 100 milligramsUnder a commercial system the rules could be a lot tighter said Mark Kleiman of the University of California Los Angeles an adviser to Washington StateRight now you have some products where youre supposed to eat say an eighth of a cookie Whos going to take a circular cookie and geometrically divide that friable object into eighthsSensing the opportunity for something more predictable Cooper and his partner at Ebbu a Colorado pot startup are creating a variety of predosed products  like prerolled joints or little Listerinestyle strips They have eschewed the silly strain names instead labeling their products highenergy relaxed bliss create and gigglesLauren Ely a librarian from Erie Colo is working on a startup called DisposaBowls  prepacked disposable ceramic pipesI joke around and tell everyone Im the old fat Nancy Botwin she said referring to the character from the Showtime show Weeds She said that she hoped the product would appeal to experienced smokers looking for a convenient way to bring the product with them while they go on a hike for example But she also saw it as a good way to introduce novices seniors and medicinal smokers to pot with gentle predictable resultsThe legal pressure on even legitimate marijuana businesses helps to explain much of the immaturity by scaring away capital both monetary and human The industry until now has mostly been made up of potheads and lawbreakers after all But the investors I spoke with said that pitches have gotten better and money has been rushing in tooDespite the potential many investors are still hesitating at spending the money that might make joints and brownies less ad hoc more corporate Why spend 20 million on a grow site that might be shut down or a new brand that might get stamped out by the next administrations Justice Department A surfeit of laws  and confusion between them  is holding the market backIts a little bit like Alice in Wonderland said Adams of

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/09/24/sports/golf/24reuters-golf-pga-doping.html,LOS ANGELES   Golfers who are policed by an antidoping code on the PGA Tour that is viewed by critics as too opaque will have to adapt to a much more transparent program if they qualify to compete at the 2016 Olympic GamesUnlike the International Golf Federation IGF which will administer golfs reappearance as an Olympic sport after an absence of more than a century the PGA Tour is not a signatory to the code implemented by the World AntiDoping Agency WADAConsequently players who hope to represent their countries at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games will have to be educated on the significant differences between the PGA Tours policy and its prohibited list of substances versus that promulgated by WADAWhats going to be key is a full understanding of the differences how that impacts a clean player and making sure a clean player has an opportunity to be successful United States AntiDoping Agency USADA chief Travis Tygart told ReutersThe WADA code has things like the beta2s agonists that are used to treat asthma and other pulmonary disorders that are going to be different than what the current PGA Tour list looks likeSo we are going to have a full and fruitful opportunity to educate those athletes that may fall under our jurisdiction just like we do with the NBA National Basketball Association players who come in to play in the OlympicsThat schooling of players bidding to make it to Rio for the 2016 Games will not be restricted to the United StatesThe IGF is already working with the Tours PGA Tour European Tour LPGA etc to educate players on the IGF antidoping policy an IGF spokesman told Reuters This activity will continue and increase as we get closer to Rio 2016Almost 70 percent of USADAs drug testing is conducted outofcompetition and requires athletes to notify their whereabouts on a daily basis something PGA Tour players have never been required to doAll those players in the US at least are going to fall under the USADA program going into Rio said TygartAnd 67 percent of our testing on an annual basis is done outofcompetition and that means athletes provide us with details of where they are going to be so that we can locate them for testingIve seen golfers saying they havent been tested outofcompetition or they havent had blood testing so there are some key differences between the codes but none of them are insurmountableBIGGEST DIFFERENCEPerhaps the biggest difference between the PGA Tours antidoping policy and the more established one set forth by WADA relates to transparencyUSADA responsible for implementing WADAs code in the US prides itself on independence and transparency while the PGA Tour is alone among the major North American professional sports bodies in not disclosing fines or suspensions for conductIn the event of a positive doping test the PGA Tour says it will disclose details after the entire appeals and challenges process is completed though it is not required to do so in cases involving Drugs of Abuse socalled recreational drugsAsked how the PGA Tour responded to suggestions that it fall in line with the other major professional sports leagues and become fully transparent executive vicepresident Ty Votaw told Reuters These suggestions are nothing new and our responses to those suggestions have been consistentWe are comfortable with how we handle performance enhancing drug violations versus substances of abuseSince the PGA Tour launched its antidoping program in 2008 only one player has been suspended for a violation American journeyman Doug Barron who was banned for a year in November 2009 for taking a performanceenhancing drugMatt Every was suspended by the PGA Tour for three months during his rookie season in 2010 but that was for conduct unbecoming a professional after he and two others were arrested on misdemeanor charges of marijuana possession in IowaThe charges were later dropped but the PGA Tour suspension which was announced by Everys management company remained in placeGolf appears to be largely unaffected by performanceenhancing drugs where it is difficult to view any advantage that might be gained but there had been widespread calls for the sports governing bodies to put drug testing in placeThe National Center for Drug Free Sport administers testing on the PGA Tour virtually every week of the season with all samples analyzed by WADAaccredited laboratoriesPerhaps the brightest spotlight on the PGA Tours antidoping policy was cast inadvertently in July when bighitting American Dustin Johnson announced that he had taken a leave of absence from golf to seek help for personal challengesSWIRLING RUMOURSRumors immediately swirled about Johnsons lifestyle prompted by a Golfcom article that citing an unnamed source alleged that the American had been suspended by the tour for six months after a third failed drug test and a second for cocaineThe PGA Tour which had initially issued a statement saying it did not comment on rumors or speculation released another statement a few hours later saying that Johnson had taken a voluntary leave of absence and had not been suspendedCommissioner Tim Finchem has repeatedly outlined over the years the reasons why the PGA Tour opts not to disclose details of fines and suspensionsOne we dont feel like people really care that much Finchem said We dont get emails from fans saying Why dont you tell us So we dont think theres this hunger for that informationTwo candidly we dont have that much of it and we dont want to remind people about itIf we had a problem of any magnitude if we had a conduct problem if we were faced with any significant issues where a player is not showing integrity or respect for the game we might have a very different attitudeFor USADA chief Tygart transparency is a prized commodity in the world of antidopingUSADA was founded on independence and transparency and we think thats a core principle of why we exist he saidIt completely ends rumor and speculation and it provides a significant deterrent for current players and also future generations of players when they see if an athlete cheats the rules apply regardless of the stature of that athleteFrom our end you cant replace independence and transparency Its one of the critical elements of having an overall

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/fashion/sebastien-lagrees-megaformer-machines-put-the-sweat-in-pilates.html,On a recent afternoon Sebastien Lagree knelt down and plucked a spring rigged up to an elliptical machine He climbed aboard the Frankensteinian creation one of many scattered about the Burbank Calif headquarters of his company Lagree Fitness which occupies a warehouse that brings to mind a mad scientists labOn these machines here Im experimenting having a mix of static and variable tension he said pedaling slowly Its like out there to drive cars you have gas diesel and electricity Think about another way of powering a car thats clean energy thats abundant its the perfect kind of energy you want Thats what Im working onThis is how Mr Lagree spends many of his days toying with tension and figuring out how to better use it in a piece of exercise equipment he invented the Megaformer the basis of a coreburning workout that blends Pilates cardio and strength training A wobbly carriage that can be pushed and pulled lunged on and squatted down to the machine challenges those atop it in ways that traditional Pilates may notIt brings to Pilates what Pilates was lacking said Amanda Freeman founder of the New Yorkbased Megaformer studio SLT which stands for Strengthen Lengthen Tone I always wanted to do Pilates but I felt like I needed to do another workout after I didnt sweatOver the last 13 years Mr Lagree has built something of an empire He has sold thousands of machines which cost upward of 7000 each to the more than 250 fitness studios that license his method With the promise of sculpturing lean long muscles his workout has attracted celebrity devotees including Sofa Vergara and Kim Kardashian Even Michelle Obama is a fanThis workout is really intense and works so many different muscles at the same time Ms Vergara wrote in an email She bought her own Megaformer last year and uses it four to five times a week she wrote I love it because it works out muscles I didnt even know I hadBut Mr Lagree exhibits none of the rahrah enthusiasm of a typical fitness guru He is a former aspiring actor who took up personal training to pay the bills I thought being a personal trainer was worse than being a car salesman and calls his success something of a fluke He also hasnt worked out in a year You have to understand that Im a lazy guy he said Nothing here happened because I masterminded itMr Lagree 41 was born in France and raised on a farm an hour east of Paris He got into working out as a teenager when he realized his video game habits werent helping his waistline or his viability with women After his parents divorced he moved to Oregon with his mother and found himself drawn into the cult of fitness here spending 40 hours a week lifting weights taking aerobics classes and swimmingWhen I was in my 20s fitness was my religion he said Golds Gym was my church and I went praying three times a dayMr Lagree studied business and marketing at Portland State University and received a masters in business administration from Seattle University He also modeled on the side For one photo shoot he posed in a loincloth and held a bow and arrow up to the air long blond hair cascading down his back The effect is part Greek god part FabioIt just spoke to me in a way that nothing else had Mr Lagree said of the photo which he adapted for his companys logo It gave me a sense of purpose It gave me the idea of going to HollywoodWhile he got plenty of attention from paparazzi who thought he was the Italian model Fabio Lanzoni I cut my hair because of it Mr Lagree said acting gigs didnt materialize At the suggestion of a friend he applied to be a personal trainer at Angel City Gym in West Hollywood Calif and was thrust into teaching Pilates a form of exercise he had never heard ofI thought this was the biggest scam ever he said I come from a background that physical fitness needs to be exertive you need to sweat you need to be soreSo Mr Lagree riffed on traditional Pilates moves and developed a workout that made him in his words a sensation overnightHe lost his job at the gym after the owner accused him of sleeping with clients Mr Lagree said that happened once it was not a rule and branched off on his own opening a studio in the living room of his West Hollywood apartment in 2001While Mr Lagree wanted to improve on the traditional Pilates reformer from the start  Its like a wooden wheel how do you make that into something more interesting he said his booming baritone dripping with sarcasm  the idea for manufacturing his own equipment came in 2003 He maxed out 15 credit cards to pay 150000 for a prototype of the Proformer the Megaformers predecessor Two years later he had enough new machines to replace the old ones His clients balked at the design but a glowing writeup from the website Daily Candy brought in a trove of new business and the Lagree method started its march from Los Angeles to the rest of the worldHis rise hasnt been without obstacles He ended up marrying and quickly divorcing the client from the gym for whom he made that onetime exception they have two children together He lost his sprawling Melrose Avenue studio to his second wife Carrie Minter in their divorce last year She now runs it under the name Carries Pilates Plus He claims some licensees and others are blatantly copying the design of his machines which carry two patents and plans to sue them once his pending patents are approvedBut Mr Lagree swats off these annoyances like so many gnats as he forges ahead Showing off the latest versions of his Megaformers  each model has a clinical name the M2 the M3 the Iformer  he spoke about robotic arms and handles that move electronically Hes developing a suit with sensors that light up and buzz when the wearer flubs up his form during a workout Hes working on a book about his experience with exercise and funding a documentary about the future of fitness that he wants to present at the Sundance Film Festival in 2016 The question he hopes to answer how will technology optimize the way people work outWere interviewing everyone we have Microsoft we have NASA we have a whole bunch of scientists people in nanotechnology biotechnology people into robots all of that stuff he said Behind him was a white board with lots of arrows and the phrase synthetic bodies scrawled in large lettersHe and his wife Danielle Lagree they married last year 34 days after meeting at a Studio City bar also have plans to get into the supplement market Ms Lagree a former Penthouse pet wants to open a marijuana dispensary and Mr Lagree thinks theres some herbal qualities of pot that can go into an energizing drink Hes curious about other unconventional energy sources as wellMaybe its crazy but cocaine actually has a lot of health benefits he said The way they synthesize it is not good but the coca leaves people chew on it in Peru and they dont go crazyThe idea eventually is for the Lagree method to extend well beyond a workout Mr Lagree would also like to build a carracing team get top tier DJs to spin for Megaformer classes broadcast worldwide and maybe even produce a horror film I like zombie flicks he said Nothing irks him more than the notion that he should stick to fitness though he plans to resume his own Megaformer regimen soon Im getting so fat he lamented throwing in an expletive and a sidelong glance at his adulterated ellipticalsOur licensees are always suggesting Hey theres this fitness expo or this health expo you should do that and Im like No because I dont consider myself a fitness company he saidIm a lifestyle company he added People have more to gain from looking at my product than I have from looking at their

but an ordinary electionThe hundreds of people who packed Auckland Town Hall on a recent evening were regaled by speeches by Glenn Greenwald a Pulitzer Prizewinning journalist Julian Assange the WikiLeaks founder and Edward J Snowden the former National Security Agency contractor the last two appearing by Internet video link Mr Greenwald and Mr Snowden said the New Zealand government had carried out or at least participated in mass domestic surveillanceBut at the center of the show was the events organizer Kim Dotcom an Internet entrepreneur accused of mass copyright theft whose fledgling Internet Party stands a chance at winning seats in Parliament in the national elections on SaturdayWe are going to work really really hard to stop this country from participating in mass surveillance Mr Dotcom told the crowd And well close one of the Five Eyes he added referring to the intelligence alliance that consists of Australia Britain Canada New Zealand and the United States The crowd erupted in cheersIn this remote Pacific island country where elections usually turn on breadandbutter issues like jobs and personal financial security this election campaign has been rocked by a scandal involving the hacked emails of a rightwing blogger that led to the resignation of a senior minister a campaign finance scandal that forced the resignation of a member of Parliament and a lawsuit brought by the publishers of the American rapper Eminem accusing the governing National Party of illegally using his song Lose Yourself in a campaign ad The party denies the allegationThe issue that has drawn international attention however has been Mr Dotcom himself who has become an outspoken character and a significant player in New Zealand politics since he moved here several years ago Born Kim Schmitz in Germany before legally changing his name Mr Dotcom 40 is fighting extradition to the United States where he is wanted on racketeering charges stemming from his filesharing site Megaupload now defunctWhile out on bail as he appeals the case he has introduced a new company Mega confronted the prime minister in Parliament released an album and founded the Internet PartyThe party advocates decriminalizing marijuana setting a national goal of 100 percent sustainable energy generation by 2025 repealing surveillance legislation and amending copyright laws to protect Internet companies from civil liability arising from the action of their users a fix that could shield hosting services like MegaThere is widespread suspicion as well that if his party wins a place in the government it will try to block his extraditionAnalysts say a spot in a coalition government is not out of the questionThe Internet Party has formed an alliance with the small leftleaning Mana Movement which already has a member in Parliament A recent poll by the  3 News television network suggests that if the current Mana leader retains his seat the combined InternetMana coalition could take three seats in Parliament If no party wins a majority smaller parties could negotiate significant influence in a coalition government which would have final say over an extraditionMr Dotcom who is not a New Zealand citizen and cannot run for office has campaigned publicly and spoken on his partys behalf acting as its founder figurehead and financierHes still sort of seen as being outside the parliamentary political process but kind of throwing some sort of hand grenades into it said Bryce Edwards a lecturer in the politics department at the University of Otago in southern New ZealandMr Dotcom has sunk at least 35 million New Zealand dollars or 29 million into the Internet Party the largest personal contribution to a political party on record in New Zealand according to the national Electoral CommissionMr Dotcom has said one of his main political goals is to to defeat the National Partyled government which he accuses of colluding with the American film industry With the film industry cited as one of the main victims of the copyright piracy that Megaupload is accused of committing Mr Dotcom sees the governments cooperation with his extradition as doing the industrys biddingOn the campaign trail the usually calm and composed prime minister John Key has lashed out on occasion calling Mr Greenwald a loser and a henchman of Mr DotcomAnd although Mr Dotcom has tried to ally himself with other leftleaning parties they have not always welcomed the attention Frankly people have had about enough of Kim Dotcom the Labour leader David Cunliffe said Wednesday I detest the influence of big money in New Zealand politics wherever it comes fromMr Key has repeatedly denied that the Government Communications Security Bureau New Zealands equivalent to the NSA in the United States conducts mass domestic surveillance But he has refused to comment on whether it has access to data on New Zealanders collected by other partiesIn an email interview on Friday Mr Dotcom denied that his political aspirations were selfishIn New Zealand I founded the Internet Party to give back to Kiwis he said by email My gratitude to them for supporting me for having my back and giving me the strength to fight back The global vision for the Internet Party is to reestablish a balance of power between the people and their governments with the help of the InternetRegardless of his intentions he seems to have stirred interest in the election As of Wednesday more than 434000 people had already cast ballots in early voting more than double the number who had voted by this time in the previous electionDr Edwards said he predicted an increase in turnout on Saturday because this has been such a colorful election campaign There would hardly be anyone that doesnt know the election is taking place he said And people have become more polarized and excited  or maybe even repulsed  by some of the major players,2014-09-19T00:00:00Z,drugs

an escalator and rarely walks beyond our circular driveway So when her physician ordered her onto a treadmill last winter it hardly seemed surprising that her heartbeat jumped dramatically even when the pace was not brisk She is 80 after allTo temper her tempo she was soon prescribed a very expensive heart medication I have to take it or I might have a stroke she told me a problem for me as her future caregiver as well as for her Luckily Medicare and her supplemental insurance picked up most of the cost so a 90day prescriptions worth of pills came to just 135  a good rate to pay I thought for a good heart rate But in July her discount suddenly endedYour mother is in the doughnut hole my 83yearold father said to me grimly I had no idea what he was talking about but knew from his expression it was not a good place to be I instantly pictured my mom encased in a giant inner tube of fried flour uselessly trying to eat her way out like a doomed character in Willy Wonkas Chocolate FactoryI quickly learned that the doughnut hole has nothing to do with baked goods and is instead the term used to describe the gap my mother had now reached in her Medicare Part D prescription drug program She had hit her initial coverage limit of close to 3000 a year calculated by adding together the full fee of all her drugs and now would have to pay a higher outofpocket cost for her prescription drugs until she reached the catastrophic coverage threshold thousands of dollars laterGiven that she also takes other medications her drug costs were suddenly going to go through the roof  and as I share that roof with my parents husband brother and children it was also going to skyrocket our mutually managed budget Her heart medication alone would now cost more than 800 for a

few days later as I slipped a guy at a Toronto pharmacy a folded piece of paper containing copies of my mothers prescriptionsThe pharmacist looked me over closely We get a lot of Americans like you doing just this he said making me feel like the medication mule I had now becomeIs it legal I asked him quietly mumbling into the collar of my jean jacketNo he said explaining that the Food and Drug Administration cannot allow foreign drugs to be resold or distributed in the United States I wondered if I should make a run for the door before he called in the feds But then he explained how it really worksCustoms looks the other way when it comes to personal use he saidAs I soon learned by checking the FDA website the United States government has issued guidelines on bringing prescription drugs over the border As the pharmacist explained my mother could not sell the drugs and could obtain only a 90day supply of medication she had already been prescribed by a doctor licensed in the United States More important a Canadian doctor had to sign off on her personal doctors prescriptionI left the pharmacy wondering if I could pick up a doctor in a bar nearby and get him on the phone with my mother for a quick consultation But given that it was 10 am and I am married that did not seem like the best idea or one my parents would applaud even if I did return with a stash of pillsTwo days later I was visiting another friend on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls and he happened to mention a doctor friend who lived nearby Knowing my parents  as my friend has for many years  I quickly pulled him aside slipping my drug list into his front pocketCan you get me these I said explaining the situation PleaseWithin a halfhour he was off trying to track down his doctor But alas the doctor had gone on a golfing weekend as doctors do in August In the end I left the country emptyhanded with nothing but a sixpack of Molson to declare at CustomsThe good news is that we have now found a Canadian physician my mother has met with him who works with a reliable Canadian pharmacy that will ship the doughnuthole drugs to our doorstepThe bad news is I now realize how many elderly people in the United States must be facing this same problem by 2020 the Affordable Care Act is supposed to fill the doughnut holeBut I am also happy knowing that if my parents ever need any medical marijuana I have sharpened my old skills and wont need a passport to ease their pain,2014-09-21T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/18/world/americas/ap-lt-mexico-army-slayings.html,ARCELIA Mexico   A woman says she saw Mexican soldiers shoot and kill her 15yearold daughter after a confrontation with a suspected drug gang even though the teenager was lying wounded on the ground Twenty others also were shot and killed in rural southern Mexico after they surrendered and were disarmed the mother told The Associated PressThe Mexican government has maintained that all died during a fierce shootout when soldiers were fired on in the early morning of June 30 That version came into question because government troops suffered only one wounded and physical evidence at the scene pointed toward more selective killingsThe witness said the army fired first at the armed group holed up at the warehouse She said one gunman died in the initial shootout and another gang member and her daughter were wounded The rest of the gunmen surrendered on the promise they would not be hurt she said speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisalsAfter the gang surrendered the girl Erika Gomez Gonzalez lay face down in the ground a bullet wound in her leg Soldiers rolled her over while she was still alive and shot her more than half a dozen times in the chest her mother said Another suspected gang member was injured in the initial attackA soldier stood the kid up and killed him said the witness who said she had gone to the warehouse the night before to try to retrieve her daughter from the gang she had apparently joinedThe soldiers interrogated the rest of the gang members in front of the warehouse and then took them inside onebyone she said From where she stood just outside the warehouse and in army custody she heard gunshots and moans of the dyingMexicos National Human Rights Commission has an investigation underway to find out exactly what happened the day of the killings Commission President Raul Plascencia said Thursday He said he could not give any detailsSeveral days after the killings AP reporters visited and took pictures of the warehouse and found little evidence of sustained fighting  There were few stray bullet marks and no shell casings At least five spots along the warehouses inside walls showed the same pattern One or two closely placed bullet pocks surrounded by a mass of spattered blood giving the appearance that some of those killed had been standing against the wall and shot at about chest levelAfter the AP report the state of Mexico prosecutors office released a statement saying there was no evidence at all of possible executions The office said it found ballistic evidence of crossfire with a proportionate interchange of gunshotsThe state government refused to release autopsy reports the AP requested under Mexicos freedom of information law declaring them state secrets to be guarded for nine yearsInterviewed separately relatives of three other gang members who were killed and a doctor who saw Erikas body said the wounds were consistent with the mothers account of how they were killed  with an incapacitating wound and a burst of gunshots to the chest The death certificate for Erika seen by reporters confirmed that she died on June 30 outside the town of San Pedro Limon where the killings occurred and gave bullet wounds as the cause of death There are no details in the certificate on ballistics or the type of weapon used The gravestones of two other of those killed Marcos Salgado Burgos 20 and his brother Juan Jose Salgado Burgos 18 also record their death on June 30Separately a teenager in the nearby town of Ixcapuzalco said his older brother was among the 22 dead He said he saw the body and said there was a bullet wound to the left leg  it destroyed his knee  and a shot through the back with an exit wound through the chest His account could not be independently corroboratedNone of the relatives wanted to be identified for fear of reprisals The army and the state of Mexico so far have not provided a list of those killed Human Rights Watch has demanded that the case be thoroughly investigated and that the witness be protectedAccording to Erikas mother the shootout was initiated by the army a violation of its own rules of engagement which allow soldiers to fire on armed civilians only if the civilians fire first and if soldiers or civilians lives are in danger The army did not respond to requests for commentThe federal attorney generals office said there is an open investigation into the incident but that no evidence has been found so far to corroborate the witness account originally reported by the magazine Esquire LatinoamericaThe woman spoke angrily last weekend about her daughters death She said she spent a sleepless night sitting on a pile of bricks on June 29 after arriving to retrieve her runaway daughterThe girl was involved with the wrong crowd she said The group had traveled from the town of Arcelia in Guerrero state to nearby San Pedro Limon in three pickups with guns All were teenagers or in their early 20s Little is known about what the gang was up to or had been doing in the days before the shootingsLocal officials said Arcelia is controlled by the La Familia drug gang which was run out of Michoacan state where it was founded and now controls parts of the impoverished Tierra Caliente or hot land in neighboring Guerrero Drug trafficking and conflicts with the military have occurred there for decades Some farmers grow and traffic marijuana and poppies for opium and violence is commonRecently supporters of the gang blocked roads and burned four Coca Cola trucks leading the soft drink company to shutter its distribution center in Arcelia Local journalists say they have been threatened for publishing stories the drug cartel didnt likeIt was unclear if the AP was allowed to report freely in the area because the story casts the army in a poor light But the gang appeared to keep close tabs on AP reporters while they were in the region During an interview with the dead girls mother in a parking lot a young man appeared arms propped on the back of a pickup truck staring fixedly and remaining until the endThe area is patrolled heavily by army and marine units When reporters were at a local soccer match interviewing a relative of the two dead brothers a threeman marine detachment stood nearby The units leader told the journalists Its my turn to interview you and asked them what they were doing and where they were staying Other marines photographed the journalists and their press ID cardsRecalling the morning of her daughters death the mother said confusion broke out inside the warehouse before dawn when one of the young gunmen appeared shouting Theyre on usTroops from the Mexican armys 22nd military zone were on patrol Soldiers trained a spotlight on the warehouse and opened fire on those inside she saidAfter an initial exchange of gunfire soldiers called out to those inside saying their lives would be spared if they surrendered They walked out with their hands on the back of their necks she saidThe soldiers took her two other women and two young men who claimed to be kidnap victims to a semienclosed room at one side of the entrance to the warehouseFrom there under soldiers custody the woman could only catch glimpses of what was happening insideI was afraid to see too much she said noting some of the detainees were shot standing some were kneelingAfter a couple of hours the two men who had claimed to be kidnap victim were separated from the three women taken off by soldiers and shot apparently because they did not believe their claims she saidThe army said in its initial press release that soldiers rescued three women who were kidnap victims The mother says she was one of three women taken by the army to the Mexico state capital Toluca and turned over to a state prosecutors agent The other two women were promptly arrested and are still in custodyThe mother said she was photographed next to the guns confiscated from the gang and told she too would be arrested if she didnt cooperate with authorities and confirm their version of events She said she did not know the

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/world/europe/reckoning-starts-in-britain-on-abuse-of-girls.html,ROTHERHAM England   It started on the bumper cars in the childrens arcade of the local shopping mall Lucy was 12 and a group of teenage boys handsome and flirtatious treated her and her friends to free rides and ice cream after schoolOver time older men were introduced to the girls while the boys faded away Soon they were getting rides in real cars and were offered vodka and marijuana One man in particular a Pakistani twice her age and the leader of the group flattered her and bought her drinks and even a mobile phone Lucy liked himThe rapes started gradually once a week then every day by the war memorial in Clifton Park in an alley near the bus station in countless taxis and once in an apartment where she was locked naked in a room and had to service half a dozen men lined up outsideShe obliged How could she not They knew where she lived If you dont come back we will rape your mother and make you watch they would sayAt night she would come home and hide her soiled clothes at the back of her closet When she finally found the courage to tell her mother just shy of her 14th birthday two police officers came to collect the clothes as evidence half a dozen bags of themBut a few days later they called to say the bags had been lostAll of them she remembers asking A check was mailed 140 pounds or 232 for loss of property and the family was discouraged from pressing charges It was the girls word against that of the men The case was closedLucys account of her experience is emblematic of what investigators say happened during a 16year reign of terror and impunity in this poor northern English town of 257000 where at least 1400 children some as young as 11 were groomed for sexual exploitation while the authorities looked the other way One girl told investigators that gang rape was part of growing up in her neighborhoodBetween 1997 and 2013 despite numerous reports of sexual abuse only one case involving three teenage girls was prosecuted and five men were sent to jail according to an official report into the sexual exploitation of children in Rotherham published last weekEven now the official reaction has been dominated by partisan fingerpointing and politics The leader of the Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council has resigned and the police chief is under pressure to follow suit But criminal investigations continue and more than a dozen victims are suing the police and the Council for negligenceThe scale and brutality of the abuse in Rotherham have shocked a country already shaken by a series of child abuse scandals involving celebrities public officials clerics and teachers at expensive private schools The Rotherham report suggests that it continues unchecked among the most vulnerable in British societyIt has highlighted another uncomfortable dimension of the issue that of race relations in Britain The victims identified in the report were all white while the perpetrators were mostly of Pakistani heritage many of them working in nighttime industries like taxi driving and takeout restaurants The same was true in recent prosecutions in Oxford in southern England and the northern towns of Oldham and Rochdale where nine men of Pakistani Bangladeshi and Afghan origin were given long prison sentences in 2012 for abusing up to 47 girls Investigators in Scotland have reportedly uncovered a similar pattern of abuseSexual abuse of children takes many forms and the majority of convicted abusers in Britain are white But as Nazir Afzal the chief crown prosecutor in charge of sexual violence and himself of Pakistani heritage put it There is no getting away from the fact that there are Pakistani gangs grooming vulnerable girlsThe grooming tends to follow a similar pattern according to Alexis Jay a former chief inspector of social work who was commissioned by the Rotherham Council to carry out an independent investigation following a series of reports in The Times of London a period of courting with young men in public places like town centers bus stations or shopping malls the gradual introduction of cigarettes alcohol and sometimes harder drugs a sexual relationship with one man who becomes the boyfriend and later demands that the girl prove her love by having sex with his friends then the threats blackmail and violence that have deterred so many girls from coming forwardBut the report also outlined how those victims and parents who did ask for help were mostly let down by the police and social services despite a great deal of detail known to them for more than a decade including in some cases the names of possible offenders and their license plate numbersNobody can pretend they didnt know Ms Jay said in an interviewUnimpeded the abuse mushroomed Over time investigators found it evolved from personal gratification to a business opportunity for the menIncreasingly the girls were shared not just among groups of men locally but sold or bartered for drugs or guns They were driven to cities like Sheffield Manchester and London where groups of men raped them sometimes overnightWhen parents reported their daughters missing it could take 24 hours for the police to turn up Ms Jay said Some parents if they called in repeatedly were fined for wasting police timeSome officers and local officials told the investigation that they did not act for fear of being accused of racism But Ms Jay said that for years there was an undeniable culture of institutional sexism Her investigation heard that police referred to victims as tarts and to the girls abuse as a lifestyle choiceIn the minutes of a meeting about a girl who had been raped by five men a police detective refused to put her into the sexual abuse category saying he knew she had been 100 percent consensual She was 12These girls were often treated with utter contempt Ms Jay saidLucy now 25 but too scared to give her last name because she said the men who brutalized her still live nearby knows about contempt During an interview at her home outside Rotherham she recalled being questioned about her abuse by police officers who repeatedly referred to the main rapist as her boyfriendThe first time she was raped there were nine men she said one on top of her another to pin her down and force himself into her mouth Two others restrained a friend of hers holding open her eyelids to make her watch The rest of the men all in their 20s stood over her cheering and jeering and blinding her with the flash of their camerasIt was November 2002 and Lucy was 13When she went to bed that night she found a text message from the man who had groomed her for months Did you get home all rightShe hesitated then texted back Yes Im fineAt that moment she said rape became normality I thought This must be my fault I must have given them a signal she saidUnlike other victims Lucy came from a stable family Her parents owned a convenience store and post office They lived in a middleclass neighborhood I had been brought up in a nice world she said I thought rapists were people hiding in bushes and pedophiles were people who drive white vans and park outside schoolsAfter that first rape she said she began to think she had overreacted and told her friend that she had been upset because she had lost her virginity After school they went back to the town center The leader of the group took her to McDonalds and rolled her a marijuana cigarette she said For a week it was as if nothing had happenedThen he raped her again and soon the rules changed The girls were to speak only when spoken to They had to sit quietly in town and wait Taxis would come by and pick them up They were raped by different men in different places mostly outdoorsThere seemed to be no way out They threatened to gangrape my mother to kill my brother and to firebomb my house Lucy saidOnce she said when they thought she might go to the police a man with gold teeth whom she had never seen before dragged her into his car a darkgreen Honda with leftside drive and put a gun to her head On the count of three youre dead she said he told her He pulled the trigger on three but nothing happened Keep your mouth shut he said Next time there will be a bullet insideEventually Lucys parents sold their business and moved to Spain for 18 months It became quite clear that leaving the country was the only way we could save Lucy said her mother who participated in parts of the interviewLucy experienced years of depression and anorexia her mother said She now works as a consultant on child sexual exploitation issues for police departments and charitiesThey say its vulnerable girls these people are after her mother said Well of course theyre vulnerable Theyre innocent Theyre children,2014-09-02T00:00:00Z,drugs

Massachusetts Institute of Technology police Officer Sean Collier while the Tsarnaevs were being sought according to two people with knowledge of the case who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they werent authorized to discuss the investigationSilva told police he smoked marijuana every day because my best friend was the bomber according to court documents in a state case from last yearSilva was a close friend of Tsarnaev whos accused with his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev of setting off bombs at the April 2013 marathon killing three people and injuring more than 260 others and then ambushing Collier days later and shooting him multiple times in his car Hes one of five men connected to the Tsarnaevs who have been charged in the bombing investigationOn Monday the day Silva was arrested a federal jury found Azamat Tazhayakov guilty of obstruction of justice and conspiracy for trying to protect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev by agreeing with another friend Dias Kadyrbayev to get rid of a backpack and disable fireworks they took from his dorm room Kadyrbayev is to be tried next month on the same chargesRobel Phillipos who is charged with lying to

day because my best friend was the bomber court documents sayGeorge Hinson who attended the Cambridge Rindge and Latin school with Silva Silvas twin brother and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev said Silvas arrest came as a shockHe would not have given Tsarnaev the gun or hidden it if he knew he was a terrorist Hinson said Tsarnaev probably gave him a different story He probably just wanted to make sure his friend was protectedHinson said Silva and his twin brother Steven Silva initially enrolled at the University of MassachusettsDartmouth where Tsarnaev went but the twins eventually transferred to the UMass campus in BostonSteven was the pretty boy Hinson said Stephen was sort of the laidback oneCordelia van Heeckeren who lives on the floor of the Cambridge highrise apartment building where the

was still meeting with his client and reviewing the caseAccording to news reports law enforcement officials say it is the same weapon that was used  in the MIT officer Sean Collier shooting Shapiro said Tuesday after Silva made his initial court appearance However this has not been charged in the indictmentThe state court documents didnt explain whether Silva believed his friend Tsarnaev was the bomber because of news reports identifying the Tsarnaevs as the suspects or through other means They also didnt elaborate on why he said he smoked marijuana because of what he believed was his friends

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/09/15/us/politics/15reuters-usa-politics-wage.html,WASHINGTON   President Barack Obamas push to raise the minimum wage which has largely found success in liberalleaning coastal states to date could make headway in the conservative heartland in the November electionsVoters in the Republicancontrolled states of Alaska Arkansas Nebraska and South Dakota will consider ballot initiatives in November that would raise the minimum wage above the national rate of 725 per hour Activists on both sides of the issue say the proposals stand a good chance of passingIf successful the ballot measures would provide further evidence that the idea of raising minimum pay has support across party lines A favorable outcome could also turn up the heat on Congress to raise the national rate Obama proposed raising the national minimum to 9 per hour in his 2013 State of the Union address and now advocates for a national minimum of 1010 But the idea has gained little traction among Republicans who control the House of RepresentativesCongress last voted to raise the national wage in 2007 following successful ballot initiatives in Arizona Colorado Missouri Montana Nevada and Ohio Since last year some 13 states and six cities largely controlled Democrats have raised their own minimum wages In Seattle the minimum wage will gradually rise to 15 an hour by 2021 the nations highest rateState and local momentum is what drives Congress to ultimately follow suit and 2014 has really laid the foundation said Jack Temple a policy analyst at the leftleaning National Employment Law ProjectTHE END AROUNDThe ballot initiatives allow labor unions charity groups and Democrats a way to boost wages in states where Republicancontrolled state legislatures have been reluctant to act Voters havent rejected a minimumwage hike at the ballot box since 1996 and have approved 13 raises in conservative and liberalleaning states since then according to the Ballot Initiative Strategy CenterIn 2013 for instance voters in New Jersey passed an increase to 825 per hour after Republican Gov Chris Christie vetoed an increase that had passed the legislatureLawmakers in Massachusetts Minnesota and Michigan opted to raise the minimum wage this year to head off ballot initiatives in their states Voters in Democraticcontrolled Illinois will weigh in on a nonbinding proposal in November as wellBusiness groups have successfully lobbied against a minimumwage increase in Congress and many state legislatures by arguing that it would slow job creation and raise costs Thats a tougher sell when talking directly to votersIts other peoples money  its easy to spend said Denny DeWitt who is leading the fight against the minimumwage hike in Alaska as state director of the National Federation of Independent BusinessSAVING THE SENATEThe ballot questions could also boost Democrats chances of holding on to the Senate in November by drawing in lowwage workers who otherwise might sit out the electionJust as Republicans used gay marriage ballot initiatives to drive up turnout among religious conservatives in the last decade Democrats now aim to boost turnout with the minimum wage question said Jennifer Duffy an analyst with the nonpartisan Cook Political ReportGeoff Holland is a good example A janitor in Lincoln Nebraska Holland heard about the ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage in his state to 9 an hour during a visit to a food pantry Though he does not usually participate in politics Holland said he plans to vote for the measure this fall It has to be done said Holland who earns 8 per hour The price of everything else goes up and the wages dont go upOmaha Nebraska waitress Sonia Bentley a selfdescribed political independent says she doesnt support Democratic priorities like expanding Medicaid health coverage for the poor But her opinion of Republican officeholders has soured since she began advocating for a minimum wage hikeHolland and Bentley aside the ballot questions arent exactly a slamdunk for the Democrats For instance they may not help Democratic Senate candidates in South Dakota and Nebraska where Republican candidates are heavily favoredBut the proposal could make a difference in Alaska where incumbent Sen Mark Begich faces a tough reelection battle The AFLCIO labor union which backs Begich is making the minimumwage ballot question a core part of its message in doorknocking and phone calls to voters Voters in that state also will consider a proposal to legalize marijuana another measure that could help DemocratsAlaska Republicans who control the state legislature in fact tried to raise the state minimum wage this spring But they were blocked by Democrats and their allies who wanted to put the question directly to voters insteadThe proposal would raise the states minimum wage from 775 to 975 by 2016 and adjust it for inflation after thatIn Arkansas both Democratic Senator Mark Pryor and his Republican challenger Tom Cotton back the ballot proposal that would gradually raise the state minimum wage to 850 an hour by 2017A poll this spring found that nearly 8 in 10 Arkansas voters supported the raise Thats a sign that many voters in one of the nations poorest states know someone personally who is struggling to make ends meet on minimum wage said Steve Copley a Methodist minister who chairs the advocacy group Give Arkansas A Raise NowThe minimumwage push could help Pryor by drawing in otherwise ambivalent Democratic voters like Jennifer Nelson who works two minimumwage jobs as a home health aide and day care workerI dont dislike him or like him Nelson said of Pryor The ballot proposal on the other hand would make a big difference Id have a little extra money Id try to save itTHE BOTTOM LINEIf successful the ballot initiatives would boost wages for 419000 workers says the National Employment Law Project Thats on top of the 7 million workers who will benefit from the other state and local increases passed over the previous two years but still far short of the 28 million workers that the White House estimates would benefit from a national 1010 rateBut its unclear if the White House will ultimately benefit Advocates of the four ballot initiatives are eager to put distance between their efforts and those of a president who has little support in their states In Nebraska advocates say their low cost of living and conservativeleaning electorate prompted them to settle on a target of 9 an hour by 2016We definitely took pains when crafting the measure to ensure that it was right for Nebraska said Democratic State Sen Danielle Conrad We werent just blindly following a national trendEditing by Caren Bohan and Hank Gilman,2014-09-15T01:03:23Z,drugs

wealthiest Americans and everyone else has been matched by a slowdown in state tax revenue according to a report being released Monday by Standard  PoorsEven as income for the affluent has accelerated its barely kept pace with inflation for most other people That trend can mean a doublewhammy for states The wealthy often manage to shield much of their income from taxes And they tend to spend a lower percentage of it than others do thereby limiting sales tax revenueAs the growth of tax revenue has slowed states have faced tensions over whether to raise taxes or cut spending to balance their budgets as required by lawRising income inequality is not just a social issue said Gabriel Petek the SP credit analyst who wrote the report It presents a very significant set of challenges for the policymakersStagnant pay for most people has compounded the pressure on states to preserve funding for education highways and social programs such as Medicaid Their investments in education and infrastructure have also fueled economic growth Yet theyre at risk without a strong flow of tax revenueThe prospect of having to raise taxes to balance a state budget is a politically delicate one The allure of low taxes has been used by states to spur job creation by attracting factories businesses and corporate headquartersIf youve got political pressure to spend more money and pressure against raising taxes then youre in a pickle said David Brunori a public policy professor at George Washington UniversityIncome inequality isnt the only factor slowing state tax revenue Online retailers account for a rising chunk of consumer spending Yet they often manage to avoid sales taxes Consumers are spending more on untaxed services tooSPs analysis builds on a previous report this year in which it said the widening gap between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else has slowed the US economys recovery from the Great Recession Because consumer spending fuels about 70 percent of the economy weak pay growth typically slows economic growthSome states are scrambling for new revenue sources Pennsylvania has raised fees for vanity license plates and other auto expenses Colorado and Washington legalized recreational marijuana in part on the promise that the proceeds would be taxedAdjusted for inflation government data show that median household income rose by a few thousand dollars since 1979 to 51017 in 2012 and remains below its level before the recession began in late 2007 By contrast the top 1 percent has thrived Their incomes averaged 126 million in 2012 up from 466302 in 1979 according IRS dataThe combination of an increasingly global economy greater productivity from technology and outsize investment returns has shifted a rising share of money to the wealthy Of all the dollars earned in 2012 more than 22 percent went to the top 1 percent That share has more than doubled since 1979Before income inequality began to rise consistently state tax revenue grew an average of 997 percent a year from 1950 to 1979 That average steadily fell with each subsequent decade dipping to 362 percent between 2000 and 2009State tax revenue growth has risen slightly since then as the economy has recovered and some states  California Connecticut New Jersey and New York for example  have adopted higher top marginal income tax rates according to SP In 2012 California voters backed a ballot measure to raise taxesThat measure boosted Californias sales tax to 75 percent for four years and income taxes rates to between 103 and 123 percent for seven years on income over 250000 Plus theres an additional 1 percent tax on millionairesMore than half the income tax the state collected in 2012 came from the top 1 percent compared with 33 percent in 1993 And in 2013 state tax revenue in California surged 156 percentThe debate about taxes and inequality has spilled into the race for governor with the Democratic incumbent Jerry Brown saying a failure to broadly increase wages has stunted growthIf the consumers are up to their eyeballs in debt arent making a decent salary how the heck are they going to buy anything Brown told the California School Employees Association And if they dont buy anything the economy doesnt go forward and doesnt workRepublican challenger Neal Kashkari a former US Treasury official and Goldman Sachs investment banker has said that school reform is the ultimate key for closing the wealth gapThe root cause of income inequality is a failure of our education system Kashkari saidSeven other states have also raised top marginal rates since 2009 This marks a reversal of the trend from 1985 to 2009 when average top marginal tax rates across all states fell slightlyThe most affluent Americans typically receive most of their income from profits in stocks and other investments rather than wages This means that swings in financial markets can cause state revenue to gyrate from year to yearSome states  including Arizona Florida Nevada Texas and Washington  rely primarily on sales taxes for funding Theyre more dependent on consumer spending and dont benefit much from the gains that have flowed mainly to the wealthiest AmericansRepublican lawmakers in Georgia are pushing to replace that states income tax with an expanded sales tax State Sen Judson Hill disputes the view held by many economists that the wealth gap dampens economic growth The Republican lawmaker argued that some of these individuals at higher incomes will hire more people and create new companies which will provide opportunity for everybody at every income levelAcross all states sales taxes account for 301 percent of all state revenue according to the National Conference of State Legislatures Personal income taxes make up 366 percent The rest comes from other sources such as taxes on fuel alcohol and cigarettesAs consumers have spent more online and on untaxed services many states have tried to tax items like Netflix subscriptions and iTunes downloads Washington state now taxes services at dating centers tanning salons and Turkish bathsKim Rueben a senior fellow at the Urban Institute said the rise of untaxed purchases might have squeezed state revenue even if income inequality hadnt widenedSales taxes are being eroded by the fact that were moving to a services economy and people are buying far more on the Internet she saidResearch by Lucy Dadayan a senior policy analyst at the Nelson A Rockefeller Institute of Government notes that income tax collections have become more volatile from year to year making it harder for states to plan budgets provide services and launch programs She endorses an overhaul of state tax codes to produce a more balanced revenue flowBut SP says its findings suggest that the wealth gap derives from many factors and that state taxcode revisions dont fully address the consequencesChanges to state fiscal policy alone wont likely fix whats wrong SP

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/15/world/americas/a-vaquita-is-ensnared-by-criminals-and-nets.html,SAN FELIPE Mexico   It is a rare moment when scientists can point to an animal at the edge of extinction and predict when it might disappear forever But it is happening here under the golden waters of the desertrimmed sea where a small porpoise has almost vanishedNobody imagined that the end would approach so quickly What changed was the appearance of a new threat to the snubnosed porpoise known as the vaquita organized crimeThe vaquita a shy marine mammal is simply collateral damage as poachers here sweep up another endangered species a giant fish called the totoaba to please consumers in China The vaquitas become entangled and die in the nets set for totoabaLike the Chinese demand for other rare animal parts including shark fins the market for totoaba is driven by customers who pay generously in this case for the totoabas swim bladder Dried and served in soup it is believed to have medicinal qualitiesWith each kilogram of swim bladder fetching as much as 10000 here its sale is more lucrative than that of marijuanaThe effect of the totoaba poaching on the vaquita came as a shock to conservationists A study released in July concluded that half of the population which inhabits the northern reaches of the Gulf of California had been killed in two years leaving just 97 vaquitasThe numbers prompted a group of Mexican and international vaquita experts to issue a dramatic warning Without drastic steps to save the worlds smallest marine mammal the group said it would disappear within four yearsIts definitely the last call for this species said Barbara Taylor a marine mammal expert who is part of the scientists group the International Committee for the Recovery of the VaquitaThe only way to restore the vaquita the experts said would be to shut down the illegal totoaba trade and impose severe new restrictions on the shrimp fisheries here when the season begins on SaturdayWere encouraging them to reinvent the northern gulf said Dr Taylor a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration I dont trivialize how difficult it will be These guys making millions of dollars trafficking in endangered species are not going to go quietlyNor will the local shrimp fishermenThey are more interested in the vaquita than in human beings Ral Gutirrez a fisherman in this town on the west side of the gulf said of the conservationistsUntil now the shrimp fishermen have been the focus of the effort to protect the vaquita in the northern Gulf of California Their long gillnets sway like curtains in the current and have been lethal to the porpoiseMexican officials say they are taking the committees recommendations to heart Eight navy speedboats are scheduled for delivery in the northern gulf over the next few weeks and more are expected next year The government will start aerial monitoring with two light planes and eventually drones said Rafael Pacchiano Alamn an under secretary with the Mexican Environment MinistryBut it may be the fishermen not the poachers who feel the rule of law first Mr Pacchiano said the authorities would also start enforcing regulations on the length of fishing nets 200 meters or about 220 yards Fishermen acknowledge that they typically set them five times as longThe prospect of new limits on how and where shrimp can be caught has caused anxiety in the gulfs northern fishing villagesCarlos Alberto Tirado the leader of one of the fishing federations in the small town of El Golfo de Santa Clara on the northeastern tip of the gulf said that scientists recommendation to ban all gillnets across a wide area of the northern gulf would wipe out the industryThey deal with conservation but they do not deal with how the communities will remain communities he said They would become ghost townsOfficials acknowledge that measures to save the vaquita will hurt the fishermen Its a big dilemma said Juan Jos Guerra Abud Mexicos environment secretary But without doubt the objective is to preserve it We are looking for what kind of stimulus what kind of support we can give to compensateConservationists argue that there is a way for fishermen to continue working without harming the vaquita by switching to baglike trawl nets that do not snare the porpoiseBut Antonio Garca Orozco a fisherman who has been working with environmental groups on the trawl nets design said it could not work when miles of gillnets are stretched out across the fishing grounds We need time and space to demonstrate that we can get 100 percent of the catchThe government had planned to phase in the new nets by 2016 But even the fishermen who made the switch voluntarily say they cannot provide for their familiesWe are considered the heroes of the vaquita because we were the first to change said Javier Valverde 66 one of the few fishermen to have seen the elusive animal But we are losing a lotThe jolt of urgency now comes after the government has already spent about 55 million since 2007 to protect the vaquitaIt began paying compensation to fishermen for the loss of fishing grounds after an area of 1260 square kilometers or 486 square miles was declared offlimits as a vaquita refuge in 2005 There was another subsidy to change to trawl nets Then there was a payout to encourage the fishermen to switch to tourism but few could make it workStill there was progress The population decline fell to 45 percent a year by 2010 about half of what it was in earlier yearsThe totoaba trade reversed that speeding up the loss to 185 percent a yearThe authorities on both sides of the MexicanUnited States border are just beginning to get a glimpse of how totoaba smuggling works Last year after officials at the Calexico border crossing in California found 27 totoaba bladders hidden in Song Shen Zhens car they searched his house and discovered 214 more laid out under whirring fans  a haul worth more than 36 million on the Asian black market the authorities saidThen came the June murder in El Golfo de Santa Clara of Samuel Gallardo Castro a prosperous fisherman whom Mexican military authorities had linked to drug trafficking A suspected hit man suggested that Mr Gallardo was shot over an unpaid totoaba debtThe distinction between legal fishermen and totoaba poachers is fuzzier than many here would like to admit Indebted fishermen may find it hard to resist the temptation to solve their problems by catching one totoaba  and then anotherAs they wait for the promised government action to materialize many fishermen are skeptical it will do much goodEvery year its the same Jos Luis Romero said The promise is This time really we will put security in place They go out one day two days and thats itMr

Stevens201314 record 2557 Proud Celtics finish 12th in conference after a run of six seasons in playoffsSorry Celtics fans no playoff for Boston  again Thats hard to accept for a franchise with 17 titles but the talent is not thereAging point guard Rajon Rondo is again sidelined this time with a broken left hand That likely leaves an early starting five of Avery Bradley and rookie Marcus Smart at the guards with Jeff Green Jared Sullinger and Kelly Olynyk up front Sullinger and Olynyk have promise but there is not a 20point scorer in the bunch BROOKLYN NETSFounded 1967NBA titles NoneHead coach Lionel Hollins201314 record 4438 Returned to playoffs but after taking Toronto in seven games fall to Miami in five in second roundIt all revolves around whether center Brook Lopez can stay healthy The former AllStar has had only one injuryfree season in the past three and the Nets need him at his best to advance in the playoffsBrooklyn basically stuck with the same group that made the postseason a year ago bringing in Lionel Hollins to coach them after Jason Kidd went Milwaukee Better defense and improved early play are musts and another big year from leading scorer Joe Johnson is needed Point guard Deron Williams who underwent ankle surgery is beginning to show his age 30 and age is definitely a deterrent for 38yearold year power forward Kevin Garnett NEW YORK KNICKSFounded 1946NBA titles 2 1973 1970Head coach Derek Fisher201314 record 3745 Missed playoffs by a gameDefense or the lack of it will be key after the Knicks traded their best defender Tyson Chandler The offense with former scoring champion Carmelo Anthony has always been there Stopping other teams has notNew coach Derek Fisher with Phil Jackson now the team president has brought the triangle offense back to the NBA and has solid point guard Jose Calderon Another member of that trade Samuel Dalembert is not an especially strong center putting more pressure on Andrea Bargnani up front PHILADELPHIA 76ERSFounded 1946NBA titles 3 1983 1967 1955Head coach Brett Brown201314 record 1963 The record speaks for itself The 76ers were terribleNot a lot of positives for the worst team in the Eastern Conference The 76ers even traded away leading scorer Thaddeus Young as they look to the futureRookie of the year Michael CarterWilliams the point guard does return and Philadelphia welcomes young but talented frontliner Nerlens Noel who missed last season after anterior cruciate ligament surgery Theres doubt whether center Joel Embiid the third overall draft pick will play following foot surgery and forward Dario Saric another top 12 pick is playing in Turkey TORONTO RAPTORSFounded 1995NBA titles NoneHead coach Dwane Casey201314 record 4834 Bounced from playoffs by Brooklyn in game seven of first round after going flat in fourth quarterThe Raptors with their starting five intact should be one of the better teams in the EastToronto had young Lithuania center Jonas Valanciunas work with NBA legendary center Hakeem Olajuwon among others in a bid to improve his agility not to mention scoring and defense They also resigned point guard Kyle Lowry The other guard DeMar DeRozan had a terrific year offensively and will start with former slam dunk champion Terrence Ross and Amir Johnson at the forwards CENTRAL DIVISIONCHICAGO BULLSFounded 1966NBA titles 6 1998 1997 1996 1993 1992

starts with former league most valuable player Derrick Rose hopefully back at full speed after the latest knee surgery The Bulls need his scoringForward Pau Gasol comes over from the Lakers with a title on his mind teaming with excellent passer Joakim Noah and Mike Dunvleavy up front The other guard Jimmy Butler needs to pick up his offenseLet the debate begin Bulls or Cavaliers best in the East CLEVELAND CAVALIERSFounded 1970NBA titles NoneHead coach David Blatt201314 record 3349 Oh but wait till this seasonThe King is back and has a court worthy of a crownThe firepower starts with LeBron James who left the Miami Heat to return home to championshipstarved northeast Ohio High scoring Kevin Love joined the mix and returning point guard Kyrie Irving adds another 20 pointsThe key will be how well they can play together Even James Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh needed adjustment time in Miami Guard Dion Waiters seems a bit brash for such a highcaliber group and could face his own transition under former Euroleague coach David Blatt whose lack of experience with the NBA also will be on the line DETROIT PISTONSFounded 1941NBA titles 3 2004 1990 1989Head coach Stan Van Gundy201314 record 2953 Missed playoffs for fifthconsecutive seasonFormer Orlando coach Stan Van Gundy has a new project the development of young center Andrew Drummond Just 21 Drummond has shown much promise with his rebounding yet needs work on his offenseShoothappy Josh Smith will occupy the power forward spot this time Caron Butler will be the other frontliner with Greg Monroe ready to step up

Michael Jordanowned Hornets return to their original name The arrival of guard Lance Stephenson should ensure more delight including a second consecutive playoff appearanceCenter Al Jefferson injured in the first playoff game with Miami carries the offense inside with his 218 scoring average New arrival Marvin Williams likely will join him up front More consistency is needed from guard Kemba Walker a 393 percent shooter Defensive stopper Michael KiddGilchrists starting role could be on the block without more scoring MIAMI HEATFounded 1988NBA titles 3 2013 2012 2006Head coach Erik

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/us/informant-debate-renewed-as-air-force-revisits-cadet-misconduct.html,COLORADO SPRINGS   Eric Thomas was a thirdstring linebacker at the United States Air Force Academy who also played a far more secretive role on campus He was a confidential informant one of dozens of student spies assigned by the academy in the past decade to investigate drug use and sexual misconductWorking with an Air Force criminal investigator in 2011 and 2012 Mr Thomas attended parties where drugs were dispensed and secretly recorded conversations with people suspected of rape His tips led to three sexual assault convictions in 2013 the first at the academy in more than 15 years Air Force records show Those records also suggest that his work was used to begin more than 20 drug investigationsBut the Air Force shut the program down in late 2012 after news reports revealed its existence and prompted angry reactions from alumni The investigator who had managed Mr Thomas was transferred to a job emptying trash cans and vacuuming offices and Mr Thomas was expelled for misconduct after the Air Force disavowed his undercover workNow his actions are again roiling the academy Last week the academys superintendent Lt Gen Michelle D Johnson said she had opened an investigation into misconduct among student athletes and possible coverups by members of the athletic staff after two Colorado newspapers reported allegations of rape drug use and spiked drinks at illicit parties involving football players Almost all of the cases were first reported by Mr ThomasGeneral Johnson pointed to steps the academy was taking to combat such behavior including awareness and prevention campaigns But her announcement raised anew a question posed by Mr Thomas and others Should the academy reinstate the informant systemIt worked Mr Thomas 25 who has been trying for a year to appeal his expulsion said in a recent interview Why would you end the program like that and then go after the two people at the middle of itA spokesman for the academy said it had no student informants now But in an email on Thursday General Johnson said administrators would consider using informants again if they suspected a crime had been committed or was about to be committedGeneral Johnson added that she thought the best approach was to build trustWe are focusing on personal accountability and accountability to each other so that everyone has the courage to stop misconduct from minor infractions to major mistakes and crimes she saidIn many ways the academys struggle with sexual assault echoes larger problems on college campuses The crimes usually occur behind closed doors amid alcohol and drug use that can make memories unreliable And only about 10 percent of cases lead to convictions which may discourage victims from reporting crimesBut the academy is not most colleges It has federal agents on campus and students are activeduty members of the Air Force living under strict military rules Though there are no known cases of other colleges using informants  even other military academies say they do not  they are standard in the Air Force which relies on informants around the world to watch for theft graft drugs and terrorist threatsDefending the practice a retired deputy judge advocate general for the Air Force Maj Gen Steven J Lepper said in a report released in the spring that the academys honor code sometimes had to be broken to expose crimes like drug dealing and sexual assaultThere might be something else out there that is so important that it would justify a lie General Lepper said The safety of your fellow airmen is one of those thingsBut the idea of having students spy on one another is controversial with both alumni and experts on campus sexual assault arguing that it violates the honor codes ban on lying and erodes trust among cadetsSaying this works is a tricky assertion said Alexandra Natapoff a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who studies the use of informants in law enforcement Does it work to get incriminating information Absolutely But does it maintain the integrity of an institution like the academy Maybe notMr Thomass work on sexual assault cases began in the fall of 2011 when Sgt Brandon Enos  an agent assigned to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations known as OSI  began working at the academySergeant Enos declined to comment saying his OSI detachment commander Lt Col Vasaga Tilo had ordered him not to speak to the news media or the academys leadership about the program But in a 12page letter sent to members of Congress in May he said his first case at the academy had involved a female cadet who had been sexually assaulted She told Sergeant Enos that her attacker had also assaulted other women But he recalled her saying there was nothing the sergeant could do because the cadet was on the football team which meant he could get away with murderI felt sick to my stomach that someone could think this way Sergeant Enos wrote in the letter a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times I told the female cadet I would do everything I could to change this cultureHe decided to try using an informant and within weeks recruited Mr ThomasSergeant Enos directed Mr Thomas to go after the football team believed to be a hotbed of misconduct Mr Thomas began hanging out with the beer drinkers at parties taking photos on his phone and sometimes wearing recording devices He met Sergeant Enos almost daily behind the academys B52 bomber to file secret reportsEric Thomas was how I found out what was truly going on inside the football team the sergeant wroteIn January 2012 based primarily on Mr Thomass findings the Office of Special Investigations began its largest law enforcement action ever at the academy interrogating 50 cadets in one day most of them football players It called the crackdown Operation Gridiron records show Officials at OSI headquarters in Virginia the academy superintendent and the secretary of the Air Force were briefed regularly Sergeant Enos wrote in his letterBased in part on the work of Mr Thomas and other informants three football players were convicted in 2013 of sexual assault including a star linebacker Jamil Cooks Sergeant Enos said Other players were expelled for drug useIn the wake of those convictions reports of sexual assault at the academy  a statistic that Air Force leaders regularly cite as a barometer of confidence in the system  almost doubled This year after the informant program ended with no further convictions reports fell by half according to academy officialsAs Operation Gridiron ensnared more and more football players it drew the scrutiny of top commanders who began to push back against investigations of members of the football team Sergeant Enos saidIn his letter to Congress Sergeant Enos said Lt Gen Michael C Gould the superintendent in 2012 and 2013 and a former quarterback on the team had repeatedly interfered in casesAt one point he said General Gould questioned the strength of a drug case against a star running back Asher Clark who had been accused of smoking synthetic marijuana  even though Mr Clark had confessed and drawn agents a picture of the bong he had used Mr Clark was eventually expelledAt another point General Gould denied Sergeant Enoss request to interview the football coaching staff about drug use and sexual assault the sergeant saidAnd according to Mr Thomas and Sergeant Enos the general allowed Mr Cooks  the linebacker who was being investigated on allegations of drug possession intimidation of witnesses and five sexual assaults including rape  to remain in the dorms despite requests from prosecutors and OSI agents that he be placed in pretrial confinementDuring that time Mr Cooks committed another sexual assault according to OSI documents After the football season was over he was convicted of abusive sexual contact in April 2013 and expelledIn an interview General Gould now retired called the suggestion that he had interfered with the investigation preposterous citing the academys willingness to punish several players last yearWe did the right thing it sent a strong signal and the cadets got the message he saidThe athletic director Hans J Mueh a former chemistry professor at the academy said in an interview that he had never seen evidence of any of the described misconduct He argued that the academy had too many safeguards in place for cadets to cheat whether academically or on drug testsWhile he acknowledged that the football team had had problems in the past he said Since then weve been working very hard and have had success on most programs Weve been pretty squeaky clean knock on woodIn the spring of 2013 Mr Thomas was expelled after being caught repeatedly sneaking off base to go to parties and spending time in the presence of underage drinking Mr Thomas says those actions occurred largely under the direction of OSI agents But when he tried to get the OSI to help him he said it did not respondSergeant Enos said in his letter to Congress that he had been ordered not to speak to the academy on Mr Thomass behalf and that OSI officials refused to release documents describing Mr Thomass undercover workAfter being expelled Mr Thomas told his story to a newspaper The Gazette in Colorado Springs The academy acknowledged the existence of the informant program and then shut it downSergeant Enos was transferred from the academy stripped of his badge given menial jobs and told by a commander that he would be kicked out of the Air Force he said in his letter He fought his dismissal and is now in the final stages of a medical discharge his lawyer saidMr Thomas now works at a nutritional supplement store in South Dakota while trying to be reinstated as a cadet General Johnson the superintendent said she would not support his reinstatementMr Thomas said the use of informants on campus was clearly complicated I didnt think that by providing a voice for the victims I would end up the victim he said But I would do it again ,2014-08-10T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/books/the-short-and-tragic-life-of-robert-peace-by-jeff-hobbs.html,Jeff Hobbs and Robert Peace were roommates throughout their four years at Yale class of 2002 Their friendship got off to a slightly bumpy start Mr Hobbs a wealthy secondgeneration Yalie who grew up in a house with a pool had the impression that his future roommate came from a similar background perhaps because Rob Peace had gone to a prep school and played water polo But Rob was a black kid from a ghetto called Illtown just outside Newark And when they compared their fathers occupations Jeff said surgeon Rob said inmate tactfully leaving out convicted murdererRob started out in this world with no advantages except for good looks tremendous intelligence a charismatic father and a tirelessly selfsacrificing mother Jackie who devoted every day of her life to trying to give her son a better one In The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace a haunting work of nonfiction with a title that is all too selfexplanatory Mr Hobbs movingly captures Jackie Peaces unwavering devotion to her boyThis was not a case of a thwarted adult trying to fulfill her dreams through her child Jackie was strongwilled to begin with and she knew enough not to marry Skeet Douglas Robs father Skeet trafficked in drugs and Jackie knew it would be damaging to have her son grow up in that atmosphere But when Skeet went to prison for the gruesome murders of two women  convicted by evidence that seemed inconclusive at best even to the judge  she made sure Rob and Skeet saw each other weekly Depriving a boy of his father would have hurt him badly tooThis book is full of unanswerable questions about why Rob Peaces life took the path it did and whether anything could have been done to save him He was a supernova at an early age already nicknamed the professor as a 3yearold in day care When Jackie found out what public school was like in East Orange NJ where they lived she scrimped enough to get him a Catholic school education He was such a brilliant student and such an exemplar of fine character that Charles Cawley a wealthy banker who heard his keynote address as a high school senior approached him to say You can go to college wherever you wantRob badly wanted to go to Johns Hopkins But his mother who worked in a hospital cafeteria was penalized and made to work late for wearing the wrong hairnet on the day that applications were due She got to the post office 10 minutes after midnight missed Johns Hopkinss deadline and destined her boy to go to Yale insteadWould the choice of school have made any difference Maybe Rob liked Johns Hopkinss Baltimore location because it felt more like home The Yale campus was alien to him and he made it more so by wearing dreadlocks and menacing nylon cap a look about as antiprep as he could get He also began commuting to Newark to buy marijuana to sell on campus and spent a good part of his college career stoned and partying Still he had a real love for subjects like molecular biophysics and biochemistry A friend from Newark also at Yale wondered why Rob stayed so quiet about his academic success but made so much noise about his drug exploitsAs a member of Elihu one of Yales secret societies Rob shocked his fellow members just before college ended He told a fourhour version of his fathers terrible story which was just one big thing about Rob that none of them had ever known They left school realizing what an unknown quantity he was and having no idea what kind of future plans he had He spoke vaguely about wanting to go to Rio de Janeiro but what kind of career goal was that What none of them realized was that he had amassed more than 100000 in drug money during those college yearsHe did go to Rio and enjoyed its sunny hedonism for a while But the arc of his life had changed course and he knew it His days as a rising star were over Now in the absence of another bright idea he had nowhere to go but down And Mr Hobbs who kept in touch but didnt stay close enough to know much about his postcollege experiences firsthand simply lays out the circumstantial evidence of what began to happenPiecing together interviews with Jackie other relatives and the many many friends of the gregarious Rob Mr Hobbs writes in a forthright but not florid way about a heartbreaking story He captures the ways in which doors began to close for Rob and making money became less a pastime than an urgent obsession When Rob got a job with Continental Airlines that brought him close to the baggagehandling process put him on a friendly basis with security personnel and let him fly standby at off hours he was in a perfect position to start smuggling in a major way Yet those Yale friends who knew he worked for Continental just assumed he was sitting behind a desk somewhereHad Rob reentered a comfort zone the one he had known Skeet to inhabit when he was a little boy Rob was only 7 when Skeet was incarcerated Had he lost confidence in himself for some other reason Had the drugs become such a temptation that they sapped him of all ambition Mr Hobbs does a fascinating job of raising these questions even though he cannot possibly answer themRob was never so far gone that he forgot to repay his debt to Jackie he took care of his elderly grandparents after he left college so that she could have some relief On the other hand when he drove past Jackies house at night and saw that another man in the family was there to watch over her his car didnt stop He just checked on her and drove away Shame Fear Other business to attend to That other business was very dangerous Its the reason hell never be able to explain,2014-09-11T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/12/theater/this-is-our-youth-stars-michael-cera-kieran-culkin-and-tavi-gevinson.html,Just watch these bodies in motion loping flying dancing vamping and writhing at an altitude known only to the permanently high and perpetually crashingThe acrobatics being performed in Anna D Shapiros sensational kinetically charged revival of Kenneth Lonergans This Is Our Youth which opened on Thursday night in a marijuana haze at the Cort Theater arent anything like those youd find at the Cirque du Soleil But theyre every bit as compelling and probably painfully a whole lot closer to your own experienceAs brought to thinskinned fullblooded life by Michael Cera Kieran Culkin and Tavi Gevinson the three privileged and desperate young characters in Mr Lonergans 1996 play exist in a state of unending free fall And a studio apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan  designed by Todd Rosenthal with an awareness of the big city beyond  starts to seem as vast and scary as outer spaceYou may remember that this is what it feels like to be on the cusp of adulthood with a whole wide world waiting to eat you upThough first performed nearly two decades ago and set in the early 1980s This Is Our Youth hasnt dated in the usual way of portraits of bright and sullen young things banging their heads against the walls of a society that doesnt understand them Thats because for all its periodspecific references Mr Lonergan never relies merely on surface details to define his characters uncomfortable place in timeWhat he captures so beautifully in this work that made his name as a playwright is the sense of being lost formless and on your own that descends as adolescence comes to an end and every feeling seems to contradict itself And he translates that emotional chaos into dialogue that is as tellingly rhythmic as that of David Mamet but that sounds a lot more spontaneousIts like my instinct is just broken says Jessica Goldman the 18yearold fashion student played by Ms Gevinson the precocious 18yearold fashion blogger moonlighting here as an astonishingly assured actress The same sentiment is surely shared by the other characters onstageGranted one of them the swaggering dopedealing Dennis Ziegler Mr Culkin in whose apartment the play is set might officially beg to differ On the other hand Warren Straub Mr Cera Denniss best friend and whipping boy makes no pretense of knowing what hes doing or where hes headed and theres a sad liberating certainty in the admissionThe first time I met Dennis and Warren they were being portrayed by Josh Hamilton and Mark Ruffalo in a New Group production Off Broadway with Missy Yager as Jessica They all made such an impression on me especially Mr Ruffalo as a sad sack stitched into shape by hemp that 18 years later my memories of them initially threatened to crowd out this latest cast which has a much bigger stage to fillBut Ms Shapiro who oversaw the angry fireworks of Tracy Lettss August Osage County and Stephen Adly Guirgiss The ________ With the Hat knows how to scale up intimate confrontations to Broadway dimensions without losing nuance Under her direction Youth becomes more explosively physical than I recalled it a ballet of gracefully clumsy collisionsAnd Mr Cera Mr Culkin and Ms Gevinson imprint highly legible and individual signatures onto their characters in ways that extend into every inch of their postures Whether theyre dancing or hurtling toward one another like comets sprung from their orbits or tossing a football and wrecking the joint in the process these kids are achingly selfconscious in deliciously distinctive style The characters I mean not the people playing themThe story which flows as easily and foamily as tap beer for the plays first threequarters suggests a cross between one of Mr Mamets tales of hapless connivers and J D Salingers studies of sensitive kids in revolt against adult phoniness Freshly evicted from his own home Warren shows up chez Dennis one night with a bag full of stolen money Its his dads it turns outHow are they going to spend it and then selfpreservation asserting itself how are they going to make that money back so they can return it Drugs figure in these calculations both to be consumed and trafficked in as does Warrens collection of 1950s and 60s memorabilia So does the prospect of getting Warren in bed with a girl and thus ending what Dennis calls a stupefying losing streak Hence the arrival of the unwitting Jessica a sortof friend of Denniss girlfriendThis description suggests more in the way of structured plot than Youth possesses What drives and shapes the play is the energy of its characters feeling  and psyching  one another out Theyre groping to connect but also always wary of the dangers of bona fide human contactIts not just the dope that keeps them at a remove from reality Theyve all grown up in fractured intellectually steeped New York households and theyre wary of sounding like clichs There is deliberate wary artifice in how they talk But their messy emotional metabolisms keep undermining themEach cast member keeps these conflicting elements in skillful ambivalent balance Mr Culkin who played Warren in London 11 years ago here becomes a funny and appropriately irritating alpha narcissist whose will to rule borders on psychopathic You can imagine every move Dennis makes being reflected in the hall of mirrors of his mind Ms Gevinson nails exactly the aggressive defensiveness of a girl who sees boys as both the enemy and salvationMr Cera best known for his film and television work Juno Arrested Development achieves something remarkable here the sense of an amorphous being assuming and losing shape in the course of roughly 12 hours All lanky limbs in search of a stance his Warren reminds you of the adolescent agony of not quite knowing who you are while being smart enough to know that you dont knowWarren is a damaged soul for reasons that emerge by degrees as the play continues So are in less radical ways Dennis and Jessica And in the plays second and lesser act Mr Lonergan spells out the ways in which these characters are the products of warping parents When that happens especially when Dennis and Warren deliver big life with dad monologues Youth loses some of its magicUp to that point this play trusts its audience to discern the social patterns that makes these people who they are We can infer the past that informs their present especially when the cast is as gifted and spot on as this one Then suddenly its as if someone had told Mr Lonergan But you cant end this thing without telling us what it means and he obligedSuch appended analysis is entirely unnecessary Yet it doesnt dilute the painful pleasure of what precedes it or the lingering exquisite memory of these awkward lovably unlovable creatures pondering forlornly how they might remember the way they were,2014-09-12T00:00:00Z,drugs

by social workers a dozen times in the past three yearsThe children seemed happy and welladjusted despite occasional spankings and the family took a summer trip to Disney World and the beach according to documents released by the Department of Social Services on Thursday Authorities never found anything serious enough to take the children away but the documents show Timothy Ray Jones Jr as a single father and computer engineer struggling to raise his childrenJones killed his five children at home by violent means about a week before his exwife reported them missing Acting Lexington County Sheriff Lewis McCarty said in news release issued late Thursday Lexington County Coroner Earl Wells conducted autopsies and ruled each of the deaths a homicide The cause of the childrens deaths is still being investigated Wells said in a statementJones 32 was scheduled to make his first court appearance in Lexington at 10 am Friday the same day a memorial service was to be held for his children in Mississippi where other relatives liveA social worker last visited Jones two weeks before the childrens disappearanceDad appears to be overwhelmed as he is unable to maintain the home but the children appear to be clean groomed and appropriately dressed wrote the case worker who name was blacked out on an Aug 13 reportOn Aug 28 Jones picked up his children ages 8 7 6 2 and 1 from school and day care McCarty said the three boys and two girls were likely killed soon after thatArrest warrants allege that Jones willfully and maliciously killed his five children by violent means at his Lexington home then loaded their bodies in trash bags into his Cadillac Escalade McCarty said  Jones drove around the Southeast for days with the decomposing bodiesDetectives have reason to believe that Jones killed his five children about one week before the childrens mother reported them missing McCarty addedAn intoxicated and agitated Jones was arrested at a DUI checkpoint in Smith County Mississippi on Saturday and authorities said he had a form of synthetic marijuana on him Officers found childrens clothes blood and maggots in his SUVThree days later he led police to the bodies on a remote hillside in Alabama Authorities said they still dont know his motive how the children were killed and why they were buried thereIn South Carolina social workers in Jones hometown of Lexington released their entire 50page file on Jones Names of everyone except the father were redactedIn October 2011 Jones confronted a case worker who demanded he clean up the clothes and blankets scattered on the floor boxes of food on top of the counter with tools scattered around them where the children could be hurt and an open air vent where a kid could step and break a leg The argument got so heated the case worker called deputies and Jones calmed down when they arrivedThree days later the case worker returned and wrote observed the home to be VERY VERY VERY CLEANCase workers made follow up visits over the next several months as Jones marriage fell apart amid allegations his wife cheated on him with a neighborJones wife talked about being lonely and what a mistake the couple thought they made moving from Mississippi where Jones family lived They moved after he got a degree at Mississippi State University and was hired making 71000ayear job as a computer engineer at IntelIn May about seven months after the couples divorce was finalized social workers talked to the childrens teachers after a complaint that Jones made his kids do exercises for punishment A mark was found on a sons neck and Jones said it happened when he yanked the boy by the collar At an unannounced followup the case worker found Jones and the children celebrating the oldest childs birthday with cupcakesIn the August complaint social workers were told Jones beat his children and left bruises and would often bring home 20 chicken nuggets for all of the children to split for dinner Deputies joined a case worker in interviewing Jones and the children The kids could recall what they ate the night before and appeared to be well fed They all agreed a cut above one boys eye happened when he hit a doorknob Jones suggested a former baby sitter was angry about being replaced and made up the allegationsSocial workers planned a followup visit but Jones and his children disappearedMore than a decade earlier when Jones was 19 he was arrested for cocaine possession and a crime spree in the suburbs of Chicago where he grew up He was convicted of car theft burglary and passing forged checks on his fathers account ranging from 4 to 62For the crime spree he received concurrent sixyear terms and had a year tacked on for the drug possessionTypical teenager doing stupid stuff thats about it Jones father Tim

prefers to walk or ride the bus to the citys innumerable coffee shops and breweries and livemusic spots On weekends he and his wife have no problem hitching rides to the Pacific Coast or the Cascade mountain range Everywhere he looks Hale told me there are people just like him  bearded on skateboards brewing kombucha Its really chill he saysPortland has taken hold of the cultural imagination as to borrow the tag line from Portlandia the place where young people go to retire And for good reason The city has nearly all the perks that economists suggest lead to a high quality of life  coastlines mountains mild winters and summers restaurants cultural institutions and clean air Fortunately collegeeducated people dont value sunshine as much as they used to Portland also has qualities that are less tangible but still likely to attract young people these days like a politically open culture that supports gay rights and the legalization of marijuana  in addition to the right of way for unicyclists or the ability to marry in a 247 doughnut shop Its really captured the zeitgeist of the age in a way that no other small city in America ever has said Aaron Renn an urbanaffairs analyst who writes the Urbanophile blog According to professors from Portland State University the city has been able to attract and retain young collegeeducated people at the secondhighest rate in the nation Louisville Ky is No 1City dwelling is generally considered a good thing for the overall economy Proximity and serendipity offer employers a better chance to hire the perfect person for a job as opposed to someone whose skills just sort of match according to the work of Enrico Moretti an economist at the University of California Berkeley Chance encounters in dense cities Moretti has argued lead to innovation which subsequently leads to income And as the baby boomers retire the pressure is on the young and highly educated to spur urban economies As a result many American cities are remaking themselves to lure human capital offering various perks like cheap housing and tax breaks in the hope that smart young people can attract others like them The Greater Houston area has added more than a million residents since 2000 in large part through generous tax breaks and the growth of the energy sector Las Vegas is in the middle of a privately funded 350 million project to transform its derelict downtown into a tech incubator Parts of Detroit have more or less been turned over to the onlinemortgage billionaire Dan Gilbert Other cities like Austin Tex Boulder Colo Raleigh NC and Nashville have tried in some way or other to spark their own little Silicon ValleysPortland meanwhile has the opposite problem It has more highly educated people than it knows what to do with Portland is not a corporate town as its neighbors Seattle and San Francisco have become While there are employment opportunities in the outdoorapparel business Nike Adidas and Columbia Sportswear are all nearby or the semiconductor industry Intel has a large presence in Hillsboro most workers have far fewer opportunities According to Renn personal income per capita in the city grew by a mere 31 percent between 2000 and 2012 slower than 42 other cities including Grand Rapids Mich and Rochester And yet people still keep showing up People move to New York to be in media or finance they move to LA to be in show business Renn said People move to Portland to move to Portland Matthew Hale may have all the kombucha he can drink but he doesnt have a jobHale who is 35 told me he is actively looking for work in the field of graphic design In the meantime he is getting by he said through various freelance gigs and his wifes income as a barista This is typical of many Portlanders I too am originally from there David Albouy an economics professor at the University of Illinois has created a metric the sacrifice measure which essentially charts how poor a person is willing to be in order to live in a particular city Portland he discovered is near the top of the list Even when collegeeducated residents get jobs there they earn 84 cents for the average dollar earned in other cities according to Greg Schrock and Jason Jurjevich professors of urban studies at Portland State University In 41 of the countrys 50 largest cities young educated people earn more than they do in Portland Its a buyers market for labor Schrock saysPortlands residents may as the saying goes want to keep their city weird But do they want to keep it broke tooAs America has segued from a manufacturing economy to a largely servicebased one its cities have been undergoing a steady metamorphosis Access to ports and bluecollar workers are no longer the key to thriving urban economies Now its educated people with desk jobs who drive the growth Of the 10 largest cities in 1950 eight of them currently have smaller populations according to Edward Glaeser the Harvard economist and the author of Triumph of the City The exceptions are Los Angeles and New York And though Hollywood remains the countrys entertainment capital New York has succeeded in large part on its ability to transform itself from a sugar meatpacking and garmentmanufacturing center to the financial capital of the worldSince 1950 the disparity between incomes and home prices has steadily widened to the point that many urban areas have become largely unaffordable to the middleclass workers who once inhabited them Economists at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia have coined the term superstar cities to refer to the likes of New York San Francisco Los Angeles and Boston Even large metropolitan areas might evolve into communities that are affordable only by the rich just like exclusive resort areas wrote the economists Joseph Gyourko Christopher Mayer and Todd Sinai in a 2013 articleAs the superstar cities have become unattainable the middle class is increasingly finding refuge in places like Philadelphia or Nashville Denver or Charlotte NC An example of the people who are getting killed Renn said is the old traditional bluecollar Queens person whos now getting squeezed with taxes and with housing costs Its clear they dont fit into the vision of the city Theyre basically realizing Hey I can go to Charlotte and live like a king on a truck drivers salaryPortlands story is slightly different in that many of its immigrants have come in search of a different kind of wealth Most people after all cant willingly up and move to a new city for  rather than a job opportunity  some ephemeral or lofty ideals about homesteading and locally grown kale But quite a few Portlanders have done so As our culture and expectations grow decadence rises Albouy said Were not the hungry immigrant nation we used to be Were more into meaning into jobs that find fulfillment And at least some people are willing to accept lower pay to go somewhere they care about According to Joe Cortright the president of Impresa a Portlandbased consulting firm on regional economies young people are increasingly telling themselves Im going to move somewhere and pursue my career rather than Im going to pursue my career and go wherever it takes me For the beer bikes and Birkenstocks people as Cortright put it that means Portland Hale for instance had planned to move to New York where he found plenty of listings for graphicdesign jobs Then by chance he and his wife visited a friend in Portland and fell in love Jobs are thinner here he said But the intelligent urban planning makes my heart singHeartwarming planning however can only go so far Portlands paradox is that it attracts so many of the young and the restless as demographers call them that it has become a city of the overeducated and underemployed  a place where young people are in many cases forced into their semiretirement A July report by the Oregon Employment Department fretted about the states low personal income and employmenttopopulation ratio The average income of Oregonians in recent years may have been a victim of the states attractiveness and a resulting population influx by new residents who dont earn much the report saidYet Portland is hardly immune from larger economic forces The vast majority of its migrants hail from the West Coast including many who have been priced out of Seattle or San Francisco And as more of these newcomers flood the city they threaten to remake its slacker image Surreptitiously this process is already underway Between 2001 and 2012 gross domestic product per person grew 50 percent more than any other city even those in Silicon Valley Accordingly employment is climbing as are housing prices and the overall cost of livingAffordability has long been one of Portlands most attractive features What happens when that disappears Schrock and Jurjevich the economists at Portland State have coined a term the amenity paradox that refers to cities where the same amenities that attract people end up eroding what made a city desirable in the first place Portland seems likely to fall into this historical cycle Just as some New Yorkers may decamp for Charlotte to live like kings its likely that Portlands designers and baristas the very people who have made the city what it is will one day no longer be able to afford the houses they live in either We could have told a similar story about retiring Midwestern farmers moving to Los Angeles at the end of the 19th century Glaeser saysAlbouy told me that he has always wondered why Portland doesnt invest more in its institutions of higher education If you took Portlands quality of life and citizens he said and added Pittsburghs universities you would come out with a worldclass city But the answer perhaps is that Portlands best chance for retaining its culture is to make sure other people dont want to live there Unless of course it is those nine months of constant rain At some point though the economic forces may be beyond their controlAnother solution for keeping Portland weird at least temporarily may come from within the city itself In the wake of the financial crisis many young college graduates have delayed their lives put off worries about jobs and houses and families and instead moved to cool cities to wait out the recession says William Frey a demographer at the Brookings Institution During that time the young and educated abandoned cities like Phoenix and Atlanta in large numbers for places like Austin and Portland But as job prospects improve and unemployment shrinks to its lowest levels since the crash its likely that many of the young people who fled to Portland will soon chase their ambitions to less cool places  the ones that people move to when its time to become an adult Then Portland will find out who the true believers really are,2014-09-21T00:00:00Z,drugs

had been dead for days by the time he led investigators to the spot where they had been dumped among dead trees and scrub brushThe childrens journey to that isolated hilltop in central Alabama covered hundreds of miles and crisscrossed several Southeastern states as Jones drove his Cadillac Escalade around for days using bleach to try to mask the smell of the decomposing bodies authorities said WednesdayJones was arrested Saturday at a DUI checkpoint in Mississippi about 500 miles from his hometown of Lexington South Carolina An officer said he smelled the stench of death along with chemicals used to make methamphetamine and synthetic marijuana Jones was acting strangely and appeared somewhat disoriented said Lewis McCarty the acting sheriff in LexingtonCourt documents show the childrens brief lives were troubled marred for years by discord between their parents The divorce between Jones and his wife Amber finalized 11 months ago included multiple allegations of adultery against the woman and resulted in the children bouncing back and forth between their home in South Carolina and northeastern Mississippi where Jones family livesA therapist who saw the man more than two years ago described him as highly intelligent and responsible yet emotionally devastated and angry over his wifes alleged infidelity court records show Still authorities said they dont know why the children were slain or how or exactly when Autopsies were scheduled to begin ThursdayJones 32 confessed to killing his children ages 1 to 8 and dumping their bodies in the secluded clearing authorities said The computer engineer who had a degree from Mississippi State University was working for Intel when he disappeared with his children the company said At the time of his divorce he was making about 71000 a yearThe sheriff said Jones apparently acted alone and will be charged with five counts of murder Authorities have seized his computerJones father made a brief statement but directed questions attorney Boyd Young who would represent his son Youngs office in South Carolina refused to confirm that it is representing Jones and declined to commentAuthorities believe the children were killed at the same time likely soon after they were last seen alive in late August Jones had moved with the children to a neighborhood of mobile homes in Lexington after the October 2013 divorce and the children had slowly started disappearing from view said neighbor Dorothy WoodI didnt even hear them playing outside any more I thought they had moved Wood saidJones stepmother Julie Jones of Amory Mississippi called the children beautifulThey were wonderful They were happy Jones said as she criedDivorce records listed the five children as Merah 8 Elias 7 Nahtahn 6 Gabriel 2 and Elaine Marie 1 Elaine Marie was born Abagail Elizabeth but the parents agreed to a name change records showIn Lexington there was an abuse complaint against Jones lodged on Aug 7 but when deputies and an official with the Department of Social Services went out to the house they interviewed the children and didnt see anything to alarm them Officials wouldnt say who made the complaintThe case has unfolded over the past two weeks but it wasnt until Tuesday afternoon  when authorities found the childrens bodies  that they went publicWe were trying to balance the children and the investigation against the releasing of information McCarty saidThe children were last seen Aug 28 The older children were at school and Jones picked up his younger kids at daycare He was to bring the children to their mothers home Sept 2 but never showed upTheir mother Jones exwife reported them missing Sept 3 South Carolina Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel said authorities did not issue an Amber Alert because the case didnt meet the criteria  Jones had legal custody of his childrenWith the children already dead and stowed inside the vehicle Jones left their home on a journey that took him to North Carolina Georgia Alabama and finally Mississippi authorities said In all he covered about 700 miles in what the Lexington sheriff called a logistical nightmareIn Pine Apple 20 miles off Interstate 65 and about 65 miles south of Montgomery Mayor Chris Stone said he was cutting his grass Saturday morning when he saw a man driving a black Escalade along Alabama 10 a twolane highway where logging trucks are more common than luxury SUVs The man was driving slowly like he was looking for something Stone saidHe was going out toward where the bodies were found Stone saidThe same day apparently after the bodies were atop the hill Jones stopped to use an automatic teller at a bank in the nearby town of Camden said District Attorney Michael Jackson Authorities havent found anything linking Jones to Alabama Jackson said and the hill may have been picked simply because it was hidden from viewThey think it was just a location thing being a rural area Jackson saidOn Saturday night about nine hours after the mayor saw the Escalade Jones was stopped about 190 miles away at a checkpoint in Smith County Mississippi authorities saidWhen authorities ran his license plate they

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/25/us/darren-wilsons-unremarkable-past-offers-few-clues-into-ferguson-shooting.html,FERGUSON Mo   On the early afternoon of Feb 28 2013 Officer Darren Wilson answered a police call of a suspicious vehicle where the police said the occupants might have been making a drug transaction After a struggle Officer Wilson subdued the suspect and grabbed his car keys before help arrived the police saidA large amount of marijuana was found in the car the police said and the 28yearold suspect now faces seven charges including possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute and resisting arrest The incident won Officer Wilson a commendation presented by the police chief this year as Officer Wilson stood hands clasped before him and city officials looked onIt was until this month the work for which Officer Wilson was best known in his five years with the police But two weeks ago Officer Wilson gained far wider attention when he fatally shot an unarmed black teenager named Michael Brown setting off many nights of unrest in Ferguson and reopening a national debate over issues of race and policingIm a little shocked said Doris Stewart the aunt of the man arrested in the vehicle after learning for the first time this weekend that her nephews arrest had resulted in an award for the same officer who had fatally shot Mr Brown Im also a little relieved that he wasnt badly injured she said of her nephew Christopher Brooks who like Mr Brown is blackThe intense focus on Officer Wilsons actions  old and new  marks a jarring change for a man who over most of his 28 years had left a muted barely noticeable trail behind While protesters have marched nightly a grand jury has begun hearing evidence and supporters of the officer have raised more than 350000 for him Officer Wilson himself has vanished from public view leaving his ranch home where letters on red white and blue stars hung from a door spell out Welcome in a town southwest of St Louis he is believed to be under police protectionOfficer Wilson who is divorced was born in Texas but has spent most of his years in these suburbs that surround St Louis records show Family members friends colleagues and a lawyer have mostly refused to speak publicly about him yet those who do paint a portrait of a wellmannered relatively softspoken even bland person who seemed if anything to seek out a low profile  perhaps some suggested a reaction to a turbulent youth in which his mother was repeatedly divorced convicted of financial crimes and died of natural causes before he finished high school in 2004He was a good kid but also a nondescript kid said Barney Brinkmann who coached ice hockey at St Charles West High School where some who knew Officer Wilson say he narrowly got enough ice time his senior year to earn a varsity letter A former nextdoor neighbor in the small city of Troy an hour northwest of St Louis where Officer Wilson and his former wife lived for about a year said he recalled Officer Wilson grilling outside from time to time and never causing trouble And in Crestwood southwest of St Louis where records show that Officer Wilson now lives with Barbara Spradling a fellow police officer neighbors said they rarely made much conversationAs a teenager Darren Wilson lived in St Peters Mo a mostly white city of 54000 about 20 miles west of Ferguson where his environment was chaotic He was the eldest of three children of Tonya Dee Durso who records show carried out financial crimes including against Sandra Lee Finney who lived across the street and had believed they were friendsIts a terrible thing that has happened now but he did have a troubled childhood Ms Finney said in an interview adding that Officer Wilsons family had somewhat awkwardly stayed in the neighborhood  moving just one door down  even after his mother was convicted of stealing and forgery in 2001After her bank informed her that it was freezing her accounts Ms Finney said she learned that numerous credit cards had been opened in her name her mail was being stolen her phones were secretly forwarded across the street and the thief had managed to obtain her drivers license and a copy of the key to her front door Among the purchases tens of thousands of dollars of candles home decorations furniture clothes including some from American Eagle Outfitters which Ms Finney says was Officer Wilsons favorite store at the time and hockey gearAll the while shed come over and sit at my kitchen table to chat and say how she would help me with this terrible thing that was happening to us Ms Finney said of Ms Durso whom she described as a thin blonde woman who seemed uppermiddle class What hurt me more than all of it was what she did to those kidsMs Durso pleaded guilty and was sentenced to probation Not long after in 2002 when Officer Wilson was a sophomore in high school Ms Durso died at age 35 and one of his stepfathers was granted guardianship until he finished high school An obituary cited natural causesYears later Ms Finney said she was stunned when she saw her former neighbor appear outside the old house in a police uniform My husband and I thought How did he get to be a police officerAfter attending the police academy Officer Wilson began work in Jennings another suburb in June 2009 Robert Orr the former chief of the Jennings Police Department said he had no recollection of Officer Wilson and had to call the mayor last week to jog his memory Sure enough the mayor said he was one of ours Mr Orr said That must mean he never got in any trouble because thats when they usually came to meYet Officer Wilsons formative experiences in policing came in a department that wrestled historically with issues of racial tension mismanagement and turmoil During Officer Wilsons brief tenure another officer was fired for a wrongful shooting and a lieutenant was accused of stealing federal funds In 2011 in the wake of federal and state investigations into the misuse of grant money the department closed and the city entered into a contract to be policed by the county The department was found to have used grant money to pay overtime for DWI checkpoints that never took placeWhen the department folded the county hired 12 of the roughly 40 officers who worked in Jennings Mr Wilson was not among them Instead in October 2011 he went to Ferguson where he now makes 45302 a yearThere Chief Thomas Jackson has reported no disciplinary actions against him He was a gentle quiet man the chief said He was a distinguished officerYet on the streets of Ferguson some residents say they question the very environment that Officer Wilson was functioning in and they argue that inappropriate stops have become pervasive Data on municipal courts across Missouri in 2013  gathered by a nonprofit group ArchCity Defenders as well as The New York Times  show that relative to the size of the city Ferguson had the highest rate of warrants issued in the state among cities larger than 5000 people as well as some of the highest rates of fines collected and nontraffic violation cases filedIn the case involving Mr Brooks for which Officer Wilson won a commendation Mr Brookss family questioned what probable cause had led to the arrest and said there were similarities to Michael Browns circumstances Mr Brooks was just sitting in a car in his grandmothers driveway when Officer Wilson confronted him his relatives sayOn Sunday a spokesman for the city declined to comment on the case In the formal presentation of the commendation this year Chief Jackson read as Officer Wilson stood before him In recognition of outstanding police work while investigating a suspicious vehicle call acting alone you struggled with one subject and was able to gain control of the subject and his car keys until assistance arrivedFamily members who were present during the arrest declined to comment or did not return calls Mr Brooks himself responded by text message I would love to but I gotta talk to my lawyerFamily members who had heard descriptions from others said that Mr Brooks had refused the officers order to get out of his car Then when he was finally out of the vehicle Georgia Austin his grandmother said Mr Brooks locked the car and refused to open it for Officer Wilson His mama said thats when the cop arrested him Ms Austin saidMs Stewart Mr Brookss aunt said that he had been hurt while being handcuffed As a large person she said he had been unable to place his hands comfortably behind his bodyIn the end Ms Austin 73 said she was upset both with the officer and with her grandson She said he had denied having drugs but she was not sure whom to believe,2014-08-25T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/public-editor/an-unusual-hire-for-uncommon-times.html,SINCE I arrived in the newsroom of The Times two years ago Ive watched vast change take hold The digital revolution has hit the newspaper business like a hurricane roaring ashoreScrambling like mad The Times is making the adjustment as well as any legacy media company and better than mostOne of the places where change is visible and symbolically important is the Times masthead The list of top editorsNot only has the top editors post turned over in a way I could not have guessed in 2012 with Dean Baquet replacing the fired Jill Abramson in May but Times brass also made a recent move that is almost as notableMr Baquet along with his equivalent on the opinion side the editorial page editor Andrew Rosenthal appointed Alexandra MacCallum to the post of assistant managing editor A note announcing the move to the staff described her new role effective next month as in charge of expanding our audience and deepening its engagement with our great journalism Thats especially important now that Times subscription revenue has outpaced advertising revenueThe appointment is unusual not only in that Ms MacCallum at 33 is young for the lofty AME title but also because her background at The Times is not in news  she is described as a businessside executive most recently assigned to helping develop the new NYT Cooking appTraditionally newspaper companies have had strong churchstate walls in two areas Between the news operation and the opinion side and between the business side and the newsroom Now with new economic imperatives and the future of The Timess journalism at stake some of that is changingKeeping things separate traditionally was a way of ensuring that business interests especially advertisers did not affect newsroom judgments And it helped keep editorial stances from intruding into news coverageFrom Mr Baquets point of view Ms MacCallums appointment should not suggest that the wall between advertising and the newsroom is coming down That remains firmly in place he said And even though his memo describes her as a businessside executive he doesnt see specialists in product development and technology as businessside people in the traditional senseI see this whole group of talented creative people as something like Switzerland Mr Baquet said neither business nor editorial but a third universe whose focus is attracting and keeping readers not in serving the interests of advertisersIts crucial he believes to take full advantage of what these specialists offer The Timess heralded Innovation Report on maximizing the digital potential of its news report makes the point For the first time both the newsroom and business side are focused primarily on readers Exciting new collaborations are already underway But our historical divide has not fully adjusted toreflect this shiftNow The Times is doing everything it can to stay viable in an era in which as Clay Shirky the New York University professor put it last week on Medium The future of the daily newspaper is one of the few certainties in the current landscape Most of them are going away in this decadeHence the new ways of doing things Although in the past masthead editors usually have boasted foreign reporting experience years of editing experience and perhaps a Pulitzer those qualifications were not germane here Mr Baquet told meI just picked the smartest person on this subject that I could find he said Ms MacCallum was one of the first three employees at Huffington Post its first news editor and later its corporate counselShe told me last week that she sees her job as reaching readers in the ways they consume content nowGiven declining readership of The Timess home page and the seismic shift to mobile devices that means finding readers who may come to The Times by searching for a topic through Facebook Twitter and other social platforms and even through email which Ms MacCallum considers an undervalued tool Recent successes she said include The Timess World Cup coverage which pulled in 17 million viewers and the marijuana legalization series which brought in 16 million a quarter of them firsttime visitorsIn addition to her dual reporting to the news and opinion chiefs and her atypical background Ms MacCallum also has the distinction of being the first digital native to join the Times masthead She sees no conflict between increasing digital viewership and doing topflight journalism Our main purpose is to serve readers she said so our aims are really alignedAre there risks in bringing down the longstanding walls of traditional newspapering Clearly there areI hear often from readers who dislike the blurring of lines they see in native advertising ads that are modeled after news content The Times is better than most at reducing this dangerous confusion with clear labeling but confusion to some extent is baked inI also hear from readers who are dismayed when they see opinion encroaching into news stories Still others tell me of their deep attachment to the printed newspaper and their lack of interest in the digital innovation that is taking so much time attention and investmentAll of these issues require thoughtful consideration with an eye toward protecting The Timess reputation and credibility No shortterm improvement to the bottom line makes sense if it threatens or harms those assetsBut at the same time the need for change is urgent  and trying to maintain the status quo may be the riskiest path of

National Stadiums indoor arena from the young and hip to the elderly was already pumpedWhen reggae artist Tarrus Riley entered the stage the screams of the full house were deafening and the fervor persisted throughout his performanceA musical and social roots movement called Reggae Revival is on the rise in Jamaica where the raunchier dancehall genre has been king for the last two decades The revival evokes music from reggaes golden era of the 1970s dominated by the late laidback legend Bob Marley who put reggae on the global map with his catchy tunes and spiritual and socially conscious lyricsReggae is bouncing back said Chris Blackwell the founder of Island Records who introduced the group Bob Marley and the Wailers to the world It got lost somewhat in a negative and violent direction but I think its finding itself again he addedThe revival of traditional roots reggae also stands as a peaceful revolution in a nation that is often typecasted as violent said Dutty Bookman a Jamaican writer who has been documenting the movement which he says goes beyond music likening it to the Arab SpringLove unity positivity truthseeking these things form the basis of the movement he saidJamaica is the birthplace of reggae which became an international phenomenon thanks to Marley who died of cancer in 1981 at age 36Reggae is the heartbeat of Jamaica said Ziggy Marley one of Bob Marleys reggaeplaying sons currently on tour for his Fly Rasta albumI think Jamaica misses it added the younger Marley In the past years a lot of the younger artists have been trying to move away from it with dancehall but reggae is something that is needed because music affects our society deeplyDANCEHALL TAKES OVERAfter reggaes golden age the music degenerated as artists moved from marijuana considered a spiritual drug by Jamaicas Rastafarian Christian sect to harder drugs like cocaine Herbie Miller Jamaica Music Museums director saidSlackness a catchall term for bad behavior including explicit sexuality and violence became the norm and with it came the rise of dancehallDancehall is an offshoot of reggae with a hyperenergetic sound and often violent misogynistic as well as sexually explicit lyricsIn 1991 dancehall artists famously upstaged roots reggae performers at the popular annual Reggae Sunsplash music festival and dancehall artists such as Shabba Ranks Yellowman Buju Banton and Ninjaman became all the rageDancehall moved reggae closer to the American gangster rap scene led by artists like Snoop Dogg one the biggest selling American rappersBut dancehall was rocked by a series of scandals involving some of its stars The Grammywinning singer Buju Banton was convicted in 2011 on cocaine conspiracy and trafficking charges and is serving a 10year sentenceIn April dancehall star Vybz Kartel was sentenced to life in prison in Jamaica for the murder of a former associateDespite fading reggaes influence can still be heard in mainstream American pop including the Bruno Mars 2012 hit Locked Out of HeavenMars performed a rousing reggae tribute to Bob Marley at the 2013 Grammys alongside Sting Rihanna and two Marley sons Ziggy and Damian singing a cover of his 1980 song Could You Be LovedIn a sign of the times Snoop Dogg changed his name in 2012 after a trip to Jamaica and announced a conversion to the Rastafari movement and a new alias Snoop Lion His 2013 charttopping Grammynominated album Reincarnated put reggae firmly back on the map featuring a fusion of reggae and dancehallBACK IN THE CHARTSFor the week of Aug 23 Billboard ranks Chronixxs Dread  Terrible the fourth bestselling reggae album Ziggy Marleys Fly Rasta ranks third and Snoop Lions Reincarnated ranks sixthThe new crop of artists in the reggae revival include Protoje Tarrus Riley Chronixx Jah9 and Kabaka Pyramid who all play music with messages rooted in RastafarianismWhat you have and how you look and what you dont have thats dancehall said Kabaka Pyramid who was ranked at the top of Billboards Next Big Sound chart last year In the reggae revival ego is being taken out of the music he saidThe revival is being fostered by Billy Wilmot a Jamaican surfing legend the vocalist guitarist and songwriter for the Mystic Revealers a Jamaican reggae band that formed in the late 1970sHis surf camp Jamnesia became a seminal place where Reggae Revival artists cut their teeth on live performanceReggae is always socially conscious music and socially relevant said Wilmot It might not be what you want to hear but its whats going on in societyRoots reggae and dancehall may have very different sounds and messages but theyre not mutually exclusive Some reggae artists have incorporated rap elements of dancehall including Damian Marley and Tanya StephensBoth can exist and live says Ziggy Marley The roots revival can bring things back into balance without being judgmental of one or the otherEditing by David Adams and Lisa Shumaker,2014-08-24T12:24:39Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/world/asia/building-good-will-in-afghanistan-but-not-without-a-fight.html,AZRA Afghanistan   It was hard to place the thick scent filtering into the American military helicopter as it landed here on a recent summer dayThen the soldiers fanned out across the terraced farmland a stones throw from the government headquarters and discovered a crop of marijuana growing beneath them that stretched to the horizonNice weed joked Col Chris Riga the commander of the Armys Special Forces troops in Afghanistan until this summer pushing through the shinhigh emerald waves of greenSo began a day trip with Americas elite troops and a contingent of Afghan government and military officials to this troubled and largely forgotten district where the Taliban had recently massacred nine local police officers It was a visit characterized by the absurd and unexpected twin features of Americas war in AfghanistanHere in Azra a district in the eastern province of Logar villagers begged the Americans to shoot blindly at the Taliban hiding in the mountains an Afghan politician publicly beat two government officials and a local policeman caught a helicopter ride to Bagram Air Base for medical treatmentThe visit by the American Special Forces commander was a demonstration of solidarity with the Afghan forces his men had trained and then dispatched to an area where few Americans have been in the last decade In part the intention of the visit was to offer money to the families of the slain officers from Colonel Rigas discretionary funds But it was also about building good will however ephemeral in an area controlled by the TalibanThe two dozen Special Forces soldiers who were operating as Colonel Rigas security force forded a small river and fanned out across hillsides overlooking the dilapidated district a cluster of buildings set on a slight rise surrounded by pineclad mountainsMore than 100 Afghans gathered near the center a mix of Afghan provincial officials military leaders and curious villagers who had come by car and on foot to greet the Americans Apache helicopters flew overhead scanning the hulking ridgelines for activity setting the locals into frenzyWhy are you not shooting at the mountains there and there yelled one villager perplexed that an assault was not already underwayBy comparison the Americans looked cautiousColonel Riga meanwhile was being treated as the guest of honor Dignitaries were clamoring over one another to pay their respects and offer thanks  in addition to seeing what else they might be able to get from the commander As he had in the past Colonel Riga brought a gift with him This time it was a cellphone tower to help the government strengthen the weak signal in the districtThe provincial governor took him into the district center offices where still more government officials and elders awaited sitting in chairs against the walls On a table near the center a nervous American soldier counted stacks of money for the families of the nine dead police officers Each family received about 2000One by one they arrived quieted by the American presence in their district An old man clutched a plastic bag to carry the cash home A young boy accompanied his uncle to collect Dignitaries snapped pictures with the bemused families as they left claiming credit for Colonel Rigas largessAfterward Colonel Riga who has carried out assignments in Afghanistan since 2002 was asked to say a few words to the crowd outside Like a local politician the colonel thanked them lauded their resilience and referred to the citizens of Azra as the best peopleHe was then given an impromptu tour of the district much to the consternation of the members of his security detail who were not yet accustomed to his unorthodox style They had already made an unscheduled stop to pick up a dozen Afghan villagers in their military helicopters before heading to an extremely dangerous district just days after a Taliban assaultThe first stop on the tour was a battered health clinic filled with jumbled pieces of construction material banked along the corridor and so rusted and mangled that their origins were unidentifiable The metallic smell of blood filled a dank operating room where a set of ancient tools lay on a table beside a cot In the hallway outside where the smell still lingered a makeshift kitchen had been set up to prepare lunchThe provincial head of the health department who was leading the tour listed his accomplishments and remarked on all of the resources available at the site The cabinets mostly barren told another storyThis is an nongovernmental organizations dream but theres no security or capacity to get down here Colonel Riga saidAs the men turned a corner to examine another room the health director let out a yelp Colonel Rigas security detail raced forward to investigate and discovered an older member of Parliament Sahib Khan throwing punches at the health directors head and throatWhy are you lying you donkey Mr Khan yelled landing another shot We dont have enough staff or equipment and you are pretending everything is fineThe crowd slowly made its way back toward the government centerOn the walk a local police officer approached the colonel Barely in his 20s he was limping from a gunshot wound to the left knee sustained in a firefight with the TalibanSwarmed by people Colonel Riga stopped to listen to the young man who lifted his knee to show a bulbous swelling from where the bullet had torn through the kneecapWhat should I do he asked hoping the colonel might give him some medicine to alleviate the pain a request he had made to others earlier in the dayColonel Riga grabbed the mans knee and examined itWhy dont you come back to Bagram with me he said You can fly with us and come see my doctorEveryone sat stunned for a moment The idea of a local police officer catching a ride on an American Black Hawk helicopter to one of the most tightly guarded military bases in the country was staggeringHe does this stuff all the time said Matthew Leas the colonels civilian public affairs adviser and the only person in the crowd who was not surprisedLater the group moved down to the landing area an open patch of dirt gravel and grass lined by a serpentine river And then another fight erupted Mr Khan was at it again this time attacking the provincial police chief The motive was unclearIt nonetheless required more intervention especially after Mr Khan a former mujahedeen fighter produced a gun Before he could fire it the crowd wrestled it away gripping his long white beard as a sort of steering wheel to direct himGod I love this country Colonel Riga said watching the fracas unfold just before the helicopters arrivedAs they landed spitting up a wave of dirt and stone Colonel Riga made sure the local police officer was on board,2014-09-07T00:00:00Z,drugs

United States have certainly noticed their adversaries on the water burly commandos in blackandwhite boats mounted with 30caliber machine guns and bulletproof shields The patches on the officers camouflage fatigues identify them not as federal Border Patrol agents but as another breed of law enforcement entirelyTexas game wardensA team of them  whose routine duties include investigating fishing tournament cheaters and making arrests for BUI or boating under the influence  patrol the Rio Grande pulling smuggling suspects from the river and dodging rocks thrown from the Mexican side Members of the Texas Rangers have also traded in their familiar white cowboy hats for camouflage so they can blend into the brush on covert nighttime operationsOn the border Texas uses helicopters with infrared technology It monitors motiondetecting cameras it installed on private ranches And rather than rely on federal highaltitude surveillance airplanes Texas bought one of its own for 74 millionGov Rick Perrys recent announcement that he was deploying 1000 National Guard troops to the border has generated widespread attention But it was only the latest step in a broader decadelong strategy by Mr Perry and other Republican leaders to patch together Texas own version of the Border Patrol on its 1200mile border with MexicoMr Perry and state officials defend the show of force as a costly but necessary effort to stop the smuggling of people and drugs into Texas and to prevent what they call criminal aliens from filling up Texas jails unrelated to their immigration status They say it has resulted in tens of thousands of arrests and tens of millions of dollars of drug seizuresBut their operations have scores of detractors including some officials in border communities who say the threat posed by illegal immigrants and the extent of South Texas crime have been exaggerated the programs have had decidedly mixed results and that patrolling the border is the federal governments job not the statesIts not something the federal government has asked him to do said Veronica Escobar El Pasos county judge It is such a waste of taxpayer resources especially when so many fundamental needs are underfunded by the very state leadership that proposes and promotes this wasteRichard H Garcia the mayorof the City of Edinburg in the Rio Grande Valley questioned the need for the National Guard saying that crime had decreased by 12 percent in his city last year The perception is being raised that were a war zone here and thats the furthest from the truth he saidTexas has spent 500 million on border security since 2005 That is far in excess of what other states that share a border with Mexico  California Arizona or New Mexico  have spent though Texas officials note that the Texas border with Mexico is larger than the borders in those three states combined And no other state has a Border Security Operations Center which Texas opened in Austin to analyze map and share borderrelated intelligence with local state and federal agenciesIn 2010 thenGov Bill Richardson of New Mexico ordered a few dozen troops to his states border after the killing of an Arizona rancher but he sees no comparison with what Mr Perry has done in TexasIt was limited and it was temporary Mr Richardson a Democrat said of his own 2010 deployment I think border states have to be careful that they dont overmilitarize the borderHe added I worked with Governor Perry on border issues I just think hes gone a bit too farThe 500 million comes with a caveat Last month Mr Perry told a congressional committee that Texas should be reimbursed by the federal government for its border security expenditures dating from the presidency of Mr Perrys predecessor George W BushThere can be no national security without border security said Lucy Nashed a spokeswoman for Mr Perry And while Texas taxpayers should not have to bear the burden of fulfilling the federal governments responsibility to secure the border we cannot wait for action while our border remains porous and communities are at riskThe game wardens have seen highrisk action on their patrols on the border One was recently struck by a rock and another was assaulted as he fought with a smuggler resisting arrest One June morning in 2011 near Mission drug smugglers trying to protect a raft loaded with marijuana threw rocks and fired up to six gunshots at officers The game wardens Texas Rangers and Border Patrol agents answered with a barrage of gunfire discharging 300 roundsTheir response was defended by Texas officials who said the officers fired in selfdefense Game wardens  who carry guns and badges as fully commissioned state peace officers and are overseen by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department  have no authority to enforce federal immigration laws on the border They instead make arrests for state crimes like human traffickingThe Texas authorities work closely with the Border Patrol coordinating joint operations and sharing information In January 2007 when Mr Perry ordered 600 National Guard troopsto the border  his first stateinitiated border deployment  someof the soldiers were paired with Border Patrol agents and local police officersBut Texas operates independently from federal officials too often spotting and responding to suspicious activity before the Border Patrol Border Patrol officials did not respond to requests for comment about Texas operations But there have been signs that federal officials in Washington disagree with some of Mr Perrys proposals and rhetoric Mr Perrys repeated requests in 2009 for federal officials to put 1000 National Guard troops on the border to help curb what he called drugrelated spillover violence were never approvedOfficials with the states top law enforcement agency the Department of Public Safety say dozens of killings assaults shootings and kidnappings in Texas have been directly related to Mexican drug cartels A 2011 report by two retired Army generals  an assessment that cost Texas 80000  found that Texans were being threatened by a narcoterrorist militarystyle campaign being waged against them by the cartelsMr Perrys border operations have a militarystyle tone in their tactics and equipment with footballthemed names like Operation Linebacker and Operation Strong Safety Texas has paid millions of dollars to a private military contractor founded by the retired Army general John N Abrams to help develop its bordersecurity strategies Before his 2007 National Guard deployment known as Operation Wrangler Mr Perry said the troops would be forming 12 armed security platoonsThe governor and Texas officials have said the new deployment of troops has little to do with the influx of young Central American immigrants flooding the border and will instead mirror previous border missions focused on crime and smuggling Mr Perry who is considering another presidential run in 2016 has denied that his decision to put troops on the border was motivated by his political ambitionsMy citizens safety is what is foremost here Mr Perry said on CNN on SundayTexas spares no expense The Pilatus surveillance airplane Texas bought in 2012 came loaded with a 1 million thermal imaging system and 58000 night vision goggles Six boats used by state troopers and game wardens cost 34 million The National Guard deployment will cost Texas 60 million if it lasts five monthsIn a fiscally conservative state whose leaders espouse a lowtax lowspend mantra the 500 million spent on border security has become an exception to the ruleIts a very bittersweet situation said State Representative Dennis Bonnen the Republican chairman of a House committee studying the fiscal impact of border operations Its a clear federal responsibility but they choose to not do the job so we have no choice but to fill the holesMr Perry and other state officials said the effort had made Texans safer The use of state police helicopters and the surveillance airplane on the border alone have been responsible for more than 13000 arrests 87 million worth of drug seizures and the rescue of 137 people state officials saidBut controversies have at times overshadowed successes In 2012 a state officer in a helicopter trying to shoot the tires of a pickup truck suspected of carrying drugs killed two unarmed illegal immigrants hiding in the vehicleBefore installing lowcost motiondetecting cameras Texas spent millions of dollars on a more advanced videocamera system that allowed people to watch the live footage on the Internet and report suspicious activity Known as Texas Border Watch it resulted in few apprehensions The Texas Tribune found in 2010 that the program led to a total of 26 arrests which worked out to about 153800 per

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/opinion/charles-blow-war-against-whites-i-think-not.html,When Representative Mo Brooks Republican of Alabama claimed earlier this week that Democrats were waging a war on whites he lifted the lid on a simmering resentment that is very real and very resilient and feeds on anxiety  and fear  about a changing America and the possibility of those changes upending historical architectures of privilegeOn Monday Brooks was on Laura Ingrahams radio show to talk about Republicans deportation policies She played a clip of Ron Fournier of National Journal on Fox News sayingThe fastestgrowing voting block in this country thinks the Republican Party hates them This party your party cannot be the party of the future beyond November if youre seen as the party of white peopleIngraham asked Brooks to respond to the clip and he didThis is a part of the war on whites thats being launched by the Democratic Party And the way in which theyre launching this war is by claiming that whites hate everybody else Its part of the strategy that Barack Obama implemented in 2008 continued in 2012 where he divides us all on race on sex greed envy class warfare all those kinds of thingsThis is a paranoid delusion wrapped in a staggering deflection inside an utter lack of personal  or party  accountabilityRepublicans have been digging a trench between themselves and racial minorities for decades One could argue that it began when President Lyndon B Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and reportedly lamented that in doing so he was assuring that Democrats had lost the South for a generation a kind of political white flight of Southern whites to the Republican PartyThe racial divisiveness became part of the party plan in the 1970s with the Southern Strategy when Richard Nixons political strategist Kevin Phillips told The New York Times Magazine The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South the sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become RepublicansThen Nixon declared a war on drugs in 1971 which is one of the longestrunning most disastrous programs  in both wasted money and wasted lives  in the history of this countryAfter more than 40 million drug arrests and 1 trillion spent what do we have to show for it For one an obscene bloated massincarceration system According to the Sentencing Project The United States is the worlds leader in incarceration with 22 million people currently in the nations prisons or jails  a 500 percent increase over the past thirty yearsFurthermore the antidrug campaign has become increasingly focused on arrests for marijuana  a substance that is now legal in some states and whose potential legality is picking up steam in others  and among those arrested exists an unconscionable racial disparity As the ACLU has pointed outDespite the fact that whites engage in drug offenses at a higher rate than AfricanAmericans AfricanAmericans are incarcerated for drug offenses at a rate that is 10 times greater than that of whitesThe racial divisiveness was further accelerated in the 1976 presidential campaign when Ronald Reagan continually invoked the specter of a lecherous welfareabusing woman from Chicago  the Welfare Queen the media dubbed her  who he saidHas 80 names 30 addresses 12 Social Security cards and is collecting veterans benefits on four nonexisting deceased husbands And she is collecting Social Security on her cards Shes got Medicaid getting food stamps and she is collecting welfare under each of her names Her taxfree cash income is over 150000The object of the anecdote was reported to be a woman named Linda TaylorOnly as a Washington Star article printed in The Times pointed out in February of 1976 The problem is that the story does not quite check outAs the article explainedAfter a series of indictments each one of which was replaced by another indictment winnowing down the number of charges Miss Taylor is now charged with using not 80 aliases but four The amount the state is charging that she received from her alleged fraud is not 150000 but 8000The article concluded The welfare queen item in Mr Reagans repertoire is one of several that seem to be at odds with the factsThe racial divisiveness continued in 1988 when George Bushs supporters used the Willie Horton attack ad against Michael DukakisIt continues as Republicans trade racial terms for culturecentric euphemisms Newt Gingrich in 2011 Really poor children in really poor neighborhoods have no habits of working and have nobody around them who works although most poor people of working age work Paul Ryan earlier this year We have got this tailspin of culture in our inner cities in particular of men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work And Bill OReilly said recently in a discussion about legalizing marijuana that the lefts position was that marijuana was harmless and Its blacks you know you get youre trapping the blacks because in certain ghetto neighborhoods its part of the cultureAdd the Obama birthers voter suppression laws congressional obstruction and Republicans in the House voting to sue the president and it becomes clear Democrats didnt drive a wedge between Republicans and blacks Republicans drove blacks away Blacks have voted more than 80 percent Democratic in every election since at least 1972 and that percentage was over 90 percent in both of Obamas electionsAnd in the Obama era  despite what Mo Brooks says  Republicans are not only solidifying their division with blacks but solidifying a divide with Hispanics as wellIn 2008 most of the people voting for Barack Obama were white In fact as Ive pointed out before even if every black person in America had stayed home on Election Day that year Obama would still have wonBut during Obamas term as a Gallup poll found in March more whites have moved away from the Democratic Party and toward the Republican Party It was yet more white flightAs for Hispanics Republicans seemed to make some headway when George W Bush who supported a pathway to citizenship was in the White House They shrank a 50point Democratic advantage among Hispanic voters in 1982 to just 12 points in 2004 But congressional Republicans destroyed that trend by passing an enforcementonly immigration bill in 2005 sparking nationwide protests and leading to a 2006 midterm election in which the Democratic advantage among Hispanic voters for House races soared again to 48 percentage pointsSince then we have seen further antiimmigrant legislation like Arizonas ShowMeYourPapers law Congresss failure to move on comprehensive immigration and opposition to efforts to help the Dreamers It has now culminated in an ugly conservative reaction to the humanitarian crisis of undocumented children from Central American arriving at our southern borderIt should be noted here that Hispanic is an ethnicity not a race Hispanics can be of any race and a recent Pew Research report found that they are increasingly identifying themselves as whiteWhites are not under attack by Democrats Republicans like Brooks are simply stoking racial fears to hide their history of racially regressive policies,2014-08-07T00:00:00Z,drugs

using the name RedskinsThe board said on Friday that it had urged the NFL team for more than two decades to change its name which it said unquestionably offends not only many Native Americans but many other Americans tooThe teams owner Daniel Snyder has rebuffed calls to consider alternatives and the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has sided with SnyderSo while we wait for the National Football League to catch up with thoughtful opinion and common decency we have decided that except when it is essential for clarity or effect we will no longer use the slur ourselves the board wroteNewspapers in Detroit San Francisco and Seattle as well as several other prominent sportswriters have already stopped using the nickname and refer to the team as Washington This week the CBS football announcer Phil Simms and Tony Dungy a former coach who is now an analyst for NBC said that they would probably stop using the name on air as wellIn an article in The Post this week Mike Carey a former NFL referee said he asked not to officiate Redskins gamesRETIREES TO ARGUE APPEAL Seven former players who asked an appeals court to intervene in the proposed settlement between the NFL and retirees who say the league did not tell them of concussion risks will argue their case in front of a panel of judges The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia said it would hear oral arguments on Sept 10The players say that the current settlement which has been sent to all NFL retirees and their beneficiaries does not adequately cover all retirees because only those with the most severe illnesses will be eligible for cash awardsIn an unusual move the players led by Sean Morey and Alan Faneca asked the court to hear their arguments before the deadline for retired players to approve or opt out of the settlementThe judge overseeing the case Anita B Brody of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania had already asked the league and plaintiffs lawyers to revise their deal which now includes uncapped damages for players with degenerative neurological conditions Brody scheduled a fairness hearing for Nov 19 when she will evaluate any objections to the settlementLEAGUE FINES MANZIEL The NFL fined Johnny Manziel the Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback 12000 for flipping his middle finger at Washingtons sideline a person familiar with the penalty told The Associated Press The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the ruling has not been made publicManziel said he was reacting to the Redskins incessant taunting during Monday nights nationally televised game when he made the gesture while running back to Clevelands huddleI had words exchanged with me throughout the entirety of the game every game week after week Manziel said I should have been smarter It was a Monday Night Football game and the cameras were probably solidly on me and I need to be smarter about thatBrowns Coach Mike Pettine said he felt Manziel should have known better than to react to Washingtons insults and that he wanted Manziel  and Clevelands other players  to make mature decisions on and off the field Pettine said the 21yearold Manziels behavior factored into the teams decision in naming a starterWe talk about Play like a Brown We want our guys to act like a Brown Pettine said We want to be a firstclass organization We have hundreds thousands of kids come to our training camp practices and look up to our players That type of behavior is unacceptable  APCHIEFS TACKLE SUSPENDED Kansas City offensive tackle Donald Stephenson has been suspended by the NFL for the first four games of the regular season for violating the leagues policy on performanceenhancing substancesStephenson was a fillin starter last season but was expected to anchor the right side of the Chiefs line this year He remains eligible to participate in all preseason practices and games including Saturday nights game against MinnesotaStephenson will miss games against Tennessee Denver Miami and New England and be eligible to return to the active roster Sept 30 The Chiefs were already without wide receiver Dwayne Bowe for

logically essential to a sentence Sometimes idiom or the natural cadence of English favors phrases that arent stripped to the bone Theres nothing wrong with hurry up even though hurry means the same thingBut in many cases extraneous words really do gum up our prose many padded expressions are weak flabby and ineffective A colleague points out one common construction that can almost always be improved by being shortened Its this formulaThe noun is an adjective oneIn most cases both idiom and efficiency favor this insteadThe noun is adjectiveSo for instance The answer is simple is preferable to The answer is a simple one Not only is the second version more verbose but it ends with the meaningless one rather than the adjective simple which deserves the emphasisExamples abound in

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/09/05/business/05reuters-brazil-dictatorship-volkswagen.html,SAO PAULO   Volkswagen AG spied on Brazilian union activists in the 1980s and passed sensitive information about wage demands and other private discussions to the countrys military dictatorship according to newly uncovered documents seen by ReutersThe company covertly monitored its own workers as well as prominent union leaders of the era One of VWs targets was Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva who went on to become Brazils president from 2003 to 2010 and remains one of its most influential politiciansThe documents were recently discovered in government archives by a special truth commission that at the request of Brazils current president Dilma Rousseff is investigating abuses that occurred during the 19641985 regimeReuters reported last month that the commission found signs that dozens of companies including Volkswagen and other foreign automakers helped the military identify union activists in the 1980s to suppress labor unrestNow according to the commissions leaders 20 pages of  documents marked confidential that Volkswagen gave to the military in 1983 and 1984 provide the clearest proof yet that some companies went further  gathering their own intelligence on union activities and sharing it with authoritiesIn the documents Volkswagen provided extensive accounts of more than a dozen union meetings in Greater So Paulo The company relayed workers plans for strikes as well as their demands for better salaries and working conditionsThe company reported the names of Volkswagen workers who attended union events and in at least two cases noted the make and license plate numbers of vehicles presentVolkswagen also reported the showing of a socialistthemed film at a union headquarters the contents of flyers distributed outside its factory doors and the names of those distributing them and an incident in which several addicted workers were caught smoking marijuanaSuch information was typically used by police to monitor harass and detain union activists in the hope of discouraging future unrest said Sebastio Neto a member of the National Truth Commission He cited testimony the group has gathered from workers who met with such treatmentThese documents show with exceptional clarity how companies expected the government to help them solve their problems with their workers said Neto who is overseeing the commissions research of links between companies and the militaryCompanies could face civil lawsuits or demands for reparations if they are found to have contributed to human rights violations of their workers during the dictatorship some Brazilian prosecutors have saidOthers doubt that the evidence uncovered so far would be sufficient to mount a court case They say the investigations true value lies in building a fuller account of past abuses so that Brazil now a stable democracy and economic power never repeats the mistakes of the dark periodThe documents were found in Brazils national archive by professional historians who were hired by a local union to work in coordination with the National Truth Commission Neto said they would be included in the groups final report due in DecemberVW VOWS INVESTIGATIONIn response to questions from Reuters about the new documents Volkswagen repeated a vow it first made last month to investigate all indications that employees provided information to the militaryNo other large company with operations in Brazil has yet publicly committed to such an investigationVolkswagen is acknowledged to be a model for coming to terms with its corporate history the company said in a statementThe company will handle this topic in the same wayVolkswagen has repeatedly surfaced in the truth commissions probe as a prolific supplier of information It wasnt the only company that helped the military track union activities however researchers and academics say The dictatorship suppressed workers wages as a central part of its economic growth model and saw strikes as a communist threat to stability Countless companies faced pressure to collaborateVolkswagen was one of 19 Brazilian and foreign companies that attended regular meetings with military and police officials in the Paraiba River Valley an industrial area some 55 miles 90 km east of So Paulo The meetings began in July 1983 at a time of growing labor unrest in the areaAt the meetings the companies exchanged information about coming strikes and mass layoffs according to notes of the meetings made by Brazils Air ForceIn the Air Force minutes which were provided to Reuters by Truth Commission researchers Volkswagen was the only company recorded to have submitted its own extended written accounts of union activities It did so on at least three occasionsThe documents were attached as an annex to the minutes They dont state how Volkswagen obtained the information But the intimate level of detail suggests the company may have sent security personnel to monitor union events or received information from sympathetic workers researchers sayFor example Volkswagen reported on the showing of a film about the Russian Revolution at a union headquarters In a memo VW described how workers blocked the doors to the projection room and deactivated the buildings elevator to avoid a possible seizure of the film by the Censorship Department of the Federal PoliceThe memo noted that warm wine popcorn and chocolate were available at the screening and it recorded the name of the worker who sold themVolkswagen also extensively documented a union rally of June 19 1983 that featured Lula He was not a company employee but was a rising star in the regional labor movement at the time Volkswagen quoted Lula as criticizing the lack of shame of the government and encouraging workers to stop paying into a government housing fund as a gesture of protestThe company recorded the license plate number of a bus that carried workers to Brasilia after the rally and the name of the company that operated itA spokesman for Lula declined to comment on the documentsGeovaldo Gomes dos Santos a former quality control official who retired from Volkswagen in 2003 was named in the documents as having organized a meeting on June 21 1983 to discuss a coming regional conference of metalworkersDos Santoss name also appeared in a separate black list of union activists in Greater So Paulo that police assembled in the early 1980s the existence of which Reuters revealed last monthTold that he also appears in the new set of documents Dos Santos said Thats absurdHe said that in light of the information he may try to sue Volkswagen or its former executives for moral damage  a broad offense under Brazilian law roughly akin to harassmentI dont want any money he said Its just so disgusting what they did We werent doing anything abnormal Why were they spying on us Unions should just be a normal

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/us/beards-in-prison-hold-next-religion-test-for-supreme-court.html,WASHINGTON   When the Supreme Court comes back from its summer break next month it will pick up where it left off returning to the subject of religious freedom But the courts focus will shift from corporations to prisonersOn the final day of the last term in June the justices ruled in the Hobby Lobby case that some corporations could refuse to provide contraception coverage to their workers on religious groundsThe new case to be argued on Oct 7 the second day of the next term concerns whether prison officials may prohibit Muslim inmates from growing the beards required by their faithsThe juxtaposition of the two cases may color the justices analysis in the second one said Marci A Hamilton a law professor at Cardozo Law SchoolAfter going out on a limb by providing newfound rights to corporations she said are they now going to turn around and say that prisoners cant grow beardsThe justices will apply a familiar legal test to decide the case As in the Hobby Lobby case they will consider whether the challenged government regulation placed a substantial burden on religious practices If it did the government must show that it had a compelling reason for the regulation and no better way to achieve itThe new case was brought by an Arkansas inmate Gregory H Holt who is serving a life sentence for burglary and domestic battery Mr Holt also known as Abdul Maalik Muhammad sought to grow a halfinch beardMore than 40 state prison systems allow such beards which are shorter than a dime Most allow longer ones The exceptions according to Mr Holts brief are Alabama Arkansas Florida Georgia South Carolina Texas and VirginiaIn Arkansas prison regulations allow neatly trimmed mustaches along with quarterinch beards for inmates with dermatologic problems Other kinds of beards are bannedAt a 2012 hearing in Mr Holts case prison officials testified that the strict policy was a result of security concernsEven short beards one said could conceal anything from razor blades to drugs to homemade darts Another said that SIM cards for cellphones could also be hidden in beardsThe two officials conceded however that there are many other places to hide contraband including clothes shoes and body cavitiesMagistrate Judge Joe J Volpe of the Federal District Court in Little Rock said he saw little reason to make Mr Holt shave the short beard he wore in courtIts almost preposterous to think that you could hide contraband in your beard Judge Volpe said But theres a bigger picture hereJudge Volpe ruled against Mr Holt saying that prison officials security assessments deserved deference A district judge and an appeals court agreedIn their Supreme Court brief Arkansas officials listed other kinds of contraband that might be hidden in beards needles pieces of wire broken glass gum caulk tobacco marijuana and powdered drugs The officials told the justices that they should not be required to produce evidence that prisoners actually used beards as hiding placesCourts should not insist on studies data or concrete examples the brief said Prisons are dangerous places it said and the judgments of those in charge are entitled to deferenceThe states brief did provide one example based on testimony last year from Ray Hobbs the director of the states corrections department and the lead defendant in Mr Holts lawsuit The testimony came in a hearing concerning a different prisoner who sought to grow a beard for religious reasonsAsked whether he knew of prisoners who got caught concealing contraband within their beards Mr Hobbs described an incident the month before An inmate fresh out of county jail he said concealed a part of a razor blade and later on that night committed suicide with itThe states Supreme Court brief filed in July cited that testimony But it was only partly trueAn inmate named Steven Oldham did kill himself with a razor on Aug 8 2013 in Malvern Ark But he did so according to a sworn statement from the coroner by using an orange plastic disposable razor that had been issued to him by prison authorities so he could shave his beardDouglas Laycock one of Mr Holts lawyers said Supreme Court briefs should meet a higher standard of factual accuracy This kind of flat misrepresentation to the court however it happened he said doesnt happen very oftenA reply brief from Mr Holt pointed out the error and lawyers from the state attorney generals office promptly wrote a letter to the court disavowing their earlier account of the incident The testimony of Director Hobbs concerning Mr Oldham they wrote to the Supreme Court was erroneous in stating that the razor was concealed in a beardThrough a spokesman Mr Hobbs said he does not wish to offer comments about how he came to give false testimony A spokesman for the state attorney generals office which represents Mr Hobbs in the Supreme Court declined to elaborate on the offices letter to the justicesMr Laycock said the disavowal in the letter was significant This was their only example he saidProfessor Hamilton of Cardozo Law School said there were authentic security concerns in play in the case There has to be a real thumb on the side of deference to the prison she said particularly because prisoners have no shame in claiming to be members of any religionThere is a real risk she added that prisons face with facial hairThe state told the justices that it had other concerns beyond the smuggling of contraband Merely having to inspect beards the states brief said may be dangerous Razor blades dirty needles or other items could cut correctional officers the brief saidMr Holt responded that prisoners could be made to run their hands vigorously through their own beardsThe state added that allowing beards would make it easy for escaped prisoners to alter their appearance Mr Holt responded that the prison authorities could take pictures of inmates with and without beardsLast year the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in St Louis ruled that the states justifications were sufficient to prohibit Mr Holt from growing a beard Mr Holt then filed a handwritten petition asking the justices to hear his case Holt v Hobbs No 136827 pointing out that other courts had struck down policies banning beards in prisonsIn an interim order in November the Supreme Court said Mr Holt must for now be allowed to grow a halfinch beardIn addition to Mr Laycock who teaches law at the University of Virginia Mr Holt is represented by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty which also represented Hobby Lobby the chain of crafts stores that won last terms religious liberty caseThe two cases are quite different said Ira C Lupu a law professor at George Washington University as prisons are highly specialized contextsThis case coming the term after Hobby Lobby he said is the purest

another in a region where change has been palpable for centuries While two linger in the second half of the 20th century another flashes forward to the present and showcases the cultural metamorphosis that one country Brazil has itself gone through A fourth focuses on arguably the most profound way Latin America can change visitors through natureVmonos Bernard Plossu in Mxico  Edited by Salvador Albiana and Juan Garca de Oteyza 335 pages ApertureFundacion TelevisaThe French photographer Bernard Plossu was 20 when he first set foot in Mexico inquisitive adventurous and ready for anything  a true child of the 60s In 1965 the Beat Generation which had already chosen Mexico as a backdrop for its own adventures was giving way to a hippie era of languid selfdiscovery Inevitably Plossu was swept up in the zeitgeist nomadic road trips marijuana and all And though he always had a camera with him wherever he went  from Mexico City to Chiapas and beyond  the last thing on his mind was starting a career as the celebrated roving photographer he would soon becomeIt was just a question of fixing all those moments passing by of capturing the grandiose and magical landscapes of this sublime country Plossu says of his prodigious photographic output in Vmonos a lush compendium of mostly blackandwhite photos essays interviews and excerpts from Plossus road notesAnd fix those moments he did from the ethereal portraits of a whiterobed Lacandon Maya to roadside scenes of men working on brokendown vehicles brides in full regalia and children on dusty curbs Plossus fellow travelers are also in these pages  sprawled out on car seats standing arms spread in the middle of an empty highway Together they were all on the same journey the journey of a generation in the process of constructing itself as Salvador Albiana puts itThe ephemeral feel of Plossus photos suggest both a Mexico in transition and the vagabond style of a photographer whose fame was based in large part on a transient lifestyle that led him to many places But it was Mexico that captured his heart Again and again he would return four trips over the next 15 years or so In subsequent visits improvisation gave way to more focused themes the shantytowns and hardscrabble areas of Mexico City which in his photos seem to be ruled by throngs of children the border region areas along the Atlantic and Pacific coastsWhatever the specific destination one image keeps popping up the road Whether it is a highway a city street or a dirt lane Plossus lust for the open road is steadfast I photograph it by instinct he once said because we move forward on it and abandon old habits we set out for the future leaving our organized lives in the closet where they belongThe Footloose American Following the Hunter S Thompson Trail Across South America  By Brian Kevin 372 pages BroadwayA few years before Plossus first trip to Mexico another traveler in his 20s went to Latin America in search of adventure of a more calculated sortHere was a white man with 12 Yankee dollars in his pocket  hauling a typewriter grinning sweating no hope of speaking the language no place to stay wrote Hunter S Thompson in a 1962 article for The National Observer The white man was Thompson himself who had recently embarked on a yearlong trip across South America in hopes that the last frontier would yield some careerlaunching stories including one about the trade in contraband goodsBut as his journey progressed Thompson became increasingly cranky impatient with bugs and poverty bumpy truck rides and cities some chaotic and others like Asuncin as lively as Atlantis and nearly as isolated Though he was fascinated by a few places like Mato Grosso in Brazil the overall result of his trip was his transformation into the cynical overthetop gonzo journalist he was destined to beThat in a nutshell is Thompsons Latin American adventure story The Footloose American delves into the journalists travels and includes another story that of the author Brian Kevin yet another young American who recently divorced and more than a little footloose himself cashes in his frequent flier miles for a flight to muggy Barranquilla Colombia His goal to trace Thompsons path from the Colombian coast across the Andes and into Brazil and beyond in hopes of understanding how travel in a foreign land could turn a moony misanthrope like Thompson into a shrewd cultural observerHis quest takes him to cities like La Paz Bolivia where people in zebra suits cavort on busy intersections and Cali in Colombia gleaming with laundered drug money a city where Thompson once watched a British expatriate on his penthouse terrace whack golf balls onto the tinroofed neighborhood below In Quito Mr Kevin finds a spectrum of tourists from the world changers hopping from volunteer gig to volunteer gig to hedonists  partying their way across the continent Woven into Mr Kevins encounters with salt workers in Colombia and tin miners in Bolivia are lucid explanations of American foreign policy in Thompsons time and South American politics past and present Not only does Mr Kevin fill us in on the careening journey that helped define Thompson as a journalist but he also delivers an engrossing and opinionated travel guide to modern Latin AmericaBrazil A Celebration of Contemporary Brazilian Culture  320 pages PhaidonThe 60s are also evoked in this sweeping stylish volume of photos and essays but only as a means to contrast that mostly oppressive decade 1964 marked the beginning of some 20 years of military dictatorship that

 among them footlong centipedes toddlersize iguanas giant tortoises big enough for Darwin to climb atop  perhaps none is so intriguing as homo sapiens a nonnative species believed to have made landfall on these volcanic islands more than 500 miles off the coast of Ecuador in the early 16th century Given the capacity of humans to wreak havoc on delicate environments it is nothing short of amazing that in the case of the Galpagos they have not done so The Galpagos according to Mr Nicholls remain so relatively untouched that the act of wading ashore to one if its islands can feel like you are the first to do soIt seems that the bleak otherworldly Galpagos have inspired humans to behave with uncharacteristic decencyOf course continued protection of the islands requires diligence which is perhaps why Mr Nicholls a science journalist and an ardent supporter of all things Galpagos devotes three out of 10 chapters to humans  what they have done wrong a period of unregulated population growth the introduction of invasive species an oil spill in 2001 and right stringent protective measures taken by the Ecuadorean government and Unescos diligent unwavering attentionThankfully geology plant life including wondroussounding forests of giant daisy trees and other creatures are not ignored in this slim delightful volume Youll find sections meted out to invertebrates reptiles sea creatures and birds including not only the clownlike bluefooted booby but also the Nazca booby an altogether snazzier birdMr Nicholls entertaining in his own right keeps things lively with lots of human observations William Beebe for instance an American naturalist who in 1925 explored the waters around the Galpagos describes rubbing the bright shell of an amiable crab which sank down upon the sand lowered his eyes into their sockets and wiggled his maxillipeds ecstaticallyAnd as fascinated as Darwin was with the panoply of weird creatures arrayed before him he wasnt always impressed with their looks Marine iguanas which he referred to as imps of darkness were in his eyes most disgusting clumsy LizardsAs protective as Mr Nicholls is of these strange islands the reader gets the distinct feeling that he wants you to see for yourself these animals that show no prejudice no fear   an experience that will do no less than transform the way we think about our

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/travel/wine-olive-oil-and-the-good-life-in-uruguay.html,Our first lunch was laid out like a last supper There in the middle of a vineyard underneath a billowing white cotton tent a long wooden table had been set up every inch of it covered with platters of food There was the stuff you might expect at a picnic bread homemade and chewy wedges of various cheeses arranged on wooden cutting boards paperthin slivers of prosciutto and salami Then there were the local specialties  bowls of creamy spinach dip stacks of freshly baked empanadas stuffed with tuna and still steaming And finally the wine bottles of the heavy stuff this area was famous for and what brought us here in the first placeWe were eight that afternoon  my friends and I our hosts Diego Vigano his wife Maria and his father Mauro Galeazzo and scampering around somewhere Coco the cherubic 2yearold who had the run of the place The setting was Posada CampoTinto a gorgeous fiveroom boutique hotel set on a sprawling hill deep in the wine country of South America It had taken an overnight flight to Buenos Aires an hour in a car to the port and three hours on a ferry across the Ro de la Plata that separated us from Argentina But as I took my seat next to Mr Galeazzo a dashing Italian gentleman of 87 I forgot my fatigue and concentrated on not stuffing all the food into my face at onceWelcome to Uruguay said Mr Vigano de Narvaez raising his glass and looking around the table Our population just went up since you arrivedUruguay has made some news lately  all of it indicative of a country that wants you to enjoy yourself First Uruguay beat out Argentina as the highest per capita consumer of beef a real victory for the smaller country in this meatloving part of the world Last year The Economist named Uruguay Country of the Year partly for legalizing samesex marriage and partly for becoming the first country to legalize the production and the sale of marijuana saying that those actions have increased the global sum of human happiness at no financial costSitting in the middle of the vineyard surrounded by songbirds and a light breeze it was hard not to feel the sum of human happiness in ways entirely unrelated to federal legislation We were there to explore a nascent scene of great wine being made and the kind of easygoing grassroots vibe that comes from small communities birthing their own tourism industryThis locus of Uruguayan wine country though not the largest in this small nation has been producing wine for generations  but has only recently gained attention as much for its wine as for being an awfully nice place to visit Its centered around the dusty old town of Carmelo about 150 miles northwest of the capital of Montevideo and just across the Ro de la Plata from Argentina Its a place of grassy roads fields of grazing cattle and hillsides of pale green vineyards Wildflowers carpet the land and rosemary and lavender plants grow to be the size of small Fiats Its Tuscany in miniatureThe eight vineyards around Carmelo comprise about 1000 acres making the area slightly smaller than Uruguays biggest wine regions which are outside Montevideo and Canelones Uruguay produces less than 100 million liters of wine every year which means our entire country produces as much as one large winery in Argentina said Juan Andres Marichal vice president of the National Wine Institute of Uruguay Our wineries arent big corporations They are small and run by families If Argentina is the continents wine Goliath Uruguay may be on its way to being its David  a formidable opponent And a huge part of its appeal and success may be that its small and accessibleWe started early the next day I met my friends Lisa who traveled with me from the States and Astrid and Matias who joined up with us in Argentina on the terrace of CampoTinto for a breakfast of cheese ham toast and yerba mate or simply mate pronounced MAHtay which tastes like green tea if you added bitterness and removed joy Calling it an acquired taste is generous and yet its as popular in Uruguay and Argentina as steak Mate is served in cups that look like hollowedout gourds lined with silver and Astrid and Matias drank theirs through a stainless steel pipe slash straw contraption It is a beautiful methodical centuriesold tradition and after one sip I wanted no part of itHalf an hour later it was time to borrow bikes from the hotel and get our bearingsJust down a dusty clay path from CampoTinto is Cordano Almacn de la Capilla one of the oldest vineyards in Uruguay My greatgreatgrandfather came here in 1870 from Genoa said Ana Paula Cordano as we stood in her wine shop and general store which seem to be lifted from an earlier centuryWe had ditched our bikes outside and were perusing jars of dulce de leche and baskets of homemade caramels made from wine Antique glass bottles and scales lined the shelves and dings from the ancient cash register added to the feeling that we had stepped into a saloon in the old westHe brought with him the Italian tradition of planting grapes Ms Cordano said referring to the vineyards founder We had to modernize but we try to preserve tradition That tradition was on display in the field just behind the Cordano store  an antique wine press old hazelnut trees and just beyond the yard cows and horses grazing in the pasture as they have for generationsOnly a few miles from CampoTinto  everything is only a bike ride away in Carmelo  is El Legado winery one of the smaller more elegant wineries in the area What we have in Carmelo is a microclimate said Bernardo Marzuca the tan crisply dressed owner of the winery which he opened in 2007 he released his first vintage in 2011 It was the following evening and we were sitting at the heavy wooden table in his tasting room surrounded by winestained oak barrels platters of salami olives and breadsticks and antique revolvers hanging from the door frame The harvest in the rest of Uruguay is in March but here in Carmelo the grapes mature faster so the harvest is two weeks earlier He stood up and walked over to one of the formidable oak barrels next to usMr Marzuca pulled out the plug from the top of the barrel inserted a long glass syringe drew out some wine nearly black and dispensed it into a glass The tannat grape the pride of Uruguay produces the wine of the machos socalled because its quite strong It was rich and lush and tasted faintly of berriesMy father planted these vines said Mr Marzuca pride swelling in his voice as we walked through his vineyard at dusk Tannat grapes grow better in sandy areas and I think they have grown quite well hereThe sky had slipped from orange to red to black It was time to head back to CampoTinto for the night We piled into Mr Vigano de Narvaezs 1951 lime green Studebaker  almost everyone here drives a 1940s or 50sera car when not traveling by horseback or bicycle We like the old cars Mr Vigano de Narvaez said over the rumble of the engine In Carmelo if something is not broken we do not fix itThe next day we put our tannat expedition on hold and delved into another famous crop In the shadow of wine countries all over the world there is usually olive oil  and in southwestern Uruguay the olive oil of reckoning comes from Familia LongoThis place was a real mess when I took it over said Dolores Longo the owner The following day we were strolling through her olive grove the late afternoon sun giving way to a slow chill in the air I didnt know anything about how to make olive oil  I had to teach myselfWhat she learned eventually led her to make three different types of olive oil grassy manzanilla fruity arbequina and the pungent and peppery coratina arbequina If you dont process the olives within a few hours the oil suffers Ms Longo said as we ended our tour in her tasting roomAnd yes at this point Uruguay was beginning to seem like a series of very cute very charming tasting rooms My palate spoiled indulged and exhausted demanded a breakPunta Gorda said my friend Matias a Patagonian farmer of few words You must see itThere are two things to know about Punta Gorda a fleck of a town 20 minutes by modern car from Carmelo Its considered kilometer zero for the Ro de la Plata and like so many points on the coastline of South America it boasts a connection to Darwin the Beagle stopped here on Darwins famous voyage of the 1830sStanding on a hilltop overlooking the muddy roiling river we could see Argentina in the distance Its close said Astrid But this quiet pocket of wine country she added is a world away from the rest of the world isnt it,2014-09-14T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/us/ferguson-missouri-protests.html,FERGUSON Mo  Violence erupted here once more overnight even as Missouri National Guard troops arrived the latest in a series of quickly shifting attempts to quell the chaos that has upended this St Louis suburb for more than a weekIn the days since an unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was shot to death by a white police officer here on Aug 9 an array of state and local law enforcement authorities have swerved from one approach to another taking to the streets in militarystyle vehicles and riot gear then turning over power to a Missouri State Highway Patrol official who permitted the protests and marched along then calling for a curfewEarly Monday after a new spate of unrest Gov Jay Nixon said he was bringing in the National Guard Hours later he said that he was lifting the curfew and that the Guard would have only a limited role protecting the police command postAlthough the tactics changed the nighttime scene did notLate Monday night peaceful protests devolved into sporadic violence including gunshots by what the authorities said was a small number of people and demonstrators were met with tear gas and orders to leave Two men were shot in the crowd officials said in an earlymorning news conference and 31 people  some from New York and California  were arrested Fires were reported in two places The police were shot at the authorities said but did not fire their weaponsWe cant have this said Capt Ronald S Johnson the Highway Patrol official who stood near a table that held two guns and a Molotov cocktail that had been seized We do not want to lose another lifeCaptain Johnson who is coordinating security operations gave no sense of whether the police would change their tactics again on Tuesday But he urged peaceful protesters to demonstrate during daylight hours so as not to give cover to violent agitators and he pledged despite the repeated nights of tumult Were going to make this neighborhood wholeAdding to the turbulence was confusion over the curfew Although it was no longer in force the police demanded around midnight that the crowd disperse a move the authorities attributed to increasingly unsafe conditionsAlso on Monday more details emerged from autopsies performed on Mr Browns body One showed that he had been shot at least six times another found evidence of marijuana in his systemIn Washington President Obama said that Attorney General Eric H Holder Jr would go to Ferguson on Wednesday to meet with FBI agents conducting a federal civil rights investigation into the shooting He seemed less than enthusiastic about the governors decision to call in the National GuardMr Obama said he had told Mr Nixon in a phone call on Monday that the Guard should be used in a limited and appropriate wayHe added that he would be closely monitoring the deploymentIll be watching over the next several days to assess whether in fact its helping rather than hindering progress in Ferguson said Mr Obama who emphasized that Missouri not the White House had called in the GuardHe again tried to strike a balance between the right to protest and approaches to securityWhile I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown giving in to that anger by looting or carrying guns and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions Mr Obama saidAs darkness set in along West Florissant Avenue one of the citys main thoroughfares and a center of the weeklong protests demonstrators were required to keep movingAfter more than an hour of peaceful protests some in the crowd began to throw bottles at the police who brought out armored vehicles and tactical units But many peacekeepers in the crowd formed a human chain and got the agitators to back downAt another point as protesters gathered near a convenience store some of them threw objects the police responded with tear gasAnd near midnight the police began announcing over loudspeakers that people needed to leave the area or risk arrest after what the police said were repeated gunshots and a deteriorating situationA few blocks away at the police command post National Guard members in Army fatigues some with military police patches on their uniforms stood ready but never entered the area where protesters were marching State and local law enforcement authorities oversaw operations thereResidents seemed puzzled and frustrated by the continually changing approaches suggesting that the moving set of rules only worsened longstanding tensions over policing and race in this town of 21000It almost seems like they cant decide what to do and like law enforcement is fighting over whos got the power said Antione Watson 37 who stood near a middleofthestreet memorial of candles and flowers for Mr Brown the 18yearold killed on a winding block hereFirst they do this then theres that and now who can even tell what their plan is Mr Watson said They can try all of this but I dont see an end to this until there are charges against the copThe latest turn in law enforcement tactics  the removal of a midnightto5 am curfew imposed Saturday and the arrival of members of the Guard  followed a chaotic Sunday night Police officers reported gunfire and firebombs from some people among a large group and they responded with tear gas smoke canisters and rubber bulletsBy Monday the police seemed intent on taking control of the situation long before evening and the expected arrival of protesters some of them inclined to provoke clashes The authorities banned stationary protests even during the day ordering demonstrators to continue walking  particularly in an area along West Florissant not far from where the shooting occurred One of those told to move along was the Rev Jesse L JacksonSix members of the Highway Patrol plastic flexties within easy reach stood guard at a barbecue restaurant that has been a hub of the turmoil Just north of the restaurant about 30 officers surrounded a convenience store that was heavily damaged early in the unrest Several people were arrested during the day including a photographer for Getty Images Scott Olson who was led away in plastic handcuffs in the early eveningExplaining his decision to call in the National Guard Mr Nixon recounted details of the unrest on Sunday night and described the events as very difficult and dangerous as a result of a violent criminal element intent upon terrorizing the communityYet Mr Nixon also emphasized that the Guards role would be limited to providing protection for the police command center which the authorities say was attacked Gregory Mason a brigadier general of the Guard described the arriving troops as well trained and well seasonedWith these additional resources in place said Mr Nixon a Democrat in his second term the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local law enforcement will continue to respond appropriately to incidents of lawlessness and violence and protect the civil rights of all peaceful citizens to make their voices heardWhile Mr Obama and other leaders called for healing and more than 40 FBI agents fanned out around the city to interview residents about the shooting emotions remained raw and the divide over all that had happened seemed only to be growing amid multiple investigations and competing demonstrationsA recent survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press showed that Americans were deeply divided along racial lines in their reaction to Mr Browns killing It showed that 80 percent of blacks thought the case raised important issues about race that need to be discussed while only 37 percent of whites thought it didBlacks surveyed were also less confident in the investigations into the shooting with 76 percent reporting little to no confidence compared with 33 percent of whitesSupporters of Darren Wilson the Ferguson police officer who fired the fatal shots gathered outside a radio station in St Louis over the weekendMr Brown is now the subject of three autopsies The first was conducted by St Louis County and the results were delivered to the county prosecutors office on Monday That report showed evidence of marijuana in Mr Browns system according to a person briefed on the report who was not authorized to discuss it publicly before it was releasedAnother autopsy on Monday was done by a military doctor as part of the Justice Departments investigationOn Sunday at the request of Mr Browns family the body was examined by Dr Michael M Baden a former New York City medical examinerDr Badens autopsy showed that Mr Brown was shot at least six times in the front of his body and that he did not appear to have been shot from very close range because no powder burns were found on his body But that determination could change if burns are found on his clothing which was not available for examinationIn a news conference on Monday the Brown familys lawyer Benjamin L Crump said that the autopsy confirmed witness accounts that Mr Brown was trying to surrender when he was killedDaryl Parks another lawyer for the family said the autopsy proved that the officer should have been arrested The bullet that killed Mr Brown entered the top of his head and came out through the front at an angle that suggested he was facing downward when he was killed Mr Parks said The autopsy did not show what Mr Brown was doing when the bullet struck his headWhy would he be shot in the very top of his head a 6foot4 man Mr Parks said It makes no sense And so thats what we have Thats why we believe that those two things alone are ample for this officer to be arrestedPiaget Crenshaw a resident who told reporters that she had witnessed Mr Browns death from her nearby apartment seemed unsurprised by the eruptions of anger which have left schools closed and some businesses looted This community had underlying problems way before this happened Ms Crenshaw said And now the tension is finally brokenFor businesses here the days and long nights have been costly and frightening At Dellena Joness hair salon demonstrators tossed concrete slabs into the business as Ms Joness two children prepared for what they had expected to be a first day back to schoolI had a full week that went down to really nothing she said of her business which has been mostly empty Theyre too scared to come As she spoke a man walked by and shouted You need a gun in there ladyIn his news conference Mr Obama said that most protesters had been peaceful As Americans

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/a-mother-lifts-her-son-slowly-from-heroins-abyss.html,SPARTA NJ   When Gail Morris came home late one night after taking her daughter to college she saw her teenage son Alex asleep on the sofa in the family room Nothing seemed amiss An unfinished glass of apple juice sat on the table She tucked him in under a blanket and went to bedThe next morning he would not wake up He was stiff and was hardly breathing Over the next several hours Ms Morris was shocked to learn that her son had overdosed on heroin She was told he would not surviveHe did survive but barely He was in a coma for six weeks He went blind and had no function in his arms or legs He could not speak or swallow Hospitalized for 14 months Alex who is 6foot1 dropped to 90 pounds One of his doctors said that Alex had come as close to dying as anyone he knew who had not actually diedMost people who overdose on heroin either die or fully recover But Alex plunged into a state that was neither dead nor functionalThere are no national statistics on how often opioid overdose leads to cases like Alexs but doctors say they worry that with the dramatic increase in heroin abuse and overdoses they will see more such outcomesI would expect that we will said Dr Nora Volkow director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse They are starting to report isolated cases like this And I would not be surprised if you have more intermediate cases with more subtle impairmentMore than 660000 Americans used heroin in 2012 the federal government says double the number of five years earlier Officials attribute much of the increase to a crackdown on prescription painkillers prompting many users to turn to heroin which is cheaper and easier to get than other opioidsHeroin deaths across the country have soared From 2011 to 2012 they rose 200 percent in Louisiana 60 percent in Ohio and 300 percent in Maine On Long Island east of New York City more than 220 people died from heroin in 2012 and 2013 the most everEveryone focuses on death because its so dramatic Dr Volkow said And so attention hasnt been paid to the followup consequences that may emerge when someone actually survivesAlex overdosed in 2001 when he was just 17 Today after 13 difficult years he has regained some cognition but still cannot get out of bed bathe or dress without help His mother who is divorced has become his fulltime caretaker And her life  she was an executive for Citibank and traveled the world  has become circumscribed by his needsStill one of the doctors who treated Alex early said he was luckyThe ones who survive that I have taken care of  many are in a minimally conscious state or a vegetative state said Dr Caroline O McCagg who is associate medical director of rehabilitation medicine at the JFK Medical Center in Edison NJ and oversees patients with brain trauma Some get better but cognitively they are so impaired that their communication is limited and their ability to live in the community is unlikelyShe calls their condition a living deathThey dont always come back all the way she said Ive had patients for 10 or 15 years who are just in limbo But the family cant let them go Death would be kind in some instancesAlex has made more progress than anyone predicted While he still cannot stand on his own and must use a wheelchair he no longer requires a specialized chair with restraints His left hand works He has regained some vision He can swallow and even speak in fact his cognitive functioning is fairly high considering what he has been through and he communicates well enough to reveal a quick intelligence and flashes of humorBut the promise of his young life  he excelled at math and loved to play guitar  appears dashed He once dreamed of playing in a band he now dreams of being able to walkAlex had learned his multiplication tables when he was three and scored 700 on his math SATs Today he can hardly add though he occasionally recalls his calculus and watches television programs on topics like string theoryHis brain is Swiss cheese his mother said It is full of holesOne of those holes is the time immediately before he overdosed in April 2001 at his home hereAlex has no recollection of it His mother said she thought this must have been his first time He had an afterschool job that required him to take a drug test and only three months before the overdose his drug test had been clean But after his overdose the police found heroin packs hidden under a false bottom in his bedroom dresser along with packets of marijuana and pills They found no needles leading police to surmise he had snorted the powderMs Morris and Alex no longer ask why he turned to drugs She offers theories that he cannot corroborate He was an introvert and had been bullied at school he was moody and wanted to ease the pain he thought heroin would expand his music appreciationIn the emergency room he received two rounds of an antidote probably naloxone which can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose It is now being widely distributed to emergency medical workers and even family members and has saved thousands of lives In Alexs case he received it too late and it did not workHe ended up in the same intensive care unit at the local community hospital as Karen Ann Quinlan the young woman at the center of one of the nations first major righttodie debates in the mid1970s Ms Quinlan had fallen into a coma after a night of drugs and alcohol After a year in which her doctors said she suffered from irreversible brain damage and was in a persistent vegetative state she was taken off her respirator She lived for nine years before dying of natural causesJulia Quinlan Karen Anns mother heard about Alexs overdose and called Ms Morris She was very helpful Ms Morris recalled Mrs Quinlan helped her think about her options and what might lie ahead But mostly Ms Morris sat by her comatose son in the hospital willing him to live by softly chanting what she calls the parents prayer Take from me and give to himAfter emerging from his coma Alex was transferred to the acute brain trauma unit at JFK Medical Center where he stayed for three months and then he spent 10 months in the medical centers extended brain trauma unitAt the age when Alex had been expected to follow his sister into an Ivy League college he instead could do little but breathe Instead of becoming independent he became completely dependent He is now 30 and his mother is 66 They are an inseparable pair their lives intertwined in every way She tends to the minutiae of his every waking momentTheir symbiosis is reflected in their pas de deux when Ms Morris helps Alex transfer from bed to wheelchair from wheelchair to toilet from wheelchair to sitting chair Her legs straddle his while she pulls him up and he grasps her arms She is careful to position herself so that if his legs go into a spasm they will not clutch her in a vise When she has him up they stand for a moment as if in an embrace before she turns him to another chairAnd they seem to have a kind of mind meld Ms Morris was saying that introverts like her son often felt in high school like they were being policed But as she spoke she knew that policed was not quite the word she wanted and Alex who was listening intently sensed it too Monitored he offered That was the word she was looking forBraininjured people cant always find the right word she said But sometimes I feel like weve flipped and Alex fills in the blanks for meHe is also funny At one point Ms Morris said she had despaired of researchers who like to note that more people die from smoking cigarettes than from using heroin This prompted Alex to laugh and paraphrase the comedian George Burns who constantly smoked a cigar My doctors who told me that smoking would kill me are all dead nowIn between exercises therapies and trips to the doctor Ms Morris and Alex find time for a few activities that do not relate to his condition They traveled recently to Baltimore to see an exhibit on Archimedes the Greek mathematician They attend classes together at the Apple Store They also go to a local Toastmasters club where people learn public speaking and are critiqued by other members Ms Morris said it was good therapy for Alex to see Mom get critiqued for a changeIn recent months they developed a cooking project called Helping Hands Chefs to help people like Alex with dexterity issues Over the years Ms Morris has perfected many techniques from putting peas in mashed potatoes so that they do not roll off a fork to grinding cinnamon sugar onto bananas making the pieces less slippery so Alex can pick them upNow she is sharing those techniques through a blog videos a cookbook and by giving cooking lessons to others who take care of people who have difficulty feeding themselvesMs Morris hopes the project will provide some financial security for Alexs future which is constantly on her mind He receives disability income now through his fathers retirement Ms Morris is healthy and strong but knows she will not live forever Her immediate goal is for her son to be able to move from chair to chair by himself and someday to walk with a caneI hope that I hold out long enough that we can get him to be independent and hes trying as hard as he can she said If he does not learn to walk she said he could end up in a nursing home She is still searching for a way that he might become selfsupportingAsked how he envisioned his future Alex said quietly I dont have an answer for thatPeople often think of taking heroin as like Russian roulette Ms Morris said because you never know what you are going to get But to her mind taking heroin is more like being a suicide bomberNot only are you affecting your own life but the shrapnel that is produced goes to the people you love the most she saidWhen youre thinking of getting high you really should be thinking that youre taking a hot coal and putting it in your loved ones body she said If you die that pain will be with your loved one forever But these other outcomes can also be incredibly painful and arduous for whoever has to deal with

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/19/us/ferguson-missouri-protests.html,FERGUSON Mo  Missouri National Guard troops entered this battered city on Monday even as an overnight curfew was lifted the latest in a series of quickly shifting attempts to quell the violence that has upended this St Louis suburb for more than a weekIn the days since an unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was shot to death by a white police officer here on Aug 9 an array of state and local law enforcement authorities have swerved from one approach to another taking to the streets in militarystyle vehicles and riot gear then turning over power to a State Highway Patrol official who permitted the protests and marched along then calling for a curfewEarly Monday after a new spate of violence Gov Jay Nixon said he was bringing in the National Guard Hours later he said he was lifting the curfew and said the Guard would have only a limited role protecting the police command postAt the same time more details emerged from autopsies performed on Mr Brown One showed that he had been shot at least six times another found evidence of marijuana in his systemIn Washington President Obama said Attorney General Eric H Holder Jr will go to Ferguson on Wednesday to meet with FBI agents conducting a federal civil rights investigation into the shooting He seemed less than enthusiastic about the decision to call in the National GuardMr Obama said he had told the governor in a phone call on Monday that the Guard should be used in a limited and appropriate wayHe said he would be closely monitoring the deploymentIll be watching over the next several days to assess whether in fact its helping rather than hindering progress in Ferguson said Mr Obama who emphasized that the State of Missouri not the White House had called in the GuardHe again tried to strike a balance between the right of protest and approaches to securityWhile I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown giving in to that anger by looting or carrying guns and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions Mr Obama saidAs darkness set in along West Florissant Avenue one of the citys main thoroughfares and a center of the weeklong protests demonstrators were required to keep moving There were several skirmishesAfter more of than hour of peaceful protests some in the crowd began to throw bottles at police who brought out armored vehicles and tactical units But many peacekeepers in the crowd formed a human chain and got the agitators to back downAt another point as protesters gathered near a convenience store some of them threw objects police responded with stun grenades and tear gasA few blocks away at the police command post National Guard members in Army fatigues some with military police patches on their uniforms stood readyResidents seemed puzzled and frustrated by the continually changing approaches suggesting that the moving set of rules only worsened longstanding tensions over policing and race in the town of 21000It almost seems like they cant decide what to do and like law enforcement is fighting over whos got the power said Antione Watson 37 who stood near a middleofthestreet memorial of candles and flowers for Mr Brown the 18yearold killed on a winding block hereFirst they do this then theres that and now who can even tell what their plan is Mr Watson said They can try all of this but I dont see an end to this until there are charges against the copThe latest turn in law enforcement tactics  the removal of a midnightto5 am curfew imposed Saturday and the arrival of members of the Guard  followed one of the tensest nights so far Police officers reported gunfire and firebombs from some among a large group and responded with tear gas smoke canisters and rubber bulletsBy Monday the police seemed intent on taking control of the situation long before evening and the expected arrival of protesters some of them inclined to provoke clashes The authorities banned stationary protests even during the day ordering demonstrators to continue walking particularly in an area along West Florissant not far from where the shooting occurred One of those told to move along was the Rev Jesse L JacksonSix members of the Highway Patrol plastic flexties within easy reach stood guard at a barbecue restaurant that has been a hub of the turmoil Just north of the restaurant about 30 officers surrounded a convenience store that was heavily damaged early in the unrest Several people were arrested during the day including a photographer for Getty Images Scott Olson who was led away in plastic handcuffs in the early eveningExplaining his decision to call in the National Guard Mr Nixon recounted details of the tumult on Sunday night and described the events as very difficult and dangerous as a result of a violent criminal element intent upon terrorizing the communityYet Mr Nixon also emphasized that the Guards role would be limited to providing protection for a police command center here which the authorities say came under attack Gregory Mason a brigadier general of the Guard described the arriving troops as well trained and well seasonedWith these additional resources in place said Mr Nixon a Democrat in his second term the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local law enforcement will continue to respond appropriately to incidents of lawlessness and violence and protect the civil rights of all peaceful citizens to make their voices heardWhile Mr Obama and other leaders called for healing and more than 40 FBI agents fanned out around this city to interview residents about the shooting emotions remained raw and the divide over all that had happened seemed only to be growing amid multiple investigations and competing demonstrationsA recent survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press showed that Americans were deeply divided along racial lines in their reaction to Mr Browns killing The report showed that 80 percent of blacks thought the case raised important issues about race that need to be discussed while only 37 percent of whites thought it didBlacks surveyed were also less confident in the investigations into the shooting with 76 percent reporting little to no confidence in the investigation compared with 33 percent of whitesSupporters of Darren Wilson the Ferguson police officer who fired the fatal shots gathered outside a radio station over the weekend in St LouisMr Brown is now the subject of three autopsies The first was conducted by St Louis County the results of which were delivered to the county prosecutors office on Monday That autopsy report showed evidence of marijuana in Mr Browns system according to someone briefed on the report who was not authorized to discuss it publicly before it was releasedAnother on Monday was done by a military doctor as part of the Justice Departments investigationOn Sunday at the request of Mr Browns family the body was examined by Dr Michael Baden a former New York City medical examinerThe findings showed that he was shot at least six times in the front of his body and that he did not appear to have been shot from very close range because no powder burns were found on his body But that determination could change if burns were found on his clothing which was not available for examinationIn a news conference on Monday the Brown family lawyer Benjamin L Crump said that the autopsy he had performed confirmed witness accounts that Mr Brown was trying to surrender when he was killedDaryl Parks another lawyer for the family said the autopsy proved that the officer should have been arrested The bullet that killed Mr Brown entered the top of his head and came out through the front at an angle that suggested he was facing downward when he was killed Mr Parks said The autopsy did not show what Mr Brown was doing when the bullet struck his headWhy would he be shot in the very top of his head a 6foot4 man Mr Parks said It makes no sense And so thats what we have Thats why we believe that those two things alone are ample for this officer to be arrestedPiaget Crenshaw who told reporters that she had witnessed Mr Browns death from her nearby apartment seemed unsurprised by the eruptions of anger which have left schools closed and some businesses looted This community had underlying problems way before this happened Ms Crenshaw said And now the tension is finally brokenFor businesses here the days and long nights have been costly and frightening At Dellena Joness hair salon demonstrators had tossed concrete slabs into the business as Ms Joness two children prepared for what they had expected to be a first day back to schoolI had a full week that went down to really nothing she said of her business which has sat mostly empty Theyre too scared to come As she spoke a man walked by and shouted You need a gun in there ladyIn his news conference Mr Obama said that most of the protesters had been peaceful As Americans weve got to use this moment to seek out our shared humanity thats been laid bare by this moment Mr Obama

NYT,http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/behind-the-cover-story-robert-draper-on-the-tentative-future-of-libertarianism/,Robert Draper a contributing writer for the magazine wrote this weeks cover story about the rise of libertarianism Draper is the author of When the Tea Party Came to Town His last article for the magazine was about Wendy DavisDid you see or hear something in particular that made you think it was time to write about libertariansIm tempted to say that this article amounted to a lifestyle choice on my part being that libertarians as a general rule are fun and quotable In truth Id been thinking about libertarians ever since Rand Pauls filibuster last year to protest the notion of drone missiles being used domestically and in a broader sense the surveillance state Ted Cruzs filibuster a few months later may have catalyzed the government shutdown but it had not roiled the Twittersphere or jolted the GOP establishment the way Pauls performance had Arguably not since the days of Reagan had a Republican sparked the imagination of young Americans So I asked myself What does this say about Paul about millennials and about the Republican party Exploring that question brought me to the hypothesis that America had arrived at a libertarian moment one that could bring young voters into the GOPs camp  though only if the party does more than simply pay lip service to the movementAre libertarians taking a new enough tack to really attract a bigger tent How far could they go before alienating their baseAs weve seen in the past two presidential election cycles the Republican Partys base problem presents a fundamental dilemma Given that the GOPs core constituency middleage white males is a shrinking demographic how does it appeal to other voting groups without alienating its loyal followers Herein lies what David Frum called the libertarian temptation On the one hand Americans especially young voters increasingly favor gay marriage decriminalization of marijuana and less foreign adventurism  all libertarian positions On the other hand the GOP has long been propped up by the threelegged stool of not only fiscal austerity but also military hawkishness and social conservatism the latter two legs of which do not feel especially supported by libertarians Its a tricky balancing act  and as I outline in the article Rand Pauls attempt to pull it off is both novel and precariousYou interviewed several young women for this article Do libertarians seem to have less of a white oldman problem than the GOPTraditionally libertarianism was even more of a bastion of white males than the Republican Party  in part because its feeders were the maledominated habitats of laissezfaire economics scifi survivalism and video games The acolytes of the libertarian writer and Objectivist philosopher Ayn Rand were and are primarily young men Back in the late90s when Kennedy the former MTV personality pronounced herself a libertarian she had almost no female friends in that tribe Now there are the Sex and the State blogger Cathy Reisenwitz the YouTube ranter Julie Borowski and several other prominent female libertarians Still young women happen to be among the demographic groups that are most approving of an active governmental presence in American life and correspondingly among the least apt to applaud the goitalone ethos championed by Reisenwitz and other libertarian puristsSeveral people in your article including Paul himself mention Silicon Valley as a constituency And yet that group has been notable so far for its political noninvolvement Has anyone from Silicon Valley donated to the libertariansWell theyve donated to causes that could be viewed as libertarian like marijuana decriminalization But until Pauls arrival on the scene there has never been a plausible presidential candidate including his father Ron whose supporters were animated by the goals of getting the elder Paul in every GOP debate and through the entire primary process rather than by the quixotic notion of a Ron Paul presidency Still both parties acknowledge that the Silicon Valley electorate is a swing group which is why Congressman Jared Polis the Democrats closest thing to a libertarian on the Hill from Boulder Colo told me that Nancy Pelosi applauds him publicly supporting Bitcoin the rollback of NSA powers and other positions associated with the movementAre there any statistics or did you get a sense of the age profiles of libertariansAs I saw during my four months of reporting for this story libertarianism has many camps Some are anarchocapitalists who advocate communalism over government Some are motivated by regulatory and fiscal minimalism For others the animating factor is governments intrusion into our personal life whether by NSA surveillance or by marital restrictions As the Reason Foundation pollster Emily Ekins found over half of millennial voters arent wedded to either party and tend to lean to the left on social issues while slightly to the right on economic ones Ron Pauls 2008 and 2012 campaigns were fueled by the grassroots support of college students who had that sort of libertarian profile But presumably many of those Paul supporters got tired of supporting someone who stood no chance of winning Well see if Rand Paul  who famously visited Berkeley and received a standing ovation for his speech on privacy  makes libertarian Republicans out of young voters who have been alienated by the GOPs stances on social issuesShort of gaining a lot more votes than they ever have the only way for libertarians to affect national politics is to pull one party the GOP being the obvious candidate in their direction What would they need in order to do thatEarlier this summer I attended the Libertarian Partys national convention in Columbus Ohio and sat at the dinner banquet with the New Jersey delegation I asked my tablemates if they could find it within themselves to support Rand Paul should he become the GOPs presidential nominee The delegates were stunned by the question support a Republican rather than the partys chosen candidate To them Rand Paul was just another standardissue conservative politician who would likely be beholden to the big donors who backed him And at the libertarian outdoor festival Porcfest I found many supporters of Ron Paul but none for his son For that matter Nick Gillespie the editor of Reason told me that he would have to look at his platform before deciding whether to support candidate Rand Paul Meanwhile Republican stalwarts like John McCain and Lindsey Graham have taken potshots at Paul their Senate colleague while over in the House the libertarian movements current darling Congressman Justin Amash is viewed with unalloyed contempt by GOP House leaders All of which is to say that libertarians and Republicans generally dont play well together So Rand Paul has his work cut out for him,2014-08-11T05:30:39Z,drugs

serpentine roads of the Cascade Mountains in Oregon The fresh basil my dad bought as a car freshener is wilting on the dash adding to the smells from our dirtcovered clothes rich with the odors of helping out at a friends farmThis is our last big stretch in a sixweek summer vacation I crossed 3365 miles with my sister and my parents now asleep in the back resting their heads on the stack of clothes and food that has created a thick median between themMy life has always been a trip Im actually the only one in my family who currently has a home a Brooklyn loft I share with three roommates When this family road trip began my sister had just returned from a ninemonth trip to Europe where she tried out rural life in Ireland Before she left she shed her home in Los Angeles where she is an actress My parents had been on the road for almost a year traveling and looking for the next place to land for a bit at leastOur lives have been this way in constant motion and flux since I was 9It began when we were living in Tucson having moved there to be closer to my dads family My mother wanted a bigger safer car in which to drive us to school One day on the way home I spotted the most perfect vehicle that a 9yearold GratefulDeadTshirtwearing child could ever imagine a 21foot Toyota Dolphin motor home with a For Sale sign My mother and sister were just as excited as I was and so we rushed home to get my dad The four of us drove back to look at the Dolphin and as we got out of our small car and my dad took in what was before him he gasped Betsy you cant take the kids to school in that thing Its a house If we bought that thing wed have to change our whole lifestyleThen as if I had just done a Vulcan mindmeld his gaze turned to awe and he muttered Id like to change our lifestyleThis wasnt completely out of the blue My parents were part of the Woodstock generation and both had backgrounds in experimental living and education Dad was once the director of such newage educational centers as Interface Foundation in Boston and the Omega Institute for Holistic Studies in Rhinebeck NY and both my folks lived in the Findhorn ecovillage in Scotland but at different times The fact that my parents were born next door to each other but didnt connect until their early 30s is a whole other story As alternative as our lifestyle already was in Tucson Dad was yearning to turn our family years into a life of adventure Within two months my parents pulled my sister and me out of school out of our cohousing community filled with hippies and artists and into both the Toyota motor home and the great unknown of the open road before usMy dad a psychotherapist who was winding down his inperson clients and becoming a pioneer in doing that sort of work on the phone fitted our motor home with every tool book art supply and seed of adventure imaginable including sushimaking utensils and the entire Beatles and Grateful Dead discography Cassidy and I earned our Junior Ranger badges at just about every national park in the country All of us became renaissance clowns when we traveled with a caravan of politically oriented storytelling circus performers from festival to festivalWe learned American history how to read maps and geography by seeing our country We also learned practical skills like how to sew work leather lead others and remove rattlesnakes from harms way There was no TV to watch but we did lots of art lots of bad art mostly During these years we would hike canyons raft rivers build fairy houses and attend Rainbow Gatherings with thousands of really nice hippies in the woods My parents believed in selfdirected education and my sister and I were unschooled a movement of education started in the 70s by John Holt Traveling at such a young age taught us to quickly adapt to the world around us and to coexist in communities and cultures incredibly different from oursThe endless summer ended when I was 12 years old I started wanting to see the same friends every day and settle down I loved being on the road but I found myself wanting more stability more space from my family and more of a stationary social life As much as my folks loved how we had been living they respected that their daughters had outgrown our small motor home and needed a more stable base We settled in Paonia Colo the town where everyone in my family found what they wanted and the town that I will forever consider my hometownBut we learned that settle isnt exactly an accurate term for us Within a few years my family was dispersed and living in different states At 12 my sister was discovered while acting in a local play and moved with my dad to Hollywood to pursue an acting career Within three months she landed a part on the hit HBO show Entourage which kept her busy for the next seven years while my mother stayed with me until I graduated Eventually I found myself on the other side of the camera ending up in Central America India Zuccotti Park rap concerts limousines fracking sites and the like drawn into the center of movements documenting revolutions as they unfolded around meThis past summer was the longest time we had all been together on the road since our life in that Toyota Dolphin Cassidy and I 22 and 25 joined our parents in that small Sentra ending up after six weeks in that special hometown of ours  Paonia ColoHeading west from New York City with two destinations in mind  the Oregon Country Fair and the North Fork Valley hippie reunion held near Paonia  it felt as if we were in an Apolloera space capsule crammed with all we needed to survive the long trip Inside the car the emotional oxygen would sometimes get a little thin and lots of mini battles were foughtDuring this trip our biggest fight was about my photography I wanted full access to my family and assuming this would be easier than getting full access to 50 Cent I was surprised when Cassidy would get mad at me when I photographed her premakeup waking up in bad moods on the phoneArriving in Eugene Ore was like docking on the mother ship of the hippie utopia that is the West Coast My parents had been able to get us all on as nonpaid staff members at the Oregon Country Fair which takes places in nearby Veneta My dad offered counseling in the Altared Advice corner of Altared Space a spiritual hub of the fair which is more of a village of conscious and loving people than what you might think of as a fair My mother Cassidy and I tended to the sacred fire and guided people in making prayer sticks We camped with the Altared Space crew in a fairytale rain forest of tinkerbell villages and laser light shows that was sparsely inhabited by the various crews who made up whats been estimated as a staff of 20000At the fair we ran into old friends who 13 years ago created the Faerieworlds festival an annual music and arts festival with a realm of the faerie theme Though we had intended to head to the Oregon coast after the Fair they gave us passes to Faerieworlds so we went there hanging out backstage with incredible bands and eating wonderful foodThe trip was nothing short of transformative and its hard to determine if the peak was the fair Faerieworlds a day of Hakomi therapy trimming marijuana plants in Eugene visiting friends in Portland Corvallis Ashland or Boulder spending time back in Paonia or simply being together committing to true family intimacyAfter the trip to commemorate our newly found adult sister closeness Cassidy and I decided to get matching tattoos Im nearly a blank canvas except for the small writing I have on

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/world/middleeast/american-fighting-for-isis-is-killed-in-syria.html,WASHINGTON  Like many teenage boys who grew up in the Midwest in the 1990s Douglas McAuthur McCain was a fan of Michael Jordans Chicago Bulls and loved to play basketballBut as he grew older he lost interest in basketball as he shuttled between two suburban Minneapolis high schools He never graduated and in his late teens he began to have runins with the law In the decade that followed he was arrested or cited nine times on charges including theft marijuana possession and driving without a licenseMr McCain moved back and forth from Minneapolis to San Diego and then abroad Officials now know he ended up in Syria where three days ago Mr McCain became the first American to die while fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria He was 33The rebels who killed him were fighting for the Free Syrian Army a rival group backed by the United States and they went on to behead six ISIS fighters  but not Mr McCain  and then posted the photographs on FacebookMr McCains death provides new insight for the authorities as they try to learn more about ISIS and identify the Americans who have joined a group that has vowed to remake the Middle East and establish an Islamic caliphate And it is a sign that ISIS at least in this case is willing to use Americans on the battlefield in the Middle East rather than sending them back to the United States to launch attacks as Western officials have fearedHis death is further evidence that Americans are going there to fight for ISIS rather than to train as terrorists to attack at home said Richard Barrett a former British intelligence officer who is now a vice president at the Soufan Group security consultants in New York Nor does it appear that ISIS regards Americans as assets that are too valuable to risk on the front line rather than to keep in reserve for terrorist attacks or propaganda purposesThis incident Mr Barrett added also confirms that American and presumably other foreign fighters are prepared to attack where directed by ISIS Some of those attacks he said will be aimed at the forces of President Bashar alAssad of Syria but not all of themThey are going to join ISIS not the fight for the future of Syria Mr Barrett saidIn recent weeks ISIS has become one of the top national security preoccupations of the Obama administration And the news of Mr McCains death comes amid public anger over the beheading of the American journalist James Foley an act that added urgency to the Obama administrations deliberations to expand its air campaign against ISIS into SyriaSenior administration officials and lawmakers have described ISIS as one of the most serious threats the United States has faced since the Sept 11 2001 attacks by Al Qaeda and some believe the group is determined to attack in the United StatesAmerican officials said Tuesday that Mr McCains case highlighted the difficulty of identifying Americans who want to travel to Syria to fight alongside rebels When the United States faced a similar problem with Somalis several years ago it was far easier for the authorities to identify those who wanted to travel there to fight because that conflict mostly attracted Somalis And Somalis live in just a few cities in the United StatesBut the Syrian conflict has attracted people from all different ages and parts of the United States  including many with no connection to SyriaIn May Moner Mohammad Abusalha a 22yearold Florida man who had traveled to Syria to join the Nusra Front died in a suicide bomb attack He had an American mother and a Palestinian father A year earlier Nicole Lynn Mansfield 33 of Flint Mich was killed with Syrian rebels in Idlib ProvinceThe federal authorities learned only after he arrived in the country that Mr McCain had traveled to Syria according to senior American officials In response the American authorities included him on a watch list of potential terrorism suspects maintained by the federal government Had Mr McCain tried to reenter the country he would have almost certainly faced an extra level of scrutiny before boarding any commercial airliner bound for the United States the officials saidIt is not clear how Mr McCain was recruited by ISIS and traveled to Syria According to his Facebook page he went to Canada and Sweden last year Many Americans and Europeans who have ended up in Syria have tried to disguise their travels by passing through other countries before heading to Turkey and crossing over its porous border with SyriaHis posts on Twitter where he went by the name Duale Khalid give clues to his mindset In one message from December 2012 he said that the movie The Help which is about black maids in the South made him hate white people Other posts disparaged Somalis and gaysIt was on Twitter that he also discussed religion He said that he was a convert to Islam and that it was the best thing that had ever happened to him Its funny to me how all these so call Muslim claim that they love Allah but always curse the one who try to implement his laws he said in one postAccording to SITE an intelligence group that monitors jihadist websites Mr McCain also appeared to grow more comfortable with the idea of losing his life in battle Ya Allah when its my time to go have mercy on my soul have mercy on my bros he said on TwitterThe Obama administration released a statement on Tuesday evening confirming his deathThe fight in which Mr McCain was killed occurred in the northern city of Marea where ISIS and the rebels had been fighting for control in recent weeks according to members of the Free Syrian ArmyMr McCain and two other ISIS fighters  a Tunisian and an Egyptian  sneaked up on a group of Free Syrian Army rebels killing two of them The other militants responded killing Mr McCain and dozens of ISIS fighters When the rebels went through Mr McCains clothes they found his American passport and several hundred dollars in cash His death was first reported by NBC NewsMuch of Mr McCains childhood was spent in New Hope Minn a Minneapolis suburb where he lived in a threebedroom apartment with his parents and two siblings according to Isaac Chase a longtime friend and neighborMr McCain was the middle child and his mother worked as a cashier at a nearby supermarket Mr Chase said She attended church every week he saidAs Mr McCain grew older he lost interest in basketball got several tattoos and lost a tooth He stuck around here Mr Chase said I dont think he knew what he wanted to doIt was around that time that Mr McCains father died He lost his anchor he saidWhen Mr Chase last saw Mr McCain in 2008 he said that it was not clear that Mr McCain was working and he appeared as though he was using

ecigarette companies that appear to be using some of the same advertising tactics that once drew young adults into smoking a Kentucky deputy attorney general told his law enforcement colleagues gathered here for a retreat to discuss emerging legal issues in states nationwideThe gathering of nearly two dozen attorneys general and senior members of their staffs came on the 20th anniversary of the initiation of the historic lawsuit that states filed against tobacco companies  resulting ultimately in an approximately 10 billion annual payment which is still being made and an agreement to restrict advertising everywhere from outdoor billboards to sports events to try to curtail the appeal of tobacco to youthsSean Riley the chief deputy attorney general of Kentucky told his law enforcement colleagues that Kentucky had left behind its status as the state with the highest percentage of youth smokers But he said he was concerned that ecigarette advertising could reverse that progress He cited several examplesHe said that the nicotine in ecigarettes was not healthy for young people and that ecigarettes whose use has surged among schoolage children nationwide might be turning into a gateway to cigarette smoking instead of a way to quitWe are at the very beginning stages of a new sort of revolutionary product here Mr Riley said We need to be prepared to work individually and collectively to use our consumer protection acts to raise the floor of conduct we are seeingJeffrey Weiss the general counsel at NJOY an independently owned ecigarette company said he agreed that the state and federal authorities must move to adopt regulations appropriately governing ecigarettes such as limiting sales to youthsBut he said that the industrys growth was actually a public health boon given the role that ecigarettes can play in helping people quit smoking cancercausing tobacco cigarettesWe can save millions of lives Mr Weiss saidAttorney General Tom Miller of Iowa a Democrat who has been in office since the tobacco case was settled in 1998 said that law enforcement officials must tread carefullyThe price of getting it wrong either way is high Mr Miller told his colleagues He noted that if they did not regulate the industry properly ecigarettes might increase tobacco use among youths but that if they regulated it too intensely it might limit the effectiveness of ecigarettes as a way to quit tobaccoAmong the problems with the ecigarette industry according to Mr Riley and other senior law enforcement officials at the meeting are ecigarettes with flavors like Cherry Crush and Peach Schnapps which are sold by the ecigarette company Blu and may be particularly appealing to childrenA letter signed by 40 state attorneys general last year urged the federal Food and Drug Administration to regulate ecigarettes addressing issues like advertising ingredients and sale to minorsBut the attorneys general already have the power under consumer protection laws to intervene against companies that make inappropriate health claims or sell items like nicotine refill cartridges that are not properly packaged to prevent them from being accidentally opened by a child and consumed Mr Riley saidMr Riley and Matthew L Myers president of the Campaign for TobaccoFree Kids both ran through a series of recent ecigarette advertisements that echo techniques once used by tobacco companies like cartoon characters that are using ecigarettes or advertisements that feature celebrities like Courtney Love and Robert PattinsonThe ecigarette industry has also started advertising at sporting events where tobacco ads are banned The problems are particularly acute the officials said with less traditional forms of advertising like on YouTube and other social media sitesToday as a result of the failure of the government to act swiftly the marketplace for ecigarettes is truly the Wild West Mr Myers saidOne question debated at the gathering this week has been whether state attorneys general should try to force ecigarette companies to comply with the same standards imposed on tobacco companies a proposal to which Mr Weiss of NJOY strongly objectedNJOY which intends to release its own line of flavored ecigarettes soon also objected to any move to try to limit the use of these flavors Mr Weiss said industrysponsored research had shown that tobacco smokers were much more likely to completely quit smoking when they used a flavored ecigaretteDavid B Abrams a researcher at the Legacy program which was funded by the tobacco settlement and does research to encourage the reduction of smoking told the attorneys general that medical research had shown that ecigarettes appeared to be about as effective as nicotine replacement therapy in helping people quit smoking But data also show that ecigarette use among youths who tried them at least once doubled from 2011 to 2012 reaching about 68 percentWhile gathered here in Park City for a retreat sponsored by the Conference of Western Attorneys General the law enforcement officials also talked about how best to deal with the legalization of marijuana taking place in certain statesAttorneys general from Washington State and Colorado where marijuana has recently been broadly legalized briefed other officials about problems they said they had encountered They cited edible marijuana products that are packaged in a way that can be appealing to children and that have insufficient labeling resulting in consumers eating an excessive amount of the drug and at times leading to accidents and even deathsAttorney General John W Suthers of Colorado said that the percentage of fatal car accidents attributed to marijuana use had jumped to 15 percent from 8 percent in the last three years He urged other attorneys general to prepare for possible legalization in their statesI encourage you not to be smug Mr Suthers who opposed the legalization said Its coming your way This is a very wellfinanced and wellorganized movement,2014-07-23T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/magazine/delivery-start-ups-are-back-like-its-1999.html,Last year I was excited to hear about a new startup in San Francisco that delivered cheap bottles of wine within an hour It was called Rewinery and it was fantastic I ordered a 5 malbec one day and a 10 chardonnay the next delivered by bike courier for a modest fee Already San Francisco was crawling with bikes inching up the hills shuttling sushi and groceries and new clothes all summoned with the tap of a finger But Rewinery was the first of the delivery startups that made me feel the way I felt back in 2000 when I could order a video and a pint of ice cream to my doorstep from Kozmocom Rewinery felt too good to be trueIt was One day seeking refreshment I opened the app to find that Rewinery had gone out of businessIn the tech crash of the early 2000s ondemand delivery services like Kozmo and Webvan werent just among the most colossal failures They also became a sort of grim joke symbolizing the excess that portended the bust Afterward conventional wisdom hardened Webenabled delivery was not a good business because it simply cost too much to build warehouses manage an inventory and pay drivers There was too little opportunity to recoup expenditures in delivery fees people will pay only so much for toilet paper to be delivered before they decide to fetch it themselvesBut something is in the air of late making hindsight blurry Despite the early demise of Rewinery and the shrunken ambitions of others such as eBay Now similar startups with names like Caviar SpoonRocket and DoorDash have raised half a billion dollars in investment in the last year according to CB Insights which tracks venture capital Even Louis Borders the founder of Webvan as well as the Borders bookstore chain another Internet casualty is at work on a grocery delivery startup Uber is using the 14 billion it just raised to expand beyond delivering people to delivering things Meanwhile venture capitalists joke that every other entrepreneur they meet pitches an Uber for X bringing goods and services on demand laundry Washio ice cream Ice Cream Life marijuana Eaze and so on Investors are stuck wondering whether this is 2000 all over again or whether this new breed of delivery startups can succeed where the last crop so famously failedJohn A Deighton a Harvard Business School professor who wrote a case study on Webvan likes to compare the delivery business to shining shoes You make as much profit on one shoe as you do on a thousand shoes he said Theres just no scale In years past it was difficult for Deighton to even teach his students about Webvan because its fatal flaws were so obvious They didnt understand how the euphoria of the dotcom boom could have obscured its shortcomings But in the last year he has been asked to teach it three times Something has changed he saidThe biggest change is that the companies are trying to improve sameday delivery with software  and at the same time are distancing themselves as far as possible from the physical supply chain that killed their ancestors They have dispensed with warehouses trucks and fulltime drivers and instead have become middlemen whose sole role is to connect customers with couriers But the one piece of the puzzle they have failed to eliminate is the hardest part of logistics and the one Deighton says makes the entire business model unravel the last few miles of the journey getting smallticket orders to farflung housesThe entrepreneurs and investors behind these companies say software can solve that too with algorithms that minimize the amount of time it takes couriers to pick up orders and maximize the number of deliveries they can makeThe reason it is such a good idea now is the exact same reason it was so horrible before the network effect said Nabeel Hyatt a venture partner at Spark Capital which has invested in Postmates a courier service that delivers from any store or restaurant Not even half of American households had an Internet connection in 1999 today 98 percent have access to a connection And it certainly helps that customers and couriers all have smartphones This means a higher density of users and potential users who can instantly reach couriers whenever they are in need eventually leading to scaleIn the 90s Webvan built several 35 million 350000squarefoot distribution centers By contrast Instacart which offers onehour grocery delivery in 12 cities has just 70 employees in a small office in San Francisco all of them engineers and administrators They never touch the food  instead they contract with personal shoppers We literally dont have any warehouses we dont have any trucks said Aditya Shah Instacarts general managerOf course the couriers still need to be paid The complicated part is not getting customers its getting the product to the customers said Paulo Lerner Rewinerys founder who fled San Francisco for Brazil If they charge a lot it loses the appeal If they charge less it has a lot of appeal but at the same time they are running on lossesInstacart charges as little as 399 for grocery shopping and delivery Yet Shah said its shoppers make about 20 an hour plus tips which makes profitability seem unlikely even with the smartest algorithms routing shoppers through grocery stores and city streets When I told him that he sounded a lot like Borders back in Webvans heyday Were really well funded so that is not something were as worried about Shah said Growth is the most important factorThat growthfirst philosophy is hardly unpopular in Silicon Valley where a focus on expansion at the expense of profit has worked well for web businesses Delivery startups are trying to bridge the digital and physical worlds  and thats when things get expensive Its a hard category  outside the Internet where everything magically happens said Lerner the Rewinery founder This is real work hard work Josh Lerner no relation to Paulo who runs the entrepreneurial management unit at Harvard Business School is similarly dubious Someone is paying for it but its definitely something that seems to defy the laws of introductory economics he saidThe question comes down to how much people are willing to pay to be lazy To economists laziness isnt necessarily a bad thing To the sympathetic onlooker these companies could be a step on the path to the world prophesied by John Maynard Keynes and even The Jetsons in which technology advances to the point that chores are replaced by leisure time But even this suggests a gloomy outcome Ondemand delivery could create a twotier economy  the people who can afford to hire others to do their errands and the people who do them That is unless Amazon succeeds in automating grunt work out of existence It already has robots that pick items off shelves and pack them in boxes it wants to have a fleet of delivery dronesOr it might be useful to listen to Fred Wilson the cofounder of Union Square Ventures who lost a lot of money on Kozmo I wish we knew the answers to these questions but we dont he told me Thats whats kept us out of this market He still signs up for new delivery startups as a customer though After all the worst case is that well go back to doing the same thing I did when Rewinery went under  running out to the store,2014-08-24T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/technology/the-unrepentant-bootlegger.html,Early in the morning of June 30 2010 Hana Beshara woke to a sharp rapping on the door of her condo in East Brunswick NJI heard a bangbangbang she said Im thinking its like AmazonIt wasnt a delivery It was a team of federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security wearing bulletproof jackets and carrying gunsShe sank into her couch and watched as they went through her belongings confiscating files her flatscreen TV several computers and cellphones her PlayStation 3  anything with a hard driveMs Beshara was one of the founders of a site called NinjaVideo which at the time was one of the most popular places online to illegally stream and download TV shows and moviesAt its peak the site attracted 26 million visitors a day and had around 60000 registered members many of whom visited the websites community section to discuss topics as diverse as philosophy parenting and politics Under the nickname Queen Phara Ms Beshara held court in these forums where she was known for her hottempered and playful online personalityNinjaVideo had a short life It went live in February 2008 and was yanked offline after the raid in June 2010 But its audacity was dazzling  impressive even The layout was simple a single scrolling web page with the names of popular television shows that were shown on cable and network television channels that week Clicking on show titles  like The Colbert Report or Lost  caused a video player to open and the show would begin Watching illegal downloads was almost as simple as flipping on the TV Few who used it were surprised when it was shutteredTo the government Ms Beshara was a thief plain and simple The Motion Picture Association of America alerted the federal government to NinjaVideo and nine other moviestreaming sites and they all went dark at the same time The raids were carried out by several federal agencies working to combat counterfeiting and piracy and the scale of the operation was meant to send a warning that the government wasnt ignoring the freewheeling world of illegal online streaming and downloadingMs Beshara however still cant accept that what she was doing deserved the heavy hammer of the law She served 16 months in prison for conspiracy and criminal copyright infringement but she still talks about NinjaVideo as something grand It was a portal that spirited her away from the doldrums of her regular life as a receptionist living with her parents to an online community that regarded her as its queen Sure she showed movies that were still playing in theaters but it seemed like harmless smallstakes funIn hindsight  I know its nave  but I never imagined it going criminal she said It didnt seem like it was something to be bothered with Even if it is wrongShe is not the only one who feels that way It has proved very difficult to reverse a pervasive cultural nonchalance about what constitutes intellectual property theft on the web Despite the government crackdown in 2010 and subsequent efforts to unplug websites that host or link to illegal content new sites have emerged that filled the void that NinjaVideo left behindOnline piracy is thriving Filesharing most of it illegal still amounts to nearly a quarter of all consumer Internet traffic according to Cisco Systems Visual Networking Index And a recent report from Tru Optik a media analytics firm said that nearly 10 billion movies television shows and other files including games and pornography were downloaded globally in the second quarter of 2014 Tru Optik estimates that about 6 percent of those downloads were legal In July a highquality version of The Expendables 3 the Sylvester Stallone action comedy film surfaced online and was downloaded millions of times well before its release in theatersCongressional efforts like a proposed Stop Online Piracy Act or SOPA introduced in 2011 met with such strident objections from the technology industry that lawmakers backed down The Copyright Alert System a voluntary effort by Internet service providers sends warnings when downloading of copyrighted content is detected but it is widely considered to be ineffective Last year 13 million warnings were sent a fraction of what Tru Optik estimates to be 400 million illegal downloads in the United States each monthThe situation has reached an uneasy stasis that pleases no one Internet advocates say that policing individuals or smalltime pirates with outdated laws ignores how ordinary people view entertainment in the real world And despite its best efforts the MPAA has yet to completely extinguish the unauthorized distribution of movies and television showsAfter she got out of prison in April 2013 Ms Beshara now 32 lived with her parents But she recently moved into an apartment in Newark with a woman she met on Craigslist Ms Besharas room is spacious but bare containing just a mattress on the floor and a few decorative items including a blanket she knitted in prison and artwork created by members of the NinjaVideo community In person Ms Beshara is prone to tears when talking about her past but she makes jokes about it as well An email exchange between Ms Beshara and her lawyers forwarded to me had the line Its me your favorite convictMs Beshara spent her early years in Brooklyn the child of Egyptian immigrants When she wasnt studying she helped out at her parents car service company dispatching rides I didnt have much of a childhood she said sitting on the edge of her mattress and dressed in a burntorange wrap smoking a clove cigarette She remembers clearly the day she came across a man selling copies of The Lion King on the street for 10 Watching it she realized that it had been made by someone covertly filming it in theatersI remember thinking that they were a hero she said That was my first bootleg momentA few years later her parents moved the family to Parlin NJ and Ms Beshara graduated from Sayreville War Memorial High School as valedictorian She enrolled in New York University and in 2003 graduated with a degree in political science Her future looked bright She dreamed about a career as a diplomat or as an important political figure perhapsBut after college she returned home and drifted She worked as a bartender and then as a receptionist in a dentists office a job that one of her mothers friends arranged as a favor I was figuring out what I wanted to do with myself she saidOne night while driving she was pulled over The police officer found marijuana in her car and she was charged with possession and later put on probation for a year The ordeal sent her into depression I felt like I was a step behind everyone Ms Beshara saidThe Internet became her escapeMs Beshara spent hours bingeing on shows like the sciencefiction drama Battlestar Galactica and eventually frequented chat rooms where people uploaded shows and movies Eventually she started doing the sameDuring this period she met Matthew Smith then 21 and living in North Carolina The two decided to build a different kind of streaming site one with highquality files and with chat forums interlaced with the content Ms Beshara would manage and moderate the forums Mr Smith would handle the technical back end NinjaVideo went up on February 2008 Within the first couple of weeks there were a few thousand videos on the site largely from volunteers It started to blow up very very quickly Ms Beshara saidJosh Evans one of NinjaVideos administrators hired in December 2009 said that working on the site was one of the funnest times of my life He lived outside Seattle and remembers traveling to New York and Greece to meet Ms Beshara and the other NinjaVideo administrators the gang even exchanged gifts around ChristmasWe were all a bit intoxicated with each other Ms Beshara saidBy day Ms Beshara went through the motions of her job After work she made a beeline for her computer where she sometimes stayed until dawn She logged into NinjaVideo and Skype where she and the other moderators coordinated the shows going online that evening They waited for their network of uploaders who used special software to tape shows directly from television and upload them to a cyberlocker or hosting site From there shows and movies would be posted on NinjaVideoIt was an internal race to get the shows up Ms Beshara said Each night on average 10 to 15 shows went online The forums were particularly active at night and thats when Ms Beshara came alive as Queen PharaShe was a bit intimidating said Candee Edwards a former comment moderator for NinjaVideo a  you either love her or you hate her kind of deal If you said something stupid you would get called out But she was always on point always on top of thingsUnknown to Ms Beshara and her collaborators NinjaVideo had been targeted by the Motion Picture Association of America which says the site aided in the infringement of millions of dollars worth of copyrighted movies television programs and software products NinjaVideo went live the same year as Hulu and Netflix Instant Netflixs video streaming service and the MPAA was trying to reroute Internet users to legitimate online streaming outlets like them The MPAA identified what it saw as other offending sites too like NinjaThiscom and TVShacknet and funneled the names to the government Eventually those sites went offline as wellIn a nationwide campaign called Operation In Our Sites undercover federal agents investigated and found dozens of movies on NinjaVideo including some still in theaters The agents didnt need to dig deep to prove that Ms Beshara and her collaborators were aware that their activity was illegal Dozens of threads on the site gleefully acknowledged  even gloated over  the illicit nature of the contentLike Ms Beshara Mr Evans had his home raided in 2010 He pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and copyright infringement and was sentenced to six months in federal prison in Connecticut Now 37 Mr Evans has returned to his home near Seattle where he works as a computer and electronics repairman Mr Smith who could not be reached to be interviewed was sentenced to 14 months in prison for conspiracy and criminal copyright infringementAdministrators of NinjaVideo were the first to be charged criminally as a result of Operation In Our Sites numerous other domain names would be seized and a handful of arrests made In 2012 the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation had their splashiest success They seized and shut down Megaupload the popular digital locker site that allowed people to share files like movies and music anonymously and arrested its owner Kim Dotcom along with several other highlevel executives They have been indicted by the United States on charges related to copyright infringement although many legal experts are not sure if a case will ever come to courtAfter the seizure of NinjaVideo and the other sites the MPAA pushed federal legislation to continue to crack down on illegal downloading But the bill SOPA was so loosely worded that it could have required all websites to be responsible for monitoring their services for potential violations  an expensive and nearly impossible challenge  prompting sites like Wikipedia Tumblr and Craigslist to rally online sentiment against the legislation Outrage about the bill came to a head in 2012 and lawmakers backed offOperation In Our Sites still exists primarily focused on trying to prosecute the Megaupload case But the campaign didnt stop unauthorized viewing Instead the next generation of rogue services  including Popcorn Time which TechCrunch a technology blog described as Netflix for pirates  learned from the mistakes of sites like NinjaVideo Operating primarily on American soil NinjaVideo was especially vulnerable to prosecution Newer sites established themselves overseas out of the American governments reach They also tended to avoid forums and incriminating public statements that prosecutors could use against themThe MPAA meanwhile says it is not pursuing any new legislation to crack down on copyright infringement online focusing instead on educating consumers about legal streaming optionsThe goal is not so much to use mitigation factors to stop them from pirating but showing them the alternatives that are out there said Michael D Robinson the chief of operations and content protection for the MPAA We are working on getting young people to understand the importance and value of copyright protectionBut that task he said is unfortunately at this point neverendingIt is difficult to compete with free he addedThat said the MPAA says that the number of legitimate streaming outlets has doubled to 100 since 2009 and that Americans legally consumed 57 billion movies and 56 billion TV shows in 2013 alonePeople watch more paid legal content than ever but they also continue to download huge amounts of illegal content Piracy is putting pressure on antiquated business models which isnt necessarily a bad thing said Brett Danaher an economics professor at Wellesley College who studies Internet piracy But the prevalence of piracy shows that people are growing up in a culture of free and that is not good for the future of entertainment eitherEven if it were possible to shut down every illegal site tomorrow new ones would surely pop up The demand is there One study by the American Assembly at Columbia University found that 70 percent of young adults between 18 and 29 had copied or downloaded music or video free and almost 30 percent got most of their collections that way The pervasive cultural norm especially among younger people is that illegal downloading at least when it involves material from big corporations is no big deal Andrs MonroyHernndez a social computing researcher at Microsoft Research studied attitudes around ownership on collaborative usergenerated websites He found that young Internet users became angry when peers used their works without permission but didnt see a problem in lifting images from shows or movies for use in their own workThe farther removed you feel from the source he said the more likely you are to disregard the copyright and the intellectual propertyThere is another obstacle to stopping illegal downloads said Andre Swanston the chief executive of Tru Optik the media analytics firm People want access to everything anytime and there is little to stop them from having it Even if you added Netflix Hulu Plus Amazon Prime Sony Crackle and everything else combined that is still less content available legally than illegally he said The popularity of piracy has nothing to do with cost  it is all about accessComplex exclusivity agreements between networks and streaming sites govern when popular television shows are available But people are not always willing to hop among a streaming service a site or an app to watch different shows Mr Swanston gave the example of how ABC in January started requiring people to verify that they had a cable subscription to watch its shows on Hulu Users either didnt have the necessary information or declined to go the extra step it seems because the rate of piracy for Marvels Agents of SHIELD a network drama shot up 300 percentContent providers Mr Swanston says will eventually have to consider new delivery models that are more closely aligned with how people behave He imagines collaborations with streaming services to release content or simultaneously scheduling theater and digital streaming releases  ideas he hopes his company can help bring about Some companies like BitTorrent which makes filesharing technology are already experimenting in this arenaThe law too needs to adapt to the reality of how people behave said Peter Eckersley technology projects director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation a nonprofit advocacy group that pushes for digital rights among other thingsMr Eckersley said the law should shift its focus to making sure that copyright holders are paid for their work rather than trying to stymie how people gain access to it Subscriptionbased music services like Rdio and Spotify seem to be helping prevent music piracy  although the argument about whether artists are fairly compensated rages onHe suggested a legal framework to retire the exclusive rights aspect of copyright law that requires permission to publish  and that allows copyright holders to seek exorbitant damages from infringers  and move toward a system that requires sites and people who make money from anothers work to share any profits Solutions like these Mr Eckersley says would create different priorities that go beyond chasing smalltime pirates like Ms Beshara and her colleaguesNinjaVideo made about 500000 over three years according to the government Most of that came from advertising but also from donations and a 25 fee for access to private chat boardsMs Beshara kept the bulk of the pot around 210000 which she is required to pay back to the MPAA She says she netted only about half of that but she is gradually repaying the amount The rest was divided among four other cofounders and administrators who helped run the site and manage the communityShe acknowledges that some of her colleagues were upset when they learned she received much of the profit from NinjaVideo but says it wasnt out of line with her role as the voice of the site People took issue with the fact that I got paid she said At any rate in her opinion the money was insignificant To this day she argues that the movie business is so big that skimming a little off the top doesnt hurt anybody She likes to say that NinjaVideo was operating in a gray areaMs Beshara refused to muster any remorse during her sentencing and often took to social media between court appearances to boast about her lack of repentance This enraged the judge presiding over her caseDavid Smith one of the lawyers appointed to represent Ms Beshara compared her behavior to that of another class of clients he often works with drug traffickers The thrill is similar he said and many find themselves addicted to the lifestyle even more than the profitsA lot of them are in it for the sheer joy of doing it Mr Smith said Theres a lot of excitement and ego gratification in being a successful traffickerPrison wasnt easy for Ms Beshara She got into scuffles with other inmates including one that landed her in solitary confinement for a monthShe learned to crochet and taught a jewelrymaking class She worked in the prison kitchen preparing food for a few cents an hour Her family didnt visit NinjaVideo community members including Ms Edwards the moderator supplied Ms Beshara with phone cards and put money in her commissary account so she could buy basic items like shampoo and snacksAfter 16 months in prison Ms Beshara spent an additional five at a halfway house in New Jersey Her parole prohibits her from corresponding with her former NinjaVideo colleagues or from starting a business online until August 2015All said and done its about five years before Im allowed to really be back online she said They hurt me with thatShe works full time as human resources manager at an Internet sales company that she likes fine enough and on the weekends she shuttles across town to a food coop where she makes coffees and vegetable wraps as part of her mandatory community service Her new life lacks the excitement and thrill of NinjaVideo but when she lapses into thinking about the old days she lights up

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/travel/to-ride-again-another-day-in-colorado.html,If you ride a bicycle more than casually you probably already know about Boulder Colo Its altitude endless hills and nearly perpetual sunshine make it a big draw for the pedalpowered and regularly ensure it a top spot on lists of Americas most bikefriendly citiesBut unless you live in Boulder you probably dont know about the ultimate day ride out of town Its a ride that morphs from calm easy pedaling to quadricepbusting difficulty proceeds upward through spectacular scenery and rewards you at the top with a dusty hamlet called Ward whose citizens hope you turn around and head home ASAP When I lived in Boulder I usually made the trip once a yearThe specialness of the ride to Ward lies in a set of connected felicities Its just long enough at 20 miles each way to take a satisfying chunk out of a day and still leave you an evening to brag about your exploits The long fairly taxing climb of 4000 vertical feet with a sudden sadistic kickup into an especially steep grade for the last mile or so means that your athleticism will be tested but within limits A winding stream accompanies you the most of the way up and the scarcity of cars on the route allows you to sink into yourself and enter into a trance of repetitive exerciseThen theres your destination the wonderfully strange improbable town of WardIn June I had a chance to revisit that climb for a host of difficult reasons Among other things the trip gave me a chance to assess the state of Boulders cycling health in light of the cataclysmic rains of September 2013 that flooded the Front Range blocking access to mountain hamlets like Ward for months and forever altering the face of the areaI had climbed to Ward just a few weeks before that historic downpour during a visit from my new home in Brooklyn On a mild sultry morning in late August blissfully unaware of the impending storms I had set out on the climb accompanied by my good friend Kip Hunter a Boulder native At my request we embarked on the steeper of the two approaches to Ward Were both 50somethings but very physically fit versions of that demographic and proud of itMy first lesson of the day wasnt long in coming and it was this You cant live away from Boulder for a couple of years at sea level as I had and suddenly return to 6000feet elevation without paying a price The first hill which I used to whisk up with a serious though never killing effort now seemed huge and the grade mercilessSerious uphill cycling is always a minuet of pain and pleasure On the Ward climb the steeper grades are usually followed by shallower gentler slopes allowing screaming legs a respite and the inflight entertainment of the scenery takes some of the sting out of the uphill slog I soon passed the charming twig tenement of a beaver dam in the roadside stream Not long after I saw a pair of amorous cardinals tussling in a nearby tree Mountain bluebirds flashed their electric colors in the bushes and the high desert air was bonedry and pleasantly scented with pineLulled by how good I was feeling I proceeded to mistake No 2 forgetting to pace myself As Kip ground steadily upward in a low gear I downshifted and shot forward ignoring my lack of acclimation to the altitude Everything was perfect until a kind of red fog entered my brain my legs stopped obeying my commands and the next thing I knew I was pulled off to the side of the road dryheaving over my handlebarsFailure in front of passing cyclists and my old friend Kip who had meanwhile vanished into the distance shouting something about the tortoise and the hare was not an option Gingerly I got back on my rental bike and limped up the last mile or so on the steep 10 percent grade into WardSituated about 9500 feet above sea level this mountain village of 200 is celebrated for its gnarly offthegridness its rusting old American cars parked on the sides of the road as tourist scarecrows and its oneway signs all turned outward to discourage entry to the city limits The one business in town is the tiny Utica Street Market where before the effortless glide back down I bought and slowly drank my reward for the climb the most delicious bottle of cold water on earthI returned to my home in Brooklyn a few days later burdened by a new sense of the limits of my habitual New York rides The Prospect Park 335mile loop that until my Boulder trip had seemed perfectly reasonable now felt foreshortened and dull Even the magisterial sixmileplus Central Park loop had mysteriously become boring and repetitious After a few days of cycling the old routes I was beginning to forget my newfound feelings of deprivation when a friend from Boulder emailed me that a heavy rain had begun falling there and wasnt letting upI say rain It was more the equivalent of a highpressure fire hose trained on the city Boulder denizens are used to heavy weather of course The town is pressed flush against the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and exposed to nature at its most elemental with giant skies and three or four Houdiniquick changes of weather in a day But this was another thing entirely a deluge a biblical plague a thousandyear flood the biggest monthly rainfall in recorded historyOver the fiveday downpour totaling almost 20 inches the storm concentrated on Boulder though it fell heavily in surrounding areas as well streets became lakes bridges were carried off cars were sucked into raging torrents houses were flung about like playing cards and many mountain communities simply swept awayBoulder was marooned in a new world of fallen water and the very thing that had turned it into a biking mecca  its glorious canyon climbs  now rendered it helpless when upriver dams burst and sent 30foothigh battering rams of debris roaring into the heart of the city The effects were devastating In several cases they were also fatalThe drama of all this was so consuming to a former resident me that it wasnt until late in the game that I woke up to my own stake in things I say woke up because thats literally what happened one day at 3 am when I bolted out of bed and flew to the computer where I clicked through a few links and slumped in my chair with a groanUpon moving away from Boulder two years earlier I had put all of my recently deceased fathers rarebook collection in storage The facility was in a town called Longmont about a dozen miles away I had chosen this facility after being assured by the owner that it was well outside the hundredyear flood plain The collection comprised thousands of books dating back to the 16th century and included many scientific and literary rarities Serious collectors have a relationship with objects that stops just short of the familial the physically embodied Insofar as it was possible these books were  my beloved fatherOn the computer screen was an image of the storage facility It appeared to be almost entirely underwaterIn the days that followed there was no access to the building and it was unclear how much damage the books had suffered But it wasnt only the fate of my fathers legacy that I obsessed about It was the city of Boulder as well In Boulder I had fallen in love and raised a family and in the citys canyons I had discovered a passion for cycling that became a lifeline pulling me through the deaths of both parents and the eventual crash of my marriage Two thousand miles away I felt protective of the fragile ecosystem of roads trails and paths that had made such a thing possibleSo in June I flew back to Boulder to take stock of my dads books revisit stormbattered friends and family and assess the state of the citys cycling culture Was the pedalpushing magic still alive and wellBoulder reveals itself dramatically to those approaching it on the main access road of Route 36 emerging as if from a whirl of a magicians cape when one crests a rise to see the city set out on the plain From a distance everything looked normal and as I entered the town at dusk that normalcy seemed borne out The formerly submerged downtown showed no obvious signs of devastation The only visible clue of a changed city was the earthmoving machinery parked on side streets Over the previous months those machines had moved many many tons of dirt and rocksThe next morning eager to assess the state of things firsthand I stopped at University Bicycles Living up to its reputation as the busiest bike store on earth per square foot the store was jammed  an indication that cycling enthusiasm at least had returned to preflood levels If anything the staff members seemed more buzzed and happy than ever Whether this was the result of their own athletic activity or a side effect of the many new legal marijuana dispensaries in the area was unclear I rented a lightweight model and pedaled out onto busy Pearl StreetHaving completed a casual reconnaissance of Boulders downtown which appeared unchanged from the storm I moved out of the city center It was then while taking some of the uphill grades to the canyons that I began to note the real differences Was I having a senior moment or wasnt that gap formerly filled with trees Werent there once park benches there Wasnt there once a high brick wall rising alongside the road and didnt the road itself once have a shoulderIn the words of Mike Patton director of Boulder Open Spaces and Mountain Parks a city agency You cant believe it till you see it The water tossed this city around like clothes in a rinse cycle There are canyons and Im talking canyons where there didnt used to be before the flood Fiftyfoot alluvial fans with Volkswagensized boulders for people to climb on Forests of twofootwide pine trees still laying on their sideLater that day I enlisted Kip and we rode the Boulder Bike Path a jewel of urban engineering whose 300 coiling miles extend from the city center to the hinterlands After the flood this entire area looked like a Rocky Mountain Pompeii Kip said as we pedaled along the smooth concrete of the path All around us the same mysterious forces of subtraction had been at work The canopy of shade trees that had fringed the path was gone Debris fields sat in the middle of former meadows In deference to my silverlining tendencies Id like to say all this was an improvement somehow It was notIn fact as feared many of the former canyons I had relished climbing in the area either were impassable or their formerly smoothly graded roadbeds were filled with dirt and gravel patches rendering them useless to road bike riders The climb to Ward at least was back in business but most serious cyclists had been forced to areas east and south of the city for their rolling sustenanceWeve had to get creative said Justin Green a Boulder sports physician and competitive mountain bike racer Cyclists love their routines but the flood forced us into expanding into whole new areas and trails we barely knew beforeIt may be a changed world for Front Range riders but it is impossible to ignore the signs of revival and ongoing bikelove in the air The next day I sat in the infield of the Boulder Valley Velodrome a new oval outdoor track in the town of Erie about 15 miles north of Denver which is still in the betatesting phase Doug Emerson one of its owners he also owns University Bicycles told me that he had started out 30 years earlier with 15 bikes and a toolboxYes he said smiling as brightly kitted riders whirred around us and if youd told me then that this town would one day have thousands of recreational cyclists with 10000 bikes in their garages Id have laughed in your faceOn the streets outside the velodrome the crush of cyclists out for a spin on expensive bikes seemed to prove his point Again and again as I continued to ride over the next few days I heard the same refrain Cycling recovery in the floodravaged parts of the state is a work in progress but the spirit of the sporting community is unbowed As John Hickenlooper the governor and an avid recreational athlete put it Cycling is about never quitting just when you think you might have nothing left to give you find you can give a little more and finish Well keep coming together and well keep pedalingOn my last night in Boulder over dinner at the reliably delicious Brasserie 1010 Kip took up the same theme This whole tragedy has had some unexpected positive side effects he said Bikers pitched in heavily to fund recovery efforts in the mountain towns they loved riding to and the wary locals up there began looking at them with a new respect Everybody lost and then everybody wonPoint taken Roads can be rebuilt Peoples hearts can be opened in unexpected ways by adversity But old books once ruined by water cannot absent huge expense be brought back to life I lost an entire first edition of the works of Joseph Conrad and about 20 percent of my fathers collection despite the best efforts of my exwife and stepchildren to salvage what they could Im not happy about it but Im not shattered by it either I try to take the long view and see it as an entry in the ledger of Necessary Expenses in Life If Boulder ate some books of mine it gave me back something far greater in the long run a lifelong passion for climbing on two wheels,2014-09-07T00:00:00Z,drugs

their three favorite movies and what the bumper stickers on their cars said For a current civil case concerning Israel they were asked if they had any feelings about Jews that would make it difficult for them to serveJury questionnaires have become a familiar presence in courtrooms across the United States with some lawyers routinely requesting them in major cases  transforming the standard voir dire procedure into a written testYou can learn a lot from a questionnaire that you cant learn in person said Daniel Gitner a defense lawyer in Manhattan noting that he preferred to use questionnaires You want to use a questionnaire anytime you have a real considered view of what beliefs your jurors are coming to the courtroom withAlong with instinct lawyers and the growing field of jury consultants generally use mock juries and posttrial quizzes of actual juries to sort out jurors views in a caseThe objective is to prune the jury box of people biased against their clientsPhilip K Anthony the chief executive of DecisionQuest a trial consultancy compared the work to epidemiology what patterns exist in the population in the data that might make jurors more likely to find for one side or anotherIn the federal corruption trial of Pedro Espada Jr who served in the New York State Senate potential jurors in Brooklyn were asked whether they had ever worked as janitors business owners or at hospitals whether their employer gave them an expense account and whether they managed the money in their householdsFor the trial of five associates of Bernard L Madoff in Manhattan proposed questions asked for parents occupations whether the potential jurors 401ks or stock investments had declined since 2007 whether they owned ereaders like Kindles and whether they played the lotteryIn the trial of Michael Jacksons physician jurors in California were asked whether they had had a doctor refuse to prescribe medication that they had requested In the trial of the Boston mobster James J Whitey Bulger questions included whether marijuana sales should be legal and the name of the last book each juror had readJudges have the discretion to permit or deny the use of a questionnaire lawyers and jury consultants say that judges are more likely to allow them when the prosecution and defense make a joint request for one and have collaborated on the questionsSome of the questions are basic covering employment potential hardship in case of a long trial and specific knowledge of the case at hand Then there are the more obscure questionsFor instance to get useful answers  particularly about opinions that may be socially unacceptable  consultants and lawyers dance around the issuesYou need to make it OK to express a bias said Leslie Ellis a senior consultant with TrialGraphix Posing a question like Lots of people feel this way how many would agree with that or asking openended questions is a way to get that information she saidIt is also important to write broad questions Dr Ellis said In a patent case she said you can ask a very specific question How many people here have ever applied for a patent trademark or copyright protectionOr she added you can ask how many people feel like theyve invented something or created something from scratch That will cast a broader net and turn up possible affiliationsBecause it is up to the judge whether to allow a questionnaire in the first place along with what may be asked questions cannot be too far afield consultants saidAnd because both sides can strike jurors from panels consultants and lawyers are trying to find jurors who might align with them without making that alignment obvious to the oppositionTheres an art associated with designing questions that elicit enough of what you want to know without going too far Dr Anthony said For example if youre a defendant you might not want a question along the lines of Do you believe too much money is awarded in the court system Because people who say absolutely are in the minds of both sides defenseoriented so all youre doing is highlighting the people who the plaintiff may want to strikeLawyers can use questionnaires to expose jurors opinions and see if what they say in court lines up with what they wrote as a recent Brooklyn trial showedRonell Wilson had already been found guilty of killing two police officers and for this part of the trial jurors had to decide whether he would receive the death penalty They filled out an 80item questionnaire with questions about religious backgrounds whether relatives were psychologists and views on the death penaltyIn court Mr Wilsons lawyers successfully got one juror removed for cause because his questionnaire answer I dont believe in the death penalty contrasted with his incourt answer in which he had discussed how the death penalty could be applied They successfully eliminated another juror who wrote that he could set aside his opinions on law enforcement although his brotherinlaw and nephew were both correction officersBut the judge did not grant Mr Wilsons lawyers request to strike a juror whose questionnaire was acceptable but whose affect was off The juror appeared to be laughing during voir dire The prosecution which wanted to keep the juror described it as nervous laughterBeyond questionnaires consultants and lawyers study how jurors interact with the judge and with one another If for example a bluecollar worker puts on a suit for court it suggests respect for the court system Dr Ellis said which could translate to a proprosecution stance in a criminal caseOr if someone is charismatic and authoritative you want to be certain that person is on your side said Roy Futterman a director at Doar Litigation Consulting If that person goes a certain way hes taking everyone with him he saidStill some lawyers seem disdainful of all the analysisI look at it much less scientifically said Susan Kellman a longtime New York defense lawyer Her favorite question is a simple listeningskills one Tell me one person whos dead who we all know and respectMost jurors say my grandmother she said and  unless that grandmother is Golda Meir  that tells her all she needs to know she addedThey dont follow directions she said Youre learning a lot from listening to people more than tests,2014-08-21T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/06/25/us/ap-us-rethinking-pot-police-pot-storage.html,DENVER   Police in some medical marijuana states who once routinely seized illegal pot plants by ripping them out by their roots and stashing them away in musty evidence rooms to die are now thinking twice about the practiceFrom Colorado and Washington state to California and Hawaii police are being sued by people who want their marijuana back after prosecutors chose not to charge them or they were acquittedIn some cases the onetime suspects are asking for hundreds of thousands of dollars to replace dead plantsConcerns over liability have prompted some agencies to either forgo roundingup the plants altogether or to improvise by collecting a few samples and photographing the rest to use as evidence for criminal chargesNone of us really are sure what were supposed to do and so you err on the side of caution said Mitch Barker executive director of the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police ChiefsThe change comes as the notion of marijuana as medicine clashes with police seizure procedure that was developed in an era when pot was a scourge that needed to be wiped outLaw enforcement is going to have to think more carefully about what their procedures are and how those procedures might need to change in light of changes in the law said Sam Kamin a University of Denver law professorJust as the smell of pot smoke may no longer be grounds to search a home or make an arrest Kamin who helped craft the states pot regulations said the same evidence that two or three years ago would have given police probable cause today doesntMost local police say they are seizing less weed postlegalization but they still investigate if they suspect patients are growing more than they should Federal agents face no such quandary since pot remains illegal under federal lawWhether or not state laws require as they do in Colorado police to return medical marijuana intact if a suspect isnt charged or is acquitted departments have been sued over pot that has wilted in their evidence lockersIn Colorado Springs a cancer patient who had faced drug charges is suing police after 55 dead plants were returned to him The state appeals court had to order the police to return themMedical dispensary owner Alvida Hillery sued police to return her 604 pot plants or pay 33 million after she was acquitted of drugcultivation charges She dropped the suit in exchange for a city dispensary license By then the plants had diedWe need uniform rules and law enforcement would be wise to develop those rules otherwise they will continue to be sued said Hillerys attorney Sean McAllister who is representing another dispensary owner in a similar suit in federal courtCity patrol officers must now call a narcotics detective for advice if they believe they are in the presence of illegal weedIn Hawaii a group of medical marijuana patients who were never arrested sued in May after police seized 52 plants in a raid They want 5000 for each plant if theyve diedIn Oregon a narcotics task force takes only the number of plants necessary to bring a patient back into compliance with the law said Washington County Sheriffs Sgt Chris SchweigertTen years ago you had that many plants you just went in there and ripped them all out Now youve got to ask a few questions said Sgt David Oswalt who supervises the Grand Junction police evidence roomOswalts department tells officers who believe the questionable weed is legal for medical purposes to take clippings and leave the plants behind If not they can seize plants by the bundleLeaving plants behind carries obvious risks said Jim Gerhardt of the Colorado Drug Investigators AssociationIt would be like arresting a cocaine dealer and taking a minuscule amount of the cocaine as a sample and then leaving it there for them to be used or sold he said Its a complicated messy issueWashington state does not require police to return plants to acquitted patients The states medical marijuana law allows gardens of 45 plants or less though it doesnt expressly prohibit having multiple gardens on a single propertySeattle police destroy marijuana plants after seizing them documenting the hauls with photographs or samples that can be presented at trial if necessary said police spokeswoman Renee WittThis month they seized more than 2200 marijuana plants but arrested no one in a raid of a purported medical marijuana operationMy God we would run out of space if we had to preserve it water it light it Witt saidPolice in Lynnwood Washington no longer seize medical plants said Angelea Madsen who supervises the evidence unitOfficials last year returned 202 dead plants seized from a group of medical marijuana patients who were never charged with crimes They demanded police return the weed and growing equipment or pay nearly 1 million the estimated valueJohn Jackson the police chief in Greenwood Village Colorado and a vice president of the states association of police chiefs said state lawmakers must enact guidelines on marijuana seizures to protect law enforcement from civil and criminal liabilityTheres no property room in the world thats going to turn into a hydroponic growing operation Jackson said___Associated Press writer Gene Johnson in Seattle contributed to this report,2014-06-25T02:02:15Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/25/nyregion/safer-era-tests-wisdom-of-broken-windows-focus-on-minor-crime-in-new-york-city.html,Even as violent crime has receded across New York City arrests are near historic highs driven by an increasingly controversial imperative that no offense is too minor for police officers to pursueNow the death of a Staten Island man after officers tried to arrest him for peddling cigarettes is intensifying scrutiny of the Police Departments unflagging push to arrest people over the most minor offensesThe Police Department reported making 394539 arrests last year That is tens of thousands more arrests than in 1995 when there were three times as many murders in the city and the department was in its early embrace of the broken windows strategy which sees enforcement of lowlevel offenses as effective at preventing more serious crimeWilliam J Bratton the man who brought broken windows policing to New York in the 1990s is once again the citys police commissioner appointed by Mayor Bill de Blasio and is carrying on the departments focus on socalled quality of life crimes that he considers the seeds of more serious disorderEric Garner 43 was a target of those effortsSuspected of selling untaxed cigarettes on the sidewalk on Staten Island Mr Garner was approached by the police last week in a confrontation that was captured on video recorded by bystandersWhen officers moved in to arrest Mr Garner one of them wrapped an arm around his neck in what Mr Bratton said appeared to be a chokehold  a tactic banned by the Police Department After complaining that he could not breathe Mr Garner appeared to slip into unconsciousness and was pronounced dead a short time later at a hospitalWhile the apparent chokehold fueled much of the initial public outcry community leaders have begun asking whether focusing police officers so intently on such petty offenses makes sense in a city that is far different and far safer than the one Mr Bratton left in the mid1990sI think we need to look at whether we still need these arrests said Eric L Adams the Brooklyn borough president and a former captain in the Police DepartmentThis is a good moment he said to reevaluate what comes after broken windows now that the windows are no longer brokenAnd with the number of stopandfrisk encounters down sharply the community groups that mobilized against those street stops are turning their attention to the number of lowlevel arrests saying they will push for changesIts the new stopandfrisk Robert Gangi director of the Police Reform Organizing Project said of the lowlevel arrests which he added were eclipsed in recent years by the public debate over the stopandfrisk tacticThe longterm increase in overall arrests reflects the convergence of two striking trends Felony arrests have dropped off significantly as violent crime has plummeted But the soaring number of arrests for misdemeanors and noncriminal violations has more than made up for the dropIn 1995 for each felony arrest the police were making 13 arrests for offenses in the broadest category of misdemeanors by 2013 the ratio had grown to 25 misdemeanor arrests for each felony according to data from the states Department of Criminal Justice ServicesMr de Blasio whose campaign last year focused heavily against stopping and frisking finds himself championing key aspects of the police strategies of his immediate predecessors  Mayors Rudolph W Giuliani and Michael R BloombergDuring their administrations the city saw enormous strides in public safety but the Police Department was faulted for heavyhanded tacticsIn July the Brooklyn district attorney Kenneth P Thompson announced he would stop prosecuting some marijuana arrests which have soared in number in the last decade at times making up more than 10 percent of overall arrests by the policeBut the de Blasio administration pushed back saying the police would not change their arrest practices when it came to marijuanaAfter Mr Garners death Mr de Blasio said that if citizens were complaining about the sale of cigarettes the police were right to enforce the law If police officers are asked to enforce the law because theres a community concern we require that  we expect that of them he saidIndeed Mr Bratton said that Mr Garners death would result in no change in that focus of having officers confront lowlevel rulebreaking Its a key part of what were doing he said adding that disorderly behavior proliferated quickly unless confronted by the policeBut Mr Bratton also seemed to signal to his officers that he was open to their handling rulebreaking in less forceful ways He stressed that he wanted officers to understand he did not expect arrests where an an admonition  move along you cant do that   would have sufficed He said officers needed to understand they are given great powers of discretion and Im not measuring success by numbers of arrestsWhile the Police Departments own statistics recorded slightly fewer than 400000 arrests last year the data on arrests is imperfect Numbers reported to the City Council as well as to the state do not include several categories of arrests Additionally the Police Department includes arrests made by other smaller police agencies and occasionally assigns multiple arrest numbers to people apprehended for a spree of crimes such as a string of burglariesStill data from the citys criminal courts charts the increase in arrests over the last two decades and confirms the trajectory of the Police Departments statisticsIn 2013 the citys courts arraigned some 365752 people who had been arrested which undercounts the total number of arrests because it does not include for example cases that are immediately dismissed by prosecutorsRandy Mastro a deputy mayor in the Giuliani administration and now a lawyer in private practice said in an interview that in one sense its a surprising statistic that the arrest rates have grown to their current levels But he said that it would be a mistake to roll back police enforcement The policy of stricter enforcement in making arrests across the board for what some might consider minor offenses has served this city well and is one of the many reasons we now have such a low murder rateOver the years the number of people pulled into the criminal justice system has soared in New York City In 1994 when the Police Department adopted the broken windows strategy the police arrested 124475 individuals for the broadest category of misdemeanors some more than onceIn 2013 officers arrested 162808 people for misdemeanors some more than onceAll told since 1994 the police in New York City have arrested more than 13 million people for misdemeanors who had never been previously arrested for a penallaw crime according to data from the states Criminal Justice Services although some doublecounting is possible because of the way arrestees are trackedMarijuana arrests have driven the increase over the last decade with trespassing arrests also a leading factor Some of those who ended up in handcuffs for trespassing said they were visiting friends or relatives and a federal judge found the police were unconstitutionally stopping peopleSome officers have said they were under pressure from commanders to raise their arrest numbers which supervisors use to gauge productivityBut as the city grew safer the police also pursued ever lower violations such as having a foot on a subway seat Years after cracking down on turnstile jumpers the police started a push to arrest people who stood outside the turnstile asking others for a swipe of their MetroCardThere is no logic to the explosion of arrest activity said Representative Hakeem Jeffries a Brooklyn Democrat whose district includes

seen something overpowering In the thick gray clouds that lingered from a passing storm this past June he made out an angel And he saw Satan chasing the angel and the angel running into the face of God Mr Brown was a prankster so his father and stepmother chuckled at firstNo no Dad No the elder Mr Brown remembered his son protesting Im seriousAnd the black teenager from this suburb of St Louis who had just graduated from high school sent his father and stepmother a picture of the sky from his cellphone Now I believe he told themIn the weeks afterward until his shooting death by Darren Wilson a white police officer on Aug 9 they detected a change in him as he spoke seriously about religion and the Bible He was grappling with lifes mysteriesMichael Brown 18 due to be buriedon Monday was no angel with public records and interviews with friends and family revealing both problems and promise in his young life Shortly before his encounter with Officer Wilson the police say he was caught on a security camera stealing a box of cigars pushing the clerk of a convenience store into a display case He lived in a community that had rough patches and he dabbled in drugs and alcohol He had taken to rapping in recent months producing lyrics that were by turns contemplative and vulgar He got into at least one scuffle with a neighborAt the same time he regularly flashed a broad smile that endeared those around him He overcame early struggles in school to graduate on time He was pointed toward a trade college and a career and his parents hoped toward a successful lifeBut then came the fatal encounter with Officer Wilson Shortly after the confrontation in the convenience store Mr Brown and a friend were walking down the middle of a nearby street when Officer Wilson told them to get on the sidewalk The police say Mr Brown hit the officer and scuffled with him over his weapon leading to his being shotMr Browns friend said he swung after the officer grabbed his neck and was shot after running away hitting the ground with his hands raised in surrender He was hit at least six times twice in the head His 6foot4 frame lay face down in the middle of the warm pavement for hours a stream of blood flowing down the streetMr Brown was born in May 1996 in the nearby town of Florissant He was the first child of teenage parents Michael Brown Sr and Lesley McSpadden Growing up he lived under one roof with his parents paternal grandparents and later a younger sisterAs a boy Michael was a handful When his parents put up a security gate he would try to climb it When they left out pens and pencils he would use them to write on the wall He used to tap on the ground so his parents got him a drum set his father played the drums He grew into a reserved young man around people he did not know but joking and outgoing with those close to himAfter his parents split up he stayed with his mother though he remained close to all of his family who lived near one another in north St Louis CountyIn the ninth grade at McCluer High School in Florissant Mr Brown was accused of stealing an iPod His mother said she went to the school eventually showing a receipt to prove the iPod was his He left McCluer and went to two other high schools before going to Normandy for most of his final two yearsWhen his mother moved out of the Normandy District he moved in with his paternal grandmother so he could remain at that school But he continued to alternate between his parents and maternal grandmotherHe did not have a criminal record as an adult and his family said he never got in trouble with the law as a juvenile eitherYou may see him on a picture with some friends that may have been in a gang Ms McSpadden said He wasnt in a gang He just knew how to adapt to his surroundings Michael was so cool that he could just get along with anybodyMr Brown showed a rebellious streak One time his mother gave him her ATM card so he could buy shoes said Mr Browns friend Brandon Lewis Mr Brown bought himself a PlayStation console His mother made him give the system to his brotherThere were times when her son would talk back Ms McSpadden said She relied on family and friends including a retired juvenile officer to help mentor her sonMr Brown occasionally hinted at frustration with his family Last August he posted a message on Facebook that it was wrong how yo own family dont wanna see you do good And just a week before he was shot dead he commented that some of his friends treated him better than my own familyStill some of Mr Browns closest confidants were family members Mr Browns uncle Bernard Ewing remembers talking to his nephew about how to interact with police officersI let him know like if the police ever get on you I dont care what you doing give it up Mr Ewing said Because if you do one wrong move theyll shoot you Theyll kill youMr Lewis said he recalled Mr Brown getting into one fight A contemporary they knew from the neighborhood was upset with Mr Brown because of something Mr Brown had said to the young mans girlfriend So one day the fellow who was much smaller than Mr Brown took a swing at him Mr Brown backed up and pushed him back in the faceI dont think Mike ever threw a real punch said Mr Lewis 19The young mans father confronted Mr Brown Mr Lewis recalled asking him why he put his hands on his son Mr Browns father got involved Mr Lewis said and they settled the dispute and went their separate ways Mr Brown rarely got into physical confrontations Mr Lewis said because he was so big that nobody really wanted to test him Mr Brown tended to use his size to scare away potential trouble Mr Lewis saidHell swell up like Im mad and youll back off he saidMr Brown was not the best student His grades were kind of edgy Michael Brown Sr said Thats why I said I had to keep my foot on his neck to keep him on trackIn his senior year Mr Brown was a few credits short He was enrolled in the schools credit recovery program which allows students to work at their own pace to try to catch upIt seemed like Mike was probably the person that was the most serious in that class about getting out of Normandy about graduating said Terrence Hamilton the Normandy athletic directorAfter graduating in May Mr Brown talked to Mr Lewis about getting a job at the grocery store where Mr Lewis worked He also planned to pursue heating and cooling technician courses at a technical collegeHe was an avid video game player His favorite games were Call of Duty Zombies and PlayStation Home a simulation game in which he created an avatar and a city He was deft with technology and his hands Once when his cousins PlayStation broke because a disc was stuck in it Mr Brown took it apart fixed it and reassembled itMr Brown who constantly wore his Beats by Dre headphones also was a big fan of rap music He knew of Kendrick Lamar before he became famous His favorite group was Migos And within the past year he began producing rap songs with friendsThe content varied He collaborated on songs that included lyrics such as My favorite part is when the bodies hit the ground But he also derided fathers who dont pay child support and rapped glowingly about his stepmotherHe occasionally smoked marijuana and drank alcohol according to friends But for his music he adopted a persona to appeal to hiphop fans said his cousin Bryan Douglas a music producer who was going to help Mr Brown pursue his music careerMr Brown was sometimes philosophical as he showed in his final hoursEverything happen for a reason he posted to Facebook the night

disagreement about the whole human journey the expriest cleaves to his faith even as he wonders if his early absorption in religion was a way of exiting rather than entering the world to serve his fellow man Bullied by a father who believed in the great null and void and encouraged in his vocation by a mother whose murderous resentment revealed her pietistic attitudes as those of a hypocrite Michael grew up a boy in hiding buried separated  even from himself Perhaps he worries his calling was never more than a selfcentered escape planBetween these two damaged individuals steps a destructive specter  not of the rapist but of dishonesty which follows them into the bedroom and inspires an undeniable and increasing unease in lovemaking that prevents them from connecting on any level Natasha finds herself not keeping a secret but being kept by it No one can extract her from its hold least of all Michael whose own insecurities and neediness blind him to the nature of her fearIf Before During After is a literary rendition of Can this marriage be saved its also an elegantly constructed novel in which the catastrophic destruction of two monumental structures provides the backdrop to the fracture and crumbling of smaller couples Like the towers of the World Trade Center Michaels first marriage pancaked releasing its own little cloud of fatal dust and obfuscation and prefiguring an exponentially greater loss The ripple effect carries debris whether airborne particles or emotional wreckage from before to after poisoning the atmosphere and stranding survivors in the darkHes quit that says a colleague explaining that Michael has left the church in his case a church aptly called Grace Episcopal He has just walked away from it  and by implication from Gods love Finding herself polluted irreligious Natasha crawls as she must no matter what she believes toward the great font of the ocean its salt like tears Her need for purification is so strong that it eclipses any thought of getting to a rape kit before the evidence is washed awayOne of Richard Bauschs many talents is the forthright ease with which he delivers his characters  and readers  to the gravest questions of love faith and ultimately God even as he nimbly hides the answers in plain sight When Michael and Natasha wed bearing their freight of hidden anguish they stand before a selfrighteous Anglican priest who subjects them to a bizarre homilyGod does have a habit of choosing unattractive oracles in this case not a beggar but a bore There is but one way to face all the cataclysmic history of the species the fatuous father tells those gathered before him Before performing the sacrament of marriage he asked everyone to learn first to forgive oneself to see the enormous effect we have upon one another and to acknowledge the undeniable significance of changing ones moral compassOf course trapped as they are in a novel by Richard Bausch the newlyweds and their guests dismiss this advice as that of a party hack spouting the line Pompous in the opinion of Michael way offkey,2014-08-17T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/us/jury-reaches-a-verdict-in-first-boston-bombing-trial.html,BOSTON   In the first of the trials emerging from the Boston Marathon bombing investigation a college classmate of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev the surviving suspect on Monday was convicted of trying to cover up evidence that could have incriminated his friend in the days after the attack 15 months agoThe defendant Azamat Tazhayakov 20 was convicted of conspiracy and obstruction of justice in the first of what will most likely be a series of trials leading up to Mr Tsarnaevs day in court which is scheduled for the fall With each trial Boston faces yet another reckoning with the events of April 15 2013 when two homemade bombs killed three people and wounded more than 260 others some severelyMr Tsarnaevs defense team has argued that the prosecution of minor figures before his November trial is a ploy by the government to maintain a steady drumbeat of reminders about the attackIn the case that ended on Monday prosecutors said that after Mr Tazhayakov and another friend Dias Kadyrbayev realized Mr Tsarnaev was a suspect in the bombing they removed items including a backpack and a laptop from Mr Tsarnaevs dorm room and agreed to throw out the backpack The men attended the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth The jury found Mr Tazhayakov guilty in connection with the removal of the backpack but not the laptopMr Tazhayakov was the first of four friends of the Tsarnaev brothers who faced charges stemming from the investigation Mr Kadyrbayev is set to be tried on the same charges in SeptemberMr Tazhayakov nodded and smiled tersely at his family as he entered the courtroom His little sister a toddler was playing and grinning on the bench with their parents His mother broke into sobs as the verdict was read The jury deliberated for half of Wednesday most of Thursday before one juror became ill and Monday morning Mr Tazhayakov faces a maximum of 20 years in prison on the obstruction charge and five on the conspiracy charge though Judge Douglas P Woodlock could consider lesser penalties at sentencing on Oct 16 A lawyer for Mr Tazhayakov Matthew Myers said he would appealThe six days of testimony in Bostons federal court delved into the relaxed social dynamics of the three young men and their friends who played soccer video games and smoked marijuana and offered glimpses of insight into Mr Tsarnaevs conduct before and after the bombings A month before the marathon prosecutors said he discussed martyrdom and told his friends he knew how to make a bomb in the hours after it he apparently texted Mr Tazhayakov denying his involvementBut the focus was on Mr Tazhayakov Prosecutors asserted that he was contacted by Mr Kadyrbayev shortly after surveillance photos of the Tsarnaev brothers were released by the FBI on April 18  three days after the bombing The government contended that the two met and looked at those photos on Mr Kadyrbayevs phone and that Mr Kadyrbayev showed Mr Tazhayakov a text message from Mr Tsarnaev imploring him to go to my room and take whats thereBefore the FBI knew that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a suspect in that investigation what did this defendant do He went to Tsarnaevs dorm room said an assistant United States attorney John A Capin Mr Capin said the two men removed the backpack and the laptop they found there as well as other items like a bag of marijuana and a jar of Vaseline Jurors heard law enforcement agents testify that Mr Tazhayakov had told them the two agreed it should be thrown outAnother assistant United States attorney Stephanie Siegmann said the men acted to protect their friend Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for one reason  because they had learned their friend was the marathon bomberMr Myers a defense lawyer said assertions like that one were completely unsupported and called into question the reliability of the FBI agents testimony when their conversations with Ms Tazhayakov had not been recordedMr Tazhayakovs lawyers did not call any of their own witnesses But on crossexamination they emphasized that their client sat passively in Mr Tsarnaevs room as Mr Kadyrbayev searched it and that it was Mr Kadyrbayev who actually put the backpack in a trash bin near the apartment the men shared in New Bedford MassHes not moving into action to obstruct  thats fabricated Mr Myers said during his closing argument in which he warned jurors repeatedly about guilt by associationIf you want to find a conspiracy you probably can because youre letting the enormity of what happened in this town affect you he told the jurors The reality is college kids think differentlyBut a juror Daniel Antonino 49 who works in health care sales was not persuaded I think any 20yearold sometimes gets themselves into in way over their heads Mr Antonino said outside the courthouse And that could have come into play But thats not the way we weighed this caseHe added Destroying the backpack putting it in a Dumpster thats pretty damn damning in my opinionMr Tsarnaev is awaiting the November start date of his trial on 30 charges,2014-07-22T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/23/nyregion/fatal-confrontation-heightens-tensions-in-staten-island-police-precinct.html,In a corner of Staten Island on a sidewalk across from a tiny triangular park a fatal police confrontation last month has drawn focus to an area plagued by disorder and rife with simmering tensions over policing and povertyEric Garners death in police custody on July 17 has been a lightning rod for protests over police brutality including a major demonstration here planned for Saturday and a grand jury investigation into possible criminal charges against the officers whose chokehold and takedown of Mr Garner the New York City medical examiner ruled caused his deathIt has also invited scrutiny on the 120th Precinct where distrust of police officers splits along racial linesComplaints of police misconduct here rival those in the Bronx and Brooklyn stopandfrisk encounters were among the highest in the city and have declined more slowly In the first half of 2014 the precinct recorded 1354 stops a citywide high even as its coverage area shrank significantly last yearMurders in the precincts historical boundaries have nearly doubled this year to nine more than the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Brownsville or East New York Gangs are so prevalent that the New York Police Department moved to test an ambitious communitybased intervention program here last year before the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio decided it would be better in BrooklynAmong the citys busiest police precincts  the A houses in the departments old jargon  the 120th Precinct covering Staten Islands northeast is often overlooked blending into an errant vision of homogeneity that many outsiders have of the borough Its an island amongst islands said the Rev Demetrius S Carolina of the First Central Baptist Church in the Stapleton sectionLong an afterthought amid the gunfire of Brooklyn and the Bronx the precinct now frames in microcosm the debate over the broken windows style of policing associated with the police commissioner William J Bratton in which heavy enforcement of small crimes  like selling cigarettes for 75 cents apiece on the street as Mr Garner was suspected of doing  is seen as preventing serious feloniesIn the aftermath videos emerged of violent arrests in the precinct where neon stickers mark shuttered drug spots and a troubled Jersey Street deli has its own police command post parked out front Stories of unpleasant racially tinged interactions surfacedMr Bratton traveled to the precinct after Mr Garners death and commended its hardworking officers who have said they now face taunts from residents and resistance from suspects The borough commander for Staten Island Assistant Chief Edward Delatorre dismissed criticism of the precinct saying he had not heard anyYoure assuming Im hearing the precinct beat up Chief Delatorre said in a recent interview at the borough headquarters on Hylan Boulevard south of the 120th What Im hearing out there are cops getting accolades Im getting letters very positive lettersMost of the officers who work in the 120th Precinct also live on Staten Island an arrangement not seen in other boroughs but unsurprising in a department where 3000 uniformed members live in the middleclass borough of 470000 That proximity to work means that offduty officers frequently alert their colleagues about crimes or tips in the manner of a small town Chief Delatorre saidThey study who the known recidivists are the known criminals who are wanted and they get to know them he said They have a real vested interest in the quality of life and the level of crime on this islandSuch attention is often welcome But it also leads to repeated encounters with smalltime offenders that residents said can turn ugly Residents object to the increased attention that living in a highcrime neighborhood brings to everyday activitiesThe police twice arrested Lenny Bishop 21 of Park Hill in cases that were later dismissed The first time officers mistook Mr Bishop who is black for a robbery suspect he spent several days in jail In July he was roughed up by officers after riding a bicycle on the sidewalk Surveillance video shows a verbal back and forth and a search of his basketball shorts before a pair of officers lifted Mr Bishop off his feet and slammed him to the ground He is suing the departmentA lot of the officers who are policing on the North Shore are Staten Island residents but not North Shore residents said Deborah Rose who represents the area on the City Council They havent been exposed to the level of diversity that we have in the North Shore communitiesMr Garner 43 was among those familiar to officers the sort whose face and name are studied as a known recidivist by those on patrol A March complaint to 311 named Eric alongside others said to be selling loose cigarettes and marijuana on Bay Street The next day Mr Garner was arrested there for illegal cigarette salesMr Garner would have known the officers who approached him too if not by name then by type plainclothes police ordered to treat small crimes as pressing concernsWhen a plainclothes anticrime team confronted him last month he refused to go Officers wrestled him to the ground as one officer Daniel Pantaleo wrapped an arm around Mr Garners neck he died soon afterwardOfficer Pantaleo a resident of Staten Islands South Shore had his badge and gun removed pending results of a district attorneys investigation Another officer Justin Damico also of southern Staten Island was reassigned to desk dutyLong before the area had become a priority for the police Fourteen of the 15 Staten Island gangs tracked by the department can be found north of the Staten Island ExpresswayAlong Park Hill Avenue the police are a regular presence In a nearby city park young men and teenagers congregateIt was a lot of killing I understand why the cops would be out here said Mohamed Jenkins 24 who was waiting near an overflowing water fountain for his turn on the basketball court on a recent Thursday afternoon But this is where I had my first fight my first kiss They stop me in my own home its outrageous To them everyone is a gangbangerResidents said the park was often a hot spot for conflicts with the police All cops are not bad cops but some of them think they can get away with stuff said Quantae Walton 28 standing with her 4yearold son Zaire near the Barack Obama Computer Center a community roomSeveral women described a chaotic scene on a recent night when two 14yearolds were briefly detained by the police clearing the park at dusk They bent my arm one hit me in my face one of the teenagers Kyshief Campbell said of the officers They handcuffed my cousin Neither was charged they saidKenrick Gray who died in a botched gunpoint robbery on a nearby sidewalk earlier this year was emblematic of the situation young black residents said they faced caught between crime and zealous policing Shortly before his death Mr Gray a father of two and an aspiring writer with a record of drug arrests received a 125000 settlement from the city and another 7500 from the officer who stopped and falsely arrested him The officer Michael Daragjati had been caught in a recording making racist statements He pleaded guilty in 2012 in federal court for violating Mr Grays civil rightsLast year Police Department planners scanned the city for a good spot to pilot an antiviolence initiative with David M Kennedy of the John Jay College of Criminal JusticePassing over neighborhoods synonymous with turfbased gun violence like Brownsville Brooklyn the department selected the 120th Precinct a former topranking official with knowledge of the project said The idea tested in other cities has known gang members sit down with community groups city agencies and the police in order to pressure them to stop gun violenceThe precinct covers a diverse collection of communities  Liberians selling flamesinged fish in parking lots new arrivals from Sri Lanka and Mexico mixing among descendants of Irish and the Dutch  that are separated by the trafficclogged expressway from the wealthier whiter areas to the southIts boundaries shrank last year as a new precinct the 121st was added to the northwestStill officers in the 120th Precinct face resistance during arrests for minor violations more frequently than most other precincts with dozens of people handcuffed so far this year in situations where resisting arrest was the top charge they were given according to state criminal justice statisticsChief Delatorre said that while every officers job was to go after lowerlevel crimes that bring down the quality of life in a neighborhood discretion was important As an example officers in Staten Islands housing projects who are increasingly writing field reports in lieu of making arrests when residents are stopped for minor infractions and passing that information on to the New York City Housing AuthorityAt the end of the day Im here to make this place nicer to make it more habitable for the people that are there the chief said These problems are not police problems Theyre everybodys

began to be displaced by urban refugees looking for a way back to nature We were similar in many ways only we didnt wear as much clothing says Gary Snyder a Pulitzer Prizewinning poet associated with the socalled deep ecology movement who arrived in 1970Friends and followers of his philosophy that human life is no more valuable than that of other living things built homesteads nearby Today the 3000 residents of the ridge include artisans and organic farmers some of them marijuana growers Seven miles outside Nevada City the county seat they all rely on wells for waterIn 1975 Mr Snyder and friends formed the San Juan Ridge Taxpayers Association which came to have a single purpose Keep mining outWe were a contemporary forwardlooking scientific not Nimby group said Mr Snyder 84 using a term for not in my backyard He said that separating tiny flecks of gold from huge pieces of gravel in an area rich with bears bobcats birds of prey and other wildlife made no senseThe group vehemently opposed companies wanting to operate an open pit mine a common practice on sparsely populated federal lands in Nevada where the bulk of American production takes placeIt was going to be a complete ecological disaster said Kurt Lorenz vice president of the association who has lived on the ridge for 36 years It would mean our living here was untenableTwo decades ago Mr Callaway set out to mine the ridge addressing the groups concerns headon He proposed an underground mine not an open pit and said that instead of using cyanide to extract the gold  also common elsewhere  he would use water and gravityWhen it became clear that Mr Callaway was going to win county approval the association acquiescedWe thought OK maybe this time we can make it work and we can make this gold disappear said Liese Greensfelder a science writer who has lived in the area since 1977 and dedicated much of her career to the antimining campaign The Taxpayers Association decided to support Mr Callaway while insisting on a mitigation agreement in case the mine damaged their waterIt was Mr Callaway says the first industrial production at the mine since the Depression But the moment of common cause came to an abrupt end after miners hit a vertical fourinch fault in the bedrock Millions of gallons of water gushed into the mine draining a dozen nearby wells including one at the Grizzly Hill SchoolMr Callaway paid for new wells and bottled water for several of the nine years the school imported waterMining is a treacherous business said Mr Alpers of the Geological Survey Sometimes you dont know what youll findIn 1997 faced with an unstable mine floor and a drop in gold prices the mine closed Wed barely gotten started Mr Callaway saidA consultant had determined that there were 257000 ounces of gold in the San Juan Ridge mine but Mr Callaway extracted only 17000 ounces before the mine closedTwo years ago with gold prices near record highs Mr Callaway the chief executive of San Juan Mining reappeared this time telling residents that an alternative approach horizontal drilling would avoid another calamityBut the Taxpayers Association is not willing to give him a second chance Members are concerned not only about another accident but also about the possibility that the daily operation of the mine could siphon off millions of gallons of water especially in drought years It could cause chronic dewatering problems said the groups president Sol Henson 35 a hydrologist who grew up here and has a cabin among the pinesMembers of the group have become expert in subsurface water movement and heavymetal contamination of groundwater They raised 40000 and spent thousands of hours educating themselves In April they packed a local theater to hear experts and watch a locally produced documentary about the anguish of residents whose water was affected the last time Mr Callaway opened his mineThe issue is Is gold mining compatible in a neighborhood where people were allowed to establish families and sink wells said Elizabeth Martin chief executive of the Sierra Fund a local nonprofit organization that advises groups opposing the mineMr Callaway rejects the associations argumentThe idea that the whole community would be depleted of water has no basis he said Thats just a function of a political campaign being waged against the projectMr Callaway says he has spent 18 million in the permit process and expects to pay an equal amount before it is over The cost includes monthly monitoring of local wells Over 100 homeowners signed up to have their well water testedBut by March Mr Callaway stopped paying for most of the measurementsIn a letter to Nevada County planning officials Mr Callaway said politics not science was driving the decision about what is a reasonable amount of data collection He balked at providing a blank check for more well water studiesTo no ones surprise the Taxpayers Association disagreed It hired Tom Myers a consultant on minings impact on water supplies who told county officials that the wells should be monitored for two years to assess the potential impacts of the proposed reopening of the mineMr Henson the hydrologist favors three years of testing a dry year a wet year and a normal oneThey felt they were burned in the 90s said the Nevada County planning director Brian Foss who must arbitrate the dispute They dont want to relive itWhile the Taxpayers Association members think about preserving the homes and 200 existing jobs on the ridge Mr Callaway makes a straightforward economic case He says his mine will provide 70 new jobs and 365000 in annual county tax revenue Not everyone can flip burgers and work at antique stores he saidAlthough the United States remains No 3 in world gold production behind China and Australia the struggle on San Juan Ridge reflects what the industry sees as a wider impediment Its very difficult to expand or open new mines said Luke Popovich spokesman for the National Mining Association We have enormous storehouses of minerals in this county but we cant seem to put supply and demand together in large part because the permitting issues are so fraughtCounty planning officials are expected to meet with Mr Callaway soon to try to resolve the impasse over water monitoring An environmental impact report required by state law will be written by independent consultants at Mr Callaways expense After written commentary and public hearings it will be up to county officials to decide the future of the mine on San Juan Ridge If Mr Callaway succeeds he expects to have a permit by 2016 and open the mine the following yearBut he is growing frustrated You cant have profits grow the economy provide jobs and tax revenue without impacts he said As a society we have to accept there is a price to pay,2014-08-23T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/us/stephen-gaskin-hippie-who-founded-an-enduring-commune-dies-at-79.html,Stephen Gaskin a Marine combat veteran and hippie guru who in 1971 led around 300 followers in a caravan of psychedelically painted school buses from San Francisco to Tennessee to start the Farm a commune that has outlived most of its countercultural counterparts while spreading good works from Guatemala to the South Bronx died on Tuesday at his home on the commune in Summertown Tenn He was 79Leigh Kahan a family spokesman confirmed the death without giving a specific causeBy Mr Gaskins account the Farm sprang in part from spiritual revelations he had experienced while using LSD the details of which he described to thousands of disciples who gathered in halls around San Francisco to hear his meditations on Buddhism Jesus and whatever else entered his mindBut to his followers he ultimately offered more than spiritual guidance In founding the Farm they said he gave concrete form to the human longing for togetherness coupled with individual expression that had energized the countercultureCommunes like the Farm have their antecedents throughout American history In the 1960s and 70s hundreds of thousands of people joined them though most of the communities did not last long But the Farm which grew to 1500 members at its peak in 1979 and has about 200 today has outlived almost all of them It now includes a retirement communityThe cultural clich has it that the flower children danced at Woodstock crashed at Altamont and gradually shed their nave ideals as they made themselves into icecream moguls media magnates and triangulating politicians Jim Windolf wrote in Vanity Fair in 2007 But the 200 people who live at the Farm he added have managed to hang on to the hippie spiritTimothy Miller a religious studies professor at the University of Kansas who has studied communes said in an interview that the Farm was the archetypal hippie commune in its commitment to higher consciousness selfsufficiency a clean environment and a flamboyant hippie styleBut where it departed from most of its counterparts was in embracing an entrepreneurial spirit It created a bookpublishing business marketed pickles and sorghum syrup under the Old Beatnik label and even dealt in handheld Geiger counters to measure radiation leaks at nuclear power plantsIt also spurned insularity for outreach Answering Mr Gaskins call to change the world Farmies as they called themselves built 1200 houses for the victims of a 1976 earthquake in Guatemala set up volunteer ambulance services in the South Bronx and on an Indian reservation in upstate New York and started a school lunch program in Belize and an agricultural training program in Liberia They were among the earliest volunteers to arrive in New Orleans after Hurricane KatrinaIn 1980 Plenty International a charitable organization Mr Gaskin started was awarded one of the first Right Livelihood Awards Sometimes called the alternative Nobel Prize the award is presented by the Swedish Parliament to those who have demonstrated practical and exemplary solutions to the most urgent challenges facing the world todayMr Gaskin and his wife the former Ina May Middleton developed a free midwifery service for women communard or not Ms Gaskin became a widely known advocate for giving birth outside of hospitals and has written popular books on the subjectTo a degree that startled outsiders in the 60s the Farms young men in straw hats and beards and women in long skirts lived an almost puritanical life They took vows of poverty and pooled their assets Vegetarianism was mandatory Mr Gaskin banned alcohol tobacco and to the surprise of many LSD though not marijuana Plenty of work  considered a form of meditation  was assigned Artificial birth control was forbiddenMr Gaskin who became a minister under Tennessee law decreed that if couples had sex they must be considered engaged and if the woman became pregnant they must marry Men were expected to treat women with knightly chivalry he saidMr Gaskin was born in Denver on Feb 16 1935 His father was a builder Lying about his age Stephen joined the Marines at 17 and saw combat in Korea He dropped out of junior college drank heavily and ran coffee houses At San Francisco State University he became a teaching assistant to S I Hayakawa the semanticistBy the mid1960s he was an instructor at the university giving courses on subjects like witchcraft After the literature department declined to renew his contract he began Monday Night Classes around San Francisco to delve more deeply into spiritual exotica He sat crosslegged on a stage advocated getting high  with or without drugs  and was given to making pronouncements like Its easier to be God than to see God He said his skill was an ability to talk intelligently while stoned longer than most peopleWhen liberal Christian ministers attending a conference in San Francisco heard him they invited him to visit churches around the United States to bring his message  minus the drugs  to alienated young people in their hometownsHe agreed and when followers asked if they could accompany him he said yes provided they brought their own wheels and paid their own wayOn Oct 10 1970 Mr Gaskin led a caravan of 25 school buses and other vehicles on a tour of 42 states Fifty more vehicles and 150 more people including several babies born along the way joined the tourAfter returning to San Francisco the group was unsure what to do next As the story goes someone at a meeting blurted out Lets go to Tennessee  where people had been nice to them  and get a farmAnother caravan hit the road Not long after arriving in Tennessee the group bought a 1014acre farm south of Nashville for 70 an acre and began setting up tentsMr Gaskin admonished his disciples to treat the local people with courtesy The sheriff called the Farmies a fine bunch of people Mr Gaskin was nonetheless arrested and convicted on drug charges after the police found a large marijuana patch on the property having been alerted by passersby who had witnessed naked commune members playing flutes to the plants He took responsibility though he had questioned the wisdom of cultivating the plantMore than 600 locals signed a petition protesting his threeyear sentence but to no avail He was paroled after one yearAs the commune grew families moved out of tents and into newly built houses By 1982 the Farm had added 700 acres and established 10 satellites in other states It incorporated as a family monastery to avoid taxesBy then it had accepted elements of capitalism having fallen deep into debt in the early 1970s Some said Mr Gaskin had pushed the community to expand beyond its capacity He was asked to step down as titular leader in 1983 but continued to live on the Farm with his wife who survives himThree earlier marriages ended in divorce He is also survived by a daughter from his second marriage Dana Wenig a son Floyd Hagler from a nonmarital relationship three children from his current marriage Eva Samuel and Paul Gaskin a sister Sherry Gaskin and five grandchildrenIn 2000 Mr Gaskin sought the Green Partys presidential nomination but drew just 10 of 319 votes The winner Ralph Nader received 295His campaign statement declared I want it to be

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/books/a-dylan-insiders-back-pages.html,LOS ANGELES   On a bright cool afternoon in July Jacob Maymudes sat on the deck of the small guesthouse he rents in the Los Feliz neighborhood here reflecting on the strange journey of his first book Another Side of Bob Dylan which will be published on Sept 9 and has already excited interestIt was never my intention to write a book about Bob he said summoning up the difficult period in his life when he resisted completing the memoir left unfinished by his father Victor Maymudes pronounced mayMOODes a longtime member of Mr Dylans inner circle who had bitterly fallen out with him in 1997 and died four years later leaving behind 24 hours of taped reminiscencesNow 34 Jake grew up long after the Dylan legend had been formed but he comes honestly to his casual Bob He was 7 when he first met Mr Dylan at the back lot of Universal Studios Jake was with his father who was continually on the road with Mr Dylan carrying out an assortment of essential backstage assignments as tour manager chauffeur and body man not to mention chessplaying companionThey were roles he had been playing off and on since the early 1960s when he was known as Mr Dylans protective sidekick together with him in London for Mr Dylans first overseas concert in a Manhattan hotel suite for a marijuanainfused summit with the Beatles in Malibu where Mr Dylans first wife Sara is said to have poured out her marital troubles to Jakes mother Linda Wylie while the unreleased Blood on the Tracks played on the stereo and Mr Dylan suddenly walked inHe said the songs were so painful he didnt know how anybody listened to them Ms Wylie said in a phone interview last weekNot quite six years older than Mr Dylan Victor an imposing darkhaired sixfooter was an established figure on the folk scene  a promoter manager and club owner in Los Angeles  when he came to New York and met the singer in 1961 or 1962The two instantly connected and as Mr Dylans career took off Victor moved in and out of his orbit  drifting away to pursue projects of his own but always circling back to Mr DylanHe was perceived as the keeper of the secrets said David Hajdu a music historian whose book Positively 4th Street describes the early 60s folk scene His reputation was for being enigmatic closemouthed trustworthy impenetrableVictors presence at the creation mattered to Mr Dylan said Sean Wilentz the Princeton historian and author of Bob Dylan in America a 2010 best seller Its a sense of loyalty of kinship he said You were brothers together You were scuffling Thats why Dylan brought him backBrought him back even after an episode involving a teenage girl that led to Victors being fired as tour manager in 1995 Another star might have banished him Instead Mr Dylan had Victor scout for and look after his real estate holdings A quarrel over one property caused the final acrimonious break in 1997In 2000 Victor who was flat broke signed a book contract with St Martins Press and began speaking into a tape recorder A year later he died of an aneurysm at 65 The unfinished book became another mythic item in the everexpanding Dylanology and curiosity grewWhat will he reveal as Mr Hajdu put itIt was a question Jake was in no rush to answer He was still troubled by his fathers death and the sense that Victor had placed his needs above those of Jake and his familyThen in January 2013 a fire destroyed the New Mexico house where Ms Wylie had been living Though long estranged from Victor she had kept his ashes in a box It was incinerated in the blaze and only the ashes and the tapes seemed to remain of VictorThe whole idea was to write this homage to my father Jake who has a career in visual effects in film and TV recalled of his decision to finish his fathers work Everything else burned upHe put an hour of raw audio on YouTube and quickly I got 400 hits in a day he said Biographers journalists and fans got in touch urging him to release the other 23 hours or to turn them into a bookJake diligently transcribed the tapes and sent material off to his fathers publisher but got a firm rejection OK then he would publish the book himself But a Kickstarter campaign fell far short of the 45000 goal even after an article in Rolling Stone brought in fresh donationsWith the guidance of an agent Jake tried again piecing together his fathers freeform tales and crosschecking the jumble of incidents against books like Clinton Heylins Bob Dylan A Life in Stolen Moments Day by Day 19411995 This time when he tried St Martins he got a contractAnother Side of Bob Dylan is an unusual addition to the giant Dylan oeuvre the quirky stepchild of Mr Dylans own looping narratives One thread explores Victors adventures in Sunset Strip bohemia In the 1950s he was a cofounder of the Unicorn a club that attracted the likes of Lenny Bruce and Marlon Brando In the 60s and 70s Victor palled with Dennis Hopper going to Peru to help build sets and scout locations and ingest mountains of cocaine for Hoppers illstarred 1971 epic The Last MovieThe second narrative is an intimate conversational account of Victors tempestuous friendship with Mr Dylan It included designing and building a house in New Mexico for Mr Dylan in the 70s Later Victor bought and fitted out the tour bus Mr Dylan used on his Never Ending Tour in the 1980s and 90sBut the most vivid passages go back further  to 1964 the pivotal year when Mr Dylan broke out of the East Coast folkie bubble and made a crosscountry journey Victor took the wheel of a blue Ford station wagon also joined by the folk musician Paul Clayton and the journalist Peter KarmanIt was a group of friends all in the know a nucleus of hip in America Mr Wilentz said of the 1964 tour It was something special The civil rights movement was going onThe stops included a visit to the poet Carl Sandburg in North Carolina and a stay in New Orleans during Mardi Gras where Mr Dylan was denied entrance to a blacksonly bar Back on the road they heard early Beatles hits on the car radio and Mr Dylan feverishly scrawled lyrics in a spiral notebookThe first inkling of Mr Dylans new fame came in London that May when he performed at the Royal Festival Hall to an audience much larger than he normally drew in America Victor draped his large frame over Mr Dylan as they slipped through the ecstatic crowdFresh from this triumph the pair vacationed in Vouliagmeni Greece on the Mediterranean I explored the coast and swam in the sea Victor recalls while Mr Dylan stayed in the hotel typing and handwriting between smoking cigarettes and he can do that for longer than anybody I knowReturning to New York they rushed to a studio and Mr Dylan blurted it all out running through 11 new songs one after another without rehearsingImprobable though this account seems it squares with the one in Howard Souness book Down the Highway The Life of Bob Dylan which describes a single sixhour session lubricated by Beaujolais that resulted in the album Another Side of Bob Dylan Mr Dylans farewell at age 23 to the bluesinflected folk idiom he had conquered Two songs  Chimes of Freedom and My Back Pages with its soaring refrain Ah but I was so much older thenIm younger than that now  signaled the next visionary phase in Mr Dylans workLater that summer he was invited to meet the Beatles at the Delmonico Hotel The Dylan entourage brought along some marijuana Mr Dylan sat down to roll a joint as Victor and others have reported but he proved all thumbs and Victor expertly took commandIt was the first quality weed the Beatles had smoked but the giddy conversation went on without Mr Dylan Exhausted from a string of late nights and a few drinks he passed out on the floor Victor remembersNot that the book is an exercise in skeleton rattling or score settling On the contrary Victor reverently speaks of Mr Dylans greatness and genius and rejoices in the magical mystery tour Mr Dylan opened up for him  even as he remained curiously remote The book suggests that the closer one got to Mr Dylan the more unknowable he became Mr Dylans representatives did not respond to email and phone requests for comment for this articleThroughout Victor is grateful for the many favors Mr Dylan did him like bringing him back into the fold no questions asked when Victor had run out of money in the 80s and needed a paycheck Youre hired he remembers Mr Dylan sayingJake too reveres Mr Dylan When I went to see him choice memorabilia were carefully laid out on his bed set lists from Mr Dylans tours stray notebook jottings in Mr Dylans hand as well as a hilariously vituperative letter the singer apparently drafted on hotel stationery in Tokyo to a music journalist back homeThere was also the guest book from the memorial for Victor at McCabes Guitar Shop in Santa Monica in 2001 Tom Petty Jackson Browne and the filmmaker Paul Mazursky all signed it Mr Dylan did not attend Jake is certain although Jakes sister Aerie told me that a slight figure in a hoodie Mr Dylans usual garb slipped into the proceedings and left just as quietlyNext we climbed into Jakes secondhand SUV bought with a portion of his 70000 book advance and headed to the 18th Street Coffee House in Santa Monica Part of a larger complex purchased by Mr Dylan in the mid1990s it was designed and built by VictorI helped nail the roof put up these poles laid the brick Jake said He worked there as a teenager and Aerie briefly managed the place until as has been reported by Mr Sounes and now Jake losses in the first year totaled almost 100000 Aerie was told she would be dismissedI told him he needed to fire me himself she recalled last week referring to Mr Dylan And thats what happened Mr Dylan came by she recalled and brusquely let her go Victor who witnessed the incident quit that instant Jake writes He sued Mr Dylan for retirement funds and the friendship was never repairedAll he had to do was apologize to Aerie and all of this would be different Victor told JakeAnd yet Jake has fond memories of the coffeehouse Mr Dylan and Victor playing wordless games of chess Ray Mancini showing up for sparring sessions with Mr Dylan at the private boxing club in back Jake sneaking into Mr Dylans office to find fresh pages typed on both sides and with no margins sitting alongside the oldfashioned typewriterHe was always nice to me Jake said of the man he grew up thinking of as his fathers boss And except for the Merit cigarettes Jake bummed at age 15 I never asked anything of him

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/us/rare-spotlight-on-rural-hawaii-after-storm-leaves-election-cliffhanger.html,PUNA Hawaii   Politics seldom intrudes on the easternmost district of the Big Island of Hawaii a hardtoreach paradise where the homes are nestled among lavaformed cliffs and the papaya and macadamia nut harvests loom larger than the machinations in Honolulu let alone in WashingtonTraditionally Puna is the place time forgot said Dawn Hurwitz 58 who has lived here for almost half of her life This is the Wild WestBut nobody has forgotten about Puna this weekLast week the area was battered by Tropical Storm Iselle which left thousands of people without power or running water And while residents are focused on digging out after the storm politicians aides and television crews have swarmed in well aware that voters here are poised to finally decide the long bitter Senate primary race between the incumbent Brian Schatz and Representative Colleen HanabusaMr Schatz leads by just 1600 votes after Saturdays Democratic election But with roads blocked by trees downed by the storm two polling places here were closedSo on Friday a rare election has been scheduled that will allow about 7000 voters from this district to cast ballots that could decide the race But it is not clear if the voting will proceed On Wednesday Ms Hanabusa asked a state circuit court on the Big Island to halt the election arguing that many people either do not know about the vote or cannot get to the polls A hearing was set for ThursdayIn the meantime she has been ladling out chili to residents and Mr Schatz has distributed water and ice Both candidates have a lot at stake The victor in the primary will almost certainly win the general election No Republican has been elected to the Senate in this state since 1970Its awesome  our moment in the sun said Elizabeth Robertson a 60yearold retiree who had gone to a community center in search of ice after it had sold out in minutes at the local stores Maybe it will help bring attention to how hard it is here and get us a few more bits and pieces of services A lot of us feel like were living in a thirdworld country we really doBut the sudden focus on Puna has also highlighted the divide in Hawaii between the highrises of Honolulu and the poorer rural districts like this one on the outer islands where residents have long felt neglected by the states politiciansOnce a haven for hippies known as Punatics Puna still draws people who want to escape bigcity life Off the single highway pavement soon gives way to gravel roads and cellphone service fades Dreadlocks and marijuana smoke are easy to find on the street in Pahoa the districts commercial center But Puna is the fastestgrowing area of Hawaii home to a diverse mix of native Hawaiians papaya farmers fishermen and people drawn here from other islands by the promise of more affordable landThere are reasons that real estate prices have stayed low There is no major hospital in the district Ambulance companies will not always brave the gravel roads residents said And most homes get water from rainwater catchment systems which stop working when the power goes down as it did when the tropical storm hit last week Mail is delivered to big groups of post office boxes on the side of the roadAnd with the areas growth has come a desire for more resourcesThis area continues to suffer from neglect said Russell Ruderman who represents Puna in the State Senate I think we saw that in the last few daysHis seat was created two years ago as a result of the booming population which has more than doubled since 1990 according to the federal census Maybe this moment in the spotlight will be enough to get us a second road out of Puna or some disaster prevention funding he saidBefore Mr Schatz and Ms Hanabusa flew here the day after the election last week  officially to help with the recovery effort but also to stump for the final few votes  there had been little government help in the storm cleanup residents said Many took pride in the communitys selfsufficiencyKail Albert a handyman who plans to support Ms Hanabusa said the lack of support in the hours after the storm had been frustrating but not surprisingUsually its all about Oahu he said Were like the last ones on the totem pole down here Were kind of like secondrate citizensMr Albert spent the days after the storm working with neighbors to clear albizia trees an invasive species that topples easily which were blocking roads and had caused most of the damageA lot of people were stopping and helping each other he said There was a lot of aloha out hereIf the election proceeds here on Friday Ms Hanabusa would have to win by a wide margin to overtake Mr Schatz That is no easy feat in an area where political interest has often been low and almost a third of residents live in poverty according to census dataMs Hanabusa filed for an injunction to allow more time to restore power so that more people could cast ballots This really comes down to peoples fundamental right to vote she said in an interview Some of the people in the hardesthit areas who were trapped in their homes last weekend are not going to be allowed to voteWith many people still struggling to find basic necessities both campaigns moved to try to fill the voidMr Schatz set up operations at a community center here where he handed bags of ice to residents through car windows He said nothing about the election and did not speak to reportersSome people did not recognize the senator though Maave Enos a volunteer who was helping to distribute the ice occasionally shouted Remember when you vote you vote for himJolyn Ho 40 who was also distributing ice said she was undecided on whom she would vote for Asked what could sway her she said Maybe if he was here again tomorrow  and the day after thatMs Hanabusa was willing to campaign slightly more openly She spent time giving out chili which she helped make a campaign spokesman said and ice at a farmers marketHer volunteers wore Hanabusa shirts and some went house to house to tell people about the electionI have campaign people who are driving around with chain saws she said If they see driveways with trees that need to be cleared theyre just going to jump out and do itWith miles of power lines down even the effort to inform voters about the election was daunting Along Makuu Drive one of the hardesthit roads residents without access to television or the Internet had no idea that an election had been scheduledIts a little ironic Ms Hurwitz who has lived here for 26 years said of the attention from the outside world For so many years Ive been witness to the lack of infrastructure and funding hereMs Hurwitz had come to a community center to charge her phone She said she had not yet decided which candidate to support but she clearly found humor in Punas sudden electoral muscleWere sitting in the catbird seat she said Itll be very amusing to observe I dont have very high expectations,2014-08-14T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/us/shooting-accounts-differ-as-holder-schedules-visit.html,FERGUSON Mo  As a county grand jury prepared to hear evidence on Wednesday in the shooting death of a black teenager by a white police officer that touched off 10 days of unrest here witnesses have given investigators sharply conflicting accounts of the killingSome of the accounts seem to agree on how the fatal altercation initially unfolded with a struggle between the officer Darren Wilson and the teenager Michael Brown Officer Wilson was inside his patrol car at the time while Mr Brown who was unarmed was leaning in through an open windowMany witnesses also agreed on what happened next Officer Wilsons firearm went off inside the car Mr Brown ran away the officer got out of his car and began firing toward Mr Brown and then Mr Brown stopped turned around and faced the officerBut on the crucial moments that followed the accounts differ sharply officials say Some witnesses say that Mr Brown 18 moved toward Officer Wilson possibly in a threatening manner when the officer shot him dead But others say that Mr Brown was not moving and may even have had his hands up when he was killedThe accounts of what witnesses have told local and federal law enforcement authorities come from some of those witnesses themselves law enforcement authorities and others in Ferguson Many spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing a continuing investigationThe new details on the witness accounts emerged as Attorney General Eric H Holder Jr was scheduled to visit Ferguson on Wednesday to meet with FBI agents who have been conducting a civil rights investigation into the shootingMr Holder and top Justice Department officials were weighing whether to open a broader civil rights investigation to look at Fergusons police practices at large according to law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal talks The issue came up after news reports revealed a 2009 case in which a man said that four police officers beat him then charged him with damaging government property  by getting blood on their uniformsUnder Mr Holder the Justice Department has opened nearly two dozen such investigations into police departments more than twice as many as were opened in the previous five years according to department dataAlso on Tuesday federal authorities learned the results of an autopsy performed on Mr Brown by military coroners that showed that he had been shot six times though they declined to release further details until their investigation was finished An autopsy conducted on behalf of Mr Browns family also found that he had been shot at least six times  including once in the face and once in the top of his head  with all bullets striking him in the front The county has also done its own autopsy which found evidence of marijuana in Mr Browns systemThe Brown family has scheduled a funeral for MondayClashes between the police and protesters have become a nightly ritual although the scene on Tuesday was initially calm The authorities took their positions before sunset and Missouri National Guard soldiers staffed checkpoints at the shopping center that is now a police command post Demonstrators marched without incident while officers watched The quiet nature of the protests raised hopes that they had entered a calmer phase but more confrontations were reported overnight with 47 people arrestedIn a statement on Tuesday night Gov Jay Nixon expressed sympathy for the Brown family and praised residents for standing against armed and violent instigators But he also said that a vigorous prosecution must now be pursuedThe democratically elected St Louis County prosecutor and the attorney general of the United States each have a job to do Mr Nixon said Their obligation to achieve justice in the shooting death of Michael Brown must be carried out thoroughly promptly and correctly and I call upon them to meet those expectationsThe fatal confrontation began on Aug 9 shortly after the police received reports that two men had robbed a convenience store in Ferguson Officer Wilson who was not responding to the robbery had stopped to speak with Mr Brown and a friend Dorian Johnson The Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson said that it was around the time that Officer Wilson started talking to the two that he realized they fit the description of the suspects in the convenience store robberyA lawyer for Mr Johnson said that his client was interviewed by the FBI and the St Louis County police last week for nearly four hours In that interview Mr Johnson admitted that he and Mr Brown had stolen cigarillos from the store said the lawyer Freeman R Bosley JrMr Bosley said that the officer told the two to get off the street adding that Mr Johnson told the officer that he lived nearby They got into a bit of a verbal dispute with the officer about whether walking in the street constituted a crime Mr Bosley saidContrary to what several witnesses have told law enforcement officials Mr Bosley said that the officer then reached out of the window with his left hand and grabbed Mr Brown by the throatHe said Mr Brown pushed him off and the officer then grabbed Mr Browns shirtMy client sees the officer pull a gun and hears him say Ill shoot you  then pow there was a shot Mr Bosley said referring to the one that apparently went off in the car He did not describe a scuffle It was more of a scuffle for him to get awayAsked if Mr Brown had punched the officer Mr Bosley said that Mr Johnson did not observe thatHowever law enforcement officials say witnesses and forensic analysis have shown that Officer Wilson did sustain an injury during the struggle in the carAs Officer Wilson got out of his car the men were running away The officer fired his weapon but did not hit anyone according to law enforcement officialsMr Johnson took cover near a parked car as he saw the officer confronting Mr Brown Mr Bosley saidA man who lives nearby Michael T Brady said in an interview that he saw the initial altercation in the patrol car although he struggled to see exactly what was happeningIt was something strange said Mr Brady 32 a janitor Something was not right It was some kind of altercation I cant say whether he was punching the officer or whatever But something was going on in that window and it didnt look rightMr Brady said he had been interviewed by county investigators but not the FBIMr Brady said he could see Mr Johnson at the front passenger side of the car when he and Mr Brown suddenly started running Mr Brady did not hear a gunshot or know what caused them to run But he said he did see a police officer get out of the patrol car and start walking briskly while firing on Mr Brown as he fledWhat happened next could be what the case turns on Several witnesses have told investigators that Mr Brown stopped and turned around with his arms upAccording to his account to the Ferguson police Officer Wilson said that Mr Brown had lowered his arms and moved toward him law enforcement officials said Fearing that the teenager was going to attack him the officer decided to use deadly force Some witnesses have backed up that account Others however  including Mr Johnson  have said that Mr Brown did not move toward the officer before the final shots were firedA lawyer for the police union Greg Kloeppel did not return calls for commentThe FBI Mr Bosley said pressed Mr Johnson to say how high Mr Browns hands were Mr Johnson said that his hands were not that high and that one was lower than the other because he appeared to be favoring it the lawyer saidJames McKnight who also said he saw the shooting said that Mr Browns hands were up right after he turned around to face the officerI saw him stumble toward the officer but not rush at him Mr McKnight said in a brief interview The officer was about six or seven feet away from himAlso Tuesday a few miles from Ferguson St Louis Metropolitan Police officers shot and killed a 23yearold black man The shooting threatened to further inflame a community still reeling from Mr Browns deathSam Dotson the chief of the St Louis Metropolitan Police said two officers encountered a man at the Six Stars Market in northwest St Louis behaving erratically and brandishing a knife The officers repeatedly warned Stop drop the knife but he refused Chief Dotson saidThe man approached the officers knife raised and was shot after he came within three or four feet the chief saidIn a sign of how tense the situation remains Chief Dotson went out into a crowd at the scene of the shooting to tell it what the police understood had occurred I think its important that people understand what happened he said He said witnesses including a local alderman had confirmed the account of the officers I want this message to be out as truthfully and quickly as possible the chief saidBut not all in the crowd were willing to listen A small group of protesters most of them black gathered at the scene chanting Hands up Dont shootEven if this is a legitimate shooting they are going to capitalize on this and try to use it for their martial law agenda said Christopher Hobbs 21 who had joined dozens of other residents at the scene,2014-08-20T00:00:00Z,drugs

while their zoning rules are reviewed and this month the Bridgeport zoning board turned down a licenseeThe law signed by Gov Dannel P Malloy a Democrat in May 2012 requires that a pharmacist dispense the drug and limits the list of qualifying ailments Four manufacturers and six dispensaries have so far been licensedYet even with the restrictions those who are trying to open the facilities are running into opposition from residents who are concerned that a dispensary nearby would reduce the stigma for children to try marijuana invite black markets or lower property valuesTwentyone states and the District of Columbia have passed laws permitting medical marijuana Only Connecticut mandates an onsite pharmacistIn the patchwork of marijuana laws emerging across the country Connecticut is somewhere in the middle not as adventurous as Colorado and Washington which have decriminalized marijuana for recreational use for people over 21 or California where residents can buy medical marijuana for common conditions such as sleeplessness loss of appetite and anxiety Anyone from other states can too using a hotel room as a residence There is no official count of marijuana dispensaries in California but Los Angeles alone is believed to have over 500 Critics say Californias porous rules set forth in a 1996 law have essentially legalized marijuana as a recreational drugConnecticut acted before neighboring New York where Gov Andrew M Cuomo a Democrat and longtime opponent of legalizing medical marijuana said in January that he would approve an experimental program allowing up to 20 hospitals to prescribe the drugProponents of medical marijuana have also faced a struggle in New Jersey The state enacted its Compassionate Care Act in 2010 when Jon S Corzine a Democrat was governor It offers immunity from prosecution to people using marijuana for a range of ailments and makes a provision for six alternative treatment centers to dispense it Three have opened The current governor Chris Christie a Republican is opposed to the law and has limited edible marijuana to sick childrenThe first Connecticut dispensaries are not scheduled to open until summer but almost 2000 patients certified by doctors as eligible to benefit from medical marijuana have registered with the State Department of Consumer Protection by supplying proof of identity and a photograph and paying a 100 feeSome like Angela Fiorini a former 911 police dispatcher who is undergoing chemotherapy for follicular lymphoma are smoking marijuana they buy from streetcorner dealers with immunity from prosecution because legislators felt it was cruel to make genuinely sick people wait for the dispensariesOpponents have slowed the drugs rollout Last month Bridgeports zoning board turned down a location in a former library building chosen by a licensed dispenser D  B Wellness It would have been the most convenient dispensary for Fairfield County but neighbors objected to the sites proximity to a lowincome apartment houseMinnie Simmons whose accounting office is near the proposed Bridgeport site said she had worried that the presence of security guards and cameras would let people know that it was a marijuana dispensary and possibly encourage casual marijuana smokers to induce patients to sell them the drug creating a black market Children she said might also conclude that if some people can obtain marijuana legally its not such a bad thingWere not opposed to helping the people We dont like the location she said Would you want that next to an apartment building with children And with a Walgreens you dont know what I purchased If I come out of a marijuana facility you specifically know what my situation isD  Bs lawyer will appeal to the city and the courts but the company has only until Saturday to show it has zoning approvalWilliam M Rubenstein the states commissioner of consumer protection said he would not speculate about any course of action after thatAssuming the Bridgeport facility does not get its zoning approval patients in Fairfield County will have to travel farther for their medicine he saidAngela DAmico a principal in D  B said the boards rejection reflected a lack of understanding about marijuanas medical benefits Calling it miracle medicine she said that it helped her with her own arthritis and insomnia when she used the drug with a medical marijuana card she obtained legally in California and that she wanted others to experience such reliefConnecticuts law restricts marijuana to residents who are over 18 and have received a physicians certification that they have one of the conditions that marijuana might soothe The qualifying ailments include cancer glaucoma HIV or AIDS Parkinsons multiple sclerosis spinal cord nerve damage epilepsy Crohns disease cachexia and posttraumatic stress disorderMr Rubenstein said that established pharmacies could theoretically qualify as dispensaries but that given the opposition in federal laws to marijuana they might not want to risk the federal registrations they need for selling controlled substancesHe said he did not think a sometimes amorphous diagnosis like PTSD might open the door to widespread use because every patient would need to have a doctor confirm the benefits of using marijuana outweigh any detriments Stronger controlled substances are already legally prescribed for the disorder he notedThe medical marijuana can be grown and produced as capsules oils pastries and patches as well as the more common leaves and stems Some forms have been shorn of the chemical  tetrahydrocannabinol or THC  that creates the marijuana high No more than 25 ounces can be dispensed within 30 daysThe six dispensary licensees chosen from among 27 applicants who paid 5000 apiece are dispersed around the state and are in addition to Bridgeport in Branford Bristol Hartford South Windsor and Uncasville Mr Rubenstein said the selections were based on business experience financial wherewithal and operational plans All except the Bridgeport site have received zoning approvalsPatients with state marijuana cards can buy it on the street without fear of prosecutionMs Fiorini 51 who is from Monroe Conn said that for eight months she had been buying the drug from dealers in Bridgeport for roughly 120 an ounce that she smoked or baked in brownies Until she began using it she said prescribed pills had not alleviated the nausea she experiences from chemotherapyWithin 10 minutes of smoking marijuana every single symptom of chemo was completely gone she said I went from vomiting to eating a full mealMs Fiorini is ready to buy marijuana at a dispensary because it will be safer than buying from drug dealers She has spoken at public meetings on behalf of Ms DAmicos applicationMs DAmico 56 a Brooklynraised woman who was a publisher of art prints for 28 years began investigating marijuana because she had heard that it could slow the progress of Alzheimers which had affected seven aunts and an uncle Her business partner Karen Barski 42 a registered nurse said she learned how marijuana calmed the tremors of Parkinsons and reduced migraine painNick Tamborrino 37 a pharmacist for Yale New Haven Health System applied to open a dispensary  Bluepoint Apothecary and Wellness  in Branford Dispensing marijuana he said should be no different from dispensing other controlled substances that he furnishes as a pharmacist He was able to win approval from the Branford zoning board for a rented storefront in an industrial areaI didnt want it on Main Street in the public eye Mr Tamborrino said I wanted it at a discreet location,2014-05-02T00:00:00Z,drugs

least to his kids college tuitionHes paid tens of thousands of dollars in rent on possible locations for a potshop chain hired lawyers and picked out flooring But now the nations second legal recreational marijuana industry is about to start without himONeil struck out in Washingtons lottery for coveted potshop licenses He has unsuccessfully tried to buy companies that scored a lucky number In frustration hes turning what would have been his Seattle retail store into a medical marijuana dispensaryOur company is bleeding money and I havent sold a single joint ONeil saysAs Washington plows toward the legalization of pot its finding that getting the cannabis market off the ground has been even tougher than anyone imaginedAmong the frustrated are growers who have been waiting months for permission to start raising their barcoded plants advocates who wish more public health messaging had been done by now and wouldbe pot vendors like ONeil who say bad luck minor oversights on their applications or errors by state officials have torpedoed otherwise promising effortsWashingtons Liquor Control Board expects to issue the first 15 to 20 marijuana retail licenses July 7 months later than first expected but its not clear how many of those shops are ready to open Board staff said last week only one shop in Seattle is prepared for its final inspectionRandy Simmons the boards legal pot project manager predicts a bumpy road with an initial shortage of stores and marijuana alike Many businesses that got lucky in the potshop lottery in April have since been disqualified such as by being too close to schools or playgrounds Others havent finished building or made deals to buy pot from licensed growersThis is a goldrush mentality and everybody wants to get rich Simmons says Some people just dont have an idea what theyre doing  no clue at all It slows down the processPot shortages are certain More than 2600 people applied last fall to grow marijuana but those applications are being reviewed glacially by the boards 18 swamped licensing investigators Only about 80 growers have been approved and some wont harvest by early July Hundreds of applicants havent even been assigned an investigatorPrices could run more than 25 a gram for the heavily taxed pot  about twice what the states unregulated medical dispensaries charge  until more growers are licensed Simmons saysThere will be no edibles available People who want to make brownies cookies or other potinfused treats must have their kitchens inspected by the state Of the two tested so far one failed  it didnt even have a handwashing sink The report on the other hasnt been completedThe board has capped the number of retail stores statewide at 334 but dozens of jurisdictions have banned them prompting lawsuits in two citiesColorado which also voted in 2012 to legalize pot for adults over 21 is bringing in millions of dollars a month while Washington struggles to build its industry Unlike Washington Colorado already had a regulated medical system making for a smoother transition when it allowed dispensaries to begin selling for recreational use in January Washington has also done more work developing marijuana safety standardsMany industry hopefuls have found Washingtons delays maddening Douglas Taylor spent 230000 on land for his planned outdoor grow The payments run 1600 a month and he says the board hasnt even started reviewing his application Meanwhile he has missed the outdoor growing season  a revenue loss of about 500000 he estimatesEd Rhinehart 58 a retired businessman counted on being licensed for an outdoor grow by April He hired four workers spent 22000 on a required fence and dropped 10000 on surveillance cameras April 15 he laid everybody off After months of backandforth with the board Rhinehart expects to get his license soon But he too will have missed the outdoor seasonIf I had to do it all over again I wouldnt have done it he saysMany wouldbe retailers allege missteps by the board For example they point to mixed signals about whether officials would allow multiple people to apply for retail licenses using the same address The board did and some groups formed numerous corporations to apply myriad times  significantly boosting their lottery odds and prompting complaints they gamed the systemOthers say they were kicked out of the lottery because inaccurate measurements placed them within 1000 feet of a protected area because board staff misread their criminal history or because they supposedly failed to turn in complete applicationsSimmons says anyone who believes mistakes were made in their removal from the lottery should appeal and 127 people have done so But its unclear what the state will do for them if they succeedDespite the bumps others credit the board for its handling of a monumental task Bob Leeds who retired from banking and socialservices work is a partner at Sea of Green Farms a licensed potgrower in Seattle His team just finished harvesting 40 pounds  some of the first marijuana that will be legally sold in WashingtonIts the most fun thing Ive ever done he says I had never seen a marijuana plant until a year and a half ago Now I own 5000 of them___,2014-06-30T01:09:07Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/08/01/world/americas/01reuters-honduras-immigration.html,TEGUCIGALPA   After meeting US President Barack Obama in Washington Honduran President Juan Hernandez sees little hope of an immediate solution to stemming a wave of child migrants fleeing misery and violence in Central America for the United StatesJoined by his counterparts from El Salvador and Guatemala Hernandez met with Obama and US lawmakers last week to discuss how to confront an unprecedented surge in child migrants that has overwhelmed border resources and ignited a fierce political debate in the United States over what to do with the childrenIn an interview with Reuters Hernandez said Obama offered the presidents no explicit help The Honduran leader said political bickering between Democratic and Republican lawmakers was killing the chances of any short or longterm fix to the crisisI havent lost hope but I thought by this stage we would already have our first concrete results in terms of dealing with this crisis Hernandez said late on Thursday in his darkwood oval shaped office at the presidential residenceThis is a huge monster with one foot in Central America and Mexico and the other foot in the United States he said As time passes this problem is only going to get worseObama wants 37 billion in emergency government funds to tackle the child migrant crisis but the deeply divided Congress which  is due to leave for its summer recess on Friday has not yet decided whether to approve itIf approved Hernandez said Honduras a poor and violent country with the worlds highest murder rate would see about 300 million of that money to spend on receiving children and their families and reintegrate them into societyPresident Obama is urging Congress to approve resources Hernandez said But the problem is that in Congress on the side of the Republicans were not hearing the same and for a definitive solution to be reached  they need to work in unison and I dont feel that is happeningRepublicans want to beef up security on the USMexican border to curb the influx of migrants and change a 2008 law so that immigrants can be deported more quickly They have also criticized Obama for not acting fast enough to get to grips with the crisisThe chances of reaching a bipartisan solution in Washington is further complicated by the fact that both parties have their eye on the 2016 election Hernandez saidTo be sure successive Honduran governments have failed to curb the exodus northward and lower violencePOVERTY DRUGS AND GANGSMore than 57000 unaccompanied minors from Central America have been apprehended at the US border since last October    Many are fleeing intractable poverty and widespread gang violence that has turned parts of Central America into one of the most lawless regions in the worldAccording to the United Nations Honduras saw 904 murders per 100000 people in 2012 way higher than any other countryFor many years gangs like Calle 18 and Mara Salvatrucha have run riot across the country extorting selling drugs and running guns Formed in the 1980s in US prisons by Central American migrants the gangs later blossomed into international franchises as members were deported back homeBut the security situation deteriorated after a 2009 coup that destabilized the country allowing Mexican drug cartels to expand their operations along the countrys wild Caribbean coastline where they receive planeloads of Andean cocaine headed for the United StatesThe damage done by the drugs trade in the region has already led some regional leaders like Guatemalas President Otto Perez to speak openly about the prospect of legalizationHernandez said he was unconvinced by the argument for drug legalization but he thought it unjust that some states in the United States had legalized marijuana while in countries in Central and South America it remained illicitI think we need to have a very serious discussion about it because its not fair he said adding that talks about unifying drug policy across the region needed to start soonHernandez acknowledged that there was a joint responsibility to tackle the surge of child migrants with Honduras needing to play its part Impunity and corruption are rife with the streets flooded with guns But he said Honduras wasnt aloneI think certain authorities in Mexico certain police could do more Hernandez said He did not spell out what he would like them to do but he said talk of efforts to limit access to trains known as La Bestia that carry migrants north through Mexico was a step in the right directionHe also felt that the United States a country built on immigration should be grateful to Hondurans who seek to work there as they benefit the US economyIt strikes me as a double standard to say We need workers we contract people as domestic workers cooks in the countryside or in construction but then also to say publicly that those same people shouldnt be allowed to enter he
