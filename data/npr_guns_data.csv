NPR,http://www.npr.org/2014/11/05/361655397/the-supreme-court-takes-up-the-case-of-the-missing-fish?ft=3&f=,Usually when a fisherman tells a fish story he makes the fish as big as he can carry But on Wednesday the US Supreme Court hears a case about a fisherman convicted of deepsixing some fish altogether so no one could accurately check their size The question before the justices is whether his conviction based on a law passed after a scandal that destroyed energy firm Enron and resulted in criminal convictions for accounting firm Arthur Andersen should get the hook Commercial fisherman John Yates and his crew were fishing for grouper in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico when Florida Fish and Wildlife officer John Jones boarded the boat Jones suspecting that the fishermen were keeping fish smaller than the 20inch minimum measured some of the catch and found 72 grouper that were undersized As fisherman Yates tells the story he got a citation for short fish its like a speeding ticket Jones who had been deputized as a federal officer ordered the fish kept but when the boat arrived on shore he determined that the fish in the crate were not the same ones he had measured Yates professes surprise at what happened down the line Three years later all of a sudden they come with bulletproof vests and guns They put me in handcuffs and they took me to jail he says The government tells a very different story Solicitor General Donald Verrilli says the state inspector put the undersized fish in a crate on board Captain Yates boat and instructed him to bring the box back to shore where he would be met by federal authorities Verrilli says that once the state inspector had left the boat Yates instructed one of his crew Take that crate of fish dump it overboard and replace it with fish that were no longer undersized And then the employee got back on shore and he ratted out his boss Yates was convicted of destroying evidence to impede a federal investigation and sentenced to 30 days in jail He appealed all the way to the Supreme Court contending that the law used to prosecute him was meant to apply to documents and records not fish He has a small army of supporters particularly in the business community The federal government however argues that the law was clearly written and intended to be a broad antiobstructionofjustice law that would fill gaps in the criminal code that had long existed The text of the law makes it a crime to destroy alter or cover up any record document or tangible object with the intent to  impede or obstruct the investigation of any matter within federal jurisdiction The government looks at that language and says the plain meaning covers more than just financial records Indeed for more than a decade federal prosecutors have used the statute in obstruction cases involving everything from terrorism to environmental safety violations the tangible object that defendants sought to alter or destroy has included human bodies bloodstains guns drugs cash and automobiles Most recently the statute was used to win the conviction of a Boston man for helping the accused Boston Marathon bomber conceal physical evidence of his crime At the Supreme Court on Wednesday Assistant Public Defender John Badalamenti representing captain Yates will tell the justices that the governments argument is a huge overreach This statute does not cover the destruction of anything but records or documents he says Indeed he notes the title of this section of the law is Destruction and Alteration of Records and he contends the purpose of the law was to prevent and punish obstruction in the financial industry I would not dispute that anything can be a tangible object under the broadest dictionary definition But they have to be read in the context of all the words that Congress legislated Badalamenti says Supporting the argument and opposing the governments position is a phalanx of business organizations as well as defense and civil liberties lawyers They contend that if the Court upholds the governments broad reading of the statute it will give prosecutors the power to seek penalties of up to 20 years in prison if an individual destroys any object no matter how trivial with the intent of obstructing a federal investigation The government replies that the records only argument would make it a crime for a murderer to destroy his victims diary but not the murder weapon Copyright 2014 NPR,20141105,guns
NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2014/11/05/356648995/what-is-an-ending-serial-and-the-ongoing-story-of-wanting-too-much?ft=3&f=,Part of the hook of the fine podcast Serial spun off from This American Life and hosted by Sarah Koenig is that it feels exactly like the grungy procedurally exacting multiepisode stories that are so popular right now on television It feels so much like a great series on Showtime or HBO it has the flavor of the anticipation and blind alleys and yougottaseethis social anticipation of True Detective or Fargo Slate has rather amusingly created a separate podcast about the Serial podcast that literally creates a new episode to analyze each new episode Buzzfeed in fact called it The Years Best New Crime Drama But of course its not that Its not a crime drama Its reporting on a real case  that of Adnan Syed who has been in prison for almost 15 years for the murder of his girlfriend in 1999 when he was 17 And according to the shows description of itself its not telling a story that began with an ending in mind Well follow the plot and characters wherever they take us and we wont know what happens at the end of the story until we get there not long before you get there with us Its a very good show and its been very well received and it may very well wind up making a lot of people angry Consider the increasingly familiar rhythms of pieces written about the show which invariably try to talk about story and try to talk about art and try to talk about the production process but cannot help poking and prodding for confirmation that there are revelations to come  that there is a plan no matter how many times Koenig clarifies that storywise endingwise conclusionwise there is probably not the thing you are thinking of when you say a plan In Vulture Koenig was asked Do you have some idea of whether Adnan Syed is guilty It feels like you must know which way you are leaning by now In Rolling Stone she was asked What do you have planned for the way you want it to come together in the end Back at Slate  where the Serial obsession runs to put it mildly deep  Hanna Rosin wrote an entire piece analyzing whether when Koenig claims she doesnt have certainty over the case herself shes just holding out on us and seemingly trying to talk herself into thinking its okay if shes not lying and simply doesnt know Rosin reminds us that Mike Pesca begged Koenig on his show The Gist to offer some kind of resolution Dont let this be a contemplation on the nature of the truth Ohhhhh Mike Pesca Ohhhhh buddy Im almost positive its going to be a contemplation on the nature of the truth I hope youre ready We are  and I say we collectively referring to people who follow serial stories over weeks and months  not notorious for our graceful acceptance of ambiguity messy closings and questions that arent answered It is common for people who follow a fictional story of this kind to expect that every single thread will be followed to its end every piece of evidence will be tied to all the others and that if a story ends in uncertainty it will end in meaningful uncertainty  that is in uncertainty that in and of itself is saying something greater about how you never know You dont just not learn what happened because its really hard to tell what happened the way you can at the end of a stretch of research or reporting Of course we should on an intellectual level be completely different in our approach to a true story We should understand that the expectations have to be different that Koenig is not Damon Lindelof or Veena Sud and that finale thinkpieces will make absolutely no sense if they rely upon how satisfying we found the story or how many coincidences there were and make that the measuring stick of quality And we are that way consciously and perhaps we will be emotionally when we get there But if we are  if we can acknowledge that it can be a fascinating trip to take even if in the end the little questions let alone the biggest questions are left in ambiguity or even infuriating bafflement  then why couldnt you write a fictional story that way If we believe that there is more to the value of this story than solving the case and all the minicases inside it then it raises this question Why couldnt there be a satisfying serial drama that defiantly refused to connect any dots and was also about the frustrating way you sometimes cannot tell what happened Surely we dont listen to Serial with the idea in mind that we are grudgingly accepting its inevitable uncertainties while knowing it would be a better show if we could be confident it would end either with a dramatic confession or with a joyful exoneration trimmed down so that only the important stuff was included so that only the questions for which there were answers were ever even asked Surely we dont begrudge it its messiness and mysterious spare parts that fit nowhere we embrace its messiness and we consider those spare parts to be colorful Why couldnt we do the same with a piece of fiction There have been other documentaries about crimes to be sure that hesitate to draw firm conclusions about the truth But the very nature of this  serial  encourages you to see its similarities to familiar narrative forms of storytelling that would be expected to end in a way that was intentional and structured where there is an authorial control over events And while the uncertainties of the underlying story dont mean that the episodes and the series arent structured just the opposite really theyre not structured in the way people wanted the end of Lost or True Detective or Fargo to be structured There is a chance a good chance every chance that this story is going to end in frustration and discomfort maybe in near equipoise and it will be nonsensical to blame for that writers who didnt know what they were doing Whats good about this wrinkle and what seems healthy about it is that it raises the question of what stories are for Must there be a lesson or a moral Must we sense a particular idea about life at the end and can it be futility If you raise a question do you have to answer it In real life of course Chekhovs gun need not come to anything in the third act just because it was shown in the first If this makes a good true story but would not make a good piece of dramatic fiction why is that Assuming people do find the ending satisfying despite what almost must be its messiness is it possible that a piece of serial crime reporting with no conclusion will point to the idea that weve perhaps become overly obsessed in judging an entire piece of storytelling on whether we get the perfectly symmetrical flawless balanced wry doubtdrowning ending we deserve This story after all affects practically none of us directly This is not reporting on world events or the broader culture this is narrowing down to this one story taking it apart the way you might hunt through letters in your own attic To be sure it makes you think about police tactics and the criminal system and the fragility of memory theres a great moment in one episode that calls to mind some of what commentators on the situation in Ferguson have said about the differences between different peoples experiences with police and whether or not they would ever call upon the police for help But the popularity of the show places it in a very complex position as it hasnt yet survived its first landing And as the producers of countless dramas  crime and otherwise  will tell you if you dont stick the landing according to rules you may not have ever agreed to abide by the reaction can be swift and severe Copyright 2014 NPR,20141105,guns

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/11/04/361403249/what-makes-kenyas-marathon-runners-the-worlds-best?ft=3&f=,Wilson Kipsang the Kenyan winner of Sundays New York City Marathon told reporters after it was over that hed had to slow down  to exercise a lot of patience  as he logged the first miles of the 262mile race And even with his purposely slowish  start he completed the marathon in two hours 10 minutes and 59 seconds Kipsang wasnt the only standout Kenyan in the race Mary Keitany and Jemima Jelagat Sumgong placed first and second in the womens division Other Kenyans are leaders as well In September Dennis Kimetto ran only his fifth marathon in Berlin and broke the world record and the 203 barrier finishing in 20257 Its impossible to measure exactly what makes for marathon gold says Daniel Lieberman a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard and the author of The Story of the Human Body Evolution Health and Disease But Kenyan runners may possess certain qualities that drive their ability to win Lieberman has spent years studying the evolution of running including the biomechanics and physiology of children and adults who run in rural and urban regions of Kenya He shared a few thoughts with Goats and Soda on what hes learned Why are Kenyans winning so many marathons Its a fascinating question  why Kenyans are so fast so dominant at the moment Ethiopians are also doing extremely well But really if you really look at finishing times runners from Africa are only a little bit faster than the rest of the world just a few minutes faster over the course of slightly more than two hours I dont know a definitive answer no one does So everybody just guesses Its impossible to quantify all of the factors that make one runner better than another Its probably a combination of training determination culture and biology How might their environment shape a young runner The area of Kenya where a lot of the best runners come from  the Western Rift Valley  is a beautiful wonderful place If there is any one factor that leaps out at me it is how many people in that region are poor and work hard There are almost no jobs apart from subsistence farming There are no factories and very few secondary schools So there are really few options for young people to better their lives They can either work hard on a farm or train to be a great runner So aspiring runners work really really hard when they train In addition most kids usually run to school barefoot which I think has some effect because it means they grow up being excellent runners because as Lieberman has written barefoot runners tend to strike with their forefoot or midfoot which is less stressful than landing heel first And the region is at high altitude All together this part of Kenya has a large population of incredibly fit runners who run barefoot and work hard Do they have any special training secrets They train with incredible heart motivation and intensity without any of the advantages that Americans get Aspiring runners in Kenya get no goo no gel no sports drinks They have no trainers or sports medicine experts When people train hard for years and years I suspect that has an effect on their ability to race compared to people who have it easier Is there a running gene an athletic gene that researchers can pinpoint The efforts to find genes or other factors have mostly failed Theres no smokinggun gene That doesnt mean these genes dont exist but no one has found them Youve studied VO2 max or maximum oxygen uptake levels in young Kenyan runners This refers to the maximum amount of oxygen an individual can utilize during intense exercise We have found that young Kenyan kids from rural areas who do a lot of running have incredible VO2 maxes They have VO2 maxes most of us would dream to have Its probably due to a combination of factors that theyre very active and living at high altitude and perhaps some genetic component When you see kids in the morning going to school theyre often running Kids travel some seven to 10 kilometers a day on foot often running How many American kids run to school every day Is there a critical point in the marathon when Kenyan runners seem to gain the advantage The marathon really starts at miles 18 to 20 The pack runs together up to then The folks who win still have gas in the tank at the end and are able to sprint the final miles How are changes in lifestyle food or other things in Kenya over the last couple of decades affecting health and running among youth Were studying this right now As development sweeps through Kenya in the urban areas there are more processed foods more public transportation more desk jobs Chairs all day long Weve done studies measuring fitness and strength in people growing up in towns versus those growing up in the countryside The differences are astonishing I now see signs along the road in Kenya for diabetes clinics which I never used to see in the old days Health problems are arriving as development occurs But I dont see this in the rural areas Do Kenyans enjoy running One of the fascinating things about Kenya is that few people exercise for fun When runners there retire they stop running Its a business As a result people dont jog to stay healthy as they age Weve been working on getting people there to think about running not just as a way to train but as important for everyone for health Copyright 2014 NPR,20141104,guns

Sean I learned being really organized From Russell I learned to trust my innate sense of what was good not to overthink things He would always tell me like Yo whats up with this record And he was really valuing my opinions And I was just you know a crazy little kid I just picked that up from him We never discussed it but I realized not to second guess myself too much that if this guy was trusting my opinion on things than my opinion was probably pretty valid And from Lyor I learned how to get yelled at how to yell back how to function under pressure and also kinda how to be strategic and kind of a bad trade Machiavellian at times I saw Lyor do all that and I spent a ton of time working with Lyor He was like a early mentor of mine A very complicated person but kinda brilliant too

Walkman and he asked me if I was Dante Ross And I was like Yeah And I somehow I guess I kind of knew who he was It probably wasnt hard to tell who I was cause there was no white people except the guys who worked there and me at the Latin Quarter And I would go and hang out with Red a lot I used to help him carry records I used to live on 108th St Id go to his house and Id roll with him to the Quarters MUHAMMAD Wow ROSS Thats how I know Chris And thats how I know Darryl and knew The Violators All from then Cause I wanted to get in for free I wanted to hang out with Red Alert This guys Red Alert He kicked a lot of game to me too god He played me a bunch of beats and I asked him if he had artists And he said yeah he got a bunch of artists and he was gonna come and play me them all That following Monday him and Fab 5 Freddy called me on the phone They played me Wrath of My Madness over the phone and I was like Thats incredible And I was like Bring all your artists Somehow Freddy didnt make the meeting Mark did He brought most of the Flavor Unit with him He had Latee with him who I knew cause Id played basketball with him  against him  in Jersey one time I dont know why how but we knew  we were like Oh yeah I remember you He played me all his artists He played me Wrath of My Madness Princess of the Posse I grabbed Monica I made him play it again She took me in her office she said We gotta sign that I said I know Dana was there She was young 18 17 MUHAMMAD What was she like ROSS She had a great personality larger than life Super friendly milliondollar smile Just a sweet person really Could tell she had came from a good family She was just really  she had the glow And Monica said We want to try and sign her We ended up going to play basketball on 91st St York Ave and she can play ball She told me she played high school ball when we were out there I was like This is crazy And she was nice I think she was like you know All County in Jersey wherever shes from East Orange And we called Richard Grabel and we did the deal and we ended up signing her That first record its basically the demo Its basically 45 Kings demo He mixed it in Calliope and it made the record  I cant tell if it made it any better Its the same record Theres no difference from the demo and that record I dont think MUHAMMAD Wow ROSS That record connected And it was cool cause the De La record I gave that to Red like hand to hand And he played it He played it and he was like Ima start playing that He called me up and told me I gave him that record too the Latifah record so I was like two for two So two right in a row went on And you know those were formidable records MUHAMMAD Absolutely At least for me I mean I dont have to go into it But the energy in New York City at that time period was  ROSS It was incredible MUHAMMAD It was incredible ROSS And everything was accessible MUHAMMAD Yeah ROSS You could really just go up to Red Alert and give him a record And your record might end up on daytime radio That was like incredible And we all looked up to  and I left this out  we all looked up to Jungle Brothers right Cause they were  them and Ultramagnetic  very different groups but they were like the new s That was the new s Like Ultra was bugged out and The Jungle Brothers man they just made great records and they were sampling all the records I grew up listening to Those were all the records my sister whos nine years older than me played Mandrill and just all the records they were messing with So hearing their music I was like Wow were all on the same kind of wavelength Where KRSOne was before us and the Juice Crew I loved all that stuff but it didnt have the same exact connection It was something about the funk they were messin with MUHAMMAD So then moving past  you didnt get your Tribe ROSS I didnt get my Tribe I got Digital Underground MUHAMMAD Thats a big signing ROSS But I never really talk about Digital cause I didnt stay to make the record I got Doowutchyalike MUHAMMAD Howd you come into contact with them ROSS Chuy from KMEL Bay Area legend Chuy Gomez he was on the radio forever I was out there he gave me the record and it had the PFunk type drawing I loved PFunk before hiphop Thats what I listened to  funk PFunk all that growing up I loved Brothers Johnson and Zapp and all that So I loved it had the PFunk thing to it I remember playing the record at Tommy Boy De La were there Pos bugged out I thought it was  there was something there We picked up the record Then I left before the next record came out I never worked on that record MUHAMMAD Wow ROSS Yeah MUHAMMAD What did that feel like Cause I mean thats  ROSS It felt like I was making twice as much money at Elektra You know what I mean Tom Silverman just wouldnt pay me Like he was really not trying to pay me so I had to bounce MUHAMMAD Thats understandable ROSS I remember Def Jam was gonna give me a job and I got offered more money at Elektra and I asked my lawyer what to do He said Take the check so I took the check MUHAMMAD Im just sitting here  I had sit in silence for a moment to really ponder that cause I just wonder what the scope of Def Jam would look like Because at that time then who was signing This was before Redman This is like  ROSS Before Redman 3rd Bass MUHAMMAD 3rd Bass which you were a part of ROSS Right I produced a lot of the records Its so funny if I had  so if Puffy had came out around before me or if I had been more ruthless I would have really got paid on that one I didnt realize that you could basically  if you were having hit records you could write your own rules But I didnt know that so I basically put 3rd Bass  like they got on Def Jam and I helped make the records but I never really made a lot of money working with them They should have been like signed to me basically But I didnt do it that way cause I didnt know MUHAMMAD Oh yeah as a production deal situation ROSS Yeah or I should have been attached as AR guy or something I should have somehow figured out a way to really make money on it and I never really did MUHAMMAD Have you done that with any of your artists ROSS Nah man Im not that kinda guy MUHAMMAD Thats why you can sleep good at night right ROSS I never took anyones publishing Im not that guy Yeah its also probably why I never got punched in the face right KELLEY You never got punched in the face ROSS Well not by a rapper I been punched in the face definitely and deservedly so But Ive never had an artist come and punch me in the face Theres never been a artist who came in my office who went crazy Or a producer or a manager MUHAMMAD Im really just trying to think during that time period who was there signing at Def Jam It was kinda quiet over there for a minute ROSS It was quiet MUHAMMAD So youre building up  KELLEY Is Faith there then ROSS She was there and she signed 3rd Bass but they didnt really empower her And thats the thing about Def Jam They never really let anyone get maverick and sign a lot of stuff It always had to run through a lot of hands you know and it was later on that they opened it up and they really let people get busy MUHAMMAD So youre building up the Elektra WEA  what was it at the time ROSS It was Elektra And there was Atlantic Elektra Warner Brothers MUHAMMAD You guys were the only ones on the hiphop side of things from  ROSS Atlantic was there They had some things MUHAMMAD They had a few 12inches but I dont remember like  ROSS They had Das EFX MUHAMMAD OK And DOC was signed there too right ROSS Yep to East West MUHAMMAD So you bring in Brand Nubian ROSS I bring in Brand Nubians and scare everybody Everyones scared MUHAMMAD What was that like Were they the first signing ROSS They were And they were  yeah they were a handful man you know They were definitely on some militant God Body type of thing and that didnt necessarily ingratiate them or get them embraced by the people at work But you know it was such a cheap deal I didnt realize I had been a big Grand Puba fan from Masters of Ceremony I mean we all were fans of his He was incredible He brought me the demo when I worked at Tommy Boy and I skated with that in my back pocket And I was like Hold up I got a deal for you Max And I took it in the door with me MUHAMMAD Wait a minute Do they know this ROSS Yeah Monica was always mad about it MUHAMMAD Im just saying ROSS Monica was like You know you cant sign Grand Puba And I was like Oh Im not signing Grand Puba Dont worry about it So Im signing Brand Nubian And I ended up skating out the door with  and two songs that didnt make the album on the demo One of em was called I Aint Goin Out Like That It was off of Sex Machine by James Brown and Cypress Hill used the hook on their second album Aint Goin Out Like That and Muggs told me straight up hes likeYo they never used it MUHAMMAD Wow KELLEY Oh my god ROSS Muggs is the king of that He took Jump Around from Leaders live show They were  remember they were Jump jump jump I was with him right next to him and hes like You know thats supposed to be a record And I was like Yeah probably And that was  there it is Jump Around MUHAMMAD Thats crazy ROSS Yeah you know I love Muggs Hes the smartest guy right MUHAMMAD Apparently you are too to just say Yeah Im not signing Puba Im signing  ROSS Brand Nubian MUHAMMAD Im not signing him trust me KELLEY I have some questions for you MUHAMMAD Oh really OK what KELLEY Well I want to know what it feels like to be a part of a bidding war like that Cause hes got one side of the story and then youre  what Is Chris telling you whats going on like what people want MUHAMMAD Yeah and it was strange because for us  meeting QTip in high school at the age of 14 and at 15 we formed the group And from him coming over to the house on the weekend and us making records and his sister dated a guy named Randall who was part of the Zulu Nation was friends with Skeff Anselm I remember we took our demo in early and it was just like Eh you kids need to just kinda like  We were kinda discouraged So to go from that to actually like making some sort of an impression it was just weird And it happened really quickly ROSS The demo had El Segundo on it MUHAMMAD It had El Segundo on it It had Bonita on it ROSS Bonita but not the remix The original MUHAMMAD It was the original version of Bonita which was musically it was different What else was on that demo ROSS Those were the two songs I remember MUHAMMAD I think Pubic Enemy may have been on there and Description of a Fool ROSS Description of a Fool was definitely on it MUHAMMAD Yeah But I mean this was probably before it even got to that point with what we had given to Randall at the time That was kind of like a learning curve for us and we just kept at it so by the time we got to the point of the demo that you heard things moved really quickly We had also sampled Knee Deep which De La used for Me Myself and I We kinda gave them the nod and just saying Well cool like you guys can have it and it turned into a huge hit for them But during that time period it went from like Are we ever gonna get on to Were so on ROSS Buddy came out before you got signed too right The remix MUHAMMAD I dont remember ROSS Think so And also he was on  Tip was on The Promo off The JBs  MUHAMMAD Yeah we had The Promo We had a song Black Is Black which was also one of our demos and The JBs were like You guys should put this on our record It was just a series of things that occurred that gave us like Well we know were close and were getting there But at the same time things were dragging out a little bit And originally Jeff Fenster who was at Geffen had given us a demo budget which  then things started to kinda like expedite a little bit They passed on us ROSS Wow MUHAMMAD Jeff loved us He said I love you guys but I dont know what to do with you The company doesnt know what to do with you guys And every time I see Jeff its like Thank you for passing Seriously because that opened the door for us to get into this bidding war I know Def Jam was involved Jive Tommy Boy I think that might have been it ROSS It definitely came down to us and Jive Elektra and Jive were slugging it out And it was awkward too cause Sean was my really good friend MUHAMMAD Well for us I mean QTip  we talk about this behind closed doors just like Man what would have happened if we signed to Def Jam ROSS You would have sold a lot of records MUHAMMAD Were not sure You know thats just one of those you never know if it would have clicked the same way or  I mean Def Jam was Def Jam though ROSS It feels like because Rush was so involved in De La they wanted their own De La It probably would have been big KELLEY What did you hear in the demo that made you be like Got to ROSS They were great Tip was a star The music was you know it was gonna be the next De La It was a nobrainer It was gonna be the next thing And I loved The Promo I loved it and I loved Tips verse on it And I knew him I saw the effect he had on people He was definitely it was  everything was there And Phife was like the Flava Flav like he had the comic relief It was the whole package It was one of the best demos of all time Four of those songs are on the first album MUHAMMAD First album yeah ROSS So its a nobrainer MUHAMMAD Just to answer directly I dont remember It was just strange It was just like euphoric You know were still kids and its like no one wants us to all of the sudden you know people wanting you and then youre wondering is it hype Is it real Once one company gets in and then they get wind that another company gets in its just like whos really gonna take care of you Thats what it ultimately became Its like well BDP signed to Jive so that could be cool Whodini was there Def Jam had LL Cool J Tommy Boy had the rest of the family And it was just kind of like do we do we go where Latifah and De La was to kinda like really strengthen the Native Tongue aspect ROSS But Tommy Boy wasnt offering real money right MUHAMMAD No they werent Or do we take the sacrifice and go elsewhere There were a lot of questions and I mean the rest is history ROSS I remember when you signed to Jive I had heard it was the biggest deal Jive had ever done for a rap group MUHAMMAD Yeah KELLEY I heard that too ROSS Yeah so And I offered more and I didnt get it MUHAMMAD I dont remember that ROSS Chris remembers it Rest in peace Chris definitely remembers it It was the first time I lost a group and I gotta tell you it hurt I was like Oh man MUHAMMAD Well  ROSS Now I lost like 50 groups so I dont care MUHAMMAD So are you looking to retire sometime soon ROSS Nah I think I got a few more seasons in me MUHAMMAD Thats whats up ROSS I have got a lot of other stuff Im doing too Im working on a TV project with Cheo Coker and Jeff Chang KELLEY What is that ROSS Well its kind of hard to say but we acquired the rights to Cant Stop Wont Stop Jeffs book and were creating a historical fiction version of the second half of the book So were working on it slowly but surely Cheo is a brilliant writer and so is Jeff and Im a shmuck who came up with kind of half the idea and they pulled me in on it That and I wrote a book My book will come out at the end of the year Son of the City its about growing up in New York and all the music stuff I worked on but also my relationship with my dad He was a writer And kind of my relationship to art and culture cause I always think that even as a record producer my greatest talent on earth is recognizing talent hearing something not necessarily being the talent So thats kind of what its about How Ive been able to encounter all these different things from different worlds along the way MUHAMMAD Are there any or is there a model or any words that you live by ROSS A couple I mean the Serenity Prayer I say it every morning when I wake up That one always gets me through tough times The St Francis prayer And then I try to just  I always think that for me the road to freedom is paved with gratitude So if I can exercise gratitude I will be a free person Not to be like a hippie or anything but thats kind of just  MUHAMMAD You know what We look at you you dont come off as a hippie KELLEY Also youre talking to Ali at NPR You can be a hippie ROSS Well my dad was a super hippie and so was my mom so I grew up around like all that And that stuff really is why I made the music I made Like my dad was friends with Bobby Seale so I was always attracted to cultural things So KMD and Brand Nubians and De La and all that that fit right into where my parents raised me to be So it made a lot of sense MUHAMMAD You always came off as crazy edgy to me ROSS Cause I was a punk rock skateboarder I still am so MUHAMMAD Its fascinating to know people long enough to  you know what I mean  really just see transformation I remember as I kid I was like Yo this  I didnt know much about Dante at the time when we first met but I just knew he was edgy And I remember a couple of times there was  ROSS I had a problem with my hands when I was younger MUHAMMAD Yeah I was about to say  it surprised me you were like No one ever punched me in the face Im like  ROSS Oh yeah but it wasnt rappers MUHAMMAD And you clarified that but Im like I remember a few times coming into a place it was like Dante got into a fight But I say that to say that you always had this kind of like this balance and this peaceful sort of zen and respectful aspect about you So hearing you say that Im like Oh yeah well thats why It makes sense It was always there ROSS As you get older its easier to gravitate towards your higher power MUHAMMAD Yeah ROSS You dont have time for the nonsense My life has been a rollercoaster a lot of it I like to say I had a 12round boxing match in three rounds for most of my life So I got older I put down that dynamic and try to just live a much more peaceful existence And I get to celebrate the things that Ive accomplished and the friends Ive got to meet through all of this stuff I always say I have got a lot of gratitude Most people didnt get the experience and see all the stuff Ive had the pleasure to see and experience and be involved with Like I got to be right up front and see and experience things that are legendary and still be alive to celebrate that and to be celebrated for it And thats priceless MUHAMMAD Youre talking about being in that environment and around so many different great elements and where you are  kind of jumping a little bit through your whole history What do you see in the scope of hiphop now where it is For me personally I think at times its  I just see tumbleweed You know like theres some sort of life but then its just like Will there be any fruit that grow and will shift mankind closer together in a good way And youre still in it and youre signing artists So what is that feeling of greatness now in 2014 versus 1989 ROSS Its very different I always think music exists in chambers right So you have this kind of art and that kind of art and this kind of art and that kind You had Tone Loc and you had Rakim you know Everythings just in its own chamber and things are good for what they are So I see things that I still appreciate and enjoy I think some of the artistry is definitely altered not necessarily for the better but I still see people who are stars So like I didnt sign them but I tried to  AAP Rocky was a star I saw the video he came in my office I was like This guy is a star So does he rap as great as my favorite rapper in the world That wasnt even relevant really MUHAMMAD Right ROSS So I look more for stars now than I look for people who are the most lyrically adept etc etc Its a different barometer the way I have to approach it and look at it That said I see things that are very inspirational and impressive whether its Kendrick Lamar or ScHoolboy even kids like the kid Denzel Curry or  there are things out there that I appreciate Joey Bada Action Bronson Iamsu So if I look hard enough you know I find things Like I brought Macklemore to ADA Now I knew he was a star cause I saw him prove it in front of 2500 people in San Francisco And my niece loves him Before he had the hit records she was in love with him I knew he wasnt Eminem but I also knew he wasnt Yelawolf I knew he was his own thing and I wanted to sign him because I thought he was a star My boss Todd Moscowitz wouldnt let me sign him So I went down the hall to ADA and they worked their deal out So when I looked at him I seen for his chamber someone who was very great at what he did So thats how I have to measure things now Everything cant be Rakim or Tribe or Cypress Hill Thats not the bar right now The bar is where its at and I have to accept that And I relate to music in its own chamber as liking it for what it is MUHAMMAD Are you still excited ROSS At times MUHAMMAD At times ROSS At times I mean you do this 25 years its hard to stay excited Am I excited like when I first heard Cypress Hills demo Definitely not I would say no But there are things that really excite me yeah Im excited by someone Im chasing right now You know theres someone I also lost last year that was exciting to me MUHAMMAD I dont know who this person is and it will remain undisclosed but whoever you are like roll with Dante ROSS Thank you Thank you Its different now too right So Brand Nubian  I was the only dude who tried to give em a record deal Theres no secrets anymore Everybody knows about everything cause we got this thing called the interweb So if you make good music you dont shop your demo anymore You put your music on a blog and you get a lot of people who know about your music then you get a phone call from nine shmucks like me and everybody tries to see if youre a star And most of us could probably tell if youre a star and then the deals start coming Its a totally different process now but theres no secrets theres none But you know I will see things and Ill be like Oh wow That guys a star I like that guy That guy makes great music Im not always right but usually I do  my average is pretty good especially on the new stuff KELLEY So back in the day Russell and Lyor would sort of trust you to tell em whats hot Like they didnt know ROSS Yeah cause they were like you know they were a little older They werent in the Latin Quarters KELLEY Do you have somebody like that now or are you still in the Latin Quarters ROSS Nah its me Its different now too Its a different game Now its like  nothing has to be a visceral experience right On all levels Which leads to lots of things not being as  having as much depth In all levels of culture way beyond music Because we can all get on the interweb and go and you know scratch the surface of whatever we want to find out about right Theres Wikipedia theres blogs theres Google theres whatever it is So you can find out about the surface of everything Back in the day you couldnt do that You had to go and smell it You had to go be right there You had to be in the element whether it was dangerous or whatever it was You had to have the physical experience the visceral experience And I think that that led to more informed decisions probably and also a deeper understanding of what the artistry that particular person was putting forth was about But that said thats not as important anymore Its a different game And if I dont adjust Im not adaptable And if I dont see how its done now and I dont play by those rules well then I get left in the dust KELLEY So the lack of a need for the visceral experience does that put the bar where its at now ROSS I wouldnt say thats the reason why I would say the reason why is  this is a theory Im trying  I think De La first told me this one Nowadays everybodys uncles cousins brothers mothers father was AAP Rockys road manager or this guys that guys something everyones connected to it Everyones aware of it When Ali and me and when we were all involved in the culture that was for forwardthinking progressive people That wasnt the norm It wasnt what every kid aspired to do So we were forwardthinkers We were outside of the box Not only were we outside of the box the box that existed the RunDMC box we didnt want that box We wanted our own universe MUHAMMAD True ROSS So we were forging our own paths Nowadays because of mass bohemia  blame it on the internet age of information whatever it is  its all accessible to every kid So youre not getting the forwardforwardthinkers anymore Youre getting everybody that wants to do it And I think that makes the goals different For us it was more about expressing artistry To have your own unique voice out there it was cathartic I dont believe its as cathartic I think now its monetary People want the fame and the fortune a lot more than just expression And thats always existed but it exists more now because its more accessible Everyone knows how much money Kreayshawn got or AAP got and everyone knows about that car that Pharrell got or this or that and that wasnt the case back then MUHAMMAD Has anything that occurred  I guess from a marketing perspective that may have caught your attention without going through the now custom route of  ROSS Theres one thing and I signed em I gave em a small deal  this group After the Smoke  and it hasnt connected Theyre very insular and they live in a vacuum a little bit And because of that I dont think its connected Cause I think they make great art but theyre so insular that they dont want to share their art MUHAMMAD So do you think that its sort of like you know because the rules are the way are that if youre looking to make music you have to start off by going through these like Ima put my stuff up on Soundcloud Or Im gonna do  ROSS I think so Its pretty easy You have to create quality content a strong visual and hope to get an audience You get that audience you go back to that audience to build your foundation So you make your video it goes on Nah Right you know you got a shot at Nah Right from now on you build your fanbase from there And that doesnt mean youre gonna get any bigger than this high but maybe you will MUHAMMAD Thats the starting point ROSS Thats the starting point Whatever site it is 2DOPEBOYZ Nah Right whatever it is So wait let me ask you something about just performing MUHAMMAD Yes ROSS You guys were great performers right MUHAMMAD Thanks ROSS De La became great RunDMC were great Cypress Hill were great Thats the one thing I see in hiphop thats really absolutely not there anymore performance MUHAMMAD Im glad you asked about that because I wanted to ask you before when you were talking about a person still being a star Im wondering your viewpoints on performance and the stage performance ROSS Its so important Performance is what gives you a career right If youre a great performer you can play forever MUHAMMAD Yeah absolutely ROSS You know in all genres of music MUHAMMAD You can have a record that doesnt translate really well but if you go out there and present it you win people over ROSS One hundred percent I feel like performance is sorely lacking Thats what sold me on Macklemore when I saw him perform I was like Oh the guy  hes got it I think with a lot of traditional rap groups got 20 guys on stage yelling and screaming its fing trash man Its really  its just not what its supposed to be MUHAMMAD Do you have a chapter in your book or maybe thisll be like the next book a howto sort of like  ROSS An instructional MUHAMMAD Because you come from a  especially with the Beastie Boys is like your training camp right ROSS Man them and Run See for me I measure every group to that But the reason the Beasties are so good cause we grew up watching the Bad Brains and then RunDMC The bar was so high so they were so good You guys and Leaders even Busta still the bar is so high You guys are coming from the root note of greatness So we get further away from that man MUHAMMAD I think maybe because people are just so focused on the glamour aspect of making music and the money aspect and the art suffers And when I say art I mean meaning Theres subtle things like what De La used to do I dont know where De La got this the idea of the flower girls or having flower girls or even having them like hold up words to the songs That to me is artistic you know and it doesnt have to be this grand like Oh lets paint the room a certain color Its just little subtle things you do I think that elevate you And I dont know if people are focusing on that as much I feel like maybe theres a  the younger generation may be getting a glimpse of that who is like 15 right now ROSS Maybe Theres like a lot of the new guys when they perform they dont got it Kendrick got it He got it live KELLEY Hes got moves though ROSS Hes got a lot of emotion on stage MUHAMMAD Yeah hes got a lot of emotion ROSS Hes there hes channeling something That group Ratking has a very good live show KELLEY Really I saw them recently I was really disappointed At Glasslands ROSS I saw them one time they killed it KELLEY Was it at Webster Hall Cause people told me that show was good ROSS Nah it was at 285 which closed I think Action Bronson got a really good show Hes very entertaining Its almost like standup comedy KELLEY Cause hes like covered in sweat instantly ROSS Cause hes funny though KELLEY Yeah its amazing ROSS Hes just really super funny But yeah performance is few and far between Like I just remember the first time Cypress ever played New York and they came out with the pigs masks and BReal had the big weed wreath and it was just like  it was monumental That was a real show you know like there was something to it Even a bad show back then or a regular show was better than most shows now Like the FuSchnickens were probably better than most rap groups right now KELLEY But people are worried They dont want to look corny They dont want to like try it and not pull it off and now theyre wearing a mask on stage you know ROSS One hundred percent Unfortunately thats very true People are scared to put it out there But you know thats why bands are almost always better than rap music live like 90 of the time MUHAMMAD What do you think about hiphop bands ROSS I like The Roots The Roots are good I havent seen really anyone else who impressed me who went out there with a band Jays good with a band MUHAMMAD What about the Fugees or Lauryn Hill ROSS Yeah that was cool too I love Lauryn Hill I saw her when she was still all together on the first record I thought that was pretty good I saw Common with a band be pretty good It can be done Sometimes it just doesnt come off And it always comes down to me to the drums Its hard The Roots they really have mastered it Common was good when he had  my man from Detroit Karriem Riggins was playing drums so it was working So if you have the right drummer it can work but its very hard to do I mean you guys have never done a band have you MUHAMMAD No we havent And QTip has done it and hes tried to talk us into it but weve never  weve talked about it but just for some reason I feel like if we cant duplicate that sound Im just afraid of it Which is kind of odd because Im really into playing live now more so than ever before but its just like it has to translate The one thing I do keep in mind when it comes to Tribes music is the drums spank when it comes through those speakers ROSS The drums Its all about that MUHAMMAD And its just like hmmmm  I havent seen it done from a live band to give it that sound I can do that in a studio but you can control it a studio You know you cant control the sound you cant tame it the same way ROSS Well Jay and them were playing on top of the record MUHAMMAD Yeah a lot of guys now are doing that But I just dont like that ROSS Its kinda fake MUHAMMAD Yeah ROSS I mean I saw De La with a band that was really good MUHAMMAD They were good I saw that ROSS I saw El Michels with WuTang that was pretty good And you know Sharon Jones and those guys I mean they kill it So if youre using Menahan or the Daptones  or the DapKings  its probably gonna be good But its few and far between Its tough The Beasties are cool when they get the band cause its them But you know theyre also  they live in their own world Their music is  the way they approach performance and music is its hiphop but its its own chamber of hiphop They have their own way of doing it you know For that I love them Unfortunately well never get another record by them MUHAMMAD I know ROSS What else you guys want to ask me Anything KELLEY Whats the craziest thing that ever happened at Calliope ROSS At Calliope Oh this is great When I was recording Step to the Rear  this is so good Me and Puba were half drunk Pus doing his vocals and Melle Mel burst through the door thinking it was his session He was in the other room And he was like all diesel And Pubas in the booth and hes like Yo Mel And hes like Yo Puba Whats up And then you know were like We think your sessions in the other room Hes like Oh word yo Peace Pu And then Puba turned around and rapped the second verse of Step to the Rear in a Melle Mel voice Grand Puba ha It was so incredible Yo I wish I had that take still MUHAMMAD I was gonna ask  do you have any archives ROSS And all night long he kept going Rah before he rapped like before he finished the song Thats a memorable moment I mean Calliope was pretty blurry I was real young and there was a lot of people in and people forget that place was only open for a little bit of time Cause after Calliope I lived at Chung King I could tell you a million things at Chung King KELLEY Go ahead ROSS Chung King has so many crazy ones I saw Busta just whip on Charlie bad in Chung King one time and I got in the middle of it I got hit in the back of the head trying to break it up which is crazy I mean  MUHAMMAD What was that like ROSS Ah man It was ugly man MUHAMMAD Because you signed Leaders and you went through that whole separation ROSS It was just ugly man Just ugly KELLEY But theyd already broken up when you signed em ROSS They were already broken up which I didnt know when I signed em MUHAMMAD Oh OK ROSS But there was always a lot of tension and it really got bad after the first record And postScenario because Busta was clearly the star Me and Chris were trying to get Busta to do a solo record Everyone knew that opportunity was there It became very strained and Busta showed an amazing amount of loyalty He did not want to break that band up Whether it was because he was scared to go solo or not I couldnt tell ya I think it was probably both loyalty and fear of riding by himself But man it was very tense during that second album And you know Busta I think in his heart knew that that second record wasnt a great record by any means and he still had to walk the walk and try and sell that to everybody and it was tough I think he showed a amazing amount of maturity the way he dealt with it And you know the rest is history Busta made a solo record and thats that You know he was shining And beyond that though Buss he was always smarter than the rest of the guys I had a very close relationship with him Im still great friends with him and he was a true superstar And you know there were times when we literally would have to get between him and Brown It was fisticuffs I mean you know  you were around it MUHAMMAD Mmhmm ROSS Yeah there was a lot of animosity MUHAMMAD You didnt sign Pete and Corey did you ROSS I inherited them My boss Raoul Roach signed them and got fired He was like Im only signing this if you want to do it I said OK lets do it Ive been hearing the demos He got fired right after and I made the records MUHAMMAD Dope records ROSS I mean Pete made the records I hung out with Pete and he did everything And it was very easy to just babysit that one That was the easiest Pete was great We had the wrong first single Go With the Flow and Creator connected We got lucky Red Alert flipped it over boom and then Flex jumped and that was that The best thing about working with Pete is I got to watch how he made records and pick up tricks  filtering bass lines and a bunch of other things not using quantize MUHAMMAD He doesnt ROSS Sometimes he did sometimes he didnt Depends what it was Putting the snare down live the whole track Reminisce Things like that Just watching that was pretty incredible Didnt Tip not use quantize sometimes too MUHAMMAD Yeah he did ROSS Yeah some Pete did and didnt depending what he was doing MUHAMMAD Yeah same with me Im just  KELLEY What does that mean ROSS Quantize just puts your drums like on beat supposedly MUHAMMAD Yeah its a bit mechanical so it stays closer to the 16th or whatever you set the parameter to to the note So its always on but  ROSS It loses funk MUHAMMAD It loses its funk compared to like a real drummer to have that human before behind a little ROSS I mean I seen Tip put together the Crooklyn joint He didnt use quantize MUHAMMAD Nope ROSS And he did it mad quick He was fast which bugged me out I always really loved that part of it being around producers when they were creating too Even now I like to hang out with Alchemist and just watch him make stuff Always opens my mind up to different tricks And I unfortunately never got to see RZA do anything cause he gave me the reels to Dirty He showed up and was like Heres the album That was like how he did it So I dont know what his science was but I know trying to mix that stuff was impossible It was impossible KELLEY It was your idea for the ODB cover ROSS So it was Dirtys idea and I helped him do it KELLEY Got it ROSS I had pretty close relationships with most of my artists but me and Dirty had a super duper crazy close relationship I have no idea why but yeah the guy like  I loved him and he really appreciated me Hes one of the only artists I never argued with  him and Sadat are probably the only two He came to my office He would always  Dirty had his own way of talking Like all Wu had their own like God Body speak but he was like Yo I got crazy thoughts I got crazy thoughts yo Yo I got my album thoughts I said What do you mean He said Yo check it out Yo this is my album cover and he pulled out his welfare card It was Russell Jones And he was like Yo could we make this my album cover I thought real quick I was like UB40 did it Yeah so why not Probably We went upstairs to the art department and I asked my friend Alli  this was before they had scanners and everyone had a computer  they had a color Xerox machine which was very expensive to use and I was like Yo can I use the color Xerox She was like What do you want to do I want to try and blow something up Just give me a minute She was like Yeah Ill set you up So I blew it up to 12 x 10 and I remember cutting the corners pulling it out it was all pixilated but it was his picture on the welfare card and I walked up to Alli and I was like Alli  Alli Church she was an amazing person  I was like Dirtys album cover right here And she was like Thats genius And she was like Give me the card Ill bring it back to you in a couple hours and Ill start working on the mock up I was like You think its gonna fly Shes like Might fly I was like UB40 She was like Yeah it can probably fly I was also  I had a lot of hit records then so I could do a lot So we ran it up the flag pole and it rocked they let us use it And it was Dirtys idea The thing that she did was she took The New York Welfare Department stamp and made it the Wu She put the W around it And that was it that was his idea I mean thats the thing about Dirty too he was brilliant Before substances took real control of him he was one of the most creative minds He really understood himself as an artist And in all of his madness he gets portrayed as a buffoon sometimes and I think thats like  its easier to think of him as a buffoon than someone who was really creative and understood himself as an artist And I think thats the tragedy of his demise  one of them  that his artistry gets lost cause that first record is incredible its genius MUHAMMAD Yeah you listen to the lyrics there is just nohow noway that I think you would be confused as  this person is a mastermind ROSS Yeah that record And his whole his whole being He got a whole chapter in my book Him and the Beasties are the only people got whole chapters KELLEY Yeah I had the tape which made the card like the perfect size ROSS I found my bag of cassettes recently MUHAMMAD Wow ROSS But I had some humdingers in there too I had TLC CrazySexyCool I had Diary of a Mad Band I had some joints I didnt think I would have in there My little RB phase was in my tape bag But I had some humdingers too Black Moon first WuTang tape And I remember the first WuTang tape I remember me adjusting my speakers thinking my speakers were fed up I was like Yo whats going on here Yo my EQs are all  yo whats going on with my speakers Its incredible MUHAMMAD Outside of your moonlighting as an AR executive finding the next AAP Rockies you still making music man ROSS I dont make much music anymore you know I gotta be honest It really came down to time is money Where do I spend my energy so I can continue to make my mortgage payments and try and make sure my familys OK its important I wasnt making as much money as I had as a producer and I wasnt working on projects that were inspirational I was getting paid less to shine turds than I had five years before And Im smart enough to be honest with myself to say Maybe this isnt going the way you want it to go The trajectory is going downhill not uphill Let me see what I can do to adjust So I adjusted And I miss it but I did it a long time And you know what Some of the last records I made were with Santana and Anthony Hamilton Those were the good ones Then I made some that I didnt really appreciate making but I needed the money and I dont want to make music for that reason KELLEY What did you make with Anthony Hamilton ROSS He sang a song I wrote for Santana called Twisted on the last Santana record All That I Am I wrote it with Anthony in my studio when Anthony had a cheese sandwich to his name He was my guy forever We wrote about 50 songs together Im a EMI writer and that was one that connected and we sold it to him and it was on the album and it was a great experience Love Anthony Hamilton Hes a great man hes a wonderful singer Hes a true artist you know I hear a lot of Bill Withers in Anthony MUHAMMAD So do you think that as a songwriter that  I dont know I hear your answer and Im just like  you breaking my heart But I totally understand And I say this because I have another friend a dear friend whos an incredible producer and gave me sort of the area in what may have caused you to make those sort of same choices in saying You know what Im shifting over here Different responsibilities and I can keep the ledger consistent by being on the company side of things But one of the people hes working with has been given the face of saving RB ROSS Thats a big job MUHAMMAD Or  no not saving  is the future Thats different Its the future And is wondering based off of the content that the artists are putting out there lyrically is this something that you know is really what theyre about and wondering if there should be some sort of a shift differently cause he can also go in on the company side of things and do really well and can be excited I think as a company person versus a producer Its just like OK yeah Ill get in the room with this person cause you want me to but its not as fulfilling ROSS Its a tough call man You know I was  I left a job as Vice President of AR to go make a Everlast record when his career was over We did a demo and I believed in it And I had enough money in my life and I owned a house and I was like You know what Eh whatever Let me take a chance Let me roll the dice I might night ever be able to do this again I went to LA and we made the record and it sold a lot of copies And we ended up working with Santana and I got a Grammy I did that for 10 years and I felt like I fought the good fight And I wasnt making the money I needed to make I made this record working with Travis Barker and it wasnt  I didnt love the record took a lot of energy and Lyor called me into Warner Brothers in LA when I was out there finishing up he offered me a job And I was like Yeah I want to move back to New York And he was like Yeah so when can you start And I took the job So I was lucky I had options Some people dont have options you know How many great guys do we know  great talents  who arent working right now And thats because music is maybe disposable times change how long do you really get a run at this thing And I think thats perennial I think that predates us You know Phil Spector didnt make the great records in the 80s that he made in the 70s and the 60s KELLEY We were talking earlier about rapper time Like working in the middle of the night ROSS Yes KELLEY Like me going on reporting trips go to dinner with my family go out for drinks then I go to work Does that mess with your personal life at all ROSS It does and I really try not to live on the nocturnal rep or schedule anymore You know I got responsibilities whether its my wife or whatever it is I got a lot of stuff I gotta do I gotta try and be done by 2 oclock I just cant do it anymore In my youth Id sleep in the studio I mean Jesus Christ I  KELLEY Theres always people asleep in the studio ROSS I mean I literally  10 years ago I was making a Fun Lovin Criminals record I got the call in the studio from Mark Labelle that they wanted a song that got submitted for 8 Mile on the soundtrack but I had to finish it in two days I called up a studio I went from Fun Lovin Criminals session at Magic Shop right to Platinum Island They had a shower there  I took a shower there to wake up I stayed up I finished the record and got on the album 36 hours straight of work and I reaped the benefits I dont know if I could do that now I was under the gun you know but I got the song on 8 Mile MUHAMMAD You know what I love about that is people they get this kinda like fantastical idea of how to be successful But theres a lot of dedication and sacrifice that you make when you do that You could have just been like Yo Im really tired and I just want to go rest But the flip side of that is you didnt and look what happened And the other aspect of that which I think discourages a lot of people is that you still make that sort of sacrifice and you dont reap the benefit the reward of it immediately ROSS Right Thats the good side of that MUHAMMAD Yeah thats the good side ROSS So theres lots of times when I was in my own studio til 5 in the morning the suns coming up and Im chopping up a loop or Im doing this or that or mixing down a demo that never went anywhere MUHAMMAD But you have to  I think at least  be in it to be in it ROSS One hundred percent Youre not gonna get the home run unless you know you get up to bat 2 million times and strike out I dont know anyone who constantly wins And my approach to producing records was always very blue collar anyway You know I never wanted a Bentley Its not my aspirations and I just dont look at the world that way Its not what revolves my world or my want for it For me the ultimate result is the tangible great song or great album Whether Im the AR guy or the producer I like that tangible piece of art that I can be proud of And if I do that enough times Ill reap the benefits But Ive never done it so I could live the fabulous life Copyright 2014 NPR,20141104,guns

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/11/04/361403249/what-makes-kenyas-marathon-runners-the-worlds-best?ft=3&f=,Wilson Kipsang the Kenyan winner of Sundays New York City Marathon told reporters after it was over that hed had to slow down  to exercise a lot of patience  as he logged the first miles of the 262mile race And even with his purposely slowish  start he completed the marathon in two hours 10 minutes and 59 seconds Kipsang wasnt the only standout Kenyan in the race Mary Keitany and Jemima Jelagat Sumgong placed first and second in the womens division Other Kenyans are leaders as well In September Dennis Kimetto ran only his fifth marathon in Berlin and broke the world record and the 203 barrier finishing in 20257 Its impossible to measure exactly what makes for marathon gold says Daniel Lieberman a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard and the author of The Story of the Human Body Evolution Health and Disease But Kenyan runners may possess certain qualities that drive their ability to win Lieberman has spent years studying the evolution of running including the biomechanics and physiology of children and adults who run in rural and urban regions of Kenya He shared a few thoughts with Goats and Soda on what hes learned Why are Kenyans winning so many marathons Its a fascinating question  why Kenyans are so fast so dominant at the moment Ethiopians are also doing extremely well But really if you really look at finishing times runners from Africa are only a little bit faster than the rest of the world just a few minutes faster over the course of slightly more than two hours I dont know a definitive answer no one does So everybody just guesses Its impossible to quantify all of the factors that make one runner better than another Its probably a combination of training determination culture and biology How might their environment shape a young runner The area of Kenya where a lot of the best runners come from  the Western Rift Valley  is a beautiful wonderful place If there is any one factor that leaps out at me it is how many people in that region are poor and work hard There are almost no jobs apart from subsistence farming There are no factories and very few secondary schools So there are really few options for young people to better their lives They can either work hard on a farm or train to be a great runner So aspiring runners work really really hard when they train In addition most kids usually run to school barefoot which I think has some effect because it means they grow up being excellent runners because as Lieberman has written barefoot runners tend to strike with their forefoot or midfoot which is less stressful than landing heel first And the region is at high altitude All together this part of Kenya has a large population of incredibly fit runners who run barefoot and work hard Do they have any special training secrets They train with incredible heart motivation and intensity without any of the advantages that Americans get Aspiring runners in Kenya get no goo no gel no sports drinks They have no trainers or sports medicine experts When people train hard for years and years I suspect that has an effect on their ability to race compared to people who have it easier Is there a running gene an athletic gene that researchers can pinpoint The efforts to find genes or other factors have mostly failed Theres no smokinggun gene That doesnt mean these genes dont exist but no one has found them Youve studied VO2 max or maximum oxygen uptake levels in young Kenyan runners This refers to the maximum amount of oxygen an individual can utilize during intense exercise We have found that young Kenyan kids from rural areas who do a lot of running have incredible VO2 maxes They have VO2 maxes most of us would dream to have Its probably due to a combination of factors that theyre very active and living at high altitude and perhaps some genetic component When you see kids in the morning going to school theyre often running Kids travel some seven to 10 kilometers a day on foot often running How many American kids run to school every day Is there a critical point in the marathon when Kenyan runners seem to gain the advantage The marathon really starts at miles 18 to 20 The pack runs together up to then The folks who win still have gas in the tank at the end and are able to sprint the final miles How are changes in lifestyle food or other things in Kenya over the last couple of decades affecting health and running among youth Were studying this right now As development sweeps through Kenya in the urban areas there are more processed foods more public transportation more desk jobs Chairs all day long Weve done studies measuring fitness and strength in people growing up in towns versus those growing up in the countryside The differences are astonishing I now see signs along the road in Kenya for diabetes clinics which I never used to see in the old days Health problems are arriving as development occurs But I dont see this in the rural areas Do Kenyans enjoy running One of the fascinating things about Kenya is that few people exercise for fun When runners there retire they stop running Its a business As a result people dont jog to stay healthy as they age Weve been working on getting people there to think about running not just as a way to train but as important for everyone for health Copyright 2014 NPR,20141104,guns

guess from Afrika cause Afrika was coming around I knew him De La of course and just everyone was around the De La sessions when they were doing the first record And Tip was  he was like in the background and Afrika was there a lot so I guess from there And I knew Red forever too I knew Red before I knew De La MUHAMMAD Can we take it back just a little bit because now you talking like Native

were into skateboarding So were friends from when we were like 14 or 15 I went to high school with AdRock We would just always hang out And like a lot of the energy from punk rock ended up going to hiphop right Cause punk rock got  for lack of a better word it got corny We liked to do stuff before people did it So when everyone got into it we moved on So we graduated from going to the see the Bad Brains to going to the Roxy Me and AdRock would go a lot So they started making rap music Russell was their manager I was friends with Russell and Lyor And I met Captain Pissy he started  Sean Carasov rest in peace my man He started road managing the Beasties and me and him linked up became super super close He thought I was a smart kid Beasties took me on tour I got off tour and they were gonna go out again and Lyor and Russell offered me a job working in the office cause of Sean Cause I told Sean I dont want to be on the road I was like Yo I want to get in the real business So Ricky

little kid I was making like no money but Id go out with Russell and Lyor like every night MUHAMMAD What does a messenger at Rush Management do ROSS I went to Sony a lot and delivered stuff for Donnie Ienner And I got Lyors lunch a lot And I went back and forth to Russells house and the office cause Russell never came to the office MUHAMMAD Right ROSS And Id have to go to Greene Street to check out either  Greene Street or Chung King  to check out Rick or whoever was in the studio MUHAMMAD So were you like bringing tapes back and forth ROSS Occasionally tapes usually like an envelope that had some contract in it or whatever And I remember  this is so fed up  so I decided I was gonna be fly after I go to Sony all the time I remember Id met like Al Teller or somebody And I saw these guys kind of dressed fly so I was like Im gonna dress fly I throw on my Benetton slacks some shoes like a buttonup and I had got a briefcase I remember I went to deliver something to Russell and he screamed at me He was like Dont ever dress like that And I was like Why Hes like You look like one of them Hes like You gotta be you MUHAMMAD Thats not Def Jam Or Rush ROSS Yeah he was like Yo they come to you You dont go to them He was like They pay me all that money cause I dress like this And I was like Word Hes like Yeah they think I know some s they dont know Hes like Dont ever do that again So I got rid of my briefcase and I went back to dressing like a bum MUHAMMAD Did you learn a lot from Russell and Lyor ROSS I did I learned a lot from both of em  a ton  and from Sean too From Sean I learned being really organized From Russell I learned to trust my innate sense of what was good not to overthink things He would always tell me like Yo whats up with this record And he was really valuing my opinions And I was just you know a crazy little kid I just picked that up from him We never discussed it but I realized not to second guess myself too much that if this guy was trusting my opinion on things than my opinion was probably pretty valid And from Lyor I learned how to get yelled at how to yell back how to function under pressure and also kinda how to be strategic and kind of a bad trade Machiavellian at times I saw Lyor do all that and I spent a ton of time working with Lyor He was like a early mentor of mine A very complicated person but kinda brilliant too  obviously brilliant MUHAMMAD Hmm I kinda wanna stay here for a minute but  KELLEY Uh huh Well we can clarify something Who is Ricky ROSS Ricky is Ricky Powell MUHAMMAD Ricky Powell ROSS The photographer Infamous for the line Homeboy throw in the towel  Your girl got ded by Ricky Powell on Hey Ladies He was a Beastie Boy guy grew up in the Village I knew him since I was a kid Hes a famous

signed Tribe MUHAMMAD Word ROSS He worked at Jive He road managed The Beasties He was a very important component in the madness that was Licensed to Ill from the exploding penis on stage to the

and one of my closest friends for a long time He passed away a few years ago unfortunately MUHAMMAD Very missed ROSS Very missed He also beyond everything he had an amazing sense of humor He saw humor in the most fed up s And maybe thats why me and him were such good friends Hes really a perverse individual but a great guy MUHAMMAD You know for us he was the record company person who wasnt the record company person ROSS One hundred percent MUHAMMAD It was one of the reasons why we definitely signed with Jive cause a Captain is  his spirit was  well everything was brand new for us so didnt really have experience of dealing with people in the industry but it was just something about him He just was  ROSS He was bigger than life larger than life MUHAMMAD Yeah he was ROSS He was like a big a big personality I mean its funny cause you guys signed to Jive But I tried to sign you guys like hook line and sinker I put it all out there I really left my job at Tommy Boy to sign two groups I went to work at Elektra to sign Tribe Called Quest and DOC and I got neither of em Because Monica wouldnt pay the money you guys were looking for Well not Monica  Tom Silverman And same with DOC Man I

us when I was Eric B and Rakims road manager I became super tight with him He was from Brooklyn I had lived in Brooklyn He was on God Body stuff and teaching me all this metaphysical things He gave me like The Power of Positive Magnetism by Bhagwan Rajneesh I read it and wed always have these philosophical discussions He was an incredibly intellectually gifted man And he really  he loved me a lot So I started hanging out with him a lot And he hit me and he said Yo theyre gonna hire a AR person at Tommy Boy They asked me if I wanted the job I turned it down but I threw your name in the ring Is that cool And I was like Yeah Hell yeah I was like I dont want to get Lyors lunch and get yelled at everyday anymore Like this is ridiculous Monica called me up She interviewed me and I did good and she called me back for a second interview and they played this tape and it was De La Soul They were like What do you think of this And I was like Thats the greatest thing I ever heard Its like Slick Rick meets Ultramagnetic I made em play it for me three or four times And me and Monica became tight They offered me the job and I had to sneak out of Rush behind Lyors back and he hated me for a year for it MUHAMMAD Yeah I can image Cause Lyor holds grudges man ROSS Oooh  he doesnt anymore He used to MUHAMMAD He used to ROSS Yeah yeah MUHAMMAD Yeah he used to ROSS Yeah he was mad at me for a while Russell was happy for me so you know MUHAMMAD But De La Soul was managed by Rush so  ROSS Later on MUHAMMAD Oh OK ROSS They didnt have a manager in the beginning MUHAMMAD Did you bring them to Rush or  ROSS I didnt bring em to em but when they asked me about it I didnt discourage it I was like Yeah thats probably a good idea You know and Lyors like You gotta give me the band I was like Youll get the band Theres no other game in town back then really Yeah it was a trippy time I mean before they had a manager I used to book their gigs out of the office and man we went to LA Oh man we performed at Skate Land and World on Wheels And if you know anything about LA back then that stuffs very gangrelated And we had no concept of any of that MUHAMMAD Was this just strictly off of  ROSS Plug Tunin MUHAMMAD Plug Tunin not even the 3 Feet High and Rising ROSS Nope Before all that Plug Tunin Cause KDAY  Tommy Boy had KDAY on the payroll so they were playing that record right Like crazy and it connected out there I remember we went out there and performed with 7A3 Everlast when he was in the Rhyme Syndicate  thats when I met Everlast IceT was there he did a song But De La might have been the headliner and it was at Skateland  I mean World on Wheels  it was bugged out So I remember everyone was wearing blue  Cowboys and Yankees and Georgetown stuff And 7A3 did that song Why And dudes was Crip walking throwing up signs going Thats why Yelling back at the record And we were scared Because we had striped shirts and flattops We didnt look like those guys It was intense It was really

MUHAMMAD 88 yeah ROSS Yeah so 87 the prelude to the album MUHAMMAD So then from signing De La you signed  ROSS Latifah MUHAMMAD Queen Latifah ROSS So that happened cause 45 King I would hear the promos he had on Red Alert Back then Red Alert was like biblical His show was like you never missed it And then there was Marley too and his show was great too but I listened to Red cause he had the ill promos There was Chuck Chillout Red Alert Marley and them But I really listened to Red cause he played the most new stuff He had the ill promos I dont know if people remember the Fat Joe promo or all the 45 King promos They were just ill I used to love em I used to like wait for the whole tape to show just for that And 45 King somehow knew who I was He came up here in Latin Quarters with a Walkman and he asked me if I was Dante Ross And I was like Yeah And I somehow I guess I kind of knew who he was It probably wasnt hard to tell who I was cause there was no white people except the guys who worked there and me at the Latin Quarter And I would go and hang out with Red a lot I used to help him carry records I used to live on 108th St Id go to his house and Id roll with him to the Quarters MUHAMMAD Wow ROSS Thats how I know Chris And thats how I know Darryl and knew The Violators All from then Cause I wanted to get in for free I wanted to hang out with Red Alert This guys Red

sweet person really Could tell she had came from a good family She was just really  she had the glow And Monica said We want to try and sign her We ended up going to play basketball on 91st St York Ave and she can play ball She told me she played high school ball when we were out there I was like This is crazy And she was nice I think she was like you know All County in Jersey wherever shes from East Orange And we called Richard Grabel and we did the deal and we ended up signing her That first record its basically the demo Its basically 45 Kings demo He mixed it in Calliope and it made the record  I cant tell if it made it any better Its the same record Theres no difference from the demo and that record I dont think MUHAMMAD Wow ROSS That record connected And it was cool cause the De La record I gave that to Red like hand to hand And he played it He played it and he was like Ima start playing that He called me up and told me I gave him that record too the Latifah record so I was like two for two So two right in a row went on And you know those were formidable records MUHAMMAD Absolutely At least for me I mean I dont have to go into it But the energy in New York City at that time period was  ROSS It was incredible MUHAMMAD It was incredible ROSS And everything was accessible MUHAMMAD Yeah ROSS You could really just go up to Red Alert and give him a record And your record might end up on daytime radio That was like incredible And we all looked up to  and I left this out  we all looked up to Jungle Brothers right Cause they were  them and Ultramagnetic  very different groups but they were like the new s That was the new s Like Ultra was bugged out and The Jungle Brothers man they just made great records and they were sampling all the records I grew up listening to Those were all the records my sister whos nine years older than me played Mandrill and just all the records they were messing with So hearing their music I was like Wow were all on the same kind of wavelength Where KRSOne was before us and the Juice Crew I loved all that stuff but it didnt have the same exact connection It was something about the funk they were messin with MUHAMMAD So then moving past  you didnt get your Tribe ROSS I didnt get my Tribe I got Digital Underground MUHAMMAD Thats a big signing ROSS But I never really talk about Digital cause I didnt stay to make the record I got Doowutchyalike MUHAMMAD Howd you come into contact with them ROSS Chuy from KMEL Bay Area legend Chuy Gomez he was on the radio forever I was out there he gave me the record and it had the PFunk type drawing I loved PFunk before hiphop Thats what I listened to  funk PFunk all that growing up I loved Brothers Johnson and Zapp and all that So I loved it had the PFunk thing to it I remember playing the record at Tommy Boy De La were there Pos bugged out I thought it was  there was something there We picked up the record Then I left before the next record came out I never worked on that record MUHAMMAD Wow ROSS Yeah MUHAMMAD What did that feel like Cause I mean thats  ROSS It felt like I was making twice as much money at Elektra You know what I mean Tom Silverman just wouldnt pay me Like he was really not trying to pay me so I had to bounce MUHAMMAD Thats understandable ROSS I remember Def Jam was gonna give me a job and I got offered more money at Elektra and I asked my lawyer what to do He said Take the check so I took the check MUHAMMAD Im just sitting here  I had sit in silence for a moment to really ponder that cause I just wonder what the scope of Def Jam would look like Because at that time then who was signing This was before Redman This is like  ROSS Before Redman 3rd Bass MUHAMMAD 3rd Bass which you were a part of ROSS Right I produced a lot of the records Its so funny if I had  so if Puffy had came out around before me or if I had been more ruthless I would have really got paid on that one I didnt realize that you could basically  if you were having hit records you could write your own rules But I didnt know that so I basically put 3rd Bass  like they got on Def Jam and I helped make the records but I never really made a lot of money working with them They should have been like signed to me basically But I didnt do it that way cause I didnt know MUHAMMAD Oh yeah as a production deal situation ROSS Yeah or I should have been attached as AR guy or something I should have somehow figured out a way to really make money on it and I never really did MUHAMMAD Have you done that with any of your artists ROSS Nah man Im not that kinda guy MUHAMMAD Thats why you can sleep good at night right ROSS I never took anyones publishing Im not that guy Yeah its also probably why I never got punched in the face right KELLEY You never got punched in the face ROSS Well not by a rapper I been punched in the face definitely and deservedly so But Ive never had an artist come and punch me in the face Theres never been a artist who came in my office who went crazy Or a producer or a manager MUHAMMAD Im really just trying to think during that time period who was there signing at Def Jam It was kinda quiet over there for a minute ROSS It was quiet MUHAMMAD So youre building up  KELLEY Is Faith there then ROSS She was there and she signed 3rd Bass but they didnt really empower her And thats the thing about Def Jam They never really let anyone get maverick and sign a lot of stuff It always had to run through a lot of hands you know and it was later on that they opened it up and they really let people get busy MUHAMMAD So youre building up the Elektra WEA  what was it at the time ROSS It was Elektra And there was Atlantic Elektra Warner Brothers MUHAMMAD You guys were the only ones on the hiphop side of things from  ROSS Atlantic was there They had some things MUHAMMAD They had a few 12inches but I dont remember like  ROSS They had Das EFX MUHAMMAD OK And DOC was signed there too right ROSS Yep to East West MUHAMMAD So you bring in Brand Nubian ROSS I bring in Brand Nubians and scare everybody Everyones scared MUHAMMAD What was that like Were they the first signing ROSS They were And they were  yeah they were a handful man you know They were definitely on some militant God Body type of thing and that didnt necessarily ingratiate them or get them embraced by the people at work But you know it was such a cheap deal I didnt realize I had been a big Grand Puba fan from Masters of Ceremony I mean we all were fans of his He was incredible He brought me the demo when I worked at Tommy Boy and I skated with that in my back pocket And I was like Hold up I got a deal for you Max And I took it in the door with me MUHAMMAD Wait a minute Do they know this ROSS Yeah Monica was always mad about it MUHAMMAD Im just saying ROSS Monica was like You know you cant sign Grand Puba And I was like Oh Im not signing Grand Puba Dont worry about it So Im signing Brand Nubian And I ended up skating out the door with  and two songs that didnt make the album on the demo One of em was called I Aint Goin Out Like That It was off of Sex Machine by James Brown and Cypress Hill used the hook on their second album Aint Goin Out Like That and Muggs told me straight up hes likeYo they never used it MUHAMMAD Wow KELLEY Oh my god ROSS Muggs is the king of that He took Jump Around from Leaders live show They were  remember they were Jump jump jump I was with him right next to him and hes like You know thats supposed to be a record And I was like Yeah probably And that was  there it is Jump Around MUHAMMAD Thats crazy ROSS Yeah you know I love Muggs Hes the smartest guy right MUHAMMAD Apparently you are too to just say Yeah Im not signing Puba Im signing  ROSS Brand Nubian MUHAMMAD Im not signing him trust me KELLEY I have some questions for you MUHAMMAD Oh really OK what KELLEY Well I want to know what it feels like to be a part of a bidding war like that Cause hes got one side of the story and then youre  what Is Chris telling you whats going on like what people want MUHAMMAD Yeah and it was strange because for us  meeting QTip in high school at the age of 14 and at 15 we formed the group And from him coming over to the house on the weekend and us making records and his sister dated a guy named Randall who was part of the Zulu Nation was friends with Skeff Anselm I remember we took our demo in early and it was just like Eh you kids need to just kinda like  We were kinda discouraged So to go from that to actually like making some sort of an impression it was just weird And it happened really quickly ROSS The demo had El Segundo on it MUHAMMAD It had El Segundo on it It had Bonita on it ROSS Bonita but not the remix The original MUHAMMAD It was the original version of Bonita which was musically it was different What else was on that demo ROSS Those were the two songs I remember MUHAMMAD I think Pubic Enemy may have been on there and Description of a Fool ROSS Description of a Fool was definitely on it MUHAMMAD Yeah But I mean this was probably before it even got to that point with what we had given to Randall at the time That was kind of like a learning curve for us and we just kept at it so by the time we got to the point of the demo that you heard things moved really quickly We had also sampled Knee Deep which De La used for Me Myself and I We kinda gave them the nod and just saying Well cool like you guys can have it and it turned into a huge hit for them But during that time period it went from like Are we ever gonna get on to Were so on ROSS Buddy came out before you got signed too right The remix MUHAMMAD I dont remember ROSS Think so And also he was on  Tip was on The Promo off The JBs  MUHAMMAD Yeah we had The Promo We had a song Black Is Black which was also one of our demos and The JBs were like You guys should put this on our record It was just a series of things that occurred that gave us like Well we know were close and were getting there But at the same time things were dragging out a little bit And originally Jeff Fenster who was at Geffen had given us a demo budget which  then things started to kinda like expedite a little bit They passed on us ROSS Wow MUHAMMAD Jeff loved us He said I love you guys but I dont know what to do with you The company doesnt know what to do with you guys And every time I see Jeff its like Thank you for passing Seriously because that opened the door for us to get into this bidding war I know Def Jam was involved Jive Tommy Boy I think that might have been it ROSS It definitely came down to us and Jive Elektra and Jive were slugging it out And it was awkward too cause Sean was my really good friend MUHAMMAD Well for us I mean QTip  we talk about this behind closed doors just like Man what would have happened if we signed to Def Jam ROSS You would have sold a lot of records MUHAMMAD Were not sure You know thats just one of those you never know if it would have clicked the same way or  I mean Def Jam was Def Jam though ROSS It feels like because Rush was so involved in De La they wanted their own De La It probably would have been big KELLEY What did you hear in the demo that made you be like Got to ROSS They were great Tip was a star The music was you know it was gonna be the next De La It was a nobrainer It was gonna be the next thing And I loved The Promo I loved it and I loved Tips verse on it And I knew him I saw the effect he had on people He was definitely it was  everything was there And Phife was like the Flava Flav like he had the comic relief It was the whole package It was one of the best demos of all time Four of those songs are on the first album MUHAMMAD First album yeah ROSS So its a nobrainer MUHAMMAD Just to answer directly I dont remember It was just strange It was just like euphoric You know were still kids and its like no one wants us to all of the sudden you know people wanting you and then youre wondering is it hype Is it real Once one company gets in and then they get wind that another company gets in its just like whos really gonna take care of you Thats what it ultimately became Its like well BDP signed to Jive so that could be cool Whodini was there Def Jam had LL Cool J Tommy Boy had the rest of the family And it was just kind of like do we do we go where Latifah and De La was to kinda like really strengthen the Native Tongue aspect ROSS But Tommy Boy wasnt offering real money right MUHAMMAD No they werent Or do we take the sacrifice and go elsewhere There were a lot of questions and I mean the rest is history ROSS I remember when you signed to Jive I had heard it was the biggest deal Jive had ever done for a rap group MUHAMMAD Yeah KELLEY I heard that too ROSS Yeah so And I offered more and I didnt get it MUHAMMAD I dont remember that ROSS Chris remembers it Rest in peace Chris definitely remembers it It was the first time I lost a group and I gotta tell you it hurt I was like Oh man MUHAMMAD Well  ROSS Now I lost like 50 groups so I dont care MUHAMMAD So are you looking to retire sometime soon ROSS Nah I think I got a few more seasons in me MUHAMMAD Thats whats up ROSS I have got a lot of other stuff Im doing too Im working on a TV project with Cheo Coker and Jeff Chang KELLEY What is that ROSS Well its kind of hard to say but we acquired the rights to Cant Stop Wont Stop Jeffs book and were creating a historical fiction version of the second half of the book So were working on it slowly but surely Cheo is a brilliant writer and so is Jeff and Im a shmuck who came up with kind of half the idea and they pulled me in on it That and I wrote a book My book will come out at the end of the year Son of the City its about growing up in New York and all the music stuff I worked on but also my relationship with my dad He was a writer And kind of my relationship to art and culture cause I always think that even as a record producer my greatest talent on earth is recognizing talent hearing something not necessarily being the talent So thats kind of what its about How Ive been able to encounter all these different things from different worlds along the way MUHAMMAD Are there any or is there a model or any words that you live by ROSS A couple I mean the Serenity Prayer I say it every morning when I wake up That one always gets me through tough times The St Francis prayer And then I try to just  I always think that for me the road to freedom is paved with gratitude So if I can exercise gratitude I will be a free person Not to be like a hippie or anything but thats kind of just  MUHAMMAD You know what We look at you you dont come off as a hippie KELLEY Also youre talking to Ali at NPR You can be a hippie ROSS Well my dad was a super hippie and so was my mom so I grew up around like all that And that stuff really is why I made the music I made Like my dad was friends with Bobby Seale so I was always attracted to cultural things So KMD and Brand Nubians and De La and all that that fit right into where my parents raised me to be So it made a lot of sense MUHAMMAD You always came off as crazy edgy to me ROSS Cause I was a punk rock skateboarder I still am so MUHAMMAD Its fascinating to know people long enough to  you know what I mean  really just see transformation I remember as I kid I was like Yo this  I didnt know much about Dante at the time when we first met but I just knew he was edgy And I remember a couple of times there was  ROSS I had a problem with my hands when I was younger MUHAMMAD Yeah I was about to say  it surprised me you were like No one ever punched me in the face Im like  ROSS Oh yeah but it wasnt rappers MUHAMMAD And you clarified that but Im like I remember a few times coming into a place it was like Dante got into a fight But I say that to say that you always had this kind of like this balance and this peaceful sort of zen and respectful aspect about you So hearing you say that Im like Oh yeah well thats why It makes sense It was always there ROSS As you get older its easier to gravitate towards your higher power MUHAMMAD Yeah ROSS You dont have time for the nonsense My life has been a rollercoaster a lot of it I like to say I had a 12round boxing match in three rounds for most of my life So I got older I put down that dynamic and try to just live a much more peaceful existence And I get to celebrate the things that Ive accomplished and the friends Ive got to meet through all of this stuff I always say I have got a lot of gratitude Most people didnt get the experience and see all the stuff Ive had the pleasure to see and experience and be involved with Like I got to be right up front and see and experience things that are legendary and still be alive to celebrate that and to be celebrated for it And thats priceless MUHAMMAD Youre talking about being in that environment and around so many different great elements and where you are  kind of jumping a little bit through your whole history What do you see in the scope of hiphop now where it is For me personally I think at times its  I just see tumbleweed You know like theres some sort of life but then its just like Will there be any fruit that grow and will shift mankind closer together in a good way And youre still in it and youre signing artists So what is that feeling of greatness now in 2014 versus 1989 ROSS Its very different I always think music exists in chambers right So you have this kind of art and that kind of art and this kind of art and that kind You had Tone Loc and you had Rakim you know Everythings just in its own chamber and things are good for what they are So I see things that I still appreciate and enjoy I think some of the artistry is definitely altered not necessarily for the better but I still see people who are stars So like I didnt sign them but I tried to  AAP Rocky was a star I saw the video he came in my office I was like This guy is a star So does he rap as great as my favorite rapper in the world That wasnt even relevant really MUHAMMAD Right ROSS So I look more for stars now than I look for people who are the most lyrically adept etc etc Its a different barometer the way I have to approach it and look at it That said I see things that are very inspirational and impressive whether its Kendrick Lamar or ScHoolboy even kids like the kid Denzel Curry or  there are things out there that I appreciate Joey Bada Action Bronson Iamsu So if I look hard enough you know I find things Like I brought Macklemore to ADA Now I knew he was a star cause I saw him prove it in front of 2500 people in San Francisco And my niece loves him Before he had the hit records she was in love with him I knew he wasnt Eminem but I also knew he wasnt Yelawolf I knew he was his own thing and I wanted to sign him because I thought he was a star My boss Todd Moscowitz wouldnt let me sign him So I went down the hall to ADA and they worked their deal out So when I looked at him I seen for his chamber someone who was very great at what he did So thats how I have to measure things now Everything cant be Rakim or Tribe or Cypress Hill Thats not the bar right now The bar is where its at and I have to accept that And I relate to music in its own chamber as liking it for what it is MUHAMMAD Are you still excited ROSS At times MUHAMMAD At times ROSS At times I mean you do this 25 years its hard to stay excited Am I excited like when I first heard Cypress Hills demo Definitely not I would say no But there are things that really excite me yeah Im excited by someone Im chasing right now You know theres someone I also lost last year that was exciting to me MUHAMMAD I dont know who this person is and it will remain undisclosed but whoever you are like roll with Dante ROSS Thank you Thank you Its different now too right So Brand Nubian  I was the only dude who tried to give em a record deal Theres no secrets anymore Everybody knows about everything cause we got this thing called the interweb So if you make good music you dont shop your demo anymore You put your music on a blog and you get a lot of people who know about your music then you get a phone call from nine shmucks like me and everybody tries to see if youre a star And most of us could probably tell if youre a star and then the deals start coming Its a totally different process now but theres no secrets theres none But you know I will see things and Ill be like Oh wow That guys a star I like that guy That guy makes great music Im not always right but usually I do  my average is pretty good especially on the new stuff KELLEY So back in the day Russell and Lyor would sort of trust you to tell em whats hot Like they didnt know ROSS Yeah cause they were like you know they were a little older They werent in the Latin Quarters KELLEY Do you have somebody like that now or are you still in the Latin Quarters ROSS Nah its me Its different now too Its a different game Now its like  nothing has to be a visceral experience right On all levels Which leads to lots of things not being as  having as much depth In all levels of culture way beyond music Because we can all get on the interweb and go and you know scratch the surface of whatever we want to find out about right Theres Wikipedia theres blogs theres Google theres whatever it is So you can find out about the surface of everything Back in the day you couldnt do that You had to go and smell it You had to go be right there You had to be in the element whether it was dangerous or whatever it was You had to have the physical experience the visceral experience And I think that that led to more informed decisions probably and also a deeper understanding of what the artistry that particular person was putting forth was about But that said thats not as important anymore Its a different game And if I dont adjust Im not adaptable And if I dont see how its done now and I dont play by those rules well then I get left in the dust KELLEY So the lack of a need for the visceral experience does that put the bar where its at now ROSS I wouldnt say thats the reason why I would say the reason why is  this is a theory Im trying  I think De La first told me this one Nowadays everybodys uncles cousins brothers mothers father was AAP Rockys road manager or this guys that guys something everyones connected to it Everyones aware of it When Ali and me and when we were all involved in the culture that was for forwardthinking progressive people That wasnt the norm It wasnt what every kid aspired to do So we were forwardthinkers We were outside of the box Not only were we outside of the box the box that existed the RunDMC box we didnt want that box We wanted our own universe MUHAMMAD True ROSS So we were forging our own paths Nowadays because of mass bohemia  blame it on the internet age of information whatever it is  its all accessible to every kid So youre not getting the forwardforwardthinkers anymore Youre getting everybody that wants to do it And I think that makes the goals different For us it was more about expressing artistry To have your own unique voice out there it was cathartic I dont believe its as cathartic I think now its monetary People want the fame and the fortune a lot more than just expression And thats always existed but it exists more now because its more accessible Everyone knows how much money Kreayshawn got or AAP got and everyone knows about that car that Pharrell got or this or that and that wasnt the case back then MUHAMMAD Has anything that occurred  I guess from a marketing perspective that may have caught your attention without going through the now custom route of  ROSS Theres one thing and I signed em I gave em a small deal  this group After the Smoke  and it hasnt connected Theyre very insular and they live in a vacuum a little bit And because of that I dont think its connected Cause I think they make great art but theyre so insular that they dont want to share their art MUHAMMAD So do you think that its sort of like you know because the rules are the way are that if youre looking to make music you have to start off by going through these like Ima put my stuff up on Soundcloud Or Im gonna do  ROSS I think so Its pretty easy You have to create quality content a strong visual and hope to get an audience You get that audience you go back to that audience to build your foundation So you make your video it goes on Nah Right you know you got a shot at Nah Right from now on you build your fanbase from there And that doesnt mean youre gonna get any bigger than this high but maybe you will MUHAMMAD Thats the starting point ROSS Thats the starting point Whatever site it is 2DOPEBOYZ Nah Right whatever it is So wait let me ask you something about just performing MUHAMMAD Yes ROSS You guys were great performers right MUHAMMAD Thanks ROSS De La became great RunDMC were great Cypress Hill were great Thats the one thing I see in hiphop thats really absolutely not there anymore performance MUHAMMAD Im glad you asked about that because I wanted to ask you before when you were talking about a person still being a star Im wondering your viewpoints on performance and the stage performance ROSS Its so important Performance is what gives you a career right If youre a great performer you can play forever MUHAMMAD Yeah absolutely ROSS You know in all genres of music MUHAMMAD You can have a record that doesnt translate really well but if you go out there and present it you win people over ROSS One hundred percent I feel like performance is sorely lacking Thats what sold me on Macklemore when I saw him perform I was like Oh the guy  hes got it I think with a lot of traditional rap groups got 20 guys on stage yelling and screaming its fing trash man Its really  its just not what its supposed to be MUHAMMAD Do you have a chapter in your book or maybe thisll be like the next book a howto sort of like  ROSS An instructional MUHAMMAD Because you come from a  especially with the Beastie Boys is like your training camp right ROSS Man them and Run See for me I measure every group to that But the reason the Beasties are so good cause we grew up watching the Bad Brains and then RunDMC The bar was so high so they were so good You guys and Leaders even Busta still the bar is so high You guys are coming from the root note of greatness So we get further away from that man MUHAMMAD I think maybe because people are just so focused on the glamour aspect of making music and the money aspect and the art suffers And when I say art I mean meaning Theres subtle things like what De La used to do I dont know where De La got this the idea of the flower girls or having flower girls or even having them like hold up words to the songs That to me is artistic you know and it doesnt have to be this grand like Oh lets paint the room a certain color Its just little subtle things you do I think that elevate you And I dont know if people are focusing on that as much I feel like maybe theres a  the younger generation may be getting a glimpse of that who is like 15 right now ROSS Maybe Theres like a lot of the new guys when they perform they dont got it Kendrick got it He got it live KELLEY Hes got moves though ROSS Hes got a lot of emotion on stage MUHAMMAD Yeah hes got a lot of emotion ROSS Hes there hes channeling something That group Ratking has a very good live show KELLEY Really I saw them recently I was really disappointed At Glasslands ROSS I saw them one time they killed it KELLEY Was it at Webster Hall Cause people told me that show was good ROSS Nah it was at 285 which closed I think Action Bronson got a really good show Hes very entertaining Its almost like standup comedy KELLEY Cause hes like covered in sweat instantly ROSS Cause hes funny though KELLEY Yeah its amazing ROSS Hes just really super funny But yeah performance is few and far between Like I just remember the first time Cypress ever played New York and they came out with the pigs masks and BReal had the big weed wreath and it was just like  it was monumental That was a real show you know like there was something to it Even a bad show back then or a regular show was better than most shows now Like the FuSchnickens were probably better than most rap groups right now KELLEY But people are worried They dont want to look corny They dont want to like try it and not pull it off and now theyre wearing a mask on stage you know ROSS One hundred percent Unfortunately thats very true People are scared to put it out there But you know thats why bands are almost always better than rap music live like 90 of the time MUHAMMAD What do you think about hiphop bands ROSS I like The Roots The Roots are good I havent seen really anyone else who impressed me who went out there with a band Jays good with a band MUHAMMAD What about the Fugees or Lauryn Hill ROSS Yeah that was cool too I love Lauryn Hill I saw her when she was still all together on the first record I thought that was pretty good I saw Common with a band be pretty good It can be done Sometimes it just doesnt come off And it always comes down to me to the drums Its hard The Roots they really have mastered it Common was good when he had  my man from Detroit Karriem Riggins was playing drums so it was working So if you have the right drummer it can work but its very hard to do I mean you guys have never done a band have you MUHAMMAD No we havent And QTip has done it and hes tried to talk us into it but weve never  weve talked about it but just for some reason I feel like if we cant duplicate that sound Im just afraid of it Which is kind of odd because Im really into playing live now more so than ever before but its just like it has to translate The one thing I do keep in mind when it comes to Tribes music is the drums spank when it comes through those speakers ROSS The drums Its all about that MUHAMMAD And its just like hmmmm  I havent seen it done from a live band to give it that sound I can do that in a studio but you can control it a studio You know you cant control the sound you cant tame it the same way ROSS Well Jay and them were playing on top of the record MUHAMMAD Yeah a lot of guys now are doing that But I just dont like that ROSS Its kinda fake MUHAMMAD Yeah ROSS I mean I saw De La with a band that was really good MUHAMMAD They were good I saw that ROSS I saw El Michels with WuTang that was pretty good And you know Sharon Jones and those guys I mean they kill it So if youre using Menahan or the Daptones  or the DapKings  its probably gonna be good But its few and far between Its tough The Beasties are cool when they get the band cause its them But you know theyre also  they live in their own world Their music is  the way they approach performance and music is its hiphop but its its own chamber of hiphop They have their own way of doing it you know For that I love them Unfortunately well never get another record by them MUHAMMAD I know ROSS What else you guys want to ask me Anything KELLEY Whats the craziest thing that ever happened at Calliope ROSS At Calliope Oh this is great When I was recording Step to the Rear  this is so good Me and Puba were half drunk Pus doing his vocals and Melle Mel burst through the door thinking it was his session He was in the other room And he was like all diesel And Pubas in the booth and hes like Yo Mel And hes like Yo Puba Whats up And then you know were like We think your sessions in the other room Hes like Oh word yo Peace Pu And then Puba turned around and rapped the second verse of Step to the Rear in a Melle Mel voice Grand Puba ha It was so incredible Yo I wish I had that take still MUHAMMAD I was gonna ask  do you have any archives ROSS And all night long he kept going Rah before he rapped like before he finished the song Thats a memorable moment I mean Calliope was pretty blurry I was real young and there was a lot of people in and people forget that place was only open for a little bit of time Cause after Calliope I lived at Chung King I could tell you a million things at Chung King KELLEY Go ahead ROSS Chung King has so many crazy ones I saw Busta just whip on Charlie bad in Chung King one time and I got in the middle of it I got hit in the back of the head trying to break it up which is crazy I mean  MUHAMMAD What was that like ROSS Ah man It was ugly man MUHAMMAD Because you signed Leaders and you went through that whole separation ROSS It was just ugly man Just ugly KELLEY But theyd already broken up when you signed em ROSS They were already broken up which I didnt know when I signed em MUHAMMAD Oh OK ROSS But there was always a lot of tension and it really got bad after the first record And postScenario because Busta was clearly the star Me and Chris were trying to get Busta to do a solo record Everyone knew that opportunity was there It became very strained and Busta showed an amazing amount of loyalty He did not want to break that band up Whether it was because he was scared to go solo or not I couldnt tell ya I think it was probably both loyalty and fear of riding by himself But man it was very tense during that second album And you know Busta I think in his heart knew that that second record wasnt a great record by any means and he still had to walk the walk and try and sell that to everybody and it was tough I think he showed a amazing amount of maturity the way he dealt with it And you know the rest is history Busta made a solo record and thats that You know he was shining And beyond that though Buss he was always smarter than the rest of the guys I had a very close relationship with him Im still great friends with him and he was a true superstar And you know there were times when we literally would have to get between him and Brown It was fisticuffs I mean you know  you were around it MUHAMMAD Mmhmm ROSS Yeah there was a lot of animosity MUHAMMAD You didnt sign Pete and Corey did you ROSS I inherited them My boss Raoul Roach signed them and got fired He was like Im only signing this if you want to do it I said OK lets do it Ive been hearing the demos He got fired right after and I made the records MUHAMMAD Dope records ROSS I mean Pete made the records I hung out with Pete and he did everything And it was very easy to just babysit that one That was the easiest Pete was great We had the wrong first single Go With the Flow and Creator connected We got lucky Red Alert flipped it over boom and then Flex jumped and that was that The best thing about working with Pete is I got to watch how he made records and pick up tricks  filtering bass lines and a bunch of other things not using quantize MUHAMMAD He doesnt ROSS Sometimes he did sometimes he didnt Depends what it was Putting the snare down live the whole track Reminisce Things like that Just watching that was pretty incredible Didnt Tip not use quantize sometimes too MUHAMMAD Yeah he did ROSS Yeah some Pete did and didnt depending what he was doing MUHAMMAD Yeah same with me Im just  KELLEY What does that mean ROSS Quantize just puts your drums like on beat supposedly MUHAMMAD Yeah its a bit mechanical so it stays closer to the 16th or whatever you set the parameter to to the note So its always on but  ROSS It loses funk MUHAMMAD It loses its funk compared to like a real drummer to have that human before behind a little ROSS I mean I seen Tip put together the Crooklyn joint He didnt use quantize MUHAMMAD Nope ROSS And he did it mad quick He was fast which bugged me out I always really loved that part of it being around producers when they were creating too Even now I like to hang out with Alchemist and just watch him make stuff Always opens my mind up to different tricks And I unfortunately never got to see RZA do anything cause he gave me the reels to Dirty He showed up and was like Heres the album That was like how he did it So I dont know what his science was but I know trying to mix that stuff was impossible It was impossible KELLEY It was your idea for the ODB cover ROSS So it was Dirtys idea and I helped him do it KELLEY Got it ROSS I had pretty close relationships with most of my artists but me and Dirty had a super duper crazy close relationship I have no idea why but yeah the guy like  I loved him and he really appreciated me Hes one of the only artists I never argued with  him and Sadat are probably the only two He came to my office He would always  Dirty had his own way of talking Like all Wu had their own like God Body speak but he was like Yo I got crazy thoughts I got crazy thoughts yo Yo I got my album thoughts I said What do you mean He said Yo check it out Yo this is my album cover and he pulled out his welfare card It was Russell Jones And he was like Yo could we make this my album cover I thought real quick I was like UB40 did it Yeah so why not Probably We went upstairs to the art department and I asked my friend Alli  this was before they had scanners and everyone had a computer  they had a color Xerox machine which was very expensive to use and I was like Yo can I use the color Xerox She was like What do you want to do I want to try and blow something up Just give me a minute She was like Yeah Ill set you up So I blew it up to 12 x 10 and I remember cutting the corners pulling it out it was all pixilated but it was his picture on the welfare card and I walked up to Alli and I was like Alli  Alli Church she was an amazing person  I was like Dirtys album cover right here And she was like Thats genius And she was like Give me the card Ill bring it back to you in a couple hours and Ill start working on the mock up I was like You think its gonna fly Shes like Might fly I was like UB40 She was like Yeah it can probably fly I was also  I had a lot of hit records then so I could do a lot So we ran it up the flag pole and it rocked they let us use it And it was Dirtys idea The thing that she did was she took The New York Welfare Department stamp and made it the Wu She put the W around it And that was it that was his idea I mean thats the thing about Dirty too he was brilliant Before substances took real control of him he was one of the most creative minds He really understood himself as an artist And in all of his madness he gets portrayed as a buffoon sometimes and I think thats like  its easier to think of him as a buffoon than someone who was really creative and understood himself as an artist And I think thats the tragedy of his demise  one of them  that his artistry gets lost cause that first record is incredible its genius MUHAMMAD Yeah you listen to the lyrics there is just nohow noway that I think you would be confused as  this person is a mastermind ROSS Yeah that record And his whole his whole being He got a whole chapter in my book Him and the Beasties are the only people got whole chapters KELLEY Yeah I had the tape which made the card like the perfect size ROSS I found my bag of cassettes recently MUHAMMAD Wow ROSS But I had some humdingers in there too I had TLC CrazySexyCool I had Diary of a Mad Band I had some joints I didnt think I would have in there My little RB phase was in my tape bag But I had some humdingers too Black Moon first WuTang tape And I remember the first WuTang tape I remember me adjusting my speakers thinking my speakers were fed up I was like Yo whats going on here Yo my EQs are all  yo whats going on with my speakers Its incredible MUHAMMAD Outside of your moonlighting as an AR executive finding the next AAP Rockies you still making music man ROSS I dont make much music anymore you know I gotta be honest It really came down to time is money Where do I spend my energy so I can continue to make my mortgage payments and try and make sure my familys OK its important I wasnt making as much money as I had as a producer and I wasnt working on projects that were inspirational I was getting paid less to shine turds than I had five years before And Im smart enough to be honest with myself to say Maybe this isnt going the way you want it to go The trajectory is going downhill not uphill Let me see what I can do to adjust So I adjusted And I miss it but I did it a long time And you know what Some of the last records I made were with Santana and Anthony Hamilton Those were the good ones Then I made some that I didnt really appreciate making but I needed the money and I dont want to make music for that reason KELLEY What did you make with Anthony Hamilton ROSS He sang a song I wrote for Santana called Twisted on the last Santana record All That I Am I wrote it with Anthony in my studio when Anthony had a cheese sandwich to his name He was my guy forever We wrote about 50 songs together Im a EMI writer and that was one that connected and we sold it to him and it was on the album and it was a great experience Love Anthony Hamilton Hes a great man hes a wonderful singer Hes a true artist you know I hear a lot of Bill Withers in Anthony MUHAMMAD So do you think that as a songwriter that  I dont know I hear your answer and Im just like  you breaking my heart But I totally understand And I say this because I have another friend a dear friend whos an incredible producer and gave me sort of the area in what may have caused you to make those sort of same choices in saying You know what Im shifting over here Different responsibilities and I can keep the ledger consistent by being on the company side of things But one of the people hes working with has been given the face of saving RB ROSS Thats a big job MUHAMMAD Or  no not saving  is the future Thats different Its the future And is wondering based off of the content that the artists are putting out there lyrically is this something that you know is really what theyre about and wondering if there should be some sort of a shift differently cause he can also go in on the company side of things and do really well and can be excited I think as a company person versus a producer Its just like OK yeah Ill get in the room with this person cause you want me to but its not as fulfilling ROSS Its a tough call man You know I was  I left a job as Vice President of AR to go make a Everlast record when his career was over We did a demo and I believed in it And I had enough money in my life and I owned a house and I was like You know what Eh whatever Let me take a chance Let me roll the dice I might night ever be able to do this again I went to LA and we made the record and it sold a lot of copies And we ended up working with Santana and I got a Grammy I did that for 10 years and I felt like I fought the good fight And I wasnt making the money I needed to make I made this record working with Travis Barker and it wasnt  I didnt love the record took a lot of energy and Lyor called me into Warner Brothers in LA when I was out there finishing up he offered me a job And I was like Yeah I want to move back to New York And he was like Yeah so when can you start And I took the job So I was lucky I had options Some people dont have options you know How many great guys do we know  great talents  who arent working right now And thats because music is maybe disposable times change how long do you really get a run at this thing And I think thats perennial I think that predates us You know Phil Spector didnt make the great records in the 80s that he made in the 70s and the 60s KELLEY We were talking earlier about rapper time Like working in the middle of the night ROSS Yes KELLEY Like me going on reporting trips go to dinner with my family go out for drinks then I go to work Does that mess with your personal life at all ROSS It does and I really try not to live on the nocturnal rep or schedule anymore You know I got responsibilities whether its my wife or whatever it is I got a lot of stuff I gotta do I gotta try and be done by 2 oclock I just cant do it anymore In my youth Id sleep in the studio I mean Jesus Christ I  KELLEY Theres always people asleep in the studio ROSS I mean I literally  10 years ago I was making a Fun Lovin Criminals record I got the call in the studio from Mark Labelle that they wanted a song that got submitted for 8 Mile on the soundtrack but I had to finish it in two days I called up a studio I went from Fun Lovin Criminals session at Magic Shop right to Platinum Island They had a shower there  I took a shower there to wake up I stayed up I finished the record and got on the album 36 hours straight of work and I reaped the benefits I dont know if I could do that now I was under the gun you know but I got the song on 8 Mile MUHAMMAD You know what I love about that is people they get this kinda like fantastical idea of how to be successful But theres a lot of dedication and sacrifice that you make when you do that You could have just been like Yo Im really tired and I just want to go rest But the flip side of that is you didnt and look what happened And the other aspect of that which I think discourages a lot of people is that you still make that sort of sacrifice and you dont reap the benefit the reward of it immediately ROSS Right Thats the good side of that MUHAMMAD Yeah thats the good side ROSS So theres lots of times when I was in my own studio til 5 in the morning the suns coming up and Im chopping up a loop or Im doing this or that or mixing down a demo that never went anywhere MUHAMMAD But you have to  I think at least  be in it to be in it ROSS One hundred percent Youre not gonna get the home run unless you know you get up to bat 2 million times and strike out I dont know anyone who constantly wins And my approach to producing records was always very blue collar anyway You know I never wanted a Bentley Its not my aspirations and I just dont look at the world that way Its not what revolves my world or my want for it For me the ultimate result is the tangible great song or great album Whether Im the AR guy or the producer I like that tangible piece of art that I can be proud of And if I do that enough times Ill reap the benefits But Ive never done it so I could live the fabulous life Copyright 2014 NPR,20141104,guns

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2014/10/30/360129727/the-many-new-voices-of-taylor-swift?ft=3&f=,As the White Queen of a pop realm in which stars are the chesspiece avatars moving on the other side of each fans evershifting looking glass Taylor Swift has been able to inhabit many contradictory identities Shes a pretty popular beneficiary of privilege and a champion of the nerd underdog a selfdefined good girl and a boyobsessed tabloid star a music industry savior and to some an embodiment of the low artistic standards todays shiny pop game sets What she is primarily however in the life she actually lives is a songwriter and a musician She writes the majority of her own material plays four instruments and by all indications is the primary architect of her own sound Yet like most women artists through the Top 40s history Swift mostly receives both accolades and damnation for the messages she sends not the way she shapes them within her compositions and recordings This must be somewhat irritating for a woman so clearly devoted to perfecting her techniques A generation has grown up with Swift loving her as an accessible everygirl who understood 15 and 22 and every awkward growth spurt in between like no one since the age of The Shirelles Most of these fans dont sweat the details of how she creates songs they claim as their own Yet her transition from teen star to selfactualized young adult powerhouse has been mostly a musical one Swifts wellpaced movement away from countrybased balladry to more complex electronically oriented often beatdriven productions shows that she is an artist call her a craftsperson if that other word makes you uncomfortable eager to challenge herself Thats the overwhelming message of her new album 1989  not that shes a grownup now or more interested in sex or sick of Nashville or in love with New York 1989 is about Taylor Swift experimenting with new sonic approaches And most of all its about her finding a new voice  actually several new voices which she assumes like new characters while always remaining herself Its worth pausing here to admit that as a singer Swift has always been limited She endured scorn early on for her wobbly pitch and tight nasal delivery Because of her exceptional gift for inflection  the subtle adjustment of words and phrases to suggest moods like doubt hope and intimacy  people have praised her style as conversational The ways Swift sings has always been as important as her lyrics  how she spits out the different between short skirts and tshirts in You Belong With Me or her various attacks on the word ever in We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together make the songs feel particular personal Much has been made of Swifts lyrical attention to detail but those details dont resonate that strongly on the page just compare a line like You gave me roses and I left them there to die to say Joni Mitchells All romantics meet the same fate some dayCynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark caf Swifts songs arent that literary or that wise yet shes still only 24 Theyre touching because the noisecancelling intimacy of her performances and the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures The flexibility and tonal range of Swifts reedy alto expanded through canny use of 21stcentury pop technology is what makes 1989 a pleasurable listen This isnt because she and her topgun producers Max Martin and Shellback Ryan Tedder Jack Antonoff and on one lovely latealbum cut Imogen Heap are processing her vocals to sound bigger or conventionally better If AutoTune is in use here its wellcamouflaged by more other more interesting vocal treatments  the blending of her high note with a ringing compressed backing track on the chorus of All You Had To Do Was Stay the clipped verses on Blank Space clicking with the beat like a gearshift the beautifully wavelike swells of her multitracked vocals on This Love Having played with this kind of cyborgian production on the singles from her previous album Red Swift goes fully prosthetic here in ways that make her singing more emotionally rich not less Shes also playing the mostly friendly rival to her fellow women on top It seems like she almost had a checklist starting with the Robynlike aerobic soul intonation on the otherwise innocuous Welcome To New York 1989 challenges a dazzling variety of female pop singers some past but mostly present As per the albums stated concept  reviving the chromium sheen of the late 1980s which as Molly Lambert noted in Grantland was a ripe time for genredefiers like Swift  moments on 1989 evoke the formerly futuristic synthrock adventures of Sinead OConnor Peter Gabriel or Bruce Springsteen But mostly it sounds like Swift dipping into new methodologies not as an imitator so much as a newly minted studio rat mastering the ropes Blank Space has the Xanax drip of a Lorde song but instead of that singers cool affect Swift injects sarcasm into its verses a good girl gone slightly cynical Bad Blood takes on Swifts alleged frenemy Katy Perry with a bright anthemic chorus but tones down Perrys brass and replaces it with a sassiness that recalls Avril Lavigne a source Swifts mined before on Red I Know Places has Swift trying out Rihannas Caribbean stutter but continually breaking the sultriness with forceful exclamations and reaching choruses Thats How You Get the Girl with its nearly onenote melody and chilly drive explores what a Britney Spears song would sound like with coyness replacing the comeon And Wildest Dreams Swift aims for Lana Del Reys swoon but ends up with a gradual melt  connecting much more gracefully to the intellectuality and sometimes uptight poise that have long been part of her persona In every case what might have been imitation works as her own expressiveness because she always stays herself too retaining that obsessively wellmodulated way of moving through verses and the letting go on choruses thats always made her sound like both a thinker and a declaimer proud to state her truth Swift doesnt take on everyone Shes no diva and she knows she never will be even when shes going fullthroat on many of the albums choruses she doesnt mess with melisma or the sort of technically difficult shading that distinguishes the most vocally adept Instead Swift plays with multitracking subtle looping synthesizer tweaks and wordless embellishments expanding her vocabulary in ways that go beyond words Swifts voice on 1989 doesnt simply stand for the freedom Swift feels as a young woman with enough clout to break the mold that made her so commercially viable its enhancement is that freedom Choosing to work with men whove helped craft other female stars vocal personae  especially Martin so linked to the posthuman performances of Spears  Swift has risked being accused of surrendering her authority In fact these songs show her to be more selfpossessed than ever incorporating her own strengths into the magical soundscape of computerdriven dance pop For all of its verve 1989 is a transitional album for Swift Shes moving toward a form that she can fully own one that allows her to retain the introspection and informality that has always made her music special but which keeps expanding instead of dialing down or always resolving in an easily accessible singalong One of the albums emblems is Out of the Woods credited to Swift Antonoff and Martin Revolving around a classic Swift lyric about romantic uncertainty and the anxiety it produces Antonoffs instrumental track is layered like a pile of autumn leaves elements scatter and pile against each other beats colliding with multiple vocal tracks and other sounds Martin produced Swifts vocal which veers from breathy to determined to confiding to exasperated pushing close its both almost too hot and a bit elusive in its instability Then theres what Swift brings that way of skittishly moving through her memories of scenes with the boy she ultimately lost her ability as a singer to flip through several emotions in one phrase sounding like shes just saying what comes to mind Out of the Woods tell a story about a woman telling herself a story not believing it throwing it away coming back It ponders the creative act of neurotic romanticizing Its also about falling in love with creating And thats the selfdirected love story Taylor Swift deserves credit for now Copyright 2014 NPR,20141030,guns

dusty street Hes a small man in his 50s who runs volunteer patrols The neighborhood is poor The houses are cobbled together out of leftover wood and pieces of metal Two years ago Sandoval says these streets used to be desolate and controlled by gangs They would shoot at each other at all hours Sandoval says Suddenly youd find someone injured someone innocent because they just didnt care The Dimitrov neighborhood in the capital of Nicaragua used to be one of the most dangerous in the country It was so dangerous that its 10 or so square blocks accounted for 20 percent of all the crime of Managua a city of 12 million people But on that day as I walk the narrow residential streets with Sandoval music pours out of open windows and neighbors sit on stoops Sandoval says people in the neighborhood have come to an understanding All that shooting all those deaths they were part of the war we lived he says Now why should we be shooting each other We stop in the middle of the street and see something surprising  children running out of their homes to play in the streets A Region Engulfed By Bloodshed This kind of tranquility is not something youd see in the capital cities of El Salvador Honduras Guatemala or Belize because over the past decade Central America has been engulfed by bloodshed becoming one of the most dangerous regions in the world Nicaragua the poorest of the bunch and with just as bloody a history is one of the safest countries in the hemisphere Analysts say it has to do with its approach to fighting crime While Nicaraguas neighbors have embraced socalled mano dura or iron fist policies Nicaragua has taken a softer approach The Nicaraguan police for example pacified the Dimitrov neighborhood by having the community patrol itself and by having police officers mediate talks between gang members often after soccer games El Salvador and Honduras legislated mano dura policies against youth crimes Guatemala and Belize followed suit but in a more adhoc manner A February 2014 report by the Congressional Research Center finds in that early period those countries incarcerated thousands of young people sometimes just because of their tattoos The report finds that between 2004 and 2005 El Salvador alone sent up to 14000 young people to jail The unintended consequence was that prison gave gangs the time and peace to organize and recruit Pedro Argueta the police commissioner in charge of youth issues says that right now Nicaragua has just 70 juveniles in jail He says the countrys bloody civil war taught them that violence only begets more violence The repression that we had during the 70s taught us a lesson he says That when there is repression there is a reaction Elvira Cuadra who has studied Nicaraguas police force for decades says thats a romanticized version of events She says that many of these policies were actually crafted as political tools Every government agency had a specific role and their primary objective was to defend the revolution she says Its a system that was developed in the 70s when Nicaraguans were preparing for war against the dictatorship Some were instructed to develop emergency treatment centers at their homes while others were given small but important tasks like collecting water After the Sandinista victory in 79 the Cuban model took hold and community organizers became government spies reporting any counterrevolutionary actions to the governments security agency The Sandinistas came back into power in 2007 and a 2009 report from the Managuabased Center For Political Studies and Analysis found that by that point the government had 500288 community volunteers This in a country with a population of a little more than 6 million Cuadra and other human rights groups have expressed concern that the police and even the community volunteers have begun to take on those security roles again Cuadra says thats bound to erode the trust the community has developed with police School Instead Of Prison But despite those criticisms Nicaraguas approach seems to be working The countrys homicide rate is a fraction of what it is in Honduras and while children from El Salvador and Guatemala are streaming north Nicaragua is keeping its youth at home On the hills that surround Managua is Nicaraguas newest youth training center Its a huge campus thats part of a program that sends kids to school

Woman the characterWonder Woman is an Amazon from an island of women who left ancient Greece to escape the enslavement of men And they lived on Paradise Island and had eternal life And a plane crashes on their island carrying a man  and Wonder Womans mother decides he needs to be brought back to where he came from because they can have no men on Paradise IslandSo she stitches for Wonder Woman this starspangled costume and Wonder Woman flies in her invisible jet with her mancaptive Steve Trevor who is a US military intelligence officer back to the United States This is in 1941And she comes to call herself Wonder Woman because she has superhuman powers that only Amazons have She has bracelets that can stop bullets She has a magic lasso  a golden lasso  and anyone she ropes has to tell the truth And shes got the cool jetOn the secret life of Marston and his mistressIts so bizarre I think they thought it was very funny In a certain way it is very funny  like that theyre putting one over on everybody The funniest thing of it all to me is they have this really triangular family arrangement but in the 30s Marstons mistress Olive Byrne takes a job as a staff writer at Family Circle magazine writing advice for housewives Family Circle which starts in 1932 is a giveaway at the grocery store and the stories that she writes are sort of a how to raise your children in the most conventional possible way On how the early suffrage movement influenced Marston Marston has all kinds of ties to the early progressiveera suffrage and feminist and birth control movements  sort of an uncanny number and complexity of ties They begin when he as a Harvard freshman in 1911 is caught up in a big controversy on campus In the fall of 1911 the Harvard Mens League for Womens Suffrage invites the incredible Emmeline Pankhurst to campus to speak in Sanders Theatre which is like the largest lecture hall on campus The Harvard Corporation is terrified  women are not allowed to speak on campus  so eventually  Pankhurst is banned from speaking on campus And this is kind of a big fracas across the countryEven to that alone theres so much in there that reappears in Wonder Woman 30 years later when Marston creates Wonder Woman in 1941  One of the things thats a defining element of Wonder Woman is that if a man binds her in chains she loses all of her Amazonian strength So in almost every episode of the early comics the ones that Marston wrote Marston stopped writing Wonder Woman in 1947 shes chained up or shes roped up  and she has to break free of these chains  Thats what Marston would always say  in order to signify her emancipation from men But those chains are a really important part of the feminist and suffrage struggles of the 1910s that Marston had a frontrow seat forOn the imagery of chains During the suffrage movement women chained themselves to the gate outside the White House in protest There were suffrage parades women would march in chains  they imported that iconography from the abolitionist campaigns of the 19th century that women had been involved in Chains become a really important symbol Women in the wake of emancipation in the aftermath of the Civil War really turn to the imagery of chains and enslavement and the language of enslavement to talk about the ways in which they have not yet been fully emancipatedOn Marston entering the comicbook world Comic books start in 1933 34 and then the first superhero Superman starts in 1938 Batman follows in 1939 but then immediately theres a pretty big crisis around comic books which become scandalous because of their violence and people start wanting to burn them People think theyre bad for kids and that Superman is a fascist and Batman carries a gun for a while  Theres a pretty big wave of critics damning comic booksThe guy who publishes Superman MC Gaines decides he wants to hire someone to help him out and he reads Olive Byrne Marstons lovers story in Family Circle about how William Moulton Marston thinks comic books might be good for kids So he calls Marston into his officeOn a need for a female superhero If you think about the problem with the comic books then Marston says theyre full of bloodcurdling masculinity Thats the problem  that theyre just too violent its the violence but its also the domination The reason why Superman looks like a fascist to some literary critics is hes kind of a demagogue but he also overpowers everybodyIn the shadow of whats going on in Europe the Nazi uprising its very terrifying to imagine kids worshiping this Ubermensch And so Marston says to Gaines Look if you had a female superhero her powers could all be about love and truth and beauty and you could also sell your comic books better to girls And that would be really important and great because she could show girls that they could do anythingOn the Varga Girls inspiration for Wonder Womans costumeThe Varga Girl centerfolds appeared in Esquire in the 1940s  The Varga Girls are really different from earlier conventions of female beauty  Theres a kind of leggy sultry athletic healthy highheeled perky something Theres a kind of cosmopolitanism to the Varga Girls  Theyre not allAmerican they have a kind of exoticism that Wonder Woman has too Shes not supposed to be from the United States and thats kind of a piece of it Theyre wearing the skimpiest possible swimsuitlike costumes  their shirts are always unbuttoned and theyre enticingOn how Wonder Woman is a complex character Wonder Woman is a tangle and its a puzzle kind of like how Lady Gaga is You look at Lady Gaga and youre like Huh what do I think about her You know  Wonder Woman looks like that for me too She didnt look like that when I started but now Im like Shes way more complicated and rich theres no wonder why she has permeated the culture and has lasted so long Theres a lot going on there Copyright 2014 NPR,20141027,guns

New Orleans schools I was in New Orleans to report on how the citys nearly allcharter school system is handling children with disabilities and special needs An old friend a veteran New Orleans reporter told me about a family  a mother and her two youngest sons  whod been badly wounded in a driveby shooting just days into the new school year I met up with Alanna Romain at a recreation league football game at City Park She has five children Her oldest boy plays football On this afternoon the neighborhood Carrollton Saints were getting beaten badly by Christian Brothers Football Fall Cheering Routine stuff in normal times But for Romain these arent normal times Unfortunately when they shot they just shot the whole block both houses At dusk on August 11th another hot summer day was coming to an end Romain says she was getting ready to take her kids to get something to eat Her two youngest  2yearold old Jamal Riley and 5yearold Kyle Romain  were playing in the yard of the nextdoor neighbors house on Burgundy Street in the Lower 9th Ward when a group of heavily armed men rolled up in a car Police believe it was about money and drugs and that the intended target was a man with a criminal record who was dating someone who lived on the block Supposedly they had some kind of problem with him Apparently it was for him But it was too many of them shooting so everyone who was outside got the bullets she says They sprayed the whole area with gunfire Romain still wears white bandages where bullets ripped into her leg and abdomen Kyle and Jamal were both hit in the head A stray bullet sliced into 5yearold Kyles optic nerve The bullet went in his head and came out on the other side his mother says It missed his temple by like half a centimeter So it went behind the eye Thats why hes blind Kyle will now likely have to enter the world of disabilities education of individual education plans and disability law while he and his mother navigate the complex world of New Orleans postKatrina charter revolution Jamal will need a metal plate in his head after a bullet tore up the left side of his cranium So he has staples in right now and a helmet thats holding all together until the plate comes in Romain says In November doctors are scheduled to install that metal plate and try to reattach a piece of Jamals skull Doctors are not yet sure what if any longterm cognitive or other damage Jamal may suffer But Romain says that the righthanded 2yearold is now no longer using his right side much to hold a fork or kick a ball More tests are planned On this night the energetic toddler is running around on the sidelines laughing and with a bright smile Hes wearing a blue helmet to protect his damaged head But it makes him look a bit like a football player as if hes eager to get into the game Like A Regular Child Just after half time 5yearold Kyle sits on his grandmothers lap looking a bit tired and sullen When he was shot Kyle was just a few days into kindergarten at one of the citys public charter schools He liked it his mom says Hes just now starting to ask his mom Will I ever get my sight back Unfortunately I had to be the one to say No not right now You know maybe when we get some more medicine and get some more help youll be able to  But Alanna Romain knows thats not really true Doctors say theres very little chance hell see again  Nearly all of the public schools in New Orleans today are charter schools Historically charters nationally have faced criticism for not doing more to serve and accommodate children with disabilities A lawsuit by the Southern Poverty Law against New Orleans school system charges that children with disabilities are still getting shortchanged in the city A federal judge is currently overseeing mediation to try to settle the case and improve services for specialneeds kids there Jamal may need special help when he enters school in a few years Kyle certainly will Romain wants to see him included in regular classes with sighted children as much as possible I want him you know to be able to feel like hes regular child and not secluded Because eventually he has to face the real world she says Romain says shes thankful that Kyles school part of the KIPP charter chain has reached out to her and offered support and help They really want to get him evaluated and get him back into school she says And they want to get him specialty teachers in the schools to where he can still play and be like a regular child instead of going to a school for the blind with just blind kids Romain says she has flashes of rage at the shooters And pangs of guilt and anger fueled in part by social media commentary questioning why she was in a crimeriddled part of town with little kids You can only live where you can afford and thats where I was living at she says Especially the social media they like to put it out they shouldnt have had that kids in the neighborhood But that doesnt mean we deserve to be shot Police have arrested four suspects in the shooting They face multiple murder and attemptedmurder charges The speedy investigation and arrests which doesnt always happen in New Orleans gives Romain a tiny bit of satisfaction But she worries nothing will really change Theres no hope Its like these little boys are just trigger happy and gun crazy So I would hope New Orleans would clean it up a little better especially with the kids getting hurt But I dont really think they will Copyright 2014 NPR,20141026,guns
NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2014/10/26/357791551/nicaragua-follows-its-own-path-in-dealing-with-drug-traffickers?ft=3&f=,Back in the day the city of Bluefields inspired poets In truth it should be paradise because it sits in an enviable position along Nicaraguas Caribbean coast But as history unfolded Bluefields became a forgotten city cut off from the rest of the country by a vast jungle and different culture As you walk its main street you feel a struggle Utility cables crisscross the streets framing buildings making them look like theyre sagging under the weight of history It rains so much that when paint peels off a piece of concrete it doesnt take long for moss to set in And no matter where you are youre hit by the stench of open sewers Eight out of 10 people in this city are unemployed yet there are stores everywhere and business seems brisk Roberto Campbell a storekeeper whos hanging out on a wooden cart says this place depends fully on the the drug trade Its not no secret Everybody knows that he says in English The big businesses from here if there are no drugs around they cannot sell their articles So when you see things are good that means drugs are around The drug trade is this citys blessing and its curse Its a city thats part of a country that has managed to remain relatively peaceful despite being in one of the most dangerous regions in the world Analysts say one of the explanations for that relative peace is that Nicaragua has taken a different approach to fighting drug trafficking Whether by circumstance or choice it has foregone its neighbors military approach for a less confrontational  and some would say more opportunistic  strategy Its an approach that has helped the country avoid the kind of violence that makes international headlines but also suggests an uncomfortably close relationship between the people the government and the drug dealers Back in 2012 the citizens of Bluefields took to the streets to protest the arrest of a notorious kingpin News footage showed hundreds of people marching around demanding justice and freedom The government alleged that Ted Hayman was involved in the drug trade so they confiscated his home  a huge gaudy structure in the hills surrounding Bluefields Donald Byers who runs a museum about this regions history says Hayman was Bluefields Pablo Escobar the Colombian drug lord who pumped his drug money into his hometown economy There were entire neighborhoods that were on Haymans payroll so when he and a couple dozen of his deputies were imprisoned the economy essentially collapsed That Christmas you could feel Bluefields wasnt the Bluefields that I know Byers says You could feel a big difference You could see a lot of people with no work on the street People were complaining This damn government Its just messing up They dont give us work This guy came and give us work and now they put him in jail Byers says when the clock struck midnight and Christmas Eve turned into Christmas there were no fireworks like previous years Instead it was quiet it was sad The Management Of Crime On the surface it seems like the Nicaraguan government is doing quite a bit to fight the drug war and that Bluefields is a place of perdition But reality is more complicated Nicaragua  the largest country in Central America  has a lengthy coastline on the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea With its remote location Bluefields is well placed to serve as a pit stop along the corridor where drugs travel from the South American producers to US consumers Whats more the cocaine moving through Nicaraguas territory represents a higher share of GDP than any other Central American country which in the words of the UNs Office on Drugs and Crime should give traffickers greater leverage to both sow more corruption and foment violence Instead like the rest of Nicaragua Bluefields is an outlier For instance its murder rate is relatively low According to numbers compiled by the Mexican think tank The Citizen Council for Public Security and Penal Justice San Pedro Sula in Honduras is the murder capital of the world with a homicide rate of 169 intentional homicides per 100000 people Belize City has a murder rate of 105 According to Nicaraguan government data Bluefields has a homicide rate of 42  just a touch lower than that of Detroit Before 2006 when Mexicos former President Felipe Caldern declared a war on drugs none of this mattered But as Mexico squeezed its cartels at home the violence moved south in a big way transforming Central America from a passive transit route to a central theater in the war on drugs Honduras El Salvador Guatemala and Belize responded by fighting fire with fire militarizing their response with funding and training from United States under a new scheme called the Central American Regional Security Initiative CARSI Nicaragua partly because of its cold relationship with the United States was mostly shut out of that funding and chose a different path In private government officials will tell you that Nicaragua does what it can It goes after local kingpins like Hayman because it doesnt have the navy or air force to go after the big drug dealers that are inevitably moving large amounts of drugs across Nicaraguan territory Roberto Orozco an expert on Nicaraguan security believes however that this is a deliberate strategy Nicaragua administers manages its organized crime Orozco says He says that countries like Honduras and Guatemala have at different points tried to do the same thing but there is one huge difference In Nicaragua there is no turf war Because in Nicaragua there is only one mafia Orozco says And that mafia controls the entire national territory When asked who that mafia is Orozco laughs nervously delivering a roundabout answer before finally saying When I say that Nicaragua manages organized crime I mean that the business deals are made with representatives from the state In other words Nicaragua essentially regulates the drug trade Jose Miguel Cruz a professor at Florida International University who wrote his dissertation on what he calls Nicaraguan exceptionalism in matters of security explains it like this People in the government know that the drugs are crossing there But as long as they dont generate too much violence and too much conflict and disrupt the social order they can just pass Cruz says that explanation makes sense but there is no smoking gun to point to that kind of relationship between Nicaragua and the cartels Two members of the Nicaraguan government denied those kinds of allegations in interviews But theyre also not new The United States Embassy in Managua made much the same claims in a secret 2006 diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks The cable alleges that President Daniel Ortega and his party used money from international drug traffickers to finance political campaigns As the US cable explains its a relationship that dates back to the 80s when Ortega cut a transit deal with Pablo Escobar The Drug Enforcement Agency placed hidden cameras on one of Escobars planes and they caught highranking Nicaraguan officials loading cocaine onto the aircraft When pressed Jacinto Suarez the governing partys international secretary laughs off the allegations and points out that Nicaragua seizes tons of cocaine each year Then growing angry he says if the world wanted to fix the drug problem the United States should look to its own people first Were the ones dealing with all of the dead people and all of the fighting yet the consumers the ones who provoke the phenomenon are the ones who also decide who is doing a good job combating drugs Suarez says Thats why some leaders have said Lets legalize this and let the drugs flow north Because if we dont the gringos are going to keep swallowing drugs while we kill each other Pirates Prowl For White Lobsters The small wooden boats start heading out to Bluefields Bay even before the sun rises As it peaks from the horizon the water is dotted with men trying their luck on the ocean Jos Ral Snchez a 36yearold fisherman who has spent most of his life out at sea says hes out here nearly every day He says hes had opportunities to make money from the drug trade but hes never done so People will kill you for a kilo he says On the other side of Sanchezs boat his nephew gathers a net The lead weights drag against bottom of the boat Slowly with the patience and skill of an old lady praying a rosary he runs the net through his fingers putting part of it in his mouth Then with a single movement he throws Out here its so quiet you can hear the nylon cut through the air Suddenly past the mangroves in the expanse of open ocean we hear the roar of big engines Sanchez says those are the pirates the guys on bigger boats who go looking for white lobsters or kilos of cocaine thrown overboard by drug traffickers trying to escape from authorities He says when the pirates get their hands on a packet whole neighborhoods benefit It presents a stark choice to all of Bluefields embrace the drug trade or live in deep poverty Sanchez says hes seen the damage that drugs have caused young people so he decides to stay above the fray I have a son and I would not want him involved in that he says In a lot of ways the Nicaraguan government faces some of the same tough choices Take on the drug trade with military might the way Honduras and El Salvador have done and risk greater violence or accept corruption and allow the drug trade to operate As Orozco the Nicaraguan security expert sees it the government has chosen the lesser of two evils The governments approach is much better because we avoid the kind of extravagant crime you see in places like Mexico he says where they hang a dozen people off an overpass To some extent the kind of policies Nicaragua has chosen have started to gain traction internationally In 2011 The Global Commission on Drugs a highprofile panel of world leaders  including former UN SecretaryGeneral Kofi Annan and former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker  declared that the global war on drugs has failed And this September the commission followed up with a report recommending policies that work including some legalization and encouraging countries to try regulating instead of prohibiting some aspects of the drug trade Orozco worries however that Nicaraguas relative peace is tenuous The economic incentive for cartels to control this territory is huge So how long he asks will it be before the Nicaraguan governments sole control is challenged by a wellheeled wellarmed cartel with little to lose This story was funded with a grant from the Ford Foundation administered by the International Center for Journalists Copyright 2014

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2014/10/25/356989245/beautiful-you-makes-sex-and-death-boring?ft=3&f=,At first I wanted to write this review of Chuck Palahniuks new book Beautiful You as a letter A lament really from a former fan and dedicated Palahniuk loyalist to the author who brought Fight Club to the page like he was writing in fire Because I am a man and because I was once a younger man I loved Fight Club for its apocalyptic depiction of the wasteland of modern masculinity and its viciously smart skewering of consumer and service culture I read Choke and liked it Less than Fight Club but still Read Lullaby too And Rant and Haunted And liked them all less than I did Choke But I wanted to tell Chuck that Id maintained the faith Even as more books came out some of which I just plain skipped he was to me still the guy who wrote Fight Club And I went into Beautiful You like a lapsed Catholic wandering into a church after too long away hoping to feel once more the old magic The joy of connection I wanted to tell him that I didnt That I am a smart guy  well read and fully schooled in the twists and tricks of modern literature  so it wasnt that I didnt get what he was trying to do It wasnt lost on me that he was attempting satire engaging in a bit of reductio ad absurdum and playing with the tropes of chick lit erotic fiction brand porn soap operas and thirdwave feminism No I was completely aware of what he was trying to do Painfully aware really So I wanted to remind him that veiled satire needs at minimum two things to succeed First a veil however thin Second it has to actually be satire and not just 200 pages of telling everybody on earth how dumb they are Beautiful You is the story of Penny Harrigan and C Linus Maxwell  known occasionally as ClimaxWell for reasons that Palahniuk will never allow you to forget Penny is a deliberately lazy caricature of a plain Midwestern girl who goes to New York to become a lawyer and live the promise of her skindeep feminism Shes a little heavy Eats too much ice cream Cant pass the bar so is still fetching coffee at a highpowered Manhattan law firm Loves shoes she cant afford Blah blah BridgetJonesFromOmaha blah Maxwell is a tech billionaire cold and robotic known for serially dating actresses and politicians He begins bland but slightly charming ends bland but blandly evil Bet you can guess what happens right He and Penny end up dating kinda because thats just what happens in everything from fairy tales to 50 Shades Of Grey A Cinderella story but with a lowly legal associate and a tech billionaire Satire But then things just get weird And by weird I mean stupid Everyone take a deep breath  Maxwell uses Penny to perfect a line of sex toys  a line called Beautiful You There follows a lot of rolling around and moaning and highly complicated masturbation described in ridiculously clinical terms Deftly she compressed his seminiferous tubules in order to suppress spermatogenesis because only the dim read erotic novels and the easiest way to mock the dim is to use big words right Chuck Max then dumps Penny releases his sex toys onto the market and almost immediately every woman in the world buys them locks themselves in their bedrooms and refuses to come out Palahniuks women are all singleminded All they care about are the orgasms their husbands could never give them And now that they can do it themselves  bringing themselves to multiple occasionally comainducing occasionally deadly climaxes impossible before Beautiful You  they abandon their careers their families their lives and seek nothing but endless pleasure I mean ladies amiright Palahniuks men dont fare any better All of them are at a loss without their wives andor mothers They wander the streets unshaven unable to tie their own ties desperate to find some woman to cook dinner for them And seriously this only takes us to about the halfway point Im not even telling you about the 200yearold sex witch who lives in a cave in the Himalayas like a castoff character from an abandoned Tom Robbins novel or the various rape scenes or the nanobots or the vagina lasers In defense of the book I will say that it did gain a kind of manic ridiculous overthetop energy in the final scene when Palahniuk as though proving that everything before had been rationally restrained just goes for broke with sendups of fantasy novels all fairy tales apocalyptic fiction and courtroom dramas There are flaming sex toys used like mortars evilgenius monologues a gasping death scene and more ironic exclamation points than I have ever witnessed used in one place But it was all too late By that point I just wanted the book to be over And now I just cant write that letter  because with Beautiful You just a distasteful and thoroughly insulting cheapshot memory I can no longer make myself care enough about Chuck Palahniuk to bother Jason Sheehan is an exchef a former restaurant critic and the current food editor of Philadelphia magazine But when no one is looking he spends his time writing books about spaceships aliens giant robots and ray guns Tales From the Radiation Age is his newest book Copyright 2014 NPR,20141025,guns

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2014/10/24/358471568/an-admiring-and-unflinching-look-at-mr-dynamite?ft=3&f=,Eight years after his death James Brown is suddenly everywhere Get On Up a feature film on the legendary singers life was released this year along with three books and some new music And on Monday HBO debuts Mr Dynamite The Rise of James Brown a documentary with an admiring yet unflinching look at one of musics most influential figures Brown remains one of the primary architects of soul RB rap and funk music a legend whose performances were so powerful one of his many nicknames was Mr Dynamite The new film traces the singers career through the words of authors musicians and former employees Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger who produced HBOs documentary and Get On Up also talks about his friend He liked big bands he liked a big horn section and he liked instrumentals says Jagger who also admits in the film that he adopted some of his signature onstage dances from Browns moves He liked arranging  He liked to be a bandleader But the films most authoritative voices are the men and women who played in Browns bands Trombonist Fred Wesley who eventually cowrote hits like Hot Pants was a hardcore jazz musician when he first considered joining Browns band in the 1960s I didnt even listen to James Brown back then says Wesley who admits he broke up a band he was playing with because several members wanted to play Browns hit Cold Sweat a song he hated I used to hear him in the background screaming and carrying on In fact me and my boys in Mobile we used to call him that little screaming hollering sissy you know We just said that in passing didnt even listen to what was happening Speaking to NPR one day after seeing a screening of Mr Dynamite Wesley was unapologetic about his tough comments in the film I have to tell it like it is he says When I say James Brown is the greatest entertainer of all time he really is But not a nice person  Hes not a person you want to sit down and hang out with In fact hes the most boring person in the world because all he talks about is himself To hear more about the stories in Mr Dynamite I invited Wesley to sit down with his good friend Christian McBride in NPRs New York studios McBride who also appears in the film is a superstar jazz and pop bassist whos worked with Chris Botti Sting and Pat Metheny and hosts the new public radio program Jazz Night in America In 2006 McBride once organized a jazz concert featuring Brown at the Hollywood Bowl The two got along then but the bassist still remembers an earlier runin with Brown who criticized first McBrides solo record  which had a tune heavily influenced by Browns sound When I got my first good cussingout from Mr Brown  I dont know if you remember this Fred but I called you because I was so devastated McBride says to Wesley James Brown said Son you aint got no talent You cant play no bass I called Fred and told him what happened and he said Aw man that happened to me every day Mr Dynamite recounts how Brown was abandoned as a kid by his father and mother and raised by an aunt who ran a brothel After a stint in jail he got together with longtime sideman Bobby Byrd and began developing his sound progressing from segregated clubs on the chitlin circuit to crossover hits for white audiences He had a soulful voice amazing dance moves and tireless work ethic But Wesley says one of the keys to Browns sound was picking the right musicians It was the individuals that were in the band that made the music he says James Brown he was the one that made us play it he did make you play it But guitarist Jimmy Nolen had a style saxophonist Pee Wee Ellis all of these guys It was what it was because of these individuals On the other hand Brown sometimes hired worldfamous session players like the Brecker Brothers and Steve Gadd to record select songs Wesley says that on those occasions Brown wouldnt come into the studio to add his vocal parts until the rest of the tracking was done I think he was afraid Wesley says I hate to say it like that but I think he was afraid of excellent musicians The film also suggests that Browns personal history made it tough for him to trust other people especially musicians In our conversation McBride asks Wesley about that relationship directly I remember reading or hearing you say somewhere that James Brown had a real tough time distinguishing someone being influenced by him as opposed to stealing from him he says Thats true Wesley replies noting that Brown cloned songs he felt were based on his sound including David Bowies hit Fame which became the James Brown single Hot I Need To Be Loved Loved Loved I would do everything he said but when he asked me to copy Wesley says sounding disappointed that such an innovative musician would ask for derivative work Copy that he said because they copied me Brown could also be abusive In the documentary drummer Melvin Parker talks about pulling a gun on Brown to stop him from hitting Parkers brother Maceo Then Parker says this I really loved the guy But I could never say to him Hey man I love you man Because he had a way of taking advantage of that Melvin didnt love James Brown Wesley says sparking waves of laughter from McBride Its impossible for Melvin to ever love James Brown You can appreciate him you can admire him I dont see how you can love him because hes a mean person Hes very mean By the late 1960s Brown had become a strong voice on civil rights writing songs about black pride and briefly giving up his pressed slickedback hairstyle for a natural afro HBOs film even includes rare footage showing a crucial moment during a 1968 concert in Boston when Brown calmed the restless crowd after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr We are black dont make us all look bad Let me finish doing the show Brown says in the clip to the restless crowd who had begun streaming onstage after the singer stopped police from throwing them off Now I asked the police to step back because I figured I could get some respect from my own people Dont make sense Now are we together or are we aint Seconds later fans had voluntarily left the stage and Brown raised his hand to start the band again Growing up in 1970s Philadelphia McBride says he saw respect for Browns leadership and status in the black community within his own home Particularly in my parents generation James Brown was much more than just a vocalist he said I would hear them tell stories They would save all these Jet and Ebony magazines James Brown spoke at this city council meeting James Brown has this to say about schools If black people had done like he said the world would be a much better place  thats the way he really feels about it says Wesley who continually refers to Brown in the present tense as if he were still alive If everybody had followed him like he wanted them to  you wouldnt have all this blackonblack crime you wouldnt have gangs and stuff like that I think he was disappointed when he felt that his singing and dancing didnt earn him that kind of respect The film doesnt show Browns decline in later years including arrests and jail time And there are no interviews with family members who have fought over his estate since his death in 2006 Wesley says the films real value comes from showcasing Brown in his prime You saw James Brown doing some stuff that he hadnt done in years he says I tell people all the time You have not seen James Brown until you see him really get down like he did in the 60s you know Indeed Mr Dynamite is a fitting reminder of the singers power and influence the story of an artist whose rise mirrored the journey of black America from segregation to success Copyright 2014

just spread the word on it communicated that it was somewhat difficult or confusing to have two Tips in one building So out of respect and just the legendary reputation and career that preceded that situation I definitely conceded My problem or conflict at the time was now this is what Ive been called all my life what do I change my name to KELLEY Right TI So I guess that began to hold my project up What are we gonna call him You know what Im saying So at that point we had to come to some sort of a resolution And KP who signed me to LaFace he just said OK look man how about TI Cause on this one record I had it was like TIP I was like Wait a minute wait a minute No That was  you left out a letter still You know what Im saying He was like Well listen man You got something better MUHAMMAD Hes solutionoriented TI No I dont have  I dont have anything better Well thats what we going with man So its kinda how it came about MUHAMMAD Ive been spending the past 25 years calling  not wholly

doesnt like that to be publicly known  but when he became QTip its been Tip forever since high school to now So its like to talk to another Tip  TI Bro You know what And listen man Im gonna tell yall

from the time I was like six to 14 15 MUHAMMAD Whats that like Cause I spent my summers getting sent down south to Virginia North Carolina So it was just you know different seeing grass and trees TI Right Well Im sure we both went back with a little something KELLEY There you go TI You know Im saying I mean me man I just think coming to New York it got  it kinda gave me a different perspective on culture and  you know in Atlanta man it was either you was black or you was white Or other You know what Im saying We didnt have a lot of different cultures We didnt have a lot of different religions We didnt have a lot of  you know what Im saying So to come to a melting pot as a youngster and really see kind of just the differences in what people say about you know how they go to school or how people spend their spare time Like what the culture  how people live their lives in other places Me knowing that it allowed me a certain diversity that contributed to my swag a little later on you know what Im saying And it kinda put me ahead of people Cause they wasnt  people didnt know  really people didnt know about Tribe when I came back to Atlanta Until like you know Bonita Applebum You know what Im saying People didnt really know about BIG I came back and told people about BIG It was the I think the year he was on the Craig Mack remix and he had things that were you know Party And Bullshit and other things that you would have to be in New York to have And I went back to Atlanta with em like Yo this cat coming And of course its like Man psh All I want to hear is Master P You know what Im saying MUHAMMAD Right KELLEY Yeah TI However my epiphany coming making its way into fruition kinda made me an elder statesman and an expert in music MUHAMMAD Thats important though TI You know what Im saying MUHAMMAD We need somebody to understand whats going on TI For sure MUHAMMAD And climbing out there and be able to be the messenger TI But in reverse I tell you something else I came up here with Outkast KELLEY When TI I came up here  nah I didnt come with them  I brought Outkast on a CD up to New York MUHAMMAD OK OK TI When New Yorkers knew nothing of Outkast Back when it was just Players Ball off the LaFace compilation you know what Im saying I came up here and shared that with my player partners that I knew from up here They was like Yo man it aint Jay Z Psh You know what Im saying MUHAMMAD Really TI Ive experienced it on both sides MUHAMMAD The struggle continues TI For sure KELLEY Cause  thats funny Didnt Pharrell once call you the Jay Z of the South TI Yeah he put that pressure on me He did that Pharrell has always been man like a brother partner and just a  an extremely genuine sincere supporter You know what I mean Ever since my very very first album I  KP took me up there and we did not  we knew we couldnt afford Pharrell And I  me being the kind of guy I am I said Hey listen I know you probably came here cause you and KP cool But I know what I got to work with financially and I know what you worth and quite frankly bro I know I cant afford you MUHAMMAD Right TI You know Im saying He was like Man we just gon work man Well deal with that later We let them deal with that I was like Nah nah nah Kinda want to deal with it He just kept telling me Man dont worry man Dont worry Lets just work So we end up working and came up with Panty Pumpin Number One and Im Serious So then Im thinking to myself Which one of these are we gonna keep We cant afford both And Pharrell was a G about it He was like Man we good man MUHAMMAD Just to go back for a moment what was it about the conversation that made you really want to square it away right then and there TI No it wasnt  Im just that kind of guy MUHAMMAD I get that but I think its important you know for people to know that TI Well its like when I walked in here I kinda said OK listen everybody What am I  what are we doing What am I gonna do here I just like to have  understanding is the greatest thing in the world in my eyes man You know confirmation A lot of people leave so much up to chance and so things  leave so much room for later conflict that couldve been avoided had we had confirmation up front handled it from the get go as my grandma used to say MUHAMMAD Very important wise grandmother right there TI But nah man the point is though Pharrell ever since day one and ever since then he has always been an avid supporter And even if it just a phone call to me when Im tripping like Ay yo Remember Remember where you were Remember where you are Respect that You know what Im saying Even stuff like that that you know make me salute him regardless of whats going on in music I know that dude is a genuine sensitive person KELLEY So he has executive produced this album TI Yes he did KELLEY And he produced three tracks on it TI Four KELLEY One of the deluxe edition ones TI No nah Its  we have Paperwork G S Light Em Up and Oh Yeah KELLEY Oh yeah yeah Thats the one Im forgetting OK Yeah TI Im proud of myself for remembering those KELLEY Im impressed TI Being able to rattle em off very eloquently KELLEY So what role did he play in this album Was there any difference in the conversations that you had on this one as opposed to previous  TI Yes KELLEY What was the difference TI Man I think we spoke  like we learned a whole about one anothers approach to music and one anothers application of business when approaching music you know what Im saying Like P is a very very artistic person and he for the most part trusts the people that hes put in place around him to conduct the business However when P has a business idea P has no problem with asserting himself in that manner So me observing as an artist and a person who has to conduct business for himself in music me watching the things he chooses to intercede on and the things he kinda falls back and allows the team to work  you know what Im saying Like that helped me as an artist KELLEY Like the battles he chooses to fight TI Yeah exactly And I think that comes with experience that comes with maturity that comes with you know years of understanding But for him to share that vision with me I think it contributed to my ability to be comfortable enough to go and make a song I may not have made You know what I mean If it was just up to me you know  even though I have executive produced along with the team around me Ive executive produced some hit records and some in the view of many classic material but I havent been pushed to the point where I was challenged to where I was like Man I dont know if I should do this And I feel like working with Pharrell allowed me to do that And he was I guess compromising enough to really find ways as a producer to add elements of what I do in the even most out of comprehensive ideas You know what I mean He even  no matter how left field he went he still added something in there that was from what I do MUHAMMAD What song out of all the songs  cause you guys have done a lot together  what song was the song that you felt that he really really pushed you harder than any other TI Pushed me harder  MUHAMMAD To go outside of maybe  TI You mean that is the most out of my realm MUHAMMAD Yeah yeah TI On this particular project MUHAMMAD On anything that you guys  just the whole body of work that youve done together TI The record we did on the No Mercy album Get Back Up was one Its another one Make Your Face Fall Off that was also on that The record from my last project with CeeLo Let me see MUHAMMAD What about Make Your Face Fall Off TI It just  MUHAMMAD Its a different  its different TI It wasnt  I would not have chosen that record as a record for me to do I mean I get it but it was a lot more  it sounded a lot like the Clipse You know what Im saying I dont mean it sounded like it but it gave you that vibe of  and for me that record the first Clipse record it was a hit record but for me it wasnt  its not my favorite record that Ive heard by them Ive heard records that even though they werent as big of hits they suited my taste a little more But that particular record  I will say hes been right more times than  oh and Blurred Lines Blurred Lines was another one Blurred Lines was a record man Pharrell said Hey look I just need you to do this Just do it You know what Im saying Kind of like Man just do it for me Just do it I was like Man Aight man Cmon Cmon man Lets do it MUHAMMAD Trust and friendship go  I think that helps the situation a little bit huh TI Yeah I will say hes been right more times than I have I will say that KELLEY We spoke to Pusha when he put out My Name Is My Name in the fall And the way he talked about working with Pharrell was  he said that he just got a phone call  I think he was in the middle of SXSW and it was all crazy  and Pharrell called him up He was like Listen I have an idea for a song And it was SNITCH And that was like  that made Pusha get realer than he had been in the past Is there any content pushing happening between you guys TI Yeah  well not pushing It was  I mean he definitely challenges you He finds out what your strengths are and he applies that to your weaknesses You know what Im saying To me he pushes me kinda in a sense  so he was like Yo you are the voice of this part of the generation You are todays Tupac You are todays Ice Cube You represent the person that came from absolutely nothing and made it here Now that you here man do something inspiring MUHAMMAD Is that why you started Oh Yeah by saying P wanted something inspirational but I wanted to say  TI Yeah absolutely Im always on some gangster s man Im always on some gangster s or some cool party s or some laid back chick s P was like Yo  I give you an example man My partner man RIP Doe B  the day that I was in Miami with Pharrell recording Paperwork the song Paperwork December 27 I was telling him about Doe B Cause Doe B was one of the coldest young cats on the up rise And I was telling him Ayo he on fire You need to hear him You need to work with him He was like Cool Get him down here So immediately after  I think we went got something to eat or something  so while we eating I call Doe and Doe  man Doe had told me he had something to do that night but he was gon be able to fly out the next morning So we go and we finish the record I go back to the crib and while Im in Miami doing what people what do in Miami I get a call and they said Man yo Doe just got shot And by the next morning Doe had died So when it comes time to come to the studio Im talking to Pharrell and hes very  he called me enthused and excited about Paperwork cause we knew what it was when we made it And you know hes like Yo do you recognize what we doing You know what we doing right now Man you are crushing it And I was like Yo you remember my homeboy Doe that I was telling you about Yeah yeah hes supposed to  you say hes coming today right Man we going in I was like Listen He dead cuz He say What What do you mean You just talked to him I said Yeah he died He went to the club He got shot He died And so P say Damn And he say  immediately he say Yo we have to record a song about this We got to We have to capture this moment What you doing what I do We have to Its up to us to  and he started talking to me as a like an astute  like a statistician of sorts you know what Im saying Like Yo it is our responsibility  Sort of like like the hero in Armageddon It is up to us to  And I was like Yo for real OK Lets do it then So I went in the studio and we came up with Lighters Up Its in ways like that he kinda took what was my strength which is I guess sharing parts of my life in a way that people can relate to jam to and really be inspired by and he applied it to my weakness which at the time was talking about this very vulnerable part of my life right now So he took my strength applied it to my weakness and thats what we came up with MUHAMMAD I listened to it today It made me cry I actually had to stop listening to the album after that TI Damn Im sorry MUHAMMAD Nah dont If the music doesnt really make you feel then whats the point of doing it TI Yeah MUHAMMAD Theres different intentions in why artists we do what we do but the best I think is when you really can pull an emotion a real emotion out I heard that song and it reminded me of  I mean it was actually not only just that it was so the way you laid it up Cause you know you put the Put It On Doe and then how that began how it ended and how it introduced Light Em Up it was just like a movement And so by time I got to the end of it I had to stop listening to the record and I just walked away and tears were coming out And because similarly when we recorded Scenario everyone was really happy and just like Yo thats  you know feeling really good about it But then  we were in the mode of doing remixes so when we did the Scenario remix there was a guy who was an MC who was around at the time Russell Simmons driver Kenny Lee used to hang around with Tip and just come to sessions check on us He was kind of like an older mentor brother of ours And he had this kid named Hood and he was like Im telling you about Hood Hood Hood So Hood came in dropped a verse He set off Scenario remix and right after that he got outed TI Damn MUHAMMAD So you know  TI Thats a bittersweet celebration MUHAMMAD Yeah So he made it you know a step beyond where your man  but just hearing that story really brought it Im like  what is this We recorded that maybe 91 or something like that Im like wow still 2014 Like this is  hearing your story Im like this is what we still  were still dealing with it And it really was upsetting So to hear you say in Oh Yeah P wanted me to do something inspirational but then youre like I just wanted to be on some F that s I find that your music has always been inspirational And thats an example of it You know when you even say in Oh Yeah Who the people want I feel like you kinda like  tell me when you say Who the people want whyd you say that TI I mean man its a lot to go into For real it was  man its about  and I what we do man we make music that come from the heart that represent the people who we know in the struggle However we must wait on radio to tell us which one of our songs is a hit record We must wait on people to I guess agree with us And when we are the voice of the people we the ones speaking to em so ultimately why dont you let the people decide Who the people want You know what Im saying And that was  that was really my real clear intention And also you just have cats who kind of  man you know they allow themselves to get caught just real caught up in what they have and what they do what theyve done You know what Im saying Like for real if you dont have the respect of people then that means that youre only as good as the things around you the things that you have and the things  cause one day that will be over And then what will you have You know what I mean Who the people want Im a man of the people at the end of the day I feel like I can be put in a glorious position but I want to be here because the people put me here MUHAMMAD I took it sort of like a double entendre like a tongueincheek When you said  when you said Who the people want its like Im giving em that thing that P want and Im giving em that thing that I am TI Right MUHAMMAD You know TI I mean I was talking to P when I said it would deal with the things when I  that I was talking about You know what Im saying That inspired that actual record Like I think he had done left and went to the club  or not to the club He had something he had to go do I believe he went to a Pusha T show if Im not mistaken when we were in Miami recording that record And we had these long  we shouldve recorded these conversations we had We had these long elaborate introspective just  Im talking about like 90minute conversations  KELLEY You trying to be our competition in this podcast game Is that what youre saying TI Nah I mean we wish we wouldve captured it We didnt though We would just sit and debate on what angle like whether its the in your face f you you aint gon try me angle or the Im gon rise above the drama and just continue doing We challenge one another  and we both had valid points I was just like Look P man Listen You come from a different kind of you know  the thing you do is different So you can take that approach and it will be accepted and agreed upon you know Everybody aint able Some of us have to get ours a different way You know what I mean We both right you know But those conversations contributed to the music that you hear MUHAMMAD I want to ask you about a line It wasnt clear to me In Oh Yeah it sounded like you say I would never be here with intellectual rapping What is  what did you say TI Sucka I would never be get hit with intellectual weaponry MUHAMMAD Oh KELLEY What does that mean TI A b I would never be Dont try me like no b Youll get hit with like real sophisticated weapons Youll get hit with sophisticated artillery S you aint seen before That was basically what I was saying MUHAMMAD OK TI It couldve been my Southern accent When I hear what people think I said a lot of times I be like Damn where they get that from MUHAMMAD Nah I mean  TI Im talking like when you see people you know online  you can see when people like your records enough to where they write down the lyrics and post it Im like Man that aint necessarily what I said But cool man Cool Go with it though MUHAMMAD Kinda going backwards  we jumped in a little into the middle of Paperwork The first song Is it titled King Cause I dont think I have a complete listing with all the features and  KELLEY Im not sure theyre the final track names what we have TI Its titled King Yeah it probably is Its titled King and its considered the introduction MUHAMMAD Yeah I feel like it was an introduction and it was like the beginning and the end all in one I was like he couldve  this couldve been the album right here TI A lot of people thought Paperwork shouldve been the first record and King shouldve been the last record but I kinda  MUHAMMAD I think King couldve been the only song on the album TI The only song MUHAMMAD Because it just start off so like Oh s TI That was my angle MUHAMMAD Yeah Just the sound of it musically and just the way you came It was like wow I dont know where its gonna go after this but I feel real good right here It was a complete meal TI Well thank you man I appreciate it My little bro man Mars from 1500 Or Nothin he put the beat together I gave him a record that was  as it was explained to me someone received a demo from a cat who sings in Ireland or Scotland and his name is Garth Gareth something of that nature And he has a song and in this song there was a section in the song that  you know thats him singing So he said Man I heard this record I thought of you Do something with it So I got it to Mars and Mars you know after Mars freaked it he got it back to me I said Oh yeah this is it MUHAMMAD Do you feel that people still come at you Cause you came pretty hard on that song I mean you generally do But it just seemed like this  so many albums in 13 years in the music business strong never delivering anything thats like subpar Im like I dont think TI should ever have to set off a warning shot TI Nah man you know what Im saying I mean  MUHAMMAD What was you thinking about when you made that TI I mean all shots or  everyone who challenges you dont necessarily do it in plain sight You know what Im saying Sometimes you have  you may observe people in a very critical moment with adverse opinions about you when nobody asked them You know what Im saying You may observe from afar people being jealous and really just spitefully negative in your moment of glory when it your time to shine You may take notice of people man really just attempting to covertly disrespect you or challenge your I guess your authority or manhood in whatever way possible And when you see these things  its not meant for you to see but you see em and you know OK you must address these things Its not  I cant just turn a blind eye I aint never been that guy Thats not me You know what I mean I see it I dont like it If its a violation there shall be a demonstration KELLEY And people respond to that cause everybody feels like that TI Sure Just everybody doesnt act on that feeling KELLEY Yeah TI I just choose to act on em KELLEY Mhmhm TI But Im trying to do better Every day I wake up man with a better sense in mind say Hey you know what Im gon let something go today You know what I mean We gon give somebody a pass today I wake up with that mentality Thats how I wake up And then life happens MUHAMMAD Life unfolds in front of you right TI Nah nah I mean its sorta like  it just depends on if you really like catch me at a point in my day where things are going exceptionally well you have a more  you know But as the day happens and you have to carry more of a load every time man Man look I done let too  you know what The buck stops here You are in bad  boy you in trouble buddy I just gave the last pass five minutes ago Now its us Here we are Thats pretty much how it carries out MUHAMMAD Understood KELLEY I feel like that sort of relates to the trajectory of your career and like ways that you have been aggressive or not aggressive or have been presenting a rehabilitated image But where Im most specifically interested in is your work with Andrew Young and the documentary that you guys made Walking With Guns I spoke with somebody named Dr Jocelyn Wilson and she told us that she thought that Andrew Young had a real big impact on you TI Man Ambassador Young is the closest thing  I wont even say the closest Hes my mentor You know what I mean In music I can say DJ Toomp Pharrell KP But I mean as  thats the closest thing to like a father  my father was his age My grandfather still alive My grandfather he taught me all the stuff that I needed to know to become the man of respect with principle and morals Now in order to articulate myself and to really poise myself as a distinguished gentleman until  that was brought to me by Andrew Young My granddaddy fantastic man he taught me everything I needed to know to make it to the point where Andy kind of picked up the baton And I feel like thats the person that I could see myself patterning my evolution after KELLEY Really TI Yeah KELLEY Leadership Political leadership in that way TI I dont know so much as  I dont want to be like mayor I dont want to  I aint trying to run for no office But ultimately even just as a community leader you know what I mean As a social example KELLEY Yeah more like SCLC type TI Yeah but with a  moving in the right direction with an appropriate purpose And I think that given the time where I knock all the dust off my shoulders and I curve out my you know the rough edges the chip that I have on my shoulder when I polish all my granite you know what Im saying I make it to a point where this is you know now this is how I can actually present myself and be perceived KELLEY How do you reconcile those two parts of yourself TI How do I reconcile it KELLEY Past and present TI The past was all necessary in order for me to make it to this point I think that had I made the right decisions before there would have been less adversity less conditioning less pressured examples that contributed to me learning faster You know what Im saying So I learn lessons  I have  the person who falls a lot theyre the best at whatever it is they do If youre a skateboarder you fall more first Then well you end up a better skater because of it So I mean for me man I fell a lot I fell a lot So I should be the first to pop a wheelie KELLEY OK Does Ambassador Young listen to your music Like now Does he  TI Yeah sure Man Mr Young he listens to gospel as well as secular music He doesnt live in a like in a cave You know what I mean KELLEY Yeah yeah yeah TI He tells me what he cares for you know And those of my movies  he tells me I need to stop playing villains in movies You know you should get you one of those good dramas I say Yeah man Ima play you man Ima play you in one Well do your story KELLEY Yeah Thats not a bad idea TI And he tells me things that he appreciates the most you know KELLEY OK I really think that not enough people know that connection TI Man Ambassador Young man hes a magnificent human being I think that of course not a lot of people know exactly of all his attributes and benefits to  MUHAMMAD To helping To where we are today TI In the modern era Yeah Im just proud and grateful and humbled by him taking the time out  you know what Im saying  to take wisdom to shed a light on me You know what I mean KELLEY Mhmhm TI And he did it in like one of my darkest moments back when I caught my case He really kinda  he took time to explain what was happening and why you know Cause of course its easy to resent the situation and its easy to excuse your wrongdoing Its easy But for me to make it to a point that I was at when I was able go speak to kids and accept  hold myself accountable That came from conversations with him I was very bitter You know what Im saying I was very like  I was extremely dark Ambassador Young took the time to kind of explain like Listen This is  you gotta understand You know He gave me experiences and just insight that I could relate to And I rationalized my circumstances at that point and after I rationalized my circumstances I was able to cope a little bit better MUHAMMAD Is it through that experience of  Ill call it ups and downs just for the moment  and being surrounded by someone like that is that sort of like motivation for a song like New National Anthem In that song youre painting  youre showing youre highlighting similarities and differences of what I think America is calling as like acceptable and  things that we get behind we rally behind  and these other aspects of life we dont You know its highly ridiculed highly prosecuted Kids selling drugs highly ridiculed highly prosecuted Politicians breaking laws using their influence not so  TI Not so highly ridiculed not so heavily prosecuted MUHAMMAD Yeah so why do you think that its that way TI Habit KELLEY Yeah TI I mean man I think its habit man I think at some point somebody in power and influence over the state of this nation  at some point they figured out that they could do the right thing and face hardships and pain and have adversity Or they could cut some corners and do it the easy way and have a similar outcome They chose to cut some corners and do it the easy way And that influence trickled down and over time it became habit so people said Man why waste time going through all this adversity to do it the right way when you can get more doing it the easy way You just gotta be willing to cut  Shhh Dont tell nobody Over time here we are Thats what happens to just put it in a nutshell Thats my opinion MUHAMMAD So why make a song Why did you make the song TI I was inspired by the moments you know what I mean It seems like every year sometimes twice a year its just moments that you feel like Man this s is fed up and it aint getting no better Then even more so its just like more blatant displays of I dont give a fu about you I dont care about you Youre here Fine But you run nothing You will not threaten or intimidate us Or there will be  violation demonstration And so I mean s when you see that when you faced with that so much of course youre gonna be motivated to  artistic expression thats how I speak And then I think that it makes  if you cant really really say it out loud you cant rationalize it You know what I mean So saying it out loud is just me coming to terms with something that I know I have to develop an understanding for If Ima change it I got to understand it KELLEY I think I can see your platform already I mean I know youre not trying to go for political office TI No If I do that guess what All this stuff gon be pulled up on me All of these statements and that And so I dont really know man I have a very very limited  my running is limited as far as how  what I can do MUHAMMAD Dont say that I dont believe that KELLEY It should be  it should be gun control TI Yeah Secretary of Defense KELLEY Alright Fine MUHAMMAD I dont believe where you going Only because I think that were at a state in history where everyones challenges and adversities are exposed And its not that were more numb to it Its just were more real TI Right MUHAMMAD Like were at a state where theres not going to be any other president whos gonna say  except if I was elected for president  that never smoked marijuana you know what Im saying Ive never smoked marijuana in 44 years of life But Im just saying were at that stage where whatever it is that we feel may be the thing that not get a person elected or have people be like Oh Im not interested in him The stage that were in historically theres not much you can really do to shock the nation into you know into you not being a viable leader especially if you have in the scales of balance weighed it out with other things Its like Oh yeah I could see  TI I think even at its finest moment it will relate to who can hide these things more and who will have the most available to the public I have the most available to the public So whoever Im running against is gonna say Yeah Check him out here And Im cool with it My answer to that would simply be I am not ashamed of my past but I am very proud of my future KELLEY Sounds like youve been practicing TI Well nah I mean it just comes to me It does KELLEY Well have you ever  so I wanted to ask you about  you have said that sort of the blessing and the curse of the Internet is that like people can just come out before theyre ready And they can be judged before theyre ready or not And so I wanted to ask you about what your grooming media training waiting until youre ready what that process was like TI Its hard to put into words KELLEY OK TI Its a lot Thats a heavy  its just a lot Cause its things creatively in music and then its things in business Cause a lot of artists especially new ones right now they dont expect to work They dont expect to have to do anything to contribute to the success of their project They just want the red carpet  I got signed Now what You know what I mean I think that just knowing that like talent should not be something that takes away the need for you to think you have to work hard you know what Im saying So I mean I just try to make sure the cats can push themselves to be as dope as they possibly can be You know carry themselves like a reputable upstanding human being and work hard KELLEY When you were young and you  what type of  did you have any sort of understanding that decisions that you made then would curtail possibilities in your future TI At the time KELLEY Yeah TI No Nobody young considers consequence Nobody You know what I mean Nobody does Until youve experienced enough of it to where you say Yo My life has gotta get better than this At least now I know Yo man I need to stay away from things that can contribute to the  Its just that the business that Im in its a business that kinda puts me in the elements of you know certain risk factors Therefore I got to poise myself a certain way KELLEY Yeah TI Simple as that You put me in Hollywood and you let me do movies all year and Im not really working on going to clubs and I aint gotta promote no albums and I aint gotta  now my element has changed My environment has changed I can kick back man you know what Im saying This is not the element for aggression and hostility So I can hang my aggression and hostility on the door Pick it up when I need it KELLEY Yeah TI But its just right now my element my environment man that it take from me to really maximize the benefit of my material I got to get out here and touch the people And that process it kind of  it gives me  it puts me in the line of fire when it come to avoiding trouble But I understand I have to find ways to over time phase out of that because I aint really  the consequence overwhelms the benefit at that point KELLEY Right TI But it took me getting older to understand that KELLEY Yeah Like everybody else And to go back to Light Em Up part of what makes that song so heavy is  I mean are you thinking like that couldve been you TI I mean well the only certain thing we have in life that we know when were born is that well die KELLEY Yeah TI Thats it I mean it always couldve been me It couldve been a long time ago When I made Live Your Life it couldve been me KELLEY Yeah TI You know what Im saying It was closer to being me then than with Doe But theres definitely a  theres something in me that  you know how they say womens clock is ticking Like I feel like my clock is ticking The clock for you to get in trouble man is ticking You need to phase out of that fast I recognize that So I have to  now this is the part of my career where I begin to change my environment MUHAMMAD So then is that  did you feel that way going into at least making this album Like the clock is ticking and there has to be something different I ask that because it sounds like  for example I Dont Know I dont think its scripting out a future but it poses a question TI Sure it does MUHAMMAD So is that one of the motivating factors like clock is ticking TI Absolutely I know for a fact  and see when I make records like I Dont Know a lot of time people think that its a script or a detailed elaborate explanation to a future action But really Im doing this  Im going through the trouble of saying it out loud so I can hear the absurdities in it and I can you know I can help myself better Hearing  this me talking like Im talking to myself and at some point saying OK now listen Does that sound rational OK then You know Im saying But at the same time what you get out of it is a jammingass song You know what Im saying MUHAMMAD Absolutely Its therapeutic TI Its therapeutic as well as you get added intangible benefits MUHAMMAD Yeah TI Shock value dont hurt you MUHAMMAD Well in thinking about  cause Cedric even mentioned this  in thinking about Tupac and some of the things that Pac spoke about that seem prophetic just hearing you make that statement about  TI Im not  sheesh Pac was  man Pac was very  he was profound with his scripting of the future I dont think Ill ever reach that level of it I mean I hope not to be so profound MUHAMMAD To that degree TI You know what Im saying Thats one thing I hope not to  but I mean at the end of the day man if thats Gods plan for me Ima carry mine like a man wherever it takes me MUHAMMAD Im not saying it in that regard I see a lot of light in the situation only because youre  TI Right on As you should MUHAMMAD Yeah I do I do TI Thank you MUHAMMAD Youre  for the kids that come from the economicallychallenged cities in New York or Atlanta or Chicago or Los Angeles you are them And they can look at you and hear someone like you And be a guide You know that beacon that just get them out of the situation Or at least bring some clarity To even hear you say You know what Im talking to myself Like people are considered crazy who do that but thats not insanity thats clarity Especially if you  in doing it with an intention of just saying OK lets see what happens after that And I think people need to hear that you know So I dont  I see it as being  you and your art  as being light TI Right on I appreciate that man Thank you And if any of it if any of this stuff can you know help some of those kids in those cities avoid their darkest hour then I mean it was worth it So I appreciate that MUHAMMAD I like the way you round out  like this album is rounded out You got your knowledge  well you got your First of all hold on Im setting it off like this in case any MC or anyone else forgot what it really is I like the way you set it off like that But then theres balance You bring it back to a little  I dont know if its necessarily political even though its called New National Anthem  but theres the political the conversation of what were dealing with This is modern day social studies class right now And then you got your songs for your ladies  and theres some extreme songs for the ladies I have to  KELLEY Why are you looking at me right now I am appreciative of those songs I am not mad at those songs MUHAMMAD I know thats why Im looking at you cause  TI I would like to excuse myself for one moment MUHAMMAD I was just saying that I think the album you rounded it out really well TI Thank you MUHAMMAD And the song for the ladies Yes I was looking at you Frannie because you always pick up  like you seem to really like these type of songs KELLEY My bad TI What song was it What song KELLEY What is the name of the Chris Brown one TI Oh its Private Show KELLEY Private Show TI You should like that song Its made for her to like You should like it KELLEY Thank you TI Youre welcome Nah man my definite intention with that was  and forgive me but Im from Atlanta  so I just kinda feel obligated to make at least one strip club record You know what Im saying And that one  that just made its way to being it MUHAMMAD Job well done TI Thank you And Chris man Chris man He contributes in a way that I  I cant begin to describe the effect that Chris got on the ladies Thats probably why she liked the song KELLEY Thats not why I like the song TI Man you know and Usher as well man The record I did with Usher  Usher whos a personal partner of mine man  we went in and did like four or five different records and you know kinda lended itself to the idea of doing a tour doing a bigger project together which we will explore later whenever the time is right  KELLEY Yes TI But he made a contribution that I cant begin to describe either man Dudes like extremely poised talented you know what Im saying I try to surround myself with cats who have the potential to be or have proved themselves to be superstars I just feel like  and the people who nobody else can deal with you know what Im saying The people who cant nobody else relate to cant nobody else deal with em I like those people Because they too honest for most ears So I appreciate that in a person KELLEY So which category does Young Thug fall into then TI Man he in both of them Hes a superstar and hes probably one of the most difficult people that Ive ever met I mean not for me Because for me he my partner and we dont have no problems never have But I observe the way he  like the way things kind of transpire And hes a very very difficult meticulous talented just extremely creative individual MUHAMMAD Well I hope that the channel between the two of you is open enough for him to receive anything that you tell him TI It does but everything  my growth took time you know what Im saying I cant expect somebody to get everything I got in a day MUHAMMAD Absolutely not TI So just make sure you pick up a little as you go Pick up a little as you go And over time man itll come together But its something that is there that you should not change You know what saying Focus on that right now cause thats whats certain And then the rest of it  as you see the need to make adjustments just be willing to make adjustments And he aint no fool man MUHAMMAD Yeah you can tell that KELLEY No were big fans Weve been trying to get him to come up here We would love to talk to him TI Woowee Good luck KELLEY We would go down to talk to him TI Yeah man I mean  KELLEY I know Good luck is fine TI Nah man nah I wont say that I wont say that Thug man once you meet him if he say he gon do it he gon do it MUHAMMAD Yeah OK Yeah Im looking forward to  I hope we  it happens Like early on I think I shocked Frannie when I was like Yo I want to talk to Young Thug She was like What KELLEY I was like Who stole Alis phone MUHAMMAD This was like  KELLEY It was Stoner It was right when Stoner hit TI Word MUHAMMAD Yeah it was right when Stoner dropped and my boy  I was in LA and he just was playing it nonstop and I was like  I was offended that I didnt even know what this was And watching him man he goes hard And I just like Yo who is this He was like Yo this Young Thug You should know about this At first I thought it was a joke and then I was like Nah this dude passionate right here Like I want to talk to him So you know hopefully  TI Thugga man Thugga thorough He probably one of the most creative cats of the new generation man He has a chance to lead the charge Hes the first person that I heard Ill say that made me not care about the fact that I dont understand what youre saying Usually like new artists Im like What is he  I dont want to hear this I cant understand it You know what Im saying But Thugga I saw skill in what he was  and I knew he was saying something I just didnt understand it But as I was getting to listen to it and I have a better sense of understanding I have a better  you know what I mean KELLEY We all have had to acclimate our ears to him TI Right But hey you know what In my research right remember we didnt understand everything Bone ThugsnHarmony was saying MUHAMMAD True TI We didnt know what they were saying MUHAMMAD True It just felt so good TI We didnt understand everything  who knows every word to a James Brown song MUHAMMAD I dont KELLEY Valid point Well he made up words there so  TI You know what Im saying So I mean I felt like at some point man you gotta give credit where credits due and stop really trying to force things into whatever box you feel is appropriate and  KELLEY All those people have crazy hooks too Thats what it is with him TI Yeah But I think that he got an enormous amount of talent and potential I cant wait to see what he does with it MUHAMMAD Dope Just one more question from me and I know you had a couple more of them KELLEY OK Just one But yeah MUHAMMAD We cant see the wrapup because its really dark out there If youre even giving us the wrapitup I cant see GS You start off by saying Im a rich n like I dont know Thats hilarious Why you set if off so hard like that TI Because I feel people expect me to act a certain way because I have certain things because I am in a certain tax bracket I feel like man look Im a man before Im anything so Im gon stick to what I know and thats being me MUHAMMAD OK Do you think that hiphop has gotten too soft Is that where that song came from TI I mean of course I wont say soft in a sense of  it seems as though just as when NWA Ice Cube Dr Dre Snoop Dogg and Biggie and Pac became the whos who gangster s became fashionable You know what Im saying Everybody whether they were solidified or really like this or not they were emulating this lifestyle And over time every genre every corporation everybody goes through this After things have been the same for over time for so long there comes one person that goes against the charge that goes the absolute opposite of what everyone else is doing and they win Slowly over time that one person begins to encourage others and then now people are going from emulating this to emulating that Not to say the same people but the people who were nerds who were acting like gangsters are now comfortable being nerds And the people who are gangsters now are like nah let me emulate the nerds you know what Im saying And so since everybody want to be sensitive I feel like man listen Man the way for me to be the one person that leads the charge back the other direction is stick with the gangster s So thats why I made G S KELLEY Does the title have anything to do with Outkasts Gangster S TI No Absolutely nothing KELLEY Foiled again TI And I feel like I got the perfect partner on there man Young Jeezy he kinda like is the epitome you know what I mean And he and I we have conversations and intentions to do a project together in the near future Its called Dope Boy Academy MUHAMMAD Is that part of this Paperwork trilogy Sprinkled in Or is it something completely different TI Its not Hell be a part of it but that project is not a part of it It will have its own testament to its material I have three albums  real talk  already after Paperwork Paperwork is the more introspective musical kind of  its the artdeco of the three The second one is the return which also has its own narrative and the theme of that is trap music And the third is more of a like you know life love liability Its a love story Young man who finds himself  hes an active avid gangster but he just finds himself  he has a soft spot for a woman And usually they have people  involved with people he shouldnt be crossing so that gets him in certain situations and inspires a certain type of music MUHAMMAD Are you going for films at this point TI Yeah Thats why its called The Motion Picture because like music is really supposed to be the soundtrack to our lives So our lives is the movie But most people like to see it visually rather than just hear it so I just want to be the one to show it to em in a different way And also I have to look for diversity in  my thespianism aint coming from Broadway You know what Im saying So I have to challenge myself and present my abilities And take my strengths apply em to my weaknesses MUHAMMAD Its just hearing you describe those next two projects it sound like it would be a great film especially the last one Well all of them but especially the last one TI Thank you The plan is to have each one  like this album me and Chris Robinson we working on right now on completing the script getting the budgets in and cast and actually filming the first of the three short stories Paperwork The Marvel movie AntMan is kind of taking up a lot of that time cause we wouldve been done with it and have it presented by the time that the album released but we had you know  its AntMan So when were able to find  we just need about two three weeks knock it down Each of them will have a 35minute story that will make up at the end one complete project KELLEY I hope you can drop em like boom boom boom And not  the label wont make you wait TI Nah the label aint gon make me do nothing now The label aint gon make me do nothing But you saying  you talking about as far as how quick they are to be released KELLEY Mhmhm TI I think the success of one would dictate the release of the other You know what I mean KELLEY Im just saying I think we are getting more impatient these days TI I mean how about this If Paperwork drops and there are three to four singles to be worked off of its going to extend the time KELLEY I know I know TI You know what Im saying KELLEY I know Its just  I feel like  TI The music is going to make  even if you get tired of waiting for something if once you get a taste of it it is all you hope it will be then that will justify the wait KELLEY OK TI Yeah MUHAMMAD I just realized and remembered youre in a new distribution situation TI Yeah Yeah MUHAMMAD With Columbia TI Yep Yep MUHAMMAD Hows it feel to completely fulfill a contract I only say that cause people hold over Tribe Called Quests head all the time You guys got one more album Ever since the documentary its like the director ended the film with that so everyone knows we still owe the label one more record And its just like  TI Now see the thing is though thats only if you guys decide to make music MUHAMMAD Yeah TI You know what Im saying They cant make you submit MUHAMMAD Of course TI You know what I mean So thats if you decide  when I decide to do some music then they will get one MUHAMMAD So youre liking the new situation at Columbia TI Yeah I love it man I love it I feel like they take more risk than most record labels I feel like they kind of  they side with the artists requests more times than other labels Other labels will kind of take the position that the artist is here the label is there Sometimes we can have wants and wishes that intercede but for the most time we are in opposition of one another You know what Im saying MUHAMMAD Yeah Absolutely TI We are in support of one another but privately and behind closed doors when its come time to really have the discussions that carry on to the making we want different things 90 of the time And here I havent seen that for real Ive seen OK You know what youre asking You know its a lot You know its  Yes I do OK This is what you think you need We gon go and do it And after doing it if you prove or if you know the material justifies the risk if the risk turns itself into benefit OK well thats one to your credit And well move forward Thats the way I see working with Columbia versus my experience with a lot of other labels But not to discredit any of my former partners man I have a huge amount of love admiration and respect for him I just understand the different business models MUHAMMAD Yeah different method TI Yeah MUHAMMAD And as being a label owner yourself does that  what youve gone through as an artist  help your situation with Iggy and  TI Sure I mean if you cant understand where someones coming from you have less of an ability to relate If you just are an incredibly understanding person you just find a way to kind of relate to everything thats you know ideal However most of us who have these afflictions  I mean like for real I feel like my way is the best way I just do you know what Im saying And so my ability to really look at anyone elses perspective man is kind of like Man why  you dont think like me Psh sucks for you You know what Im saying I just have that in me But if I know what youre going through cause Ive been through it then I can understand where you coming from a little bit better That gives me the best opportunity to relate to the Young Thugs and the Iggys and the BOBs even the Trae tha Truths Its so many Boosie So many cats that really labels dont know what to do with either because they havent really really figured out how to communicate with them they are fearful to communicate with them or theres just a disconnect somewhere lost in translation something But me I have an ability to because Ive experienced what most artists have experienced I can speak to em from a different perspective Soon as every label realizes that and just come talk to me instead of trying to talk to the artists all the time well be somewhere KELLEY Could you tell us a little bit more about Doe B and how you came to know him and work with him Just describe him for our audience TI Man Doe B personally was a very very quiet like a reserved laidback  confident but quiet You know what I mean Like you could tell he was confident but he didnt talk a lot And I havent seen a young man at 18 19 come into such an overwhelming environment and remain unphased Ive never seen Doe B excited Except when we talk about sports KELLEY OK TI Except when we talk about sports The finals when the Miami Heat came back and beat the Spurs he was extremely you know  or Alabama championship Alabama games You know what Im saying Doe B was extremely excited and an avid sports fan but for the most part hell sit in a room and wouldnt say nothing unless he really had something to say That plus his work ethic him not wanting to go to the club When everybody else like Alright we finna go we goin out to this party we gon ball Ima finish another record So he just kinda had a work ethic that  it was a certain maturity that usually dont come until your second third or fourth album And his skillset lyrically and ability to separate lyricism Cause he  although he had extreme lyrical ability he also made songs that were superduper simple Simplified his communication down to Nah nah nah nah nah you know Be like that sometimes Like You betta know it Like You betta know it is a term that everybody uses but for real like Im a young n getting money betta know it  Bank roll full of numbered hundreds betta know it You know what Im saying Thats very very simple and sophisticated at the same time So that to me showed his skill in a different  and his ability to kind of speak in great detail The way when you heard Jeezy talking  If it take it too long to lock it up bring it back  You was short anyway bring a stack You know what Im saying Those are specific details that come from a circumstance that you recognize if youve ever been in there before And Doe Bs ability to do that  he found a way to do that in a way we aint heard probably since Jeezy The man for real man it was his time It was really  it was truly his time And he was about to blow He already had one hit record with me and Juicy J that was shooting up the charts man On its way to Number 1 KELLEY Let Me Find Out TI Let Me Find Out exactly And he had  and we had just finished the Hustle Gang mixtape We were shooting videos for his next mixtape The Kemosabe record was just  that was going to be the record that that took him where he needed to be And we just  we got our progress cut short You know what I mean But we still have an enormous catalog of stellar stellar material that we will use to keep his legacy alive KELLEY Well I feel like weve taken a lot of your time I appreciate it very very much TI Ah man you know I aint doing nothing but waiting sitting around waiting for the phone to ring But nah I really do appreciate you guys your time attention and you know your contribution Your contribution as well because Im sure youre not in here for nothing MUHAMMAD Thank you man TI Paperwork1021 man Hustle Gang over everything Love Copyright 2014 NPR,20141029,guns

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2014/10/20/356964925/one-lawyers-fight-for-young-blacks-and-just-mercy?ft=3&f=,When Bryan Stevenson was in his 20s he lived in Atlanta and practiced law at the Southern Prisoners Defense CommitteeOne evening he was parked outside his apartment listening to the radio when a police SWAT unit approached his car shined a light inside and pulled a gunThey yelled Move and Ill blow your head off according to Stevenson Stevenson says the officers suspected him of theft and threatened him  because he is blackThe incident fueled Stevensons drive to challenge racial bias and economic inequities in the US justice systemIt just reinforced what I had known all along which is that we have a criminal justice system that treats you better if youre rich and guilty than if youre poor and innocent Stevenson tells Fresh Airs Terry Gross The other thing that that incident did for me was just remind me that we have this attitude about people that is sometimes racially shaped  and you cant escape that simply because you go to college and get good grades or even go to law school and get a law degreeStevenson is a Harvard Law School graduate and has argued six cases before the Supreme Court He won a ruling holding that it is unconstitutional to sentence children to life without parole if they are 17 or younger and have not committed murderHis new memoir Just Mercy describes his early days growing up in a poor and racially segregated settlement in Delaware  and how he came to be a lawyer who represents those who have been abandoned His clients are people on death row  abused and neglected children who were prosecuted as adults and placed in adult prisons where they were beaten and sexually abused and mentally disabled people whose illnesses helped land them in prison where their special needs were unmetIn one of his most famous cases Stevenson helped exonerate a man on death row Walter McMillian was convicted of killing 18yearold Ronda Morrison who was found under a clothing rack at a dry cleaner in Monroeville Ala in 1986 Three witnesses testified against McMillian while six witnesses who were black testified that he was at a church fish fry at the time of the crime McMillian was found guilty and held on death row for six yearsStevenson decided to take on the case to defend McMillian but a judge tried to talk him out of itI think everyone knew that the evidence against Mr McMillian was pretty contrived Stevenson says The police couldnt solve the crime and there was so much pressure on the police and the prosecutor on the system of justice to make an arrest that they just felt like they had to get somebody convicted It was a pretty clear situation where everyone just wanted to forget about this man let him get executed so everybody could move on There was a lot of passion a lot of anger in the community about Morrisons death and I think there was great resistance to someone coming in and fighting for the condemned person who had been accused and convictedBut with Stevensons representation McMillian was exonerated in 1993 McMillian was eventually freed but not without scars of being on death row He died last yearThis is one of the few cases Ive worked on where I got bomb threats and death threats because we were fighting to free this man who was so clearly innocent Stevenson says It reveals this disconnect that Im so concerned about when I think about our criminal justice systemInterview HighlightsOn how the police got witnesses to testify falsely in the McMillian caseThey did coerce the witnesses to testify falsely against him and for some bizarre reason taperecorded some of these sessionsSo you hear this tape where the witness is saying You want me to frame an innocent man for murder I dont feel right about thatThe police officer is saying Well if you dont do it were going to put you on death row tooThey actually did put the testifying witness on death row for a period of time until he agreed to testify against Mr McMillian Other witnesses were given money in exchange for their false testimonyBut it was challenging because even when we presented all of that evidence  and we presented Mr McMillians strong alibi the first couple of judges said No were not going to grant reliefIt took us six years to get a court to ultimately overturn the conviction I think it speaks to this resistance we have in this country to confronting our errors to confronting our mistakesOn the case taking place where To Kill a Mockingbird is setOne of the really bizarre parts of this whole case for me was this whole episode took place in Monroeville Ala where Harper Lee grew up and wrote To Kill a Mockingbird If you go to Monroeville youll see a community thats completely enchanted by that story  They have all of this To Kill a Mockingbird memorabilia The leading citizens enact a play about the book You cant go anywhere without encountering some aspect of that story made real in that communityAnd yet when we were trying to get the community to do something about an innocent AfricanAmerican man wrongly convicted there was this indifference  and in some quarters hostilityOn the lasting effects of wrongful convictions and McMillians dementia One of the things that pains me is we have so tragically underestimated the trauma the hardship we create in this country when we treat people unfairly when we incarcerate them unfairly when we condemn them unfairlyYou cant threaten to kill someone every day year after year and not harm them not traumatize them not break them in ways that are really profound Yet when innocent people are released we just act like they should be grateful that they didnt get executed and we dont compensate them many times we dont help them we question them we still have doubts about themI saw that create this earlyonset dementia in McMillian that many of the doctors believed was traumainduced was a function of his experience of being nearly killed  and he witnessed eight executions when he was on death row One of the things I just wanted to people to understand is we cant continue to have a system of justice defined by error and unfairness and tolerate racial bias and bias against the poor and not confront what we are doing to individuals and to families and to communities and to neighborhoods McMillian is in some ways a microcosm of that reality Hes representative of what weve done to thousands of peopleOn representing people on death row and witnessing executions One of the first cases I ever dealt with where the man was executed was a surreal case where  I drove down to be with this man before his scheduled execution  They shave the hair off the persons body before they put them in the electric chair and were standing there having a very emotional conversation holding hands praying talkingI remember him staying to me Bryan this has been such a strange day When I woke up this morning the guards came to me and said What do you want for breakfast And at midday What do you want for lunch In the evening they said What do you want for dinner  All day long he said they kept saying What can we do to help you Can we get you stamps to mail your last letters Can we get you water Can we get you a phone to call your friends and family Ill never forget that man saying  More people have said What can I do to help you in the last 14 hours of my life than ever did in the first 19 years of my lifeI remember standing there holding his hands thinking Where were they when you were 3 years old being abused Where were they when you were 7 and being sexually assaulted Where were they when you were a teenager and you were homeless and struggling with drug addiction Where were they when you came back from war struggling with posttraumatic stress disorder And with those kinds of questions resonating in my mind this man was pulled away and executedIts a really surreal and I think deeply destructive act to kill a person who is not a threat to other people But thats our system and thats one of the reasons why getting people closer to that system is one of my new priorities  and one of the reasons why I wanted to write this bookOn changing the conversation about raceOur newest project at the Equal Justice Initiative is really trying to change the conversation about race in this country Weve done a very poor job at really reflecting on our legacy of racial inequality  You see it in the South but its everywhereAnd we want to talk more about slavery and we want to talk more about this era between Reconstruction and World War II which I call An Era of Racial Terrorism  of racial terror and violence that shaped attitudes I want to talk more about the civil rights era not through the lens of celebration Were too celebratory of civil rights these days We have these 50th anniversaries and everyone is happy and everybody is celebrating Nobody is talking about the hardshipIts almost as if the civil rights movement was this threeday event On Day 1 Rosa Parks didnt give up her seat on the bus On Day 2 the Rev Martin Luther King Jr led a march on Washington And on the third day we signed all of these laws And if you think about that history in that way you minimize the trauma the damage the divides that were created You cant segregate and humiliate people decade after decade without creating longlasting injuries Our newest project is really trying to introduce some concept of what transitional justice requires some commitment to truth and reconciliationOn justice in the 21st century The new statistic from the Justice Department is really disheartening The Justice Department is now reporting that 1 in 3 black male babies born in the 21st century is expected to go to jail or prison The statistic for Latino boys is 1 in 6 That statistic was not true in the 20th century It was not true in the 19th century It didnt become true until the 21st century That means we have enormous work to do to improve our commitment to a society that is not haunted and undermined and corrupted by our legacy of racial inequalityThe same is true for poverty Weve got a bigger population of poor people in this country than weve had in a generation and weve got to take on the challenges of poverty  For me that means taking it on in a different way Im not persuaded that the opposite of poverty is wealth  Ive come to believe  that the opposite of poverty is justice Copyright 2014 NPR,20141022,guns

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2014/10/18/357194775/one-feminist-critics-battle-with-gamings-darker-side?ft=3&f=,For those who follow the video game industry and its community feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian is a familiar figure Her video series Tropes vs Women in Video Games analyzes how women are represented in games past and presentSarkeesian is also known for the amount of backlash she receives for her criticism This week she canceled a talk at Utah State University after the school received an email that threatened a Montreal Massacre style attack at her presentationSarkeesian was scheduled to talk on Wednesday and didnt find out about the threats until she landed in Salt Lake City on Tuesday Tim Vitale the executive director of public relations and marketing at USU told NPR that theyd planned extra security and sweeps for explosive devices after they received the threat on Monday But because of Utahs concealed carry laws he says they could not restrict those with permits from carrying a firearm to the event and thats what ultimately drove Sarkeesian to cancel her talkWe still think we had everything in place to ensure a safe environment he saysVitale says he understands Sarkeesians concerns regarding Utahs gun law in light of the threats against her But that is a debate yet to be had he says and perhaps this incident will spur that debate to happen more quickly He says the threat is still under investigation by local law enforcement and the FBIThe threats against Sarkeesian and other women in the gaming industry are part of a larger ongoing debate about sexism misogyny and harassment in the video game community These issues have been running parallel with the Gamergate movement an effort that claims to be squarely focused on ethics in video game journalism but often intersects with these incidents of harassment and threatsThis strife in the billiondollar gaming industry has now vaulted out of the niche gaming press and into the mainstream The New York Times gave it frontpage treatment after these most recent threats against Sarkeesian She spoke with NPRs Arun Rath about her history of harassment and why she thinks she and women like her are such targets by certain segments of the gaming communityInterview HighlightsOn why she canceled her Utah State University appearanceI eventually got on the phone with the police at Utah State University and they informed me that they would not allow for backpacks and have additional security there When I asked them about Utahs concealed weapon laws they informed me that they couldnt do any kind of screening for weapons which was a little mindboggling to me because the threat received was very reminiscent of sort of copycat killers of these misogynist massacres that had been done previously I was like Can you at least have metal detectors or do patdowns And they refused to do that So I declined and canceled the event because I felt like that was too high of a risk to put me and the students inOn her critique of how women are portrayed in video games Sadly its actually kind of worse than I thought it was going to be when I initially started this Tropes vs Women project Often women are framed as helpless or theyre prizes to be won or theyre highly sexualized male fantasies The other piece of this too is that theres this enormous amount of violence against women thats used in these games often times as sort of set dressing Just in the background these women are hurt or beaten up just to make the world seem more gritty These representations are really harmful to women and so were asking for better representations and better stories having more female protagonists that are full and complete charactersOn her history with harassmentSince I announced that I was going to be doing a video series specifically looking at the representations of women in video games I have been attacked and ultimately terrorized for two years because of this series Everything from my social media accounts flooded with misogynist and racist slurs to trying to hack into my social media and email Oftentimes there are very specific rape threats  that are also connected to my home address or attacks on my parents and my colleagues and their families as well so they kind of go after everyone in my vicinity And Im not the only woman being attacked right now in games There have been a number of other women who are fearing for their lives and leaving their homes because theyre receiving threats as well So this is actually a larger problem within the gaming community right nowOn why she thinks this is happening in the gaming communityIn some ways there are some men who have gravitated toward gaming culture because they have been rejected by this larger alpha male culture The problem with that is that gaming allows them to fulfill that role  the alpha male role  the macho testosterone posturing you get in a lot of these big AAA bigbudget games So theyre actually kind of reperpetuating that alpha male culture by attacking people that they perceive to be weaker than them So theyre going after women theyre going after queer folks theyre going after trans folks and especially anyone who speaks up and is critical in any way about gaming Copyright 2014 NPR,20141018,guns
NPR,http://www.npr.org/2014/10/17/356102723/the-brutalities-of-war-bring-surprising-angles-to-fury?ft=3&f=,Fury David Ayers brutal reflective wholly absorbing World War II movie is about tanktotank combat and the way war degrades everyone it touches but for about a minute it looks like a Western A rider on a white horse crosses a misty field in no great hurry gradually filling the frame Ayers patient camera tracks him into a metal thicket of burning American Shermans and their superior German counterparts Tigers Then Brad Pitt tackles the rider whose Nazi uniform has come into focus and drives his knife through the officers eye and into his brain He spares the horse Its April 1945 the last exhausted gasp of Good War in Europe in a few weeks Hitler will kill himself in a bunker and the ThousandYear Reich will surrender in Year 13 But Fury reminds us like no film since Saving Private Ryan 16 years ago that there was nothing good about it and it does so with considerably less

collection business He didnt have a fancy resume or much money He was an excon whose siblings staked him 10000 to get his business up and running This isnt as odd as it may seem Many debt collection agencies are small businesses eking out a living in storefront shops A few years back when the world was going wild for debt lots of people were getting into the business All that debt meant lots of money to be collected By the time he opened his shop Jimmy Nelms  almost everyone calls him Jimmy  had already been through a lot Hed gotten involved in drugs gone to jail on a gun charge and worked as a debt collector at a big corporate agency It turned out he was really good at collecting debts I was one of the best he says Walking in there smoking like a pound a weed And out of all those people I was producing I met Jimmy through Jake Halpern a journalist who just wrote a book called Bad Paper Chasing Debt from Wall Street to the Underworld Jake visited Jimmys shop several times It was an old karate academy he says Theres mirrors all the way up Theres stranded equipment behind the cubicles It looks like kids might have taken classes there last week Jimmy has his office but he needs one more thing debt to collect on He needs to buy a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that lists hundreds of people who didnt pay their bills along with contact information and details about the debt Jimmy showed me one spreadsheet that he paid about 18000 for Once hed bought that spreadsheet everyone listed on it now owed money to Jimmy  not to whoever they borrowed it from in the first place But to buy a spreadsheet like this you have to know the right people Its just like the streets he says I cant walk into Mexico and go tell some drug cartel Listen Im from the hood in Buffalo Give me all the keys you got In other words Jimmy needs a dealer  someone who can start getting him those spreadsheets He puts the word out and finds another Buffalo guy named Larry Just Larry He asked us not to use his last name because he was worried about getting into legal trouble Larrys niche was linking up people who were looking to sell debt with people who were looking to buy Hes a middle man Around this time he says lots of people in Buffalo needed his services All of a sudden there became an explosion of street level agencies he says On just about every block guys were coming out of prison literally and in a couple of months theyre running a collection agency Theyd get the debt Theyd get people on the phone Theyd start dialing and start collecting And those guys were really good at getting people to pay The top collectors are always the guys from the streets  pretty much came up the same way I did on food stamps and ramen noodles Larry says Sometimes being a collector means being a nice guy Nine times out of 10 these people just want somebody to listen to them Jimmy says Other times though Jimmy would take a harder approach He would use formal language  terms like first substantive contact and this is a refusal  to suggest that legal action might be coming according to Jake Halpern the journalist Even as Jimmy was making these calls he says he knew what it was like for the people on the other end of the phone I know Im putting people out he says Ive been in positions just recently where you need a couple extra dollars It feels horrible But you owe this money And Ive got kids to feed After a few years Jimmy did well enough to move to a bigger office in a more upscale neighborhood At one point he had 17 people working for him By the end of the credit boom Americans rising debt meant booming business for Larry Jimmys dealer I was on top of the world he says We had more money than the drug dealers They looked up to us It didnt last Just like some people on Wall Street went wild with debt and started going too far some debt collectors in Buffalo started doing things that were blatantly illegal like telling people theyd go to jail if they didnt pay Things were also getting out of control at the highest echelons of the debt business Larry himself got debt from a broker way up the food chain who was making lots of money who was basically selling debt he didnt own Jake Halpern says Straight up theft Larry brokered a few deals where his customers wound up with this stolen debt We let greed step in he says We stopped doing our due diligence because the money was right there to be gotten And we wanted it Larry got out of the business a few years back and bought a small house in a workingclass suburb outside of Buffalo For Jimmy it all came to an end this spring The company that processed payments for his agency cut him off This happened to lots of small collection agencies in Buffalo according to Jimmy The federal government has been putting pressure on some payment processors to stop working with certain businesses But its hard to know for sure what happened to Jimmy Maybe it was just that too many people complained about charges from Jimmys shop In any case Jimmy says he could no longer get the money he needed to keep his keep his business running Jimmy lost his office and closed shop Hes out of the debt business now Like a lot of the world he came out of the boom and bust about where he started without much left For more on this story see the book Bad Paper and related articles in the New Yorker and the New York

American was still known as Peter Yet the Arabic name he would soon choose for himself certainly seemed fitting  AbdulRahman alludes to the mercy of God and Peter wanted so much to ease the suffering he saw in SyriaKassig first volunteered in the poor Palestinian camps of Lebanon which are now also hosting thousands of Syrian refugees who have fled their homeland since war erupted there in 2011 He was deeply moved by what he saw and he decided to delve furtherA trained emergency medical technician he began volunteering at a hospital in Lebanons neglected northern city of Tripoli and he shared every part of life with his Syrian colleagues living with them and sharing meals He called it a very emotional lifechanging experienceKassig took his work home with him His house was always open to Syrian friends he met along the way Kassig took them in like brothers whether employing them in his aid group or just giving them a bed to sleep onKassig had experienced war as a US Army Ranger in Iraq in 2007 and openly shared that part of his background even though it could potentially make many suspicious of him He said he had decided to return to the Middle East to serve in a very different roleI can either be in a position to deliver tens of thousands of dollars of antibiotics for women and children or I can be another young man with a gun he told me in 2012At age 24 Kassig founded SERA the Special Emergency Response and Assistance dedicated to providing rapid medical training and supplies in volatile areas He made several trips into Syria delivering humanitarian supplies and passing along his skills to local medicsIn the 2012 profile on CNN below Kassig says Theres this impression this belief that there is no hope Thats when its more important than ever that we come in against all odds and try to do somethingKassigs humility and respect for Arab culture had won him the admiration of his colleagues at field hospitals In a video message one of them attested to Kassigs characterHe cured everyone without exception he trained many people on how to conduct an effective rescue operation He shared our grief and our happiness the colleague said His face is blurred in the video to protect his identity but he said Kassig even fasted with the Muslim workers during the holy month of Ramadan as a precursor for Kassigs own conversion to IslamSERAs Syria operations were intended to be the first step for the nonprofit with even bigger ambitions But the work kept getting more dangerous as the Syrian conflict kept expanding with many areas in critical needMany United Nations agencies citing a lack of Syrian government permission did not dare go to the areas where Kassig visited In July the world body changed its policy and authorized crossborder deliveries to rebelheld areas without regime permissionFormer UN aid chief Jan Egeland said that aid organizations have failed the most vulnerable populationsWere doing good work for refugees in neighboring countries but too few organizations are able and willing to go deep into Syria Egeland said last weekKassig was willing to go deep into Syria But on a mission in October of last year he was seized by the Islamic StateIn the aftermath his parents in Indiana had requested a media blackout But that changed when a video released earlier this month showed the beheading of British aid worker Alan Henning Kassig appeared in the same video and the Islamic State threatened to kill him nextHis parents are now speaking out pleading for his life In an interview with NBCs Today show on Monday Kassigs mother Paula saidI am hoping that he will somehow hear of this and of other conversations weve had or other times weve spoken in public That way hell know that we havent forgotten him we havent abandoned him and we certainly do love himKassigs parents also released a letter he had written and which was carried out by a hostage who was previously released It read in partPhysically I am pretty underweight but Im not starved  I have no physical injuries Im a tough kid and still young so that helps Mentally I am pretty sure this is the hardest thing a man can go through the stress and fear are incredible but I am coping as best I can I am not aloneIf Kassig knew the attention his predicament has generated he likely would prefer to shed light on the plight of the Syrians who have undertaken the same risksThirtyseven Syrian Red Crescent workers and seven Palestinian Red Crescent staff and volunteers have lost their lives in the conflict The risks are equal if not greater for Syrian activists delivering aid outside government channels because they are viewed as providing material support to the revolt against President Bashar AssadOne Syrian woman who was imprisoned with her teenage son by the Syrian government for delivering aid to the families of imprisoned dissidents in Lattakia spoke via Skype of her three months spent in solitary confinement where she was torturedAs humanitarian workers we are treated worse than fighters said the woman who asked that her name not be used for her safety She was one of the lucky ones because her wealthy brotherinlaw was able to pay more than 30000 in bribes to free her and her son Of her fellow volunteers she says None are still working All were imprisoned killed or forced to fleeThe last time I saw Kassig was a chance meeting He had just completed an aid mission to the eastern Syrian city of Deir Ezzor where he described swimming in the Euphrates River He even got his paperwork approved by the local civilian council which governed the oppositionheld area where Kassig was working at the timeI got my work permit from Deir Ezzor he said beaming visibly exhausted but elated to have cemented his transition from an American in Syria to a certified member of the aid communityKassig clearly felt he belonged in the region and called his Syrian friends and all of us in the traditional Arabic style My brother

Ive got kids to feed After a few years Jimmy did well enough to move to a bigger office in a more upscale neighborhood At one point he had 17 people working for him By the end of the credit boom Americans rising debt meant booming business for Larry Jimmys dealer I was on top of the world he says We had more money than the drug dealers They looked up to us It didnt last Just like some people on Wall Street went wild with debt and started going too far some debt collectors in Buffalo started doing things that were blatantly illegal like telling people theyd go to jail if they didnt pay Things were also getting out of control at the highest echelons of the debt business Larry himself got debt from a broker way up the food chain who was making lots of money who was basically selling debt he didnt own Jake Halpern says Straight up theft Larry brokered a few deals where his customers wound up with this stolen debt We let greed step in he says We stopped doing our due diligence because the money was right there to be gotten And we wanted it Larry got out of the business a few years back and bought a small house in a workingclass suburb outside of Buffalo For Jimmy it all came to an end this spring The company that processed payments for his agency cut him off This happened to lots of small collection agencies in Buffalo according to Jimmy The federal government has been putting pressure on some payment processors to stop working with certain businesses But its hard to know for sure what happened to Jimmy Maybe it was just that too many people complained about charges from Jimmys shop In any case Jimmy says he could no longer get the money he needed to keep his keep his business running Jimmy lost his office and closed shop Hes out of the debt business now Like a lot of the world he came out of the boom and bust about where he started without much left For more on this story see the book Bad Paper and related articles in the New Yorker and the New York

American was still known as Peter Yet the Arabic name he would soon choose for himself certainly seemed fitting  AbdulRahman alludes to the mercy of God and Peter wanted so much to ease the suffering he saw in SyriaKassig first volunteered in the poor Palestinian camps of Lebanon which are now also hosting thousands of Syrian refugees who have fled their homeland since war erupted there in 2011 He was deeply moved by what he saw and he decided to delve furtherA trained emergency medical technician he began volunteering at a hospital in Lebanons neglected northern city of Tripoli and he shared every part of life with his Syrian colleagues living with them and sharing meals He called it a very emotional lifechanging experienceKassig took his work home with him His house was always open to Syrian friends he met along the way Kassig took them in like brothers whether employing them in his aid group or just giving them a bed to sleep onKassig had experienced war as a US Army Ranger in Iraq in 2007 and openly shared that part of his background even though it could potentially make many suspicious of him He said he had decided to return to the Middle East to serve in a very different roleI can either be in a position to deliver tens of thousands of dollars of antibiotics for women and children or I can be another young man with a gun he told me in 2012At age 24 Kassig founded SERA the Special Emergency Response and Assistance dedicated to providing rapid medical training and supplies in volatile areas He made several trips into Syria delivering humanitarian supplies and passing along his skills to local medicsIn the 2012 profile on CNN below Kassig says Theres this impression this belief that there is no hope Thats when its more important than ever that we come in against all odds and try to do somethingKassigs humility and respect for Arab culture had won him the admiration of his colleagues at field hospitals In a video message one of them attested to Kassigs characterHe cured everyone without exception he trained many people on how to conduct an effective rescue operation He shared our grief and our happiness the colleague said His face is blurred in the video to protect his identity but he said Kassig even fasted with the Muslim workers during the holy month of Ramadan as a precursor for Kassigs own conversion to IslamSERAs Syria operations were intended to be the first step for the nonprofit with even bigger ambitions But the work kept getting more dangerous as the Syrian conflict kept expanding with many areas in critical needMany United Nations agencies citing a lack of Syrian government permission did not dare go to the areas where Kassig visited In July the world body changed its policy and authorized crossborder deliveries to rebelheld areas without regime permissionFormer UN aid chief Jan Egeland said that aid organizations have failed the most vulnerable populationsWere doing good work for refugees in neighboring countries but too few organizations are able and willing to go deep into Syria Egeland said last weekKassig was willing to go deep into Syria But on a mission in October of last year he was seized by the Islamic StateIn the aftermath his parents in Indiana had requested a media blackout But that changed when a video released earlier this month showed the beheading of British aid worker Alan Henning Kassig appeared in the same video and the Islamic State threatened to kill him nextHis parents are now speaking out pleading for his life In an interview with NBCs Today show on Monday Kassigs mother Paula saidI am hoping that he will somehow hear of this and of other conversations weve had or other times weve spoken in public That way hell know that we havent forgotten him we havent abandoned him and we certainly do love himKassigs parents also released a letter he had written and which was carried out by a hostage who was previously released It read in partPhysically I am pretty underweight but Im not starved  I have no physical injuries Im a tough kid and still young so that helps Mentally I am pretty sure this is the hardest thing a man can go through the stress and fear are incredible but I am coping as best I can I am not aloneIf Kassig knew the attention his predicament has generated he likely would prefer to shed light on the plight of the Syrians who have undertaken the same risksThirtyseven Syrian Red Crescent workers and seven Palestinian Red Crescent staff and volunteers have lost their lives in the conflict The risks are equal if not greater for Syrian activists delivering aid outside government channels because they are viewed as providing material support to the revolt against President Bashar AssadOne Syrian woman who was imprisoned with her teenage son by the Syrian government for delivering aid to the families of imprisoned dissidents in Lattakia spoke via Skype of her three months spent in solitary confinement where she was torturedAs humanitarian workers we are treated worse than fighters said the woman who asked that her name not be used for her safety She was one of the lucky ones because her wealthy brotherinlaw was able to pay more than 30000 in bribes to free her and her son Of her fellow volunteers she says None are still working All were imprisoned killed or forced to fleeThe last time I saw Kassig was a chance meeting He had just completed an aid mission to the eastern Syrian city of Deir Ezzor where he described swimming in the Euphrates River He even got his paperwork approved by the local civilian council which governed the oppositionheld area where Kassig was working at the timeI got my work permit from Deir Ezzor he said beaming visibly exhausted but elated to have cemented his transition from an American in Syria to a certified member of the aid communityKassig clearly felt he belonged in the region and called his Syrian friends and all of us in the traditional Arabic style My brother

NPR,http://www.npr.org/2014/10/09/354110420/in-berlin-remaking-the-city-can-rekindle-old-frictions?ft=3&f=,Berlin is an onagain offagain capital with a darker history than most cities in Europe It served as the epicenter of Hitlers Third Reich and was nearly wiped off the map at the end of the last World War Berlin was also the flashpoint of the Cold War between the United States and Russia Their conflict split the city into two leaving residents on either side cut off from each other in every way imaginable for a generation Still visitors hoping to relive a John le Carre Cold War spy novel today are likely to be disappointed Most traces of the Berlin Wall and other landmarks delineating East and West have been torn down or moved since Germany reunited nearly a quartercentury ago German planners have made a concerted effort to erase the divisions between the two Berlins But heres the catch These costly changes  especially the ongoing removal of communistera architecture  have fostered resentment among many residents in the eastern part of the city Many feel the buildings are an important part of Berlins history that are worth protecting A Blank Canvas For A Unified Berlin During the Cold War most of Berlins subways served the West Its trains would slow down  but never stop  in the dimly lit stations in the communist eastern part of the city where guards with machine guns kept watch East Berliners on the other hand rode aboveground trains streetcars and buses that steered clear of West Berlin These days in Berlin people can use any mode of public transit they wish Changes like these are by design says municipal planner Annalie Schoen a West German transplant to Berlin Schoen is part of a team that has helped create a seamless capital since lawmakers decided to move the government from Bonn back to Berlin in 1991 I met her in the federal government quarter which is called the Band des Bundes suggesting a place connecting the former East and West and binding the new federation Schoen says the buildings here with their modern facades and welcoming public spaces both indoors and out symbolize Germanys evolution into a democratic and peaceful society When we started none of the streets were here none of the buildings were here she says The blank canvas made the task of creating a unified government quarter here easier Schoen adds Architects from around the world competed to design it as German officials sought international input to prevent any appearance of nationalistic pride A key element was the redesign of the former Reichstag building which now serves as the main German parliament building It was one of the few existing structures in the quarter one that was rich in history but in terrible shape Schoen says You know that our Reichstag was renovated by a British architect Norman Foster she says adding that she doubts Britain or France would have allowed an outsider to do that But you know our history so that forces us to be a bit more open The renovated building which runs on solar power is a huge draw for German and foreign tourists alike They get not only a 360degree view of the city but can peer into the legislative chamber below Architect Thomas Krueger another West German transplant who runs an agency offering architectural tours of Berlin called Ticket B is one of the many fans of the new design Now there is a new monumentality he says Its also showing pride Now we are 85 million people peaceful reunited Palace Of The Republic Goes Baroque But a short bus ride away is another project Berlin has undertaken to reinvent itself that Krueger says misses the mark Called the Humboldt Forum the project which is to be completed by 2019 is a partial reconstruction of a Baroque palace that traces its roots back to the 15th century The palace was badly damaged in World War II and then completely torn down by the East German communists who built their parliament building there in the 1970s In 2006 the German parliament ordered the East German building with bronzemirrored windows to be torn down which took about two years These days the site is hovered over by cranes and workers assigned to the nearly 800 million project When its finished Krueger says it will house a library university facilities and Berlins African and other nonEuropean art collections The museum for nonEuropean art will be presented behind a Baroque facade which does not really make any sense he explains Nor did it make sense to remove every trace of the East German building that was here Krueger adds Called the Palace of the Republic it housed not only the communist legislature but also a bowling alley concert hall restaurants and even a giant dance floor on hydraulic lifts Every East German I know told me a story about his connection to this Palace of the Republic and to demolish it is really an act of violence Krueger says Colleagues of mine made a lot of suggestions how to renovate the old Palace of the Republic and there was still cultural life in it That is really unbelievable All what Berlin is representing was still here The Palace of the Republic was not the only German Democratic Republic building to be torn down he adds I read that more than 180 buildings here in the inner city were demolished since 89 he says This is quite a lot There was a highrise building called the foreign ministry of the GDR so they demolished it very quickly So this was a prominent building also not really nice architecture but it was a piece of the German history The sentiment Krueger adds is Everything is ugly from the GDR times and so we have to demolish it Remaking  Or Negating  East Berlins Past Krueger very much disagrees But he says the problem is that West Germans  especially those not from Berlin  dont believe the communistera buildings are worth protecting They are a reminder of a time in Germanys history theyd rather forget Thats put Berlins last major East Germanera landmark  Alexanderplatz  at risk as well The 20acre square was the showplace of communist East Germany and is best known for Berlins iconic television tower that at 1207 feet is one of Europes tallest structures A World Clock and somewhat gaudy copper and enamel fountain here also draw tourists Alexanderplatz is also framed by hulking Sovietera buildings with stark glass and metal facades that since reunification feature mostly businesses stores and restaurants The squares critics and investors say it is wasted space with old structures that are eyesores They are pushing to tear them down In an oped in Der Tagesspiegel in August 2013 one West German author and journalist Peter von Becker likened the proposed preservation of one of the buildings to keeping Berlin looking like the North Korean capital Pyongyang Thats not how Katrin Lompscher sees it Shes a native East Berliner who was 27 when the wall came down and now serves in the Berlin parliament as a member of the Die Linke party which includes members of the political party that succeeded East Germanys ruling communists The Alexanderplatz of my youth as I remember it was a major transportation hub and great place to shop Lompscher says The best department store  was here and had a terrace with open stairs like a piazza Of course its important to move forward and develop things she adds But its wrong to completely negate whats already here She worries about a 1993 master plan by German architect Hans Kollhoff It was approved by the government and calls for 10 highrise towers in and around the square although investors shied away from erecting any during a decadelong economic slump Lompscher says it now it appears that plans are moving ahead for one of the highrises a 39story building designed by avantgarde architect Frank Gehry To Lompscher its a slap in the face to East Berliners many of whom feel reunification has meant doing everything the Western way City planner Annalie Schoen agrees that many East Berliners view this as something conquerors do She says it was tougher for them to adjust postreunification because we sort of took over They had to use our laws they had to use our regulations our social security system everything For them Schoen says the change was more dramatic than it was for us Copyright 2014 NPR,20141010,guns

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/10/08/354507430/videos-of-deadly-police-encounters-grab-media-spotlight?ft=3&f=,Editors Note In an earlier version of this story we had two videos of encounters with the police They contained graphic language and violence so weve removed them from the story If you still want to see them weve included links If youve been following the news in recent months youve seen a parade of stories in which unarmed men usually but not always black had calamitous encounters with police In just the past two weeks there was an indictment in the shooting of a 68yearold grandfather in his driveway a motorist shot and injured as he tried to comply with an officers request for his ID and a drug suspect beaten with police officers guns as he tried to surrender Its become its own grim politically polarizing genre of news storyAre we seeing more of these stories because theyre actually happening more As weve written before its pretty hard to tell just how often police officers use deadly force There are thousands and thousands of law enforcement agencies in the United States Many report their useofforce data while others dont and different agencies have different standards for when force is justified As best as the Department of Justice can guess there are about 400 policerelated deaths each year across the nation In a nation that sees millions of civilian police encounters each year that means such deaths are exceedingly rare But you could look at it another way 400 deaths a year means that every day someone in the United States is probably killed in an encounter with police Thats a lot of potential grist for this genreIts clear that video has played a role in the fresh media attention  the most highprofile of these incidents was caught on either a cellphone camera or a police dashboard camera or by surveillance footageWhat you would always see in these other cases or in cases in past decades is that youd see someone after the fact with maybe some bruises or maybe some reports of the injuries they sustained Laura Castaeda a journalism and media professor at the University of Southern California told me last week A picture paints a thousand words the old cliche  but now you see it and these are powerful powerful imagesThats a big reason we end up seeing more moments on the news like this from Hammond Ind last month in which a man is tased during a traffic stop Fair warning The video in the link is disturbingAnd Castaeda said those images are getting more traction and a wider airing because of social media Its also worth noting just how much browner social media is compared to traditional media organizations  blacks and Latinos are more likely to use Twitter than are white folks which means Twitter captures and magnifies a different set of experiences and priorities News outlets are increasingly paying attentionBut there might be another deeper philosophical shift happening that might explain why were seeing these stories Consider the Pew poll taken just after the Michael Brown shooting in August that found that a majority of respondents felt that police did not treat people from different racial groups equally A majority of respondents also said they felt that police officers did not use an appropriate amount of force and that police departments didnt do a good job of holding officers accountable for misconductThat dovetails with Vikrant Reddy an analyst with the conservative policy group Right on Crime who told me about Americans shifting attitudes toward zerotolerance policing and mass incarcerationI think theres been a broad public shift just based on the fact that crime has decreased he said There was a time  when there was Willie Horton and Bernie Goetz and Time magazine covers on how New York City was ungovernable dominated the headlines We had entire presidential elections that were decided based on criminal justice issues he said noting that presidents dont have a lot of authority to intervene in criminal justice issuesHe went onPeople have to appreciate that public safety was a legitimate issue in cities  You had conservative politicians saying Liberals are not taking this problem seriously We will take it seriously We will start locking people up And I would argue that they were right about that that we needed to do more of those things But its also true that the pendulum can swing too far You can keep broadening that net ever larger and ever larger  Well lock more and more and more people up and at a certain point you just have diminishing returns It gets very counterproductive and thats the era we live in nowAs crime has fallen to nearrecord low levels Reddy said theres more space for people to think critically about policing strategies even on the political right Fiscal conservatives have begun criticizing toughoncrime policies for being expensive Social conservatives have increasingly argued that those approaches disrupt communities Libertarians take issue with their intrusivenessIts a point driven home by the alleged infractions that were the pretext for many of these disastrous confrontations Eric Garner was allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes on the street Michael Brown was allegedly jaywalkingBelow are some of the most highprofile cases from just the past 12 weeksJuly 17 Eric Garner 43 New York CityEric Garner was no stranger to encounters with the police The 43yearold father of six was forced to leave his position in the city parks department due to health problems and to help make ends meet he sold loosies  individual untaxed cigarettes  on the streets Because of that hed been arrested more than 30 timesOne day this summer Garner was standing on a corner when he was confronted by police who accused him of selling loosies to a man on the street Im tired of it Garner said This stops today After he argued with them for several minutes the officers attempted to arrest Garner and Daniel Pantaleo one of the plainclothes officers wrapped his arm around Garners neck before several of them wrestled him to the ground One of the officers put his knee on Garners head as it lay on the sidewalk while Garner could be heard repeating I cant breathe Garner fell unconscious and officers at the scene did not attempt to revive him Garner was pronounced dead not long after The video of the incident quickly spread on social media You can view it here but fair warning Its very unsettlingPantaleo and several emergency workers who were at the scene are on desk duty pending an investigation The medical examiner ruled that Garners death was a homicide caused by a chokehold  a maneuver that the NYPD bars its officers from performing No charges have been filed in the case yet although a grand jury is weighing whether to do soAug 5 John Crawford 22 Beavercreek OhioWhile Ferguson Mo was dominating the news another story of a police shooting was starting to gain traction on local news and social media John Crawford III was talking on his cellphone with his girlfriend as he walked through a WalMart store in Beavercreek Ohio with a BB gun that was sold in the store Two police officers Sean Williams and Sgt David Darkow responded to a 911 caller who said Crawford had been pointing a weapon at customers in the store Police arrived as Crawford was pacing the aisle they shot Crawford several times He died moments laterThe police realized after they shot Crawford that the gun was a toy The 911 caller later recanted his statement and said Crawford never pointed the gun at other customers The caller also previously told reporters that he was an exMarine but records show that he was kicked out while trying to enroll due to fraudulent enlistmentThe police at the scene maintained that Crawford made a sudden movement after they ordered him to drop his weapon The store released surveillance video of the shooting but it doesnt support that version of events There were reportedly 200 surveillance cameras at the WalMart and video from only one angle was made public according to BuzzFeed Nonetheless a grand jury chose not to indict Williams and Darkow The Justice Department is investigating the shootingAug 9 Michael Brown 18 Ferguson MoMichael Brown was a recent high school graduate and his family said he was enrolled in college classes for the fall His killing was the most highprofile among these incidents over the summer and it touched off a wave of protests nationally and occasionally violent skirmishes between the police and demonstrators  Almost every detail about the incident is in dispute A friend who was walking with Brown said officer Darren Wilson shot Brown after an argument over jaywalking and that Brown was shot to death with his hands raised above his head to surrender Fergusons chief of police has maintained that Brown was shot after a scuffle with Wilson in which Brown reached for the officers gun The police released security video of a man they say was Brown stealing cigarettes from a local convenience store minutes before the shooting another video purports to show Brown paying for them The police later said that alleged theft had nothing to do with why Wilson stopped BrownThe only thing seemingly not in dispute is that Wilson shot Brown and that Browns body lay in the street for several hours in the middle of the day while a crowd gathered and jeered the local police Fergusons police chief has since apologized for leaving Browns body in the streetAn independent autopsy conducted by New York Citys former chief medical examiner said Brown had been shot six times Wilson has not been seen in public since the incident The Justice Department is investigating the Ferguson police department while a grand jury weighs whether to charge Wilson with a crimeSept 4 Levar Jones 35 Columbia SCOne afternoon last month Levar Jones parked his SUV in the parking lot of a gas station and climbed out State trooper Sean Groubert pulled up behind him because he suspected Jones was driving without a seat beltGroubert asked to see Jones license But when Jones reached into his truck to get it Groubert opened fire yelling Get out of the car Get out of the carJones fell to the ground with his hands raised above his head What did I do sir Jones asked What did I do Jones apologized to the officer who shot him as he lay on the groundThe shooting and the moments leading up to it were all caught on Grouberts dashboard camera Another warning the video of the shooting contains graphic violenceBut Groubert described the incident differently in his police report when he recounted that Jones jumped out of his car and stared at him He goes on I saw something black in his hands I ran to the other side of the car yelling at him and he kept coming toward me Apparently it was his walletGroubert was subsequently fired from the force and indicted on assault and aggravated battery charges If convicted he faces 20 years in prisonJones who was shot in the hip survived the shooting He now walks with a cane Copyright 2014 NPR,20141008,guns
NPR,http://www.npr.org/2014/10/08/354594644/red-and-blue-obamas-latte-salute?ft=3&f=,The thing I found interesting about the latte salute foofaraw was that people were calling it that Why did they feel the need to suggest that it was a latte that the president was holding when he made that perfunctory salute to the Marines as he left his helicopter last month How can a latte still be a sign of effete selfindulgence when you can get one at any McDonalds or Dunkin Donuts these days Isnt that whole redblue business a little vieux chapeau Back in 2005 I actually made a bet about those color names with the lexicographer Grant Barrett who compiled a dictionary of political slang The American Dialect Society had just chosen red states and blue states as its words of the year for 2004 Barrett said those terms would join right and left as a permanent fixture of the political lexicon I said theyd be passe in 10 years time As the clock ticks down it looks like its going to be a split decision The media still use red and blue when theyre talking about the electoral map but not for a deep cultural divide People dont talk much about redandblue America anymore That redblue distinction came about as pure serendipity During the marathon battles over the recount in the 2000 election those just happened to be the colors the media were using for the broad swaths of states that went for Bush or Gore But the colors instantly became a proxy for all the differences in values and lifestyle that seemed to be cleaving the country into warring tribes That picture really had its roots in the 70s when we all took to using marketing jargon like upscale yuppie and lifestyle itself to map out our cultural geography and we suddenly discovered a nation called Middle America sitting in our midst For the right it was an occasion to brand liberals with the consumer choices that revealed them for the poseurs they were Liberals drove a safe but ugly car built by the socialist Swedes They consumed chardonnay and brie and they followed sports that didnt require helmets or gasoline In 1997 David Brooks coined the phrase latte liberal in a piece about the bourgeois bohemians in his Washington DC neighborhood  people who signaled their status discreetly by spending excessive amounts of money on staples like bottled water and organic lettuce not to mention 3 lattes It seemed the perfect symbol for liberal ideals pallid frothy and foreign Those stereotypes all came together in a brilliant TV ad sponsored by the conservative Club for Growth that ran during the 2004 Iowa Democratic primary An announcer asks a middleaged couple what they think of Howard Deans tax plan The man starts I think Howard Dean should take his taxhiking governmentexpanding lattedrinking sushieating Volvodriving New York Timesreading   and his wife continues   bodypiercing Hollywoodloving leftwing freak show back to Vermont where it belongs I thought that line was pure genius and appropriated it for the subtitle of a book I was writing on political language Those piledon participials enabled you to ridicule liberal affections while conspicuously dropping your gs The line wasnt supposed to make a lot of demographic sense  you had an image of Marilyn Manson poring over Paul Krugmans latest column while he nibbles at his California roll But the writer of the ad nailed the snooty liberal as a comic type like the pretentious foils in a Woody Allen movie The left couldnt really respond in kind When liberals denounce redstate conservatives as knuckledragging Biblethumping gunfondling bubbas they just confirm that theyre condescending elitists In fact when you encounter a phrase like beerguzzling redneck on the Web its most often coming from a conservative whos reminding the people of the heartland just what the liberals think of them It took the appearance of the redblue color code in 2000 to put those lifestyle differences literally on the map For a while those divisions were all that people could talk about  they signaled a values chasm a clash of cultures The conservative columnist John Podhoretz said the country was devolving into two nations divided not by race or income but by pure affect  the reds incapable of irony the blues capable of nothing but The media made a parlor game of assigning everything to a place on the national color wheel red and blue hairstyles rock groups fertilizer brands salads Then after 2008 the whole narrative abruptly dropped out of sight The references to latte liberals to red and blue America even to family values are all off anywhere from 70 to 90 percent in the media since then Theres no shortage of explanations  the economy Obamas election the Republicans lurch rightward Or credit the influence of Starbucks and Will  Grace In retrospect the whole two Americas business was mostly the narcissism of small differences many of which wound up being no differences at all When we talk about our divisions now its with new language that reflects the rediscovery of the old distinctions of race and class  the 1 percent the 47 percent the makers and takers the fat cats That yawning chasm between the kalechewing blues and the iceberglettucecrunching reds was never more than a blurry line between market segments of the white middle class We may be more divided than ever but not because of our irreconcilable tastes in greens

to do too much research He was essentially recreating his own story Duany 35 is one of the socalled Lost Boys of Sudan the estimated 20000 young boys who fled their homes in 1987 during the countrys civil war At age 13 he became a child soldier before escaping to a refugee camp in Ethiopia and eventually settling in America This story plays out on the big screen in The Good Lie a fictional account of four Sudanese refugees who escape civil war for Kansas City where they adjust to life in America under the tutelage of employment counselor Reese Witherspoon While the story may be fictional the experiences are far too familiar to three of the actors who play the refugees In addition to Duany Emmanuel Jal and Kuoth Wiel are also survivors of the civil war both as refugees and as child soldiers We talked to Duany now a model and actor living in New York about making a film that touched so close to home How do your experiences relate to those in the movie  I think this is the most accurate movie ever made about my country I was born and raised in South Sudan and I was one of the kids that experienced the war first hand And I was one of the socalled Lost Boys who walked from South Sudan to Ethiopia to find safety in 1987 I was among them I made my way to the US in 1994 and I stayed here When you look at the movie it parallels my life story When you moved to the US what was hardest for you  Everything Everything was very hard My family and I grew up in a village where we looked after our cattle we drank milk and in the low season we moved from place to place to where the Nile is So coming to this part of the world was totally beyond my comprehension I was in a refugee camp with only South Sudanese people so I wasnt seeing the whole world The first time I saw the whole world in the same place was when my plane landed in New York The characters in the movie are sent to Kansas City Where did you end up when you came to the US  When I first came to the States I landed in Des Moines Iowa Later I joined other guys that I knew from the refugee camp in Sioux Falls and then I learned that I had family that had come to the States My uncle was a professor at Indiana University so I moved to Bloomington I finished high school there I think I learned the American way in Bloomington I am always claiming that I am a Hoosier Is it difficult to go back and see your friends and family living in refugee camps or poor conditions at home  There are difficult moments but when I am there I enjoy being back with the people Going back and forth for the past two years I find joy in seeing my people still smiling But right now we are in the middle of a civil war so nothing is pleasant Do you hope your family can join you in the United States I would not want them to join me here I would rather have all of us home like how I join them now South Sudan has been going through civil war for six decades and in the center of all those six decades is my family our life story our experiences and our home My family prefers to be there Maybe the young guys could come here for educational opportunity but other than that I prefer that they stay there and I just join them from time to time My mom prefers to be there where her grandchildren are These people live their lives through their families Even a year ago when I was doing the movie I brought her to Nairobi to spend time there and she had a rough time living in a big city such as Nairobi So I knew if I brought her to New York shed be miserable Is it difficult to relive your experiences for the movie  It is hard but something has lifted a peace has come I have become comfortable in telling my story It doesnt matter what stranger I meet if he is willing to talk to me I am always willing to open myself up That comes with healing with time As an actor youve often played a Sudanese refugee Is that a role you enjoy playing or would you rather play a wider variety of roles From the perspective of a South SudaneseAmerican its about opportunity To share this story was a perfect opportunity and a responsibility But I also like to learn and I would like a role where I had to learn a lot to do it a role that was very different from my life experiences You were a child soldier before you escaped to Ethiopia What should the world do to stop this practice  Stop war No more war I think that could help people Tons of countries across the world are exposing young people to guns to violence Even in this country we are seeing ridiculous events If we can find a way to avoid this destruction in all society not just African countries that would help our children come up in a world where they dont hear or see violence You returned to Sudan in 2011 for the vote that officially separated South Sudan from Sudan Many hoped that would end the civil war but the last six months has seen more fighting in the region What is your hope for the new country South Sudan is a very rich country in resources and culture The future is up to the people of South Sudan in how they govern themselves The movie is a bittersweet movie because its about the long struggle of my people who are at the beginning of another struggle When people see this movie and want to help refugees that are arriving in this country what would you recommend Its always education Education is always the key Thats something we always have in our minds all of us Every little girl and boy wants their education When we come to this country and education is provided for us that is the most important thing

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2014/10/03/353516382/outkast-and-atlanta-until-they-close-the-curtain?ft=3&f=,The rap duo Outkast is wrapping up a summerlong festival tour celebrating the groups 20year career Last weekend they played three nights in their hometown of Atlanta The shows had a bittersweet quality to them because though the musicians have called the tour a thank you to their fans many of those same fans are seeing it as a goodbye  their last chance to see one of the mostrespected and bestloved rap groups of all time together Outkast represents Atlanta 20 years ago when Big Boi and Andre 3000 were teenagers they and the circle of musicians in which they moved made a conscious decision to as Andre says put the city on their backs The best way to represent the places where you from is be yourself completely And just say Im from this place Andre and Big Boi say Im from this place often in their songs They also retain their drawls and situate their stories at the intersections of their neighborhoods And they were able to be themselves because in the early 90s Atlanta was not a factor in hiphop then dominated by the coasts Because we didnt grow up in New York because we didnt grow up on the West Coast we had time to soak both of those things in Andre says Because no one expected anything from the South except you know maybe fast bootyshake club music The door was wide open so we had a open palette And one thing I can say about Atlanta is you can do anything from Atlanta Atlanta is a typical Southern town at its core says Killer Mike an Atlanta rapper businessman and colleague of Outkast He describes their city this way We like our church on Sundays we like our wine and our sinning on Saturdays But theres this whole other culture of high art and avantgarde thinking here that meshes with that and Outkast better than any other group gave the world that They implanted the seed that these two things can coexist Im just a wild and crazy guy Thats Big Boi When I spoke to him four years ago I asked him what separates Outkast from their peers Everything is just so playful he said A lot of songs dont have any meaning to them Everything is telling a joke Are we gonna be comedians or are we gonna be MCs Are we gonna be lifechangers They decided to be lifechangers And the musical collective behind them called the Dungeon Family was as committed to pushing forward Mr DJ who was in fact Outkasts first DJ when they were all teenagers later helped make some of their biggest hits But his favorite is a song called Da Art of Storytellin Pt 2 That song symbolizes so much he says We were speaking as if the world was coming to an end and Big is on his way from Fayetteville hes noticing that the sky is getting dark and Mother Earth is tossing and turning from all the years of us mistreating her and doing her bad Outkast writes about subjects ambitious and down home Bettina Love grew up in upstate New York but she says tiny details in the songs made them familiar even to her outside the perimeter Theres some things that theyre saying that you have no clue of as a Northern kid but you know that experience she says So this fish and grits and all of these things that Ive heard my grandmother say Ive heard my mother say my father say You talk about the black migration  many of our parents came from the South migrated to the North so they still told these stories Some people dont have a taste for the slang and the specificity and the occasional lewd aside but Love who today lives and teaches in Atlanta says if you can hear whats happening in the music it becomes more difficult to accept the prevailing stereotypes of people who make rap Hiphop is the quintessential example of the genius of urban youth she says If you can start from a place of brilliance with kids you wont gun em down in the street So we have to start understanding how brilliant urban kids are Theyre misunderstood People have so many misconceptions about urban kids black kids in general And other peoples misconceptions can make you doubt yourself Outkast has been an antidote for that says DJ Drama creator of the Southern rap mixtapes Gangsta Grillz Outkast made a lot of people comfortable to be able to be in their own skin and be proud to be from Atlanta or proud to be from the South He says a whole generation grew up with Outkast and for them last weekends performances brought back memories of particularly Southern black experiences People were running into each other that probably havent seen each other in years Drama says At one point I remember Greg Street said something like Raise your hands or make some noise if youve been to Freaknik V103 DJ Greg Street introduced Outkast from stage on Sunday night He got that honor because hes been breaking Southern hiphop musicians on the radio for a couple decades now He doesnt think it was a goodbye show And he says even if it was Outkast has already given its fans plenty What theyve already done and the music theyve already put out its so big and it means so much to the culture to the people that  its like the Rolling Stones its like Frankie Beverly and Maze he says People will come out and watch these guys perform forever Street calls the relationship between the city and Outkast genuine and organic Killer Mike says Atlanta hiphop is eternally grateful and Drama remains hopeful that they enjoyed themselves enough this year to do it again For now Andre at least sounds content Were just happy to  as a crew  just to have something to say and to look at people from the city and they have pride in they chest and stick they chest out a little bit different now because Atlanta kinda means something Copyright 2014 NPR,20141004,guns

saying muchJust three months ago Yashua was in Tegucigalpa Honduras dodging gang members He says they would drive by his school guns visible threatening to kill him his younger brother  Yashuas whole familyWed hide all day Yashua says and that kept us from going to schoolAfter crossing the US border illegally he came to New Orleans and ultimately enrolled at Carver Prep a small charter school on the citys east sideIn just the past year the number of socalled unaccompanied minors from Central America  like Yashua  has nearly doubled in the US Many are now being held in detention centers But some 55000 have been released to relatives already living in the country and many have since made their way into the public schoolsCarver PrepIn the past Carver Prep in New Orleans saw just a handful of Englishlanguage learners ELL in a given year But this fall Principal Ben Davis says the school has enrolled 59  a fifth of its population And the vast majority of those kids are unaccompanied minorsThis surge Davis says has stretched his resources A kid coming from Honduras and from a school thats been ravaged by gang violence or in some cases kids who havent been in school since sixth grade they have very very unique challengesOf those challenges one was not new to Carver the trauma caused by violence Its students traditionally come from some of the citys most impoverished crimeridden neighborhoodsI was speaking with one of our students whose friend was shot right around the corner from his home Davis says So the rates of trauma across the board in our student population are really really highBut that life of violence is just the beginning of Davis challengesThe Carver Prep Safety NetEvery student at Carver is paired with an adviser The title doesnt do justice to the skill set required Each adviser is like a second parent giving students a place to turn for help and support while giving the school an early warning system for kids on the edgeCarver

saying muchJust three months ago Yashua was in Tegucigalpa Honduras dodging gang members He says they would drive by his school guns visible threatening to kill him his younger brother  Yashuas whole familyWed hide all day Yashua says and that kept us from going to schoolAfter crossing the US border illegally he came to New Orleans and ultimately enrolled at Carver Prep a small charter school on the citys east sideIn just the past year the number of socalled unaccompanied minors from Central America  like Yashua  has nearly doubled in the US Many are now being held in detention centers But some 55000 have been released to relatives already living in the country and many have since made their way into the public schoolsCarver PrepIn the past Carver Prep in New Orleans saw just a handful of Englishlanguage learners ELL in a given year But this fall Principal Ben Davis says the school has enrolled 59  a fifth of its population And the vast majority of those kids are unaccompanied minorsThis surge Davis says has stretched his resources A kid coming from Honduras and from a school thats been ravaged by gang violence or in some cases kids who havent been in school since sixth grade they have very very unique challengesOf those challenges one was not new to Carver the trauma caused by violence Its students traditionally come from some of the citys most impoverished crimeridden neighborhoodsI was speaking with one of our students whose friend was shot right around the corner from his home Davis says So the rates of trauma across the board in our student population are really really highBut that life of violence is just the beginning of Davis challengesThe Carver Prep Safety NetEvery student at Carver is paired with an adviser The title doesnt do justice to the skill set required Each adviser is like a second parent giving students a place to turn for help and support while giving the school an early warning system for kids on the edgeCarver

NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2014/10/02/353263694/foxs-gracepoint-an-american-remake-best-viewed-with-fresh-eyes?ft=3&f=,Even though some TV critics hate Foxs new crime drama Gracepoint you just might love it And that mostly depends on one thing Whether youve seen the British TV series its based on Broadchurch That original series became a critical sensation after it aired on BBC America as a taut involving story about the search for the murderer of an 11yearold boy in a small town along the English Channel While detectives search for the killer they also puncture the towns faade of civility and togetherness exposing all the dirty secrets that small communities can hide It was an affecting sharplywritten drama that only got more compelling as the series unfolded over eight episodes the epitome of British televisions habit of telling a great story and stopping when its done Except Fox then decided to do an American version with an almost entirely different cast and US setting leaving critics with one question Why BBC Americas viewing audience for Broadchurch represents really truly less than 1 percent of the American television viewing population says Gracepoint executive producer Carolyn Bernstein In other words this will seem like a new show to most of the people watching it on Fox Good thing Because in my own admittedly unscientific analysis folks who have seen Broadchurch will have greatly different reactions to Gracepoint than those who have not I watched the first two Gracepoint episodes with my teenage daughters who had watched and loved Broadchurch with me over an addictive weekend last year when BBC America sent critics all eight episodes in a batch Sitting in the same room we cracked jokes about how similar the first two episodes were to the original  including a mesmerizing tracking shot scene in which the father of the victim meets almost every major character from the show as he starts his day unaware of whats happened to his son showing the audience the smalltown faade about to be shattered by murder The thrill of learning a new story was gone replaced by a weary cynical analysis of just how much Fox was willing to clone an already amazing British show But how would this play for someone who hadnt seen Broadchurch I found a friend willing to sit through the same episodes and discovered Fox may have a point Unburdened with knowledge of a previous version my new viewing buddy enjoyed the show a lot more which allowed me to enjoy it more Aside from Americanizing British colloquialisms and small details  cars on the right side of the street and cops who carry guns regularly  theres a lot of commonality between the smalltown vibe created for Broadchurch and the tiny California tourist trap in Gracepoint David Tennant is the only actor to appear in both versions of the show his scruffy beard and antagonistic attitude fully intact regardless of which side of the pond hes working on Its a tribute to Tennants skill with accents that you barely notice his carefully neutral American tones in Gracepoint  a US accent that mostly stands out for its lack of affect as if his character Emmett Carver was somehow birthed in a place with a perfectly generic patois Hes not on completely new ground Mark Strong played an American version of a character he created for British TV on AMCs Low Winter Sun Tennant also will play his Broadchurch character Alec Hardy in a second season of that show If there is one casting change that played oddly for me it was the decision to cast Breaking Bad alum Anna Gunn as Ellie Miller the longtime Gracepoint PD detective forced to work with Tennants rude driven Det Carver after he gets the supervisory job she was promised In Broadchurch Olivia Colmans Ellie Miller is meant to seem like an average mom from the town who just happens to work as a police detective Her perspective as a product of the community that must be upended to find the killer is crucial and I had a tough time seeing the more glamorous Gunn as such an average character But that could be my own bias Ive often complained about US TVs high standards of attractiveness for its actors particularly regarding female characters Gunn does a great job as Miller so it is a bit unfair to ding her for a dynamic that ranges far beyond Gracepoints call sheet Nick Nolte is reliably crusty as Jack Reinhold the operator of a local youth program and a character played with similar flair by Harry Potter alum David Bradley in the British version Michael Pena adds a touch of diversity as the victims father Mark Solano though his race isnt an issue in the Gracepoint episodes I saw I have seen seven of the ten Gracepoint episodes Fox has planned and while there are a few notable diversions from the Broadchurch script they dont much change the overall narrative for those of us who have seen the source material But producers have suggested the killer in Gracepoint will be a different character lending new possibilities to the shows numerous suspects So if you really want to enjoy Gracepoint  especially for Tennant fans who will gobble up anything the former Doctor Who star appears in  consider watching it with a friend who doesnt yet know the story Because the best way to experience this reimagined story is through fresh eyes Gracepoint debuts at 9 pm EST Thursday Oct 2 on Fox
